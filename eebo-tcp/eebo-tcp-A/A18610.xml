         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Present, with all humility, to
Your most sacred hands, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that Cause which is &amp;
ought to be infinitely dearer to
you, then all the world: Not
doubting but upon this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I shall be censur'd for a double boldnesse; both
for undertaking so great a Work, so far beyond my
weak abilities, and againe, for presenting it to such a
Parton, whose judgement I ought to fear more
then any Adversary. But for the first, it is a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to my selfe, and may be to others, that I was
not drawn to it out of any vain opinion of my selfe,
(whose personall defects are the only thing which
I presume to know,) but undertook it in obedience
to Him, who said, <hi>Tu conversus confirma fratres,</hi> not
<pb facs="tcp:7615:3"/>
to S. <hi>Peter</hi> only but to all men: being encouraged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to it by the goodnesse of the Cause, which is able
to make a weak man strong. To the belief hereof
I was not led partially or by chance, as many are, by
the preiudice and prepossession of their Country,
Education, and such like inducements, which if they
lead to truth in one place, perhaps lead to error in a
hundred; but having with the greatest equality and
indifferency, made enquiry and search into the
grounds on both Sides, I was willing to impart to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that satisfaction which was given to my selfe.
For my inscribing to it your Maiesties sacred
Name, I should labour much in my excuse of it
from high presumption, had it not some appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Title to your Maiesties Patronage &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
as being a Defence of that Book, which by
special order from your Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> was written some years
since, chiefly for the generall good, but peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
not without some aime at the recovery of One
of your meanest Subiects from a dangerous deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; so due unto your Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi>, as the fruit of your
own High humility and most Royall Charity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it is in a manner nothing else, but a pursuance
of, and a superstruction upon that blessed Doctrine,
where With I have adorn'd &amp; arm'd the Frontispice
of my Book, which was so earnestly recommended
by your Royall Father of happy memory, to all the
lovers of Truth &amp; Peace, that is to all that were like
himselfe, as the only hopefull meanes of healing the
breaches of Christendome, whereof the Enemy of
soules makes such pestilent advantage. The lustre
of this blessed Doctrine I have here endeavoured to
<pb facs="tcp:7615:3"/>
uncloud and unveile, and to free it from those mists
and fumes which have been rais'd to obscure it, by
that Order, which envenomes even poison it selfe,
and makes the Roman Religion much more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
and trubulent then otherwise it would be:
whose very Rule and Doctrine, obliges them to
make all men, as much as lies in them, subjects unto
Kings, and servants unto Christ, no farther then it
shall please the Pope. So that whether Your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
be considered, either as a Pious Sonne towards
your Royall Father K. IAMES, or as a tender hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
&amp; compassionate Sonne towards your distressed
Mother, the Catholique Church, or as a King of
your Subiects, or as a Servant unto Christ, this
worke, (to which I can give no other commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that it was intended to doe you service in
all these capacities,) may pretend not unreasonably
to your Gracious acceptance. Lastly being a defence
of that whole Church and Religion you professe,
it could not be so proper to any Patron as to the
great Defendor of it; which stile your Maiesty hath
ever so exactly made good, both in securing it from
all dangers, and in vindicating it (by the well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and rectifying this Church) from all the foule
as persions both of Domestick &amp; Forraine enemies,
of which they can have no ground, but their own
malice and want of Charity. But it is an argument
of a despairing &amp; lost cause to support it selfe with
these impetuous out-cries and clamors, the faint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges
of those that want better arguments; like that
Stoick in <hi>Lucian</hi> that cried <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>! <hi>O damn'd vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,</hi>
when he could say nothing else. Neither is it
<pb facs="tcp:7615:4"/>
credible the wiser sort of them should believe this
their own horrid assertion, That a God of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
should damne to eternall torments, those that
love him and love truth, for errors which they fall
into through humane frailty! But this they must
say, otherwise their only great argument from their
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning us, &amp; our not being so peremptory in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, because we hope unaffected Ignorance
may excuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would be lost: &amp; therefore they are
engag'd to act on this Tragicall part, only to fright
the simple and ignorant, as we doe litle children by
telling them that bites, which we would not have
them meddle with. And truely that herein they doe
but act a part, and know themselves to doe so, and
deale with us here as they doe with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom they accurse and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
for fashion sake on <hi>Maundy-Thursday,</hi>
for detaining part of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
him without satisfaction on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi>
methinkes their faltring and inconstancy herein,
makes it very apparent. For though for the most
part, they speak nothing but thunder and lightning
to us, &amp; damne us all without mercy or exception,
yet sometimes to serve other purposes, they can be
content to speak to us in a milder strain, &amp; tell us, as
my adversary does, more then once, <hi>That they allow
Protestants as much Charity as Protestants allow
them.</hi> Neither is this the only contradiction which
I have discover'd in this uncharitable Work; but
have shewed that by forgetting himselfe, &amp; retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most of the principall grounds he builds upon,
he hath sav'd me the labour of a confutation: which
<pb facs="tcp:7615:4"/>
yet I have not in any place found any such labor or
difficulty, but that it was undertakable by a man of
very mean, that is, of my abilities. And the reason
is, because it is Truth I plead for; which is so strong
an argument for it selfe, that it needs only light to
discover it: whereas it concernes Falshood &amp; Error
to use disguises and shadowings and all the fetches
of Art and Sophistry, &amp; therefore it stands in need
of abler men, to give that a colour at least, which
hath no reall body to subsist by. If my endeavours
in this kind may contribute any thing to this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and the making plain that Truth (which my
Charity perswades mee the most part of them
disaffect only, because it has not been well represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them,) I have the fruit of my labour, and my
wish; who desire to live to no other end, then to doe
service to Gods Church and Your most Sacred
Maiesty, in the quality of</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the first newes of the publication of your Book, I
used all diligence with speed to procure it; and came
with such a mind to the reading of it, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> before
he was a setled Catholique, brought to his conference
with <hi>Faustus</hi> the Manichee. For as he though that if
any thing more then ordinary might be said in defence of the Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctrine, <hi>Faustus</hi> was the man from whom it was to be expected:
So my perswasion concerning you was,<hi>—Si Pergama dextrâ defendi
possunt, certè has defensa videbo.</hi> For I conceiv'd that among the
Champions of the Roman Church, the English in reason must be the
best, or equall to the best, as being by most expert Masters train'd up
purposely for this warre, and perpetually practised in it. Among the
English, I saw the Iesuites would yeeld the first place to none; and men
so wise in their generation as the Iesuits were, if they had any <hi>Achilles</hi>
among them, I presum'd, would make choice of him for this service.
And besides, I had good assurance that in the framing of this building,
though you were the only Architect, yet you wanted not the assistance
of many diligent hands to bring you in choice materialls towards it;
nor of many carefull and watchfull eyes to correct the errors of your
worke, if any should chance to escape you. Great reason therefore had
I to expect great matters from you, and that your Book should have in
it the Spirit and Elixir of all that can be said in defence of your
Church and Doctrine; and to assure my selfe, that if my resolution
not to believe it, were not built upon the rock of evident grounds and
reasons, but only upon some sandy and deceitfull appearances, now
the wind and storme &amp; floods were coming which would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overthrow it.</p>
            <p>2 Neither truly were you more willing to effect such an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in me then I was to have it effected. For my desire is to goe the
right way to <hi>eternall happinesse.</hi> But whether this way lye on the right
<pb facs="tcp:7615:6"/>
hand or the left, or streight forwards; whether it be by following a
living Guide, or by seeking my direction in a book, or by hearkening
to the secret whisper of some privat Spirit, to me it is indifferent. And
he that is otherwise affected, and has not a travellers indifference, which
<hi>Epictetus</hi> requires in all that would find the truth, but much desires in
respect of his ease, or pleasure, or profit, or advancement, or satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of friends, or any human consideration, that one way should be
true rather then another; it is oddes but he will take his desire that it
should be so, for an assurance that it is so. But I for my part, unlese I
deceive my selfe, was and still am so affected as I have made professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
not willing I confesse to take any thing upon trust, and to believe
it without asking my selfe why; no, nor able to command my selfe
(were I never so willing) to follow, like a sheepe, every sheepheard
that should take upon him to guide me; or every flock that should
chance to goe before me: but most apt and most willing to be led by
reason to any way, or from it; and alwaies submitting all other reasons
to this one, God hath said so, therefore it is true. Nor yet was I so
unreasonable as to expect Mathematicall demonstrations from you
in matters plainly incapable of them, such as are to be believed, and
if we speak properly, cannot be known; such therefore I expected not.
For as he is an unreasonable Master, who requires a stronger assent to
his conclusions then his arguments deserve; so I conceive him a
froward and undisciplin'd Scholar, who desires stronger arguments
for a conclusion then the matter will bear. But had you represented
to my understanding such reasons of your Doctrine, as being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in an even ballance, held by an even hand, with those on the other
side, would have turn'd the scale, and have made your Religion more
credible then the contrary; certainly I should have despised the shame
of one more alteration, and with both mine armes and all my heart
most readily have embraced it. Such was my expectation from you,
and such my preparation, which I brought with me to the reading of
your book. Would you know now what the event was, what effect
was wrought in me, by the perusall and consideration of it? To deal
truly and ingenuously with you, I fell somewhat in my good opinion
both of your sufficiency &amp; syncerity: but was exceedingly confirm'd
in my ill opinion of the cause maintained by you. I found every where
snares that might entrap, and colours that might deceive the simple;
but nothing that might perswade, and very little that might move an
understanding man, and one that can discerne between discourse and
sophistry. In short, I was verily perswaded that I plainly saw and
could make it appear, to all dis-passionate and unprejudicate Iudges,

               </gap> my selfe to be perswaded by them, that it would not be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unproper for me, nor un-acceptable to God, nor peradventure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unserviceable to his Church, nor justly offensive to you (if
you indeed were a lover of Truth, and not a maintainer of a Faction,)
if setting aside the second Part, which was in a manner wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb facs="tcp:7615:6"/>
in particular disputes, repetitions and references, and in
wranglings with D. <hi>Potter</hi> about the sense of some super-numerary
quotations, and whereon the main question no way depends, I would
make a faire and ingenuous Answer to the first, wherein the substance
of the present Controversy is confessedly contained; and which, if it
were clearly answered, no man would desire any other answer to the
second. This therefore I undertook with a full resolution to be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
to your errors, but a friend and servant to your person: and so
much the more a friend to your person, by how much the severer and
more rigid adversary I was to your errors.</p>
            <p>4 In this work my conscience beares me witnesse that I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your advice <hi>proceeded alwayes with this consideration, that
I am to give a most strict account of every line, and word that passeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my pen;</hi> and therefore have been precisely carefull for <hi>the matter</hi> of
my book to defend truth only, and only by Truth. And then scrupulou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
fearefull of scandalizing you or any man with <hi>the manner</hi> of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it. From this rule sure I am, I have not willingly swerved in either
part of it, and that I might not doe it ignorantly, I have not only my
self examined mine owne work, perhaps with more severity then I
have done yours, (as conceiving it a base and unchristian thing to goe
about to satisfie others with what I my self am not fully satisfied;)
But have also made it passe the fiery tryall of the exact censures of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
understanding judges, alwaies heartily wishing that you your selfe
had been of the <hi>Quorum.</hi> But they who did undergoe this burthen as
they wanted not sufficiencie to discover any heterodoxe doctrine, so I
am sure they have been very carefull to let nothing flip dissonant from
truth or from the authorized doctrine of the Church of England,
and therefore whatsoever causelesse and groundlesse jealousy, any
man may entertain concerning my Person, yet my book, I presume,
in reason and common equity should be free from them: wherein I
hope that little or nothing hath escap'd so many eyes, which being
weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary will be found too light. And
in this hope I am much confirm'd, by your strange carriage of your
selfe in this whole businesse. For though by some crooked and sinister
arts, you have got my Answer into your hands, now a yeare since and
upwards, as <hi>I</hi> have been assured by some that know it, and those of
your own party; though you could not want every day faire oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunityes
of sending to me, and acquainting me with any exceptions,
which, you conceived, might be justly taken to it, or any part of it,
then which nothing could have been more welcome to me, yet hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you have not been pleased to acquaint mee with any one. Nay
more, though you have been at sundry times, and by severall waies
entreated and sollicited, nay press'd and importun'd by me, to joyne
with me in a private discussion of the Controversy between us, before
the publication of my Answer, (because I was extremely unwilling to
publish any thing which had not passed all manner of tryals,) as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
not that I, or my Side, but that truth might overcome on which
Side soever it was) though <hi>I</hi> have prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sted to you, and set it under my
<pb facs="tcp:7615:7"/>
hand, (which protestation by Gods help I would have made good) if
you, or any other would undertake your cause, would give me a faire
meeting, and choose out of your whole Book any one argument,
wherof you were most confident, and by which you would be content
the rest should be judged of, and make it appeare that I had not, or
could not answer it, that I would desist from the work which <hi>I</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
and answer none at all; though by all the Arts which possibly
I could devise, I have provoked you to such a tryall, in particular by
assuring you that if you refus'd it, the world should be inform'd of
your tergiversation, notwithstanding all this you have perpetually, and
obstinately declined it; which to my understanding is a very evident
signe that there is not any truth in your cause, nor (which is impossible
there should bee strength in your arguments, especially considering
what our Saviour hath told us, <hi>every one that doth evill hateth the light,
neither commeth to the light, least his deeds should be reproved; but he
that doth truth commeth to the light that his deeds may be made manifest
that they are wrought in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 In the meane while though you despaired of compassing
your desire this honest way, yet you have not omitted to tempt
me by base and unworthy considerations to desert the cause which I
had undertaken; letting me understand from you, by an acquaintance
common to us both, how that <hi>in case my work should come to light, my
inconstancy in religion</hi> (so you miscall my constancy in following that
way to heaven which for the present seemes to me the most probable,)
<hi>should bee to my great shame painted to the life;</hi> that <hi>my owne writings
should be produc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

owne motives against Protestantisme, and that such things should be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to the world touching my beliefe,</hi> (for my painter I must expect
should have great skill in perspective) <hi>of the doctrine of the Trinity, the
Deity of our Saviour, and all supernaturall verities, as should endanger
all my benefices present or future:</hi> that <hi>this warning was given me, not out
of feare of what I could say (for that Catholiques if they might wish any ill
would beg the Publication of my booke, for respects obvious enough,) but
out of a meer charitable desire of my good and reputation:</hi> and <hi>that all this
was said upon a supposition that I was answering, or had a minde to answer
Charity maintained; If not, no harme was done.</hi> To which co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>us
premonition as I remember, I desired the Gentleman, who dealt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us to return this answer, or to this effect, that I believed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity, the Deity of our Saviour, and all other super-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
verities revealed in Scripture, as truly and as heartily as your self,
or any man: and therefore herein your <hi>Charity</hi> was very much <hi>mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;</hi>
but much more and more uncharitably in conceiving me a man
that was to be wrought upon with these <hi>Terribiles visu formae,</hi> those
carnall and base fears which you presented to me, which were very
proper motives for the Divell and his instruments to tempt poor spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
men out of the way of conscience and honesty, but very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous,
either for Teachers of truth to make use of, or for Lovers of
truth (in which Company I had been long agoe matriculated) to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:7615:7"/>
to with any regard. But if you were indeed desirous that I should
not answer <hi>Charity maintained,</hi> one way there was, and but one,
whereby you might obtain your desire; and that was by letting mee
know when and where I might attend you, and by a fair conference, to
be written down on both sides, convincing mine understanding (who
was resolv'd not to be a <hi>Recusant</hi> if I were <hi>convicted,</hi>) that any one
part of it, any one argument in it, which was of moment and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and whereon the cause depends, was indeed unanswerable.
This was the effect of my answer which I am well assur'd was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
but reply from you I received none but this, that you would
have no conference with me but in Print; and soone after finding me of
proof against all these batteries, and thereby (I fear) very much en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>6 For certainly those indigne contumelies, that masse of porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and execrable calumnies, wherewith in your Pamphlet of <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to N. N.</hi> you have loaded not only my person in particular, but
all the learned and moderate Divines of the Church of England, and
all Protestants in generall, nay all wise men of all Religions but your
own, could not proceed from any other fountain.</p>
            <p>7 To begin with the last, you stick not in the beginning of your
first Chapter, to fasten the imputation <hi>of Atheisme &amp; irreligion upon all
wise and gallant men, that are not of your own Religion.</hi> In which uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and unchristian judgment, void of all colour or shadow of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
I know yet by experience that very many of the <hi>Bigots</hi> of
your Faction are partakers with you. God forbid I should think the
like of you! Yet if I should say, that in your Religion there want not
some temptations unto, and some Principles of irreligion and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,
I am sure I could make my assertion much more probable then
you have done, or can make this horrible imputation.</p>
            <p>8 For to passe by <hi>first,</hi> that which experience justifies, that where
and when your Religion hath most absolutely commanded, there and
then Atheisme hath most abounded; To say nothing <hi>Secondly,</hi> of your
notorious and confessed forging of so many false miracles, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
lying Legends, which is not unlikely to make suspitious men to
question the truth of all; Nor to object to you <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the abundance
of your weak and silly Ceremonies &amp; ridiculous observances in your
Religion, which in all probability cannot but beget secret contempt
and scorne of it in wise and considering men, and consequently Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme
and impiety, if they have this perswasion setled in them (which is
too rise among you, and which you account a peece of <hi>Wisdome and
Gallantry</hi>) that if they be not of your Religion, they were as good be of
none at all; Nor to trouble you <hi>Fourthly</hi> with this, that a great part of
your Doctrine, especially in the points contested, makes apparently for
the temporall ends of the teachers of it; which yet I feare is a great
scandall to many <hi>Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x Esprits</hi> among you: Onely I should desire you
to consider attentively when you conclude so often from the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:7615:8"/>
of Protestants, that they have no certainty of any part of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
no not of those points wherein they agree, whether you doe not
that which so magisterially you direct me not to doe, that is, proceed <hi>a
destructive way, and object arguments against your adversaries, which
tend to the overthrow of all Religion?</hi> And whether as you argue thus,
<hi>Protestants differ in many things, therefore they have no certainty of any
thing:</hi> So an Atheist or a Sceptique may not conclude as well, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and the Professors of all Religions differ in many things, therefore
they have no certainty of any thing? Again I should desire you to tell
me ingenuously, whether it be not too probable that your portentous
Doctrine of Transubstantiation joyn'd with your fore-mention'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of, <hi>no Papists no Christians,</hi> hath brought a great many others
as well as himselfe to <hi>Averroes</hi> his resolution, <hi>Quandoquide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christiani
adorant quod comedunt, sit anima mea cum Philosophis?</hi> Whether your
requiring men upon only probable and <hi>Prudentiall motives,</hi> to yield a
<hi>most certaine assent</hi> unto things in humane reason impossible, and telling
them, as you doe too often, that they were as good not believe at all,
as believe with any lower degree of faith, be not a likely way to make
considering men scorne your Religion, (and consequently all, if they
know no other) as requiring things contradictory, and impossible to
be performed? Lastly, whether your pretence that there is no good
ground to believe Scripture, but your Churches infallibility, joyn'd
with your pretending no ground for this but some texts of Scripture,
be not a faire way to make them that understand themselves, believe
neither Church nor Scripture?</p>
            <p>9 <hi>Your calumnies against Protestants in generall are set downe
in these words, Chap.</hi> 2. §. 2. The very doctrine of Protestants if it bee
followed closely, and with coherence to it selfe, must of necessity induce
<hi>Socinianisme.</hi> This I say confidently, and evidently prove, by instancing
in one errror, which may well be tearmed the Capitall, and mother Heresy,
from which all other must follow at ease; I mean, their heresy in affirming,
that the perpetuall visible Church of Christ, descended by a never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
succession from our Saviour, to this day, is not infallible in all
that it proposeth to be believed, as revealed truths.</p>
            <p>For if the <hi>infallibility</hi> of such a publique <hi>Authority</hi> be once impeached;
what remaines, but that every man is given over to his own wit, and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course?</hi>
And talke not here, of holy Scripture. For if the true Church
may erre, in defining what Scriptures be Canonicall; or in delivering the
sense and meaning thereof, we are still devolved, either upon the <hi>private
spirit</hi> (a foolery now explo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed out of England, which finally leaving every
man to his own conceits, ends in <hi>Socinianisme)</hi> or else upon naturall wit,
and judgement. for examining and determining, what Scriptures contain
true or false doctrine, and in that respect, ought to be received, or reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
And indeed, take away the authority of Gods Church, no man can
be assured, that any one Book, or parcell of Scripture, was written by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
inspiration; or that all the contents, are infallibly true; which are the
direct errors of <hi>Socinians.</hi> If it were but for thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> reason alone, no man,
who regards the eternall salvation of his soule, would live or dye in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7615:8"/>
from which, so vast absurdities as these of the <hi>Socinians</hi> must
inevitably follow. And it ought to be an unspeakable comfort to all us
Catholiques, while we consider, that none can deny the infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Church, but joyntly he must be left to his own wit and waies; and
must abandon all <hi>infused faith,</hi> and true Religion, if he doe but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
himselfe aright.</p>
            <p>In all which discourse, the only true word you speak is, <hi>This I say
confidently:</hi> As for <hi>proving evidently,</hi> that I believe you reserved
for some other opportunity: for the present I am sure you have been
very sparing of it.</p>
            <p>10 You say indeed confidently enough, that <hi>the denyall of the
Churches infallibility is the Mother Heresy, from which all other must
follow at ease:</hi> Which is so farre from being a necessary truth, as you
make it, that it is indeed a manifest falshood. Neither is it possible
for the wit of man by any good, or so much as probable consequence,
from the deniall of the Churches Infallibility to deduce any one of the
ancient Heresies, or any one error of the Socinians, which are the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
here entreated of. For who would not laugh at him that should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
thus; Neither the Church of Rome, nor any other Church is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>go,</hi> The doctrine of <hi>Arrius, Pelagius, Eutyches, Nestorius, Photinus,
Manichaeus</hi> was true Doctrine? On the other side, it may be truly sayed
and justified by very good and effectuall reason, that he that affirms
with you, the Popes infallibility, puts himself into his hands and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to be led by him at his ease and pleasure into all Heresy, and even to
Hell it self, and cannot with reason say (so long as he is constant to his
grounds) <hi>Domine cur ita facis?</hi> but must believe <hi>white to be black and
black to be white, vertue to be vice and vice to be vertue;</hi> nay (which is
a horrible but a most certain truth) Christ to be Antichrist and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
to be Christ, if it be possible for the Pope to say so: Which I say
and will maintain, howsoever you daube and disguise it, is indeed to
make men Apostate from Christ to his pretended Vicar, but reall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
For that name and no better (if we may speak truth without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence)
I presume he deserves, who under pretence of interpreting the
law of Christ, (which Authority without any word of expresse war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
he hath taken upon himself,) doth in many parts evacuate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
it: So dethroning Christ from his dominion over mens conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and in stead of Christ, setting up himself. In as much as he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that his interpretations of any law should be obeyed as true and
genuine, seeme they to mens understandings never so dissonant and
discordant from it, (as the Bishop of Rome does) requires indeed that
<hi>his interpretations</hi> should be the <hi>Laws;</hi> and he that is firmly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in mind to believe and receive all such interpretations without
judging of them, and though to his private judgment they seem unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
is indeed congruously disposed to hold adultery a veniall sin,
and fornication no sinne, whensoever the Pope and his adherents shall
so declare. And whatsoever he may plead, yet either wittingly or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
he makes the Law and the Lawmaker both stales, and obeyes
only the interpreter. As if I should pretend that I should submit to the
<pb facs="tcp:7615:9"/>
Laws of the King of England, but should indeed resolve to obey them
in that sence which the King of France should put upon them what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it were; I presume every understanding man would say that I did
indeed obey the King of France and not the King of England. If I
should pretend to believe the Bible, but that I would understand it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the sence which the chiefe Mufty should put upon it, who
would not say that I were a Christian in pretence only, but indeed a
Mahumetan?</p>
            <p>11 Nor will it be to purpose for you to pretend that the precepts
of Christ are so plain that it cannot be feared, that any Pope should ever
goe about to dissolve them and pretend to be a Christian: For, not to
say that you now pretend the contrary, (to wit), <hi>that the law of Christ

so, have made a fair way for any fowle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> interpretation of any part of it:
certainly that which the Church of Rome hath already done in this
kind is an evident argument, that (if she once had this power unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
and made expedite and ready for use, by being contracted to the
Pope) she may doe what she pleaseth with it. Who that had liv'd
in the Primitive Church, would not have thought it as utterly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that ever they should have brought in the worship of Images and
picturing of God, as now it is that they should legitimate fornication?
Why may we not think they may in time take away the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
from the Laity, as well as they have taken away half of it?
Why may we not think that any Text and any sence may not be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
aswell as the whole 14. <hi>Ch.</hi> of the <hi>Ep.</hi> of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinth.</hi>
is reconcil'd to the Latine service? How is it possible any thing should
be plainer forbidden, then the <hi>worship of Angels,</hi> in the <hi>Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians?</hi>
then <hi>the teaching for Doctrines mens commands</hi> in the Gospell
of <hi>S. Mark?</hi> And therefore seeing we see these things done which
hardly any man would have believ'd, that had not seen them, why
should we not fear that this unlimited power may not be us'd hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with as litle moderation? Seeing devices have been invented how
men may worship images without Idolatry, and kill innocent men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of heresie without murder, who knowes not that some
tricks may not be hereafter deuis'd, by which lying with other mens
wives shall be no Adultery, taking away other mens goods no theft?
I conclude therefore, that if <hi>Solomon</hi> himself were here, and were to
determine the difference, which is more likely to be mother of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,
The <hi>deniall</hi> of the <hi>Churche's</hi> or the <hi>affirming</hi> of the <hi>Popes infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
that he would certainly say <hi>this is the mother, give her the child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12 You say again confidently, that <hi>if this infallibility be once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached,
every man is given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver to his own wit and discourse:</hi> which,
if you mean, <hi>discourse,</hi> not guiding it selfe by Scripture, but only by
principles of nature, or perhaps by prejudices and popular errors, and
drawing consequences not by rule but chance, is by no means true; if
you mean by discourse, right reason, grounded on Divine revelation
and common notions, written by God in the hearts of all men, and
<pb facs="tcp:7615:9"/>
deducing, according to the never failing rules of Logick, consequent
deductions from them, if this be it, which you mean by <hi>discourse,</hi> it is
very meet &amp; reasonable &amp; necessary that men, as in all their actions,
so especially in that of greatest importance, the choice of their way to
happinesse, should be left unto it: and he that followes this in all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
and actions, and does not only seeme to doe so, followes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
God; whereas he that followeth a Company of men, may
oftimes follow a company of beasts. And in saying this, I say no more
then S. <hi>Iohn</hi> to all Christians in these words, <hi>Dearly beloved believe
not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they be of God, or no:</hi> and
the rule he gives them to make this tryall by, is to consider whether
they <hi>confesse Iesus to be the Christ;</hi> that is, the Guide of their Faith, and
Lord of their actions; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whether they acknowledge the Pope to be
his Vicar: I say no more then S. <hi>Paul</hi> in exhorting all Christians, <hi>to try
all things and to hold fast that which is good;</hi> then S. <hi>Peter</hi> in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding
all Christians, <hi>to be ready to give a reason of the hope that is in them:</hi>
then <hi>our Saviour</hi> himselfe in forewarning all his followers, that <hi>if
they blindly followed blind guides, both leaders and followers should fall
into the ditch;</hi> and again in saying even to the people, <hi>Yea &amp; why of your
selves iudge ye not what is right?</hi> And though by passion, or precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or preiudice; by want of reason, or not using that they have, men
may be and are oftentimes led into error and mischiefe; yet that they
cannot be misguided by discourse truly so called, such as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
you your selfe have given them security. For what is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
but drawing conclusions out of premises by good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?
Now the principles which we have setled, to wit, the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> are on all sides agreed to be infallibly true. And you have
told us in the fourth chap. of this Pamphlet, that <hi>from truth no man
can by good consequence inferre falshood;</hi> Therefore by discourse no
man can possibly be led to error: but if he erre in his conclusions, he
must of necessity either erre in his principles, (which here cannot have
place,) or commit some error in his discourse; that is indeed, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
but seeme to doe so.</p>
            <p>13 You say thirdly with sufficient confidence, that <hi>if the true
Church may erre in defining what Scriptures be Canonicall, or in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the sense thereof, then we must follow either the privat Spirit, or
else naturall wit and iudgement, and by them examine what Scriptures
containe true or false doctrine, and in that respect ought to be received or
reiected:</hi> All which is apparently untrue, neither can any proofe of it
be pretended. For though the present Church may possibly erre in her
judgement touching this matter, yet have we other directions in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the privat spirit, and the examination of the contents, (which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way may conclude the negative very strongly, to wit, that such or
such a book cannot come from God, because it containes irreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
contradictions, but the affirmative it cannot conclude, because the
contents of a book may be all true, and yet the book not written by
divine inspiration:) other direction therefore I say we have, besides ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these three, &amp; that is, the testimony of the Primitive Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7615:10"/>
14 You say Fourthly with convenient boldnesse, That <hi>this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Authority of your Church being denied, no man can be assur'd, that
any parcell of Scripture was written by Divine inspiration:</hi> Which is an
untruth, for which no proofe is pretended, and besides, void of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and full of impiety. The first, because the experience of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Christians is against it, who are sufficiently assur'd, that the
Scripture is divinely inspir'd, and yet deny the infallible authority of
your Church or any other. The second, because if<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I cannot have
ground to be assur'd of the divine authority of Scripture, unlesse I first
believe your Church infallible, then I can have no ground at all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it: because there is no ground, nor can any be pretended why I
should believe your Church <hi>infallible,</hi> unlesse I first beleeve the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
divine.</p>
            <p>15 Fiftly and lastly, You say with confidence in abundance, that
<hi>none can deny the infallible authority of your Church, but he must aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
all infus'd faith and true religion, if he doe but understand him selfe:</hi>
Which is to say, agreeable to what you had said before, and what out
of the abundance of your hearts you speak very often, <hi>That all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
besides you, are open Fooles, or conceal'd Atheists.</hi> All this you
say with notable confidence (as the manner of Sophisters is, to place
their confidence of prevailing in their confident manner of speaking,)
but then for the evidence you promised to maintaine this confidence,
that is quite vanished and become invisible.</p>
            <p>16 Had I a mind to recriminate now, and to charge Papists (as
you doe Protestants) that they lead men to Socinianisme, I could cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
make a much fairer shew of evidence then you have done. For
I would not tell you, you deny the infallibility of the Church of
England, <hi>ergo</hi> you lead to Socinianisme, which yet is altogether as
good an Argument as this; Protestants deny the infallibility of the
Roman Church, <hi>ergo</hi> they induce Socinianisme: Nor would I resume
my former Argument, and urge you, that by holding the Popes infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
you submit your selfe to that capitall and Mother Heresy, by
advantage whereof, he may lead you at ease to believe <hi>vertue vice,</hi> and
<hi>vice vertue,</hi> to believe Antichristianity Christianisme, and Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Antichristian; he may lead you to Socinianisme, to Turcisme,
nay to the Divell himselfe if he have a mind to it: But I would shew
you that divers waies the Doctors of your Church doe the principall
and proper work of the Socinians for the, undermining the Doctrine
of the Trinity, by denying it to be supported by those pillars of the
Faith, which alone are fit and able to support it, I mean Scripture, and
the Consent of the ancient Doctors.</p>
            <p>17 For <hi>Scripture,</hi> your men deny very plainly and frequently, that
this Doctrine can be proved by it. See if you please this plainly taught,
and urged very earnestly by Cardinall <hi>Hosius, De Author. Sac. Scrip.
l. 3. p.</hi> 53. By <hi>Gordonius Huntlaeus, Contr. Tom. 1. Controv. 1. De verbo
Dei C.</hi> 19. by <hi>Gretserus</hi> and <hi>Tanerus, in Colloquio Ratesbon:</hi> And also by
<hi>Vega, Possevin, Wiekus,</hi> and <hi>Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18 And then for <hi>the Consent of the Ancients,</hi> that that also deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb facs="tcp:7615:10"/>
it not, by whom are we taught but by Papists only? Who is it
that makes known to all the world, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> that great searcher
and devourer of the Christian libraries <hi>was an Arrian?</hi> Is it not your
great <hi>Achilles, Cardinall Perron,</hi> in his 3. Book 2. Chap. of his Reply to
<hi>K. Iames?</hi> Who is it that informs us that <hi>Origen</hi> (who never was questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
for any error in this matter, in or neere his time) <hi>denied the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Sonne and the Holy Ghost?</hi> Is it not the same great Cardinall,
in his Book <hi>of the Eucharist</hi> against <hi>M. du Plessis. l. 2. c.</hi> 7? Who is it
that pretends that <hi>Irenaeus hath said those things, which he that should
now hold, would be esteem'd an Arrian?</hi> Is it not the same <hi>Perron</hi> in his
Reply to K. <hi>Iames,</hi> in the fift Chap. of his fourth observation? And
does he not in the same place peach <hi>Tertullian</hi> also, &amp; in a manner give
him away to the Arrians? And pronounce generally of the <hi>Fathers
before the Councell of Nice,</hi> That <hi>the Arrians would gladly be tryed by
them?</hi> And are not your fellow Iesuits also, even the prime men of
your Order, prevaricators in this point as well as others? Doth not
your friend M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> or M. <hi>Flued</hi> in his book of the Nine Questions
proposed to him by K. <hi>Iames</hi> speak dangerously to the same purpose,
in his discourse <hi>of the Resolution of Faith,</hi> towards the end? Giving us to
understand, <hi>That the new Reformed Arrians bring very many testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the ancient Fathers to prove that in this Point they did contradict
themselves and were contrary one to another: which places whosoever shall
read will cleerely see, that to common people they are unanswerable, yea
that common people are not capable of the answers that learned men yeeld
unto such obscure passages.</hi> And hath not your great Antiquary <hi>Petavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
in his Notes upon <hi>Epiphanius in Haer.</hi> 69. been very liberall to the
Adversaries of the Doctrine of the Trinity, and in a manner given
them for Patrons and Advocates, first <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Fathers before the Councell of Nice, whose speeches he
saies, touching this point, <hi>cum Orthodoxae fidei regula minime consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiunt?</hi>
Hereunto I might adde that the Dominicans and Iesuits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them in another matter of great importance, viz. <hi>Gods Presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of future contingents,</hi> give the Socinians the premises, out of
which their conclusion doth unavoidably follow. For the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ans
maintain on the one Side, that <hi>God can foresee nothing but what he
Decrees:</hi> The Iesuits on the other Side, that <hi>he doth not Decree all
things:</hi> And from hence the Socinians conclude (as it is obvious for
them to doe) that <hi>he doth not foresee all things.</hi> Lastly, I might adjoyn
this, that you agree with one consent, and settle for a rule unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
that no part of Religion can be repugnant to reason, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you in particular subscribe unawares in saying, <hi>From truth no man
can by good consequence inferre Falshood,</hi> which is to say in effect, that
Reason can never lead any man to error: And after you have done so,
you proclaime to all the world (as you in this Pamphlet doe very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,)
that <hi>if men follow their Reason and discourse,</hi> they will (if they
understand themselves) be led to Socinianisme. And thus you see
with what probable matter I might furnish out and justify my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
if I should charge you with leading men to Socinianisme! Yet
<pb facs="tcp:7615:11"/>
I doe not conceive that I have ground enough for this odious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And much lesse should you have charg'd Protestants with it,
whom you confesse to abhorre and detest it: and who fight against it
not with the broken reeds, and out of the paper fortresses of an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Infallibility, which were only to make sport for their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
but with the <hi>sword of the Spirit, the Word of God:</hi> of which we may
say most truly, what <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Goliah's</hi> sword, offered him by <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,
non est sicut iste, There is none comparable to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19 Thus Protestants in generall, I hope, are sufficiently vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from your calumny: I proceed now to doe the same service for the
Divines of England; whom you question first in point of learning
and sufficiency, and then in point of conscience and honesty, as preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricating
in the Religion which they professe, and inclining to Popery.
Their Learning (you say) consists only in <hi>some superficiall talent of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
languages, and elocution, and not in any deep knowledge of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
especially of Metaphysicks, and much lesse of that most solid, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
subtile,</hi> &amp; (O re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ridicula<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Cato</hi> &amp; jocosa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>!) <hi>succinct method of School-Divinity.</hi>
Wherein you have discovered in your self the true Genius
and spirit of detraction. For taking advantage from that wherein envy
it self cannot deny but they are very eminent, and which requires great
sufficiency of substantiall learning, you disparage them as insufficient in
all things else. As if forsooth, because they dispute not eternally, <hi>Vtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Chimaera bombinans in vacuo, possit comedere, secundas Intentiones? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Million of Angels may not sit upon a needles point?</hi> Becuase they
fill not their brains with notions that signify nothing, to the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of all reason and common sence, and spend not an Age in
weaving and un-weaving subtile cobwebs, fitter to catch flyes then
Souls; therefore they have no deepe knowledge in the Acroamaticall
part of learning! But I have too much honour'd the poornesse of this
detraction to take notice of it.</p>
            <p>20 <hi>The other Part of your accusation strikes deeper, and is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable:
And that tels us that,</hi> Protestantisme waxeth weary of it self;
that the Professors of it, they especially of greatest worth, learning, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
love temper and moderation: and are at this time more unresolved
where to fasten, then at the infancy of their Church: <hi>That</hi> their Churches
begin to look with a new face: Their w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lls to speak a new language: Their
Doctrine to be altered in many things for which their Progenitors forsook
the then Visible Church of Christ: For example, the Pope not Antichrist:
Prayer for the dead: Limbus Patrum: Pictures: That the Church hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in determining Controversies of Faith, and to interpret Scripture;
about Freewill, Predestination, Vniversall grace: <hi>That</hi> all our works are
not sinnes: Merit of good works: Inherent Iustice: Faith alone doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify:
Charity to be preferr'd before knowledge: Traditions: Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
possible to be kept: <hi>That</hi> their thirty nine Articles are patient, nay
ambitious of some sence wherein they may seem Catholique: <hi>That to</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage
the necessity of wife and children in these dayes is but a weak plea
for a married minister to compasse a Benefice: <hi>That</hi> Calvinisme is at length
accounted Heresy, and little lesse then treason: <hi>That</hi> men in talk and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:7615:11"/>
use willingly the once fearfull names of Priests and Altars: <hi>That</hi> they
are now put in mind that for exposition of Scripture they are by Canon
bound to follow the Fathers: which if they doe with syncerity, it is easy to
tell what doome will passe against Protestants; seeing by the confession of
Protestants, the Fathers are on the Papists side, which the Answerer to
some so clearly demonstrated, that they remain'd convinc'd: In fine, as
the Samaritans saw in the Disciples countenances that they meant to goe
to Hierusalem, so you pretend it is even legible in the fore-heads of these
men, that they are even going, nay making hast to Rome. <hi>Which scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
libell void of all truth, discretion and honesty, what effect it may
have wrought, what credit it may have gain'd with credulous Papists,
(who dream what they desire, and believe their own dreams,) or with
ill-affected, jealous, and weak Protestants, I can not tell: But one thing
I dare boldly say, that you your selfe did never believe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21 For did you indeed conceive, or had any probable hope, that
such men as you describe, men of worth of learning and authority too,
were friends and favourers of your Religion, &amp; inclinable to your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
can any man imagine that you would proclaim it, and bid the world
take heed of them? <hi>Sic notus Vlysses?</hi> Doe we know the lesuites no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then so? What are they turned prevaricators against their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Are they likely men to betray and expose their own Agents and
instruments, and to awaken the eyes of jealousy, and to raise the clamor
of the people against them? Certainly your Zeal to the Sea of Rome,
testified by your <hi>fourth Vow of speciall obedience to the Pope,</hi> proper to
your Order, and your cunning carriage of all affairs for the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and advancement of that Sea, are clear demonstrations that if
you had thought thus, you would never have said so. The truth is, they
that run to extreams in opposition against you, they that pull downe
your infallibility and set up their own, they that declaim against your
tyranny, and exercise it themselves over otheres, are the Adversaries
that give you greatest advantage, and such as you love to deale with:
whereas upon men of temper &amp; moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, such as will oppose nothing
because you maintain it, but will draw as neere to you, that they may
draw you to them, as the truth will suffer them: such as require of
Christians to believe only in Christ, and will damne no man nor Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
without expresse and certaine warrant from gods word: upon
such as these you know not how to fasten; but if you chance to have
conference with any such, (which yet as much as possibly you can you
avoid and decline,) you are very speedily put to silence, and see the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defensible
weaknesse of your cause laid open to all men. And this I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe, is the true reason that you thus rave and rage against them,
as foreseeing your time of prevailing, or even of subsisting, would
be short, if other Adversaries gave you no more advantage then
they doe.</p>
            <p>22 In which perswasion also I am much confirmed by considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the sillynesse and poornesse of those suggestions, and partly of
the apparent vanity and falshood of them, which you offer in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this wicked calumny. For what if out of devotion towards
<pb facs="tcp:7615:12"/>
God; out of a desire that he should be worshipped as <hi>in Spirit and truth</hi>
in the first place, so also <hi>in the beauty of holinesse?</hi> what if out of feare
that too much simplicity and nakednesse in the publique Service of
God may beget in the ordinary sort of men a dull and stupid irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and out of hope that the outward state and glory of it, being
well dispos'd and wisely moderated, may ingender, quicken, increase
and nourish the inward reverence respect and devotion which is due
unto Gods Soveraign Majesty and power? what if out of a perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and desire that Papists may be wonne over to us the sooner, by the
removing of this scandall out of their way; and out of an holy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
that the weaker sort of Protestants might be the easier seduced to
them by the magnificence and pomp of their Church-service in case it
were not removed? I say, what if out of these considerations, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of our Church, more of late then formerly, have set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to adorn and beautifie the places <hi>where Gods honour dwells,</hi> and
to make them as heavenly as they can with earthly ornaments? Is
this a signe that they are warping towards Popery? Is this Devotion
in the Church of England an argument that shee is coming over to
the Church of Rome? Sir <hi>Edwin Sands,</hi> I presume every man will
grant, had no inclination that way; yet he forty years since highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
this part of devotion in Papists, and makes no scruple of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it to the imitation of Protestants: Litle thinking that they who
would follow his counsell, and endeavour to take away this dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of Protestants, and this glorying of Papists, should have been
censur'd for it as making way and inclining to Popery. His words to
this purpose are excellent words, and because they shew plainly, that
what is now practis'd was approv'd by Zealous Protestants so long
agoe,<note place="margin">Survey of Religion. <hi>Init.</hi>
               </note> I will here set them down.</p>
            <p>23 This one thing I cannot but highly commend in that sort and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
They spare nothing which either cost can perform in enriching, or skill
in adorning the Temple of God, or to set out his Service with the greatest
pompe and magnificence that can be devised. And although, for the most
part, much basenesse and childishnesse is predominant in the Masters and
contrivers of their Ceremonies, yet this outward state and glory being
well disposed, doth ingender, quicken, increase, and nourish the inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
respect and devotion, which is due unto Soveraign Majesty and
Power. And although I am not ignorant that many men well reputed have
embraced the thrifty opinion of that Disciple who thought all to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
that was bestowed upon Christ in that sort, and that it were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bestowed upon him on the poor, (yet with an eye perhaps that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would be his quarter Almoners,) notwithstanding I must confesse,
it will never sink into my heart, that in proportion of reason, the allowance
for furnishing out of the service of God should be measured by the scant
and strict rule of meere necessity, (a proportion so low that nature to other
most bountifull in matter of necessity, hath not fayled no not the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creatures of the world,) and that for our selves no measure of heaping
but the most we can get, no rule of expence but to the utmost pompe we
list: Or that God himself had so inrich'd the lower parts of the world
<pb facs="tcp:7615:12"/>
with such wonderfull varieties of beauty and glory, that they might serve
only to the pampering of mortall man in his pride; and that in the Service
of the high creator Lord and giver (the outward glory of whose higher
pallace may appear by the very lamps that we see so farre of burning glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in it) only the simpler, baser, cheaper, lesse noble, lesse beautifull, lesse
glorious things should be imployed. Especially seeing as in Princes courts,
so in the service of God also, this outward state and glory, being well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spos'd,
doth (as I have said) ingender, quicken, increase and nourish the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
reverence, respect and devotion, which is due to so Soveraign majesty
and power. Which those whom the use there of cannot perswade unto, would
easily by the want of it be brought to confesse; for which cause I crave
leave to be excused by them herein, if in Zeal to the common Lord of all,
I choose rather to commend the vertue of an enemy then to flatter the vice
and imbecility of a friend. <hi>And so much for this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24 Again, what if the names of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> so frequent in
the ancient Fathers, though not in the now Popish sense, be now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
and more commonly used in England then of late times they
were: that so the colourable argument of their conformity, which is
but nominall, with the ancient Church, and our inconformity, which
the Governors of the Church would not have so much as nominall,
may be taken away from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Church of England may be
put in a state, in this regard more justifiable against the Roman then
formerly it was, being hereby enabled to say to Papists (whensoever
these names are objected,) we also use the names of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi>
and yet believe neither the corporall Presence, nor any Proper and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory
Sacrifice?</p>
            <p>25 What if Protestants be now put in mind, that for exposition
of Scripture, they are bound by a Canon <hi>to follow the ancient Fathers:</hi>
which whosoever doth with syncerity, it is utterly impossible he should
be a Papist? And it is most falsely said by you, that you know that to
some Protestants, I cleerly demonstrated, or ever so much as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
or went about to demonstrate the contrary. What if the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists
be censur'd somewhat roundly by a Protestant Divine for affrm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>the keeping of the Lords day was a thing indifferent for two
hundred yeares?</hi> Is there in all this or any part of it any kind of proofe
of this scandalous calumny? Certainly if you can make no better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
then these, and have so little judgement as to think these any,
you have great reason to decline conferences, and <hi>Signior Con</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite
you from writing books any more.</p>
            <p>26 As for the points of Doctrine wherein you pretend that these
Divines begin of late to falter, and to comply with the Church of
Rome, upon a due examination of particulars it will presently appear,
First, that part of them alwaies have been, and now are held constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one way by them; as the Authority of the Church in determining
Controversies of faith, though not the infallibility of it: That there is
Inherent Iustice, though so imperfect that it cannot justify: That there
are Traditions, though none necessary: That charity is to be preferr'd
before knowledge: That good Works are not properly meritorious
<pb facs="tcp:7615:13"/>
And lastly, that faith alone justifies, though that faith justifies not
which is alone. And secondly, for the remainder that they, every one
of them, have been anciently without breach of charity disputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Protestants, such for example were the Questions about the
Popes being the Antichrist, The lawfulnesse of some kind of prayers
for the dead, the Estate of the Fathers souls, before Christs ascenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Freewill, Predestination, Vniversall grace: The Possibility of
keeping Gods commandements. The use of Pictures in the Church:
Wherein that there hath been anciently diversity of opinion amongst
Protestants, it is justifyed to my hand by a witnesse, with you, beyond
exception, even your great friend M. <hi>Brerely, whose care, exactnesse and
fidelity</hi> (you say in your Preface) <hi>is so extraordinary great.</hi> Consult
him therefore: Tract. 3. Sect. 7. of his <hi>Apology:</hi> And in the 9. 10. 11. 14.
24. 26. 27. 37. Subdivisions of that <hi>Section,</hi> you shall see as in a mirror,
your selfe prov'd an egregious calumniator, for charging Protestants
with innovation and inclining to Popery, under pretence forsooth,
that their Doctrine beginnes of late to be altered in these points.
Whereas, M. <hi>Brerely</hi> will informe you, they have been anciently, and
even from the begining of the Reformation, controverted amongst
them, though perhaps the stream and current of their Doctors runne
one way, and only some brooke or rivulet of them the other.</p>
            <p>27 And thus my Friends, I suppose are cleerely vindicated, from
your scandalls and calumnies: It remaines now that in the last place I
bring my selfe fairely off from your foule aspersions, that so my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may not be (as indeed howsoever it should not be) any disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
or disparagement to the cause, nor any scandall to weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
            <p>28 Your injuries then to me (no way deserved by me, but by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in opinion from you, wherein yet you surely differ from me as
much as I from you,) are especially three. For <hi>first</hi> upon heere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, &amp;
refusing to give me oportunity of begetting in you a better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of me, you charge me with a great number of false and impious
doctrines, which I will not name in particular, because I will not assist
you so farre in the spreading of my own undeserved defamation: but
whosoever teaches or holds them <hi>let him be Anathema!</hi> The summe
of them all cast up by your selfe, in your first chap. is this, <hi>Nothing
ought or can be certainly believed, farther then it may be proved by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Naturall reason:</hi> (where I conceive Naturall reason is oppos'd
to supernaturall Revelation) and whosoever holds so <hi>let him be Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema!</hi>
And moreover to clear my selfe once for all, from all imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this nature, which charge me injuriously with deniall of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Verities, I professe syncerely, that I believe all those Books of
Scripture, which the Church of England accounts Canonicall, to be
the Infallible word of God: I believe all things evidently contained
in them; all things evidently, or even probably deducible from them:
I acknowledge all that to be Heresy, which by the Act of Parliament
<hi>primo of Q.</hi> ELIZ. is declar'd to be so, &amp; only to be so: And though
in such points which may he held diversly of divers men <hi>salvâ Fidei
<pb facs="tcp:7615:13"/>
compage.</hi> I would not take any mans liberty from him, and humbly
beseech all men, that they would not take mine from me! Yet thus
much I can say (which I hope will satisfy any man of reason,) that
whatsoever hath been held necessary to salvation, either by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church of all ages, or by the consent of Fathers, measur'd
by <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> his rule, or is held necessary either by the
Catholique Church of this age, or by the consent of Protestants, or
even by the Church of England, that, against the Socinians, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whatsoever, I doe verily believe and embrace.</p>
            <p>29 Another great and manifest injury you have done me, in charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to have forsaken your Religion, <hi>because it condus'd not to my
temporall ends,</hi> and suted not with my desires and designes: Which
certainly is a horrible crime, &amp; whereof if you could convince me, by
just and strong presumptions, I should then acknowledge my selfe to
deserve that opinion, which you would faine induce your credents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
that I chang'd not your Religion for any other but for none at all.
But of this great fault my conscience acquits me, and God, who only
knowes the hearts of all men, knowes that I am innocent? Neither
doubt I but all they who know me, and amongst them many Persons
of place and quality, will say they have reason in this matter to be my
compurgators. And for you, though you are very affirmative in your
accusation, yet you neither doe, nor can produce any proof or presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it, but forgeting your selfe, (as it is Gods will oftimes that
slanderers should doe) have let fall some passages which being well
weighed, will make considering men apt to believe, that you did not
believe your selfe. For how is it possible, you should believe that I
deserted your Religion for ends, &amp; against the light of my conscience,
out of a desire of preferment, and yet out of scruple of conscience,
should refuse (which also you impute to me,) to subscribe the 39 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
that is, refuse to enter at the only common dore, which here
in England leads to preferment? Again how incredible is it that you
should believe, that I forsooke the profession of your Religion, as
not suting with my desires and designes, which yet reconciles the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
of the pleasures and profits of sinne here, with the hope of
happinesse hereafter, and proposes as great hope of great temporall
advancements to the capable servants of it, as any, nay more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Religion in the world; and instead of this should choose Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,
a Doctrine, which howsoever erroneous in explicating the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Religion, and allowing greater liberty of opinion in specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
matters, then any other Company of Christians doth or they
should doe, yet certainly which you, I am sure, will pretend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to explicate the Lawes of Christ with more rigor, and lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
and condescendence to the desires of flesh and blood then
your Doctrine doth! And besides, such a Doctrine by which no man
in his right mind, can hope for any honour or preferment either in this
Church or State or any other! All which cleerely demonstrates that
this foule and false aspersion, which you have cast upon mee, proceeds
from no other fountaine, but a heart abounding with the gall and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
<pb facs="tcp:7615:14"/>
of uncharitablenesse, and even blinded with malice towards
me, or else from a perverse zeale to your superstition, which secretly
suggests this perswasion to you, That for the Catholique cause no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is unlawfull, but that you may make use of such indirect and
crooked arts as these, to blast my reputation, and to possesse mens
minds with disaffection to my person, least otherwise peradventure
they might with some indifference hear reason from me. God I hope
which bringeth light out of darknesse, will turne your counsells to foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse,
and give all good men grace to perceive how weak and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
that Religion must be, which needs supportance from such tricks
and devices! So I call them because they deserve no better name: For
what are all these Personall matters, which hitherto you have spoke of,
to the businesse in hand? If it could be prov'd, that Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
was indeed a Iew, or that Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> was an Atheist, yet I
presume you would not accept of this for an answer to all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
in defence of your Religion. Let then my actions and intentions
and opinions be what they will, yet I hope truth is neverthelesse truth,
nor reason ever the lesse Reason because I speak it. And therefore the
Christian Reader, knowing that his Salvation or damnation depends
upon his impartiall and sincere judgment of these things, will guard
himself I hope from these impostures, and regard not the person but
the cause and the reasons of it; not who speakes but what is spoken:
Which is all the favour I desire of him, as knowing that I am desirous
not to perswade him, unlesse it be truth whereunto I perswade him.</p>
            <p>30 The third and la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t part of my Accusation was, that I answer ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of <hi>Principles which Protestants themselves will professe to detest:</hi> which
indeed were to the purpose if it could be justified. But, besides that it is
confuted by my whole Book, and made ridiculous by the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
premis'd unto it, it is very easy for mee out of your own mouth
and words to prove it a most injurious calumny. For what one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is there is the whole fabrick of my discourse, that is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
deducible out of this one Principle, That <hi>all things necessary to
salvation are evidently contain'd in Scripture?</hi> Or what one Conclusion
almost of importance is there in your Book, which is not by this one
cleerly confutable? Grant this, and it will presently follow in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to your first Conclusion, and the argument of your first Ch: that
amongst men of different opinions, touching the obscure and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Questions of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, such as may with probability be disputed
on both Sides (and such as are the disputes of Protestants;) Good men
and lovers of truth of all Sides may bee sav'd; because all necessary
things being suppos'd evident, concerning them, with men so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
there will be no difference: There being no more certain signe that
a Point is not evident, then that honest and understanding and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
men, and such as give themselves liberty of judgment, after a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
consideration of the matter differ about it.</p>
            <p>31 Grant this, and it will appear <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the means whereby
the revealed Truths of God are conveyed to our understanding, and
which are to determine all Controversies in Faith, necessary to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
<pb facs="tcp:7615:14"/>
may be, for any thing you have said to the contrary, not a
Church but the Scripture; which contradicts the Doctrine of your
<hi>Second Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>32 Grant this, and the distinction of points Fundamentall and not
Fundamentall, will appear very good and pertinent. For those truths
will be fundamentall, which, are evidently delivered in Scripture and
commanded to be preach't to all men; Those not fundamentall which
are obscure. And nothing will hinder but that the Catholique Church
may erre in the latter kind of the said points: because Truths not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Salvation, cannot be necessary to the being of a Church; and
because it is not absolutely necessary that God should assist his
Church any farther then to bring her to Salvation; neither will there
be any necessity at all of any infallible Guide, either to consigne unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Traditions, or to declare the obscurities of the faith. Not for the
former end, because this Principle being granted true, nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
can be necessary to be consign'd. Nor for the latter, because
nothing that is obcsure can be necessary to be understood, or not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
And so the discourse of your whole <hi>Third Chap:</hi> will presently
vanish.</p>
            <p>33 Fourthly, for the Creed's containing the Fundamentals of simple
belief, though I see not how it may be deduc'd from this principle, yet
the granting of this plainly renders the whole dispute touching the
Creed unnecessary. For if all necessary things of all sorts, whether of
simple belief or practice be confess'd to bee cleerly contain'd in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
what imports it whether those of one sort bee contain'd in the
Creed?</p>
            <p>34 Fiftly let this be granted, and the immediate Corollary in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to your fift Ch: will be and must be, That, not Protestants for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting,
but the Church of Rome for imposing upon the Faith of
Christians, Doctrines unwritten and unnecessary, and for disturbing
the Churches peace and dividing Vnity for such matters, is in a high
degree presumptuous and Schismaticall.</p>
            <p>35 Grant this sixtly, and it will follow unavoidably that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
cannot possibly be Heretiques, seeing they believe all things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
contain'd in Scripture, which are suppos'd to be all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed: and so your <hi>Sixt Chapter</hi> is cleerly confuted.</p>
            <p>36 Grant this lastly, and it will be undoubtedly consequent, in
contradiction of your <hi>seaventh Chapter,</hi> that no man can shew more
charity to himself then by continuing a Protestant, seeing Protestants
are suppos' to believe, and therefore may accordingly practise, at least
by their Religion are not hindred from practising and performing all
things necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>37 So that the position of this one Principle, is the direct overthrow
of your whole Book, and therefore I needed not, nor indeed have I
made use of any other. Now this principle, which is not only the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
stone or chief Pillar, but even the base, and adequate foundation
of my Answer; and which while it stands firme and unmoveable, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but bee the supporter of my Book and the certain ruine of yours, is
<pb facs="tcp:7615:15"/>
so farre from being, according to your pretence, detested by all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
that all Protestants whatsoever, as you may see in their Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of confessions, unanimously professe and maintain it. And you
your selfe, C. 6. § 30. plainly confesse as much, in saying, <hi>The whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice
of the faith of Protestants is setled on these two Principles: These
particular Books are Canonicall Scripture: And the sense and meaning
of them is plain and evident at least in all points necessary to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>38 And thus your venome against me is in a manner spent, saving
only that there remain two litle impertinencies, whereby you would
disable me from being a fit advocate for the cause of Protestants. The
first, because I refuse to subscribe the Artic. of the Ch. of England: The
second because I have set down in writing motives which sometime
induc'd mee to forsake Protestantisme, and hitherto have not answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them.</p>
            <p>39 By the former of which objections it should seeme, that either
you conceive the 39 Articles the common Doctrine of all Protestants;
and if they be, why have you so often upbraided them with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great differences? Or else that it is the peculiar defence of the
Church of England, and not the common cause of all Protestants,
which is here undertaken by me: which are certainly very grosse mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.
And yet why hee who makes scruple of subscribing the truth
of one or two Propositions may not yet bee fit enough to maintain
that those who doe subscribe them are in a saveable condition, I doe
not understand. Now though I hold not the Doctrine of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
absoluetly true, (which with reason cannot bee requir'd of mee
while they hold contradictions,) yet I hold it free from all impiety,
and from all error destructive of Salvation, or in it self damnable: And
this I think in reason may sufficiently qualifie me, for a maintainer of
this assertion, that <hi>Protestancie destroies not Salvation.</hi> For the Church
of England, I am perswaded that the constant Doctrine of it is so pure
and Orthodoxe, that whosoever believes it and lives according to it,
undoubtedly he shall be saved; and that there is no error in it which
may necessitate or warrant any man to disturbe the peace or renounce
the Communion of it. This in my opinion is all intended by Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and thus much if you conceive mee not ready to subscribe, your
<hi>Charity</hi> I assure you is much <hi>mistaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40 Your other objection against me is yet more impertinent and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
then the former: Vnlesse perhaps it be a just exception against
a Physitian, that himself was sometimes in, and recover'd himself from
that disease which he undertakes to cure; or against a guide in a way,
that at first before hee had experience himself mistook it, and after,
wards, found his error and amended it. That noble writer <hi>Michael
de Montai'gne,</hi> was surely of a farre different mind; for hee will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allow any Physitian competent, but only for such diseases as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had pass'd through: And a farre greater then <hi>Montai'gne,</hi> even he
that said, <hi>Tu conversus confirma fratres,</hi> gives us sufficiently to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that they which have themselves beene in such a state as to need
conversion, are not thereby made incapable of, but rather engag'd
<pb facs="tcp:7615:15"/>
and oblig'd unto, and qualified for this charitable function.</p>
            <p>41 Neither am I guilty of that strange and preposterous zeale (as
you esteeme it) which you impute to me; for having been so long
carelesse in removing this scandall against Protestants, and answering
my own Motives, and yet now shewing such fervor in writing against
others. For neither are they other Motives, but the very same for
the most part with those which abused me, against which this Book
which I now publish, is in a manner wholly imployed: And besides,
though you Iesuits take upon you to have such large and universall
intelligence of all state affaires and matters of importance, yet I hope
such a contemptible matter, as an answer of mine to a litle peece of
paper, may very probably have been written and escaped your obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
The truth is, I made an answer to them three yeares since and
better, which perhaps might have been published, but for two reasons:
one because the Motives were never publique, untill you made them
so; the other, because I was loath to proclaime to all the world so much
weaknesse as I shewed, in suffering my selfe to be abus'd by such silly
Sophismes; All which proceed upon mistakes and false suppositions,
which unadvisedly I took for granted; as when I have set down the
Motives in order by subsequent Answers to them I shall quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
and so make an end. The Motives then were these.</p>
            <p>1 Because perpetuall visible profession, which could never be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Religion of Christ, nor any part of it, is apparently wanting to
Protestant Religion, so farre as concernes the points in contestation.</p>
            <p>2 Because <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers, separating from the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> separated also from all Churches, pure or impure, true or false
then being in the world; upon which ground I conclude, that either Gods
promises did faile of performance, if there were then no Church in the
world, which held all things necessary, and nothing repugnant to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or else that <hi>Luther</hi> and his Sectaries, separating from all Churches
then in the world, and so from the true, if there were any true, were <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Schismaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Because, if any credit may be given to as creditable records, as any
are extant, the Doctrine of Catholicks hath been frequently confirmed;
and the opposite doctrine of Protestants, confounded with supernaturall
and divine Miracles.</p>
            <p>4 Because many points of Protestant doctrine, are the damned opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Hereticks, condemned by the Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>5 Because the Prophecies of the old Testament, touching the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Kings and Nations to the true Religion of Christ, have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in and by the Catholicke <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and the Professors of
it; and not by Protestant Religion, and the Professors of it.</p>
            <p>6 Because the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is conformable, and
the doctrine of Protestants contrary, to the doctrine of the Fathers of the
Primitive Church, even by the confession of Protestants themselves; I
meane, those fathers, who lived within the compasse of the first 600. years;
to whom Protestants themselves doe very frequently, and very confidently
appeale.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7615:16"/>
7 Because the first pretended Reformers had neither extraordinary
<hi>Commission</hi> from God, nor ordinary <hi>Mission</hi> from the Church, to preach
Protestant Doctrine.</p>
            <p>8 Because <hi>Luther,</hi> to preach against the Masse (which containes the
most materiall points now in controversy) was perswaded by reasons sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
to him by the Divell himselfe, disputing with him. So himselfe
professeth in his Book <hi>de Missa Privata.</hi> That all men might take heed of
following him, who professeth himselfe to follow the Divell.</p>
            <p>9 Because the Protestant cause is now, and hath been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
maintained with grosse falsifications, and Calumnies; whereof their
prime Controversy writers, are notoriously, and in high degree guilty.</p>
            <p>10 Because by denying all humane authority, either of Pope, or
Councells, or Church, to determine Controversies of Faith, they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
all possible meanes of suppressing Heresy, or restoring unity to the
Church.</p>
            <p>These are the Motives; now my Answers to them follow brie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly
and in order.</p>
            <p>43 To the first: God hath neither decreed nor foretold, that his
true Doctrine should <hi>de facto</hi> be alwaies visibly prfessed, without any
mixture of falshood.</p>
            <p>To the second: God hath neither decreed nor foretold, that there
shall be alwaies a visible company of men free from all error in it selfe
damnable. Neither is it alwaies of necessity Schismaticall to separate
from the externall communion of a Church, though wanting nothing
necessary: For if this Church suppos'd to want nothing necessary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
me to professe against my conscience, that I believe some error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though never so small and innocent, which I doe not believe, and will
not allow me her communion but upon this condition, In this case,
the Church for requiring this condition is Schismaticall, and not I for
separating from the Church.</p>
            <p>To the third: If any credit may be given to Records farre more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable
then these, the Doctrine of Protestants, that is the Bible hath
been confirm'd, and the Doctrine of Papists, which is in many points
plainly opposite to it, confounded with supernaturall and divine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
which for number and glory outshine Popish pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as much as the Sunne doth an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> those I mean which
were wrought by our Saviour Christ and his Apostles, Now this
book, by the confession of all sides confirm'd by innumerous Miracles,
foretels me plainly, that in after ages great signes and wonders shall
be wrought in confirmation of false doctrine, and that I am not to
believe any doctrine which seemes to my understanding repugnant to
the first, though an Angell from Heaven should teach it; which were
certainly as great a Miracle as any that was ever wrought in attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any part of the doctrine of the Church of Rome: But that true
doctrine should in all ages have the testimony of Miracles, that I am
no where taught; So that I have more reason to suspect and be afraid
of pretended Miracles, as signes of false doctrine, then much to regard
them as certain arguments of the truth. Besides, setting aside the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:7615:16"/>
&amp; the Tradition of it, there is as good story for Miracles wrought
by those who lived and died in opposition to the Doctrine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church, (as by S. <hi>Cyprian, Colmannus, Columbanus, Aidanus</hi> and
others,) as there is for those that are pretended to be wrought by the
members of that Church. Lastly, it seemes to me no strange thing
that God in his Iustice should permit some true Miracles to be
wrought to delude them, who have forged so many as apparently the
professors of the Roman Doctrine have to abuse the World.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>IVE me leave (good Reader) to informe thee by way of Preface,
of three points. The first concernes <hi>D. Potters Answere to Charity
Mistaken.</hi> The second relates to this <hi>Reply</hi> of mine. And the third
containes some <hi>Premonitions,</hi> or <hi>Prescriptions,</hi> in case <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or
any in his behalfe thinke fit to rejoyne.</p>
            <p>2. For the first point concerning <hi>D. Potters Answere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A generall consideration of D. Potters Answere.</note> I say in
generall, reserving particulars to their proper places, that in his whole
Booke he hath not so much as once truly and really fallen upon the
point in question, which was, Whether both Catholiques and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
can be saved in their severall professions. And therefore <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
Mistaken</hi> judiciously pressing those particulars, wherein the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
doth precisely consist, proves in generall, that there is but one true Church; that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are obliged to harken to her; that shee must be ever visible, and infallible; that to separate
ones selfe from her communion is Schisme; and to dissent from her doctrine is Heresie, though
it be in points never so few, or never so small in their own nature; and therefore that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of points fundamentall, and not fundamentall, is wholy vaine, as it is applied by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.
These (I say) and some other generall grounds <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> handles, and out of
them doth cleerely evince, that any least difference in faith cannot stand with salvation on both
sides: and therefore since it is apparent, that Catholiques and Protestants disagree in very many
points of faith, they both cannot hope to be saved without repentance: and consequently, as we
hold, that Protestancy unrepented <hi>destroies Salvation;</hi> so must they also believe that we cannot
be saved, if they judge their own Religion to be true, and ours to be false. And whosoever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guizeth
this truth, is an enemy to soules, which he deceives with ungrounded false hopes of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
indifferent Faiths, and Religions. And this, <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> performed exactly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that which appeares to have been his designe, which was not to descend to particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
as <hi>D. Potter</hi> affectedly does, namely, Whether or no the Roman Church be the only
true Church of Christ; and much lesse whether Generall Councells be infallible; whether the
Pope may erre in his Decrees common to the whole Church; whether he be above a Generall
Councell; whether all points of faith be contained in Scripture; whether Faith be resolved into
the authority of the Church, as into his last <hi>formall Object,</hi> and <hi>Motive;</hi> and least of all did he
discourse of Images, Communion under both kinds, publique service in an unknown Tongue,
Seven Sacraments, Sacrifice of the Masse, Indulgences, and Index Expurgatorius: all which and
divers other articles <hi>D. Potter</hi> (as I said) drawes by violence into his Book: and he might as well
have brought in Pope <hi>Ioan,</hi> or Antichrist, or the Iewes who are permitted to live in Rome, which
are common Themes for men that want better matter, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> was forced to fetch in the
aforesaid Controversies, that so he might dazle the eyes, and distract the mind of the Reader,
and hinder him from perceiving that in his whole Answere he uttered nothing to the purpose,
and point in question: which if he had followed closely, I dare well say, he might have dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his whole Book in two or three sheets of paper. But the truth is, he was loath to affirme
plainely, that generally both Catholiques and Protestants may be saved: and yet seeing it to be
most evident that Protestants cannot pretend to have any true Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> except the
Roman, and such as agreed with her, and consequently that they cannot hope for Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if they deny it to us; he thought best to avoid this difficulty by confusion of language, and to fill
up his Book with points which make nothing to the purpose. Wherein he is lesse excusable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7615:18"/>
he must graunt, that those very particulars to which he digresseth, are not fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
though it should be granted that they be errors, which indeed are Catholique verities. For
since they be not fundamentall, not destructive of salvation, what imports it whether we hold
them or no, for as much as concernes our possibility to be saved?</p>
            <p>3 In one thing only he will perhaps seeme to have touched the point in question, to wit, in
his distinction of points fundamentall, and not fundamentall: because some may thinke, that a
difference in points which are not fundamentall breakes not the Vnity of Faith, and hinders not
the hope of salvation in persons so disagreeing. And yet in this very distinction, he never speaks
to the purpose indeed, but only saies, that there are some points so fundamentall, as that all are
obliged to know and <hi>believe</hi> them explicitely, but never tells us, whether there be any other
points of faith, which a man may deny or <hi>disbelieve,</hi> though they be sufficiently presented to his
understanding, as truths revealed, or testified by almighty God; which was the only thing in
question. For if it be damnable, as certainly it is, to deny, or disbelieve any one truth witnessed
by almighty God, though the thing be not in it self of any great consequence, or moment; and
since of two disagreeing in matters of faith, one must necessarily deny some such truth; it clearly
followes that amongst men of different Faiths, or Religions, one only can be saved, though their
difference consist of divers, or but even one point, which is not in his own nature fundamentall,
as I declare at large in divers places of my first part. So that it is cleere, <hi>D. Potter</hi> even in this his
last refuge and distinction, never comes to the point in question, to say nothing that he himselfe
doth quite overthrow it, and plainly contradict his whole designe, as I shew in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of my <hi>first Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 And as for <hi>D. Potters</hi> manner of handling those very points, which are utterly beside
the purpose, it consists only in bringing vulgar mean objections, which have been answered a
thousand times, yea, and some of them are cleerely answered even in <hi>Charity Mistaken;</hi> but he
takes no knowledge at all af any such answeres, and much lesse doth he apply himselfe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them. He alleadgeth also Authors with so great corruption and fraud, as I would not have
believed, if I had not found it by cleere, and frequent experience. In his second <hi>Edition,</hi> he hath
indeed left out one or two grosse corruptions, amongst many others no lesse notorious, having as
it seemes been warned by some friends, that they could not stand with his credit: but even in this
his second <hi>Edition</hi> he retracts them not at all, nor declares that he was mistaken in the <hi>First,</hi> and
so his reader of the first <hi>Edition</hi> shall ever be deceived by him, though withall he read the <hi>Second.</hi>
For preventing of which inconvenience, I have thought it necessary to take notice of them, and
to discover them in my <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. And for conclusion of this point I will only say, that <hi>D. Potter</hi> might well have spared
his paines if he had ingeniously acknowledged, where the whole substance, yea and sometime
the very words and phrases of his book may be found in farre briefer manner, namely, in a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
of <hi>D. Vshers</hi> preached before our late soveraigne Lord <hi>King Iames</hi> the 20. of Iune 1624. at
<hi>Wansted,</hi> containing <hi>A Declaration of the Vniversality of the Church of Christ, and the Vnity
of Faith, professed therein,</hi> which Sermon having been roundly and wittily confuted by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Divine, under the name of <hi>Paulus Veridicus,</hi> within the compasse of about 4. sheets of
Paper, <hi>D. Potters Answere to Charity Mistaken</hi> was in effect confuted before it appeared. And
this may suffice for a generall Censure of his Answere to <hi>Charity Mistaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 For the second, touching my <hi>Reply:</hi> if you wonder at the Bulke thereof, compared either
with <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concerning my Reply.</note> or <hi>D Potters Answere,</hi> I desire you to consider well of what now I am
about to say, and then <hi>I</hi> hope you will see, that I was cast upon a meere necessity of not being
so short, as otherwise might peradventure be desired. <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> is short I grant, and yet
very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull, and large, for as much as concerned his designe, which you see was not to treat of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Controversies in Religion, no not so much as to debate, whether or no the Roman
Church be the only true Church of Christ, which indeed would have required a larger Volume,
as I have understood there was one then comming forth, if it had not bee prevented by the
Treatise of <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> which seemed to make the other intended worke a little lesse sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
at that time. But <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> proves only in Generall out of some Vniversall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
well backed and made good by choice &amp; solid authorities, that of two disagreeing in points
of Faith, one only without repentance can be saved; which ayme exacted no great bulk. And
as for <hi>D. Potters Answere,</hi> even that also is not so short as it may seem. For if his marginall notes
printed in a small letter were transferred into the Text, the Book would appear to be of some
bulk: though indeed it might have been very short, if he had kept himselfe to the point treated by
<hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> as shall be declared anon. But contrarily, because the question debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> and <hi>D. Potter,</hi> is a point of the highest consequence that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and in regard that there is not a more pernitious Heresy, or rather indeed ground of Atheisme,
then a perswasion that men of different Religions may be saved, if otherwise forsooth they lead a
kind of civill and morall life: I conceaved, that my chief endeavour was not to be employed in
answering <hi>D Potter,</hi> but that it was necessary to handle the Question it selfe somewhat at large,
and not only to prove in generall, that both Protestants and Catholikes cannot be saved; but to
shew also, that Salvation cannot be hoped for out of the Catholique Roman Church; and yet
withall, not to omit to answere all the particulars of <hi>D. Potters</hi> Book which may any way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7615:18"/>
To this end I thought it fit, to divide my <hi>Reply</hi> into <hi>two Parts;</hi> in the formet whereof, the
main question is handled by a continued discourse without stepping aside to confute the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of <hi>D. Potters Answere,</hi> though yet so, as that even in this first <hi>Part,</hi> I omit not to answere
such passages of his, as I find directly in my way, and naturally belong to the points whereof I
treat: and in the second <hi>Part</hi> I answere <hi>D. Potters</hi> Treanse, <hi>Section</hi> by <hi>Section,</hi> as they lye in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
I heer therefore intreat the Reader, that if heartily he desire satisfaction in this so important
question, he doe not content himselfe with that which I say to <hi>Doctor Potter</hi> in my second <hi>Part,</hi>
but that he take the <hi>First</hi> before him, eyther all, or at least so much as may serve most to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of being satisfied in those doubts which presse him most. For which purpose I have caused
a Table of the Chapters of the first <hi>Part,</hi> together with their Titles and Arguments, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
before my Reply.</p>
            <p>7. This was then a chiefe reason why I could not be very short. But yet there wanted not
also divers other causes of the same effect. For there are so severall kinds of Protestants through
the difference of Tenets which they hold, as that if a man convince but one kind of them, the
rest will conceive themselves to be as truly unsatisfied, and even unspoken to, as if nothing had
been said therein at all. As for example, some hold a necessity of a perpetuall visible Church, and
some hold no such necessity. Some of them hold it necessary to be able to prove it distinct from
ours; and others, that their businesse is dispatched when they have proved ours to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
visible: for then they will conceive that theirs hath been so: &amp; the like may be truly said of
very many other particulars. Besides it is <hi>D. Potters</hi> fashion, (wherein as he is very far from being
the first, so I pray God he prove the last of that humour) to touch in a word many triviall old ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
which if they be not all answered, it will, and must serve the turne, to make the more
ignorant sort of men believe, and brag, as if some maine unanswerable matter had been subtily
and purposely omitted; and every body knowes that some objection may be very plausibly made
in few words, the cleere and solid answere whereof will require more leaves of paper the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one.
And in particular <hi>D. Potter</hi> doth couch his corruption of Authors within the compasse of so few
lines, and with so great confusednesse and fraud, that it requires much time, paines, and paper
to open them so distinctly, as that they may appear to every mans eye. It was also necessary to
shew, what <hi>D. Potter</hi> omits in <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> and the importance of what is omitted, and
sometimes to set down the very words themselves that are omitted, all which could not but adde
to the quantity of my <hi>Reply.</hi> And as for the <hi>quality</hi> thereof, I desire thee (good Reader) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that whereas nothing is more necessary then books for answering of books: yet I was so ill
furnished in this kind, that I was forced to omit the examination of divers Authors cited by <hi>D.
Potter,</hi> meerely upon necessity; though I did very well perceive by most apparant circumstances,
that I must probably have been sure inough to find them plainly misalleadged, and much wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and for the few which are examined, there hath not wanted some difficulties to doe it. For
the times are not for all men alike; and <hi>D. Potter</hi> hath much advantage therein. But truth is
truth, and will ever be able to justify it self in the midst of all difficulties which may occurre. As
for me, when I alledge Protestant Writers as well domesticall as forraine, I willingly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
acknowledge my selfe obliged for divers of them to the author of the Book entituled, <hi>The
Protestants Apology for the Roman Church,</hi> who calls himselfe <hi>Iohn Brerely,</hi> whose care, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and fidelity is so extraordinary great, as that he doth not only cite the Bookes, but the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
also, with the place and time of their printing, yea and often the very page, and line where
the words are to be had. And if you happen not to finde what he cites, yet suspend your judgment,
till you have read the corrections placed at the end of his book; though it be also true, that after
all diligence and faithfulnesse on his behalfe, it was not in his power to amend all the faults of
the print: in which prints we have difficulty enough for many evident reasons, which must needs
occur to any prudent man.</p>
            <p>8. And for asmuch as concernes the manner of my <hi>Reply,</hi> I have procured to doe it without
all bitternesse, or gall of invective words, both for as much as may import either Protestants in
generall, or <hi>D. Potters</hi> person in particular; unles, for example, he will call it bitternesse for me
to terme a grosse impertinency, a <hi>sleight,</hi> or a <hi>corruption,</hi> by those very names, without which I
doe not know how to expresse the things: and yet therein I can truly affirme that I have studied
how to deliver them in the most moderate way, to the end I might give as little offence as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
I could, without betraying the Cause. And if any unfit phrase may peradventure have escaped
my pen (as I hope none hath) it was beside, and against my intention, though I must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that <hi>D. Potter</hi> gives so many and so just occasions of being round with him, as that perhaps
some will judge me to have been rather remisse, then moderate. But since in the very title of my
<hi>Reply</hi> I professe to <hi>maintaine Charity,</hi> I conceive that the excesse will be more excusable amongst
all kinds of men, if it fall to be in mildnesse, then if it had appeared in too much zeale. And if
<hi>D. Potter</hi> have a mind to charge me with ignorance or any thing of that nature, I can, and will
ease him of that labour, by acknowledging in my selfe as many and more personall defects, then
he can heap upon me.<note place="margin">Rules to be observed if <hi>D. Potter</hi> intend a Rejoynder.</note> Truth only and syncerity I so much valew and professe, as that he shall
never be able to prove the contrary in any one least passage or particle against me.</p>
            <p>9. In the third and last place, I have thought fit to expresse my selfe thus. If <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or
any other resolve to answere my <hi>Reply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I desire that he will observe some things which may tend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7615:19"/>
to his owne reputation, the saving of my unnecessary paines, and especially to the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of truth. I wish then that he would be carefull to consider, wherein the point of every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
consists, and not impertinently to shoot at Rovers, and affectedly mistake one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As for example, to what purpose (for as much as concernes the question betweene <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi>) doth he so often and seriously labour to proue, that faith is not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the authority of the Church, as into the formall <hi>Obiect</hi> and <hi>Motive</hi> thereof? Or that all
points of Faith are contained in Scripture? Or that the Church cannot make new Articles of
Faith? Or that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it signifies that particular Church or Diocesse, is not all one
with the universall Church? Or that the Pope as a private Doctor may erre? With many other
such points as will easily appeare in their proper places. It will also be necessary for him not to put
certaine Doctrines upon us, from which he knowes we disclaime as much as himselfe.</p>
            <p>10 I must in like manner intreat him not to recite my reasons and discourses by halfes, but
to set them down faithfully and entirely, for as much as in very deed concernes the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the thing in question; because the want sometime of one word, may chance to make
void, or lessen the force of the whole argument. And I am the more solicitous about giving this
particular caveat, because I finde how ill he hath complied with the promise which he made in his
Preface to the Reader, not to omit <hi>without answere any one thing of moment in all the discourse
of Charity Mistaken.</hi> Neither will this course be a cause that his <hi>Reioynder</hi> grow too large, but it
will be occasion of brevity to him, and free me also from the paines of setting downe all the words
which he omits, and himselfe of demonstrating that what he omitted was not materiall. Nay I
will assure him, that if he keep himselfe to the point of every difficulty, and not weary the Reader,
and overcharge his margent, with unnecessary quotations of Authors in Greek and Latin, and
sometime also in Italian and French, together with proverbs, sentences of Poets, and such gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
stuffe, nor affect to cite a multitude of our Catholique Schoole divines to no purpose at
all; his Book will not exceed a competent size, nor will any man in reason be offended with that
length which is regulated by necessity. Againe before he come to set downe his answere, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Arguments, let him consider very well what may be replied, and whether his own obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
may not be retorted against himselfe, as the Reader will perceiue to haue hapned often to
his disadvantage in my <hi>Reply</hi> against him. But especially I expect, and Truth it selfe exacts at his
hand, that he speak cleerly and distinctly, and not seek to walk in darknesse, so to delude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his Reader, now saying, and then denying, and alwaies speaking with such ambiguity, as that
his greatest care may seeme to consist in a certaine art to find a shift, as his occasions might chance,
either now, or heereafter to require, and as he might fall out to be urged by diversity of severall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
And to the end it may appear, that I deale plainely, as I would haue him also doe, I
desire that he declare himselfe concerning these points.</p>
            <p>11 First, whether our Saviour Christ haue not alwaies had, and be not ever to haue a visible
true Church on earth: and whether the contrary doctrine be not a damnable Heresy.</p>
            <p>12 Secondly, what visible Church there was before <hi>Luther,</hi> disagreeing from the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, and agreeing with the pretended Church of Protestants.</p>
            <p>13 Thirdly, Since he will be forced to grant that there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be assigned no visible true Church
of Christ, distinct from the Church of Rome, and such Churches as agreed with her when <hi>Luther</hi>
first appeared, whether it doe not follow that shee hath not erred fundamentally; because every
such errour destroies the nature and being of the Church, and so our Saviour Christ should haue
had no visible Church on earth.</p>
            <p>14 Fourthly, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did not fall into any fundamentall errour, let him tell us
how it can be <hi>damnable</hi> to liue in her Communion, or to maintaine errours, which are knowne
and confessed, not to be fundamentall, to <hi>damnable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15 Fiftly, if her Errours were not damnable, nor did exclude salvation, how can they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
from <hi>Schisme,</hi> who forsooke her Communion upon pretence of errours, which were not
damnable.</p>
            <p>16 Sixtly, if <hi>D. Potter</hi> haue a minde to say, that her Errours are damnable, or fundamentall,
let him doe us so much charity, as to tell us in particular what those fundamentall errours be. But
he must still remember (and my selfe must be excused, for repeating it) that if he say the Roman
Church erred fundamentally, he will not be able to shew, that Christ our Lord had any visible
Church on earth, when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared: and let him tell us how Protestants had, or can haue
any Church which was universall, and extended her selfe to all ages, if once he grant, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church ceased to be the true Church of Christ; and consequently how they can hope for
Salvation, if they deny it to us.</p>
            <p>17 Seaventhly, whether any one Errour maintained against any one Truth, though never so
small in it selfe, yet sufficiently propounded as testified or revealed by almighty God, doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Nature and Vnity of Faith, or at least is not a grievous offence excluding Salvation.</p>
            <p>18 Eightly, if this be so, how can <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists, Zuinglions,</hi> and all the rest of disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
Protestants, hope for salvation, since it is manifest that some of them must needs erre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some such truth as is testified by almighty God, either fundamentall, or at least not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.</p>
            <p>19 Ninthly, we constantly urge, and require to haue a particular Catalogue of such points as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7615:19"/>
he calls fundamentall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Catalogue, I say, in <hi>particular,</hi> and not only some generall definition, or
description, wherein Protestants may perhaps agree, though wee see that they differ when they
come to assigne what points in particular be fundamentall; and yet upon such a particular Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
much depends: as for example in particular, Whether or no a man doe not erre in some
point fundamentall or necessary to salvation; and whether or no <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> and the
rest doe disagree in fundamentalls, which if they doe, the same Heaven cannot receiue them all.</p>
            <p>20 Tenthly, and lastly, I desire that in answering to these points, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he would let us knowe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
what is the doctrine of the Protestant English Church concerning them, and what he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
only as his owne private opinion.</p>
            <p>21 These are the Questions which for the present I finde it fit and necessary for me to aske
of <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or any other who will defend his cause, or impugne ours. And it will be in vaine to
speake vainely, and to tell me, that a Foole may aske mere questions in an houre, then a wise man
can answer in a yeare; with such idle Proverbs as that. For I aske but such questions as for which
he giues occasion in his Book, and where he declares not himselfe but after so ambiguous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
a manner, as that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truth it selfe can scarce tell how to convince him so, but that with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and ill-judging men he will seeme to haue somewhat left to say for himselfe, though Papists
(as he calls them) and Puritans should presse him contrary waies at the same time: and these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
concerne things also of high importance, as whereupon the knowledge of Gods Church,
and true Religion, and consequently Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ation of the soule depends. And now because hee shall
not taxe me with being like those men in the Gospell, whom our blessed Lord and Saviour char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with laying heavy burdens upon other mens shoulders, who yet would not touch them with
their finger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I oblige my selfe to answer upon any demand of his, both to all these Questions, if
he finde that I haue not done it already, and to any other, concerning matter of faith that he shall
aske. And I will tell him very plainely, what is Catholique doctrine, and what is not, that is, what
is defined or what is not defined, and rests but in discussion among Divines.</p>
            <p>22 And it will be here expected, that he performe these things, as a man who professeth lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
should doe, not flying from questions which concerne things as they are considered in their
owne nature, to accidentall, or rare circumstances of ignorance, incapacity, want of meanes to be
instructed, erroneous conscience, and the like, which being very various and different, cannot bee
well comprehended under any generall Rule. But in delivering generall doctrines we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
things as they be <hi>ex natura rei, or per. se loquendo</hi> (as Divines speak) that is, according to
their natures, if all circumstances concu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re proportionable thereunto. As for example some may
for a time haue invincible ignorance, even of some fundamentall article of faith, through want of
capacity, instruction, or the like, and so not offend either in such ignorance or errour, and yet we
must absolutely say, that errour in any one fundamentall point is damnable, because so it is, if we
consider things in themselues, abstracting from accidentall circumstances in particular persons: as
contrarily if some man judge some act of vertue, or some indifferent action to be a sinne, in him it
is a sinne indeed, by reason of his erroneous conscience; and yet we ought not to say absolutely,
that vertuous, or indifferent actions are sinnes: and in all sciences we must distinguish the generall
Rules from their particular Exceptions. And therefore when, for example, he answers to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
whether he hold that Catholiques may be saved, or whether their pretended errours be
fundamentall and damnable, he is not to change the state of the question, and haue recourse to
Ignorance, and the like, but to answer concerning the errours being considered what they are apt
to be in themselues, and as they are neither increased nor diminished, by accidental circumstances.</p>
            <p>23 And the like I say of all the other points, to which I once againe desire an answere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any of these, or the like ambiguous termes, <hi>in some sort, in some sense, in some degree,</hi> which
may be explicated afterward as strictly or largely as may best serue his turne; but let him tell vs
roundly and particularly, in what sort, in what sense, in what degree he understands those, &amp; the
like obscure mincing phrases. If he proceed solidly after this manner, and not by way of meere
words, more like a Preacher to a vulgar Auditor, then like a learned man with a pen in his hand,
thy patience shall be the lesse abused, and truth will also receiue more right. And since we haue
already laid the grounds of the question, much may be said hereafter in few, words, if (as I said)
he keep close to the reall point of every difficulty without wandring into impertinent disputes,
multiplying vulgar and threed-bare objections and arguments, or labouring to prove what no
man denies, or making a vaine oftentation by citing a number of Schoolemen, which every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uny
brought up in Schooles is able to doe; and if he cite his Authors with such sincerity, as no time
need be spent in opening his corruptions, and finally if he set himselfe a worke with this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we are to giue a most strict accompt to a most just, and unpartiall Iudge, of every period,
line, and word that passeth under our pen. For if at the latter day we shall be arraigned for every
idle word which is spoken, so much more will that be done for every idle word which is written,
as the deliberation wherewith it passeth makes a man guilty of more malice, and as the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the matter which is treated of in bookes concerning true faith and religion, without
which no Soule can be saved, makes a mans Errours more materiall, then they would be, if questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were but of toyes.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the First, and Second.</hi> If beginings be omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
(as they say they are,) <hi>D. Potter</hi> hath cause
to look for great store of uningenuous dealing
from you; the very first words you speak of him
<hi>vz. That he hath not so much as once truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
fallen upon the point in question,</hi> being a most
unjust and immodest imputation.</p>
            <p>2 For first, the point in question, was not, that
which you pretend, <hi>Whether both Papists and Protestants can be saved
in their severall Professions?</hi> But, <hi>Whether you may without uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
affirme that Protestancy unrepented destroyes Salvation?</hi> And
that this is the very question is most apparent and unquestionable,
both from the title of <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> and from the Arguments of
the three first Chapters of it, and from the title of your own Reply.
And therefore if <hi>D. Potter</hi> had joyned issue with his Adversary only
thus farre, and not medling at all with <hi>Papists,</hi> but leaving them to
<hi>stand or fall to their own master,</hi> had prou'd <hi>Protestants</hi> living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so <hi>capable of Salvation,</hi> I cannot see how it could justly be charged
upon him, that he <hi>had not once truly and really fallen upon the point in
Question.</hi> Neither may it be said that your Question here and mine,
are in effect the same, seeing it is very possible that the true Answere
to the one might have been Affirmative, and to the other Negative.
For there is no incongruity but it may be true <hi>That You and We cannot
both be saved:</hi> And yet as true, <hi>That without uncharitablenesse you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pronounce us damned.</hi> For all ungrounded and unwarrantable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing
mento damnation, is either in a propriety of speech unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
or else (which for my purpose is all one,) it is that which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
mean, when they say, Papists for damning them are uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And therefore though the <hi>Author of C. M.</hi> had prov'd as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he hath done weakly, <hi>that one Heaven could not receive Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
and Papists both,</hi> yet certainly, it was very hastily and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably,
&amp; therefore uncharitably concluded, that Protestants were
the part that was to be excluded. As, though Iewes and Christians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
both be saved, yet a Iew cannot justly, and therefore not chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
pronounce a Christian damned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:7615:20"/>
3 But then secondly, to shew your dealing with him very injurious;
I say he doth speak to this very Question very largely, and very effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually;
as by confronting his worke and <hi>Charity Mist.</hi> together, will
presently appear. <hi>Charity M.</hi> proves you say in generall, <hi>That there
is but one Church. D. Potter</hi> tels him, <hi>His labour is lost in proving the
unity of the Catholique Church, whereof there is no doubt or controversy:</hi>
&amp; herein I hope you will grant he answeres right &amp; to the purpose. <hi>C.
M.</hi> proves (you say) secondly, <hi>That all Christians are obliged to harken
to the Church. D. Potter</hi> answeres, <hi>It is true: yet not absolutely in all
things, but only when she commands those things which God doth not
countermand.</hi> And this also I hope is to his purpose, though not to
yours. <hi>C. M.</hi> proves, you say thirdly, <hi>That the Church must be ever
visible and infallible.</hi> For her <hi>Visibility, D. Potter</hi> denyes it not; and as
for her <hi>Infallibility,</hi> he grants it in <hi>Fundamentalls</hi> but <hi>not in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures.</hi>
C. M. proves you say fourthly, <hi>That to separate ones selfe
from the Churches Communion, is schisme. D. Potter</hi> grants it, with this
exception, <hi>unlesse there be necessary cause to doe so;</hi> unlesse the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her Communion be apparently unlawfull. C. M. proves, you
say lastly, <hi>That to dissent from her doctrine is heresy, though it be in
points never so few, and never so small, and therefore that the distinction
of points fundamentall and unfundamentall, as it is applyed by Protestants
is wholy vaine.</hi> This D. <hi>Potter</hi> denyes, shewes the Reasons, brought
for it, weak and unconcluding; proves the contrary by reasons unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable:
and therefore that <hi>The distinction of points into fundamentall
and not fundamentall, as it is applied by Protestants, is very good.</hi> Vpon
these grounds you say, C. M. cleerely evinces <hi>That any least difference
in faith cannot stand with salvation, and therefore seeing Catholiques
and Protestants disagree in very many points of faith, they both cannot
hope to be saved without Repentance,</hi> you must mean, without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
and particular repentance, and dereliction of their errors; for so
C. M. hath declared himselfe p. 14. where he hath these words, <hi>We
may safely say that a man who lives in Protestancy, and who is so farre
from Repenting it, as that he will not so much as acknowledge it to be a
sinne, though he be sufficiently enform'd thereof, &amp;c.</hi> From whence it is
evident, that in his judgement there can be no repentance of an errour,
without acknowledging it to be a sinne: And to this <hi>D. Potter</hi> justly
opposes: <hi>That both sides, by the confession of both sides, agree in more
points then are simply and indispensably necessary to Salvation, and differ
only in such as are not precisely necessary: That it is very possible, a man
may dye in errour, and yet dye with Repentance, as for all his sinnes of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so in that number, for the errours in which he dies: with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
though not explicite and particular which is not simply requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet implicite and generall which is sufficient: so that he cannot but
hope considering the goodnesse of God, that the truth's retained on both
sides, especially those of the necessity of repentance from dead workes and
faith in Iesus Christ, if they be put in practise, may be an antidote against
the errors held on either side; to such he meanes, &amp; saies, as being diligent
in seeking truth, and desirous to find it, yet misse of it through humane
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7615:21"/>
frailty and dye in errour.</hi> If you will but attentively consider &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the undertaking of C. M. and D. <hi>Potters</hi> performance in all these
points, I hope you will be so ingenuous as to acknowledge, that you
have injurd him much in imputing tergiversation to him, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that <hi>through his whole book he hath not once truly and really fallen
upon the point in Question.</hi> Neither may you or C. M. conclude him
from hence (as covertly you doe,) <hi>An enemy to soules by deceiving them
with ungrounded false hopes of Salvation;</hi> seeing the hope of salvation
cannot be ungrounded, which requires and supposes beliefe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of all things absolutely necessary unto salvation, and repentance
of those sinnes and errours which we fall into by humane frailty: Nor
a <hi>friend to indifferency in Religions,</hi> seeing he gives them only hope
of pardon of Errors who are desirous, and according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their opportunities and abilities industrious to find the truth, or
at least truly repentant, that they have not been so. Which doctrine
is very fit to excite men to a constant and impartiall search of truth,
and very farre from teaching them that it is indifferent what Religion
they are of, and without all controversy very honourable to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, with which how it can consist, not to be satisfied with
his servants true endeavours to know his will and doe it, without full
and exact performance, I leave it to you and all good men to judge.</p>
            <p>4 As little Iustice me thinkes you shew, in quarrelling with him for
descending to the particular disputes here mentioned by you. For to
say nothing that many of these Questions are immediatly and directly
pertinent to the businesse in hand, as the 1. 2. 3. 5. 6. and all of them
fall in of themselves into the stream of his discourse, and are not
drawn in by him, and besides are touched for the most part, rather
then handled; to say nothing of all this, you know right well, if he
conclude you erroneous in any one of all these, be it but in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in one kind,</hi> or the <hi>Language of your service;</hi> the infallibility of
your Church is evidently overthrown: And this being done, I hope
there will be <hi>no such necessity of hearkning to her in all things: It will be
very possible to seperate from her communion in some things, without
schisme, and from her doctrine so farre as it is erroneous without here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy:
Then all that she proposes will not be, eo ipso, fundamentall, because
shee proposes it:</hi> and so presently all <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> will vanish into
smoak, and clouds and nothing.</p>
            <p>5 You say <hi>he was loath to affirme plainly, that generally both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
&amp; Protestants may be saved:</hi> which yet is manifest he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
plainly, of Protestants throughout his book; &amp; of erring Papists
that have <hi>syncerely sought the Truth and failed of it, and dye with a
generall repentance:</hi> p. 77. 78. And yet you deceive your selfe if you
conceive he had any other necessity to doe so, but only that he thought
it true. For we may and doe pretend that before <hi>Luther there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
true Churches, besides the Roman,</hi> which agreed not with her: in
particular, <hi>The greek Church.</hi> So that what you say is evidently true,
is indeed evidently false. Besides if he had had any necessity to make
use of you in this matter, he needed not for this end to say that now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7615:21"/>
in your Church Salvation may be had; but onely that before <hi>Luthers</hi>
time it might be: Then when your meanes of knowing the Truth were
not so great, and when your ignorance might be more invincible, and
therefore more excusable. So that you may see if you please, it is not
for ends, but for the loue of truth, that we are thus charitable to you.</p>
            <p>6 Neither is it materiall that these particulars he speakes against, are
not <hi>fundamentall errours;</hi> for though they be not <hi>destructiue of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
yet the convincing of them, may be, and is <hi>destructiue enough of his
Adversaries assertion:</hi> and if you be the man I take you for, you will
not deny they are so. For certainly no Consequence can be more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
then this; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth erre in this or that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not infallible. And this perhaps you perceiu'd your selfe; &amp;
therefore demanded not, <hi>Since they be not fundamentall, what imports
it whether we hold them or no, simply:</hi> But, <hi>for as much as concernes our
possibility to be saved.</hi> As if we were not bound by the loue of God &amp;
the loue of truth to be zealous in the defence of all Truths, that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way profitable, though not simply necessary to salvation. Or as if
any good man could satisfie his conscience without being so affected
and resolv'd. Our Saviour himselfe having assur'd us,<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 19.</note> That <hi>hee that
shall breake one of his least Commandements</hi> (some whereof you
pretend are concerning veniall sinnes, and consequently the keeping of
them not necessary to salvation) <hi>and shall so teach men, shall be called the
least in the kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 But then it imports very much, though not for the <hi>possibilitie that
you may be saved,</hi> yet for the <hi>probabilitie that you will be so:</hi> because the
holding of these errours, though it did not <hi>merit,</hi> might yet <hi>occasion</hi>
damnation. As the doctrine of Indulgences may take away the feare
of Purgatory, and the doctrine of Purgatorie the feare of Hell; as you
well knowe it does too frequently. So that though a godly man might
be saved <hi>with these</hi> errours, yet <hi>by meanes of them,</hi> many are made vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and so damn'd. <hi>By them</hi> I say, though <hi>not for them.</hi> No godly Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who is verily perswaded that there is neither impietie nor super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
in the use of your Latine service, shall be damn'd, I hope, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
present at it; yet the want of that devotion which the frequent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Offices understood, might happily beget in them, the want of
that instruction and edification which it might afford them, may very
probably hinder the salvation of many which otherwise might haue
been saved. Besides, though the matter of an Errour may bee onely
something profitable, not necessary, yet the neglect of it may be a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
sinne. As not to regard veniall sinnes is in the doctrine of your
Schooles, mortall. Lastly, as veniall sinnes, you say, dispose men to
mortall; so the erring from some profitable, though lesser truth, may
dispose a man to errour in greater matters. As for example: The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife
of the Popes infallibility is, I hope, not unpardonably damnable
to every one that holds it; yet if it be a falsehood (as most certainely
it is) it puts a man into a very congruous disposition to beleiue <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
if he should chance to get into that See.</p>
            <p>8 To the Third. <hi>In his distinctions of points fundamentall and not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7615:22"/>
he may seeme, you say, to haue touched the point, but does not so
indeed. Because though he saies there are some points so fundamentall, as
that all are oblig'd to belieue them explicitely, yet he tells you not, whether
a man may disbeleiue any other points of faith, which are sufficiently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his understanding, as Truths revealed by Almighty God.</hi> Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
which matter of <hi>Sufficient Proposall,</hi> I beseech you to come out
of the Clouds, and tell us roundly and plainely, what you meane by
<hi>Points of faith sufficiently propounded to a mans understanding, as Truths
revealed by God.</hi> Perhaps you meane such, as the person to whom they
are propos'd, understands sufficiently to be truths revealed by God.
But how then can he possibly choose but belieue them? Or how is it
not an apparent contradiction, that a man should disbelieue what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
understands to be a Truth; or any Christian what he understands
or but belieues to be testified by God? D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Potter</hi> might well thinke it
superfluous to tell you <hi>This is damnable;</hi> because indeed it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And yet one may very well think, by your saying, as you doe
hereafter, <hi>That the impietie of heresie consists in calling Gods truth in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi>
that this should be your meaning. Or doe you esteeme all those
things <hi>sufficiently presented to his understanding as Divine truths,</hi> which
by you, or any other man, or any company of men whatsoever, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to him to be so? I hope you will not say so: For this were to
oblige a man to belieue all the Churches, and all the men in the world,
whensoever they pretend to propose divine Revelations. <hi>D. Potter,</hi> I
assure you from him, would never haue told you this neither. Or doe
you meane by <hi>sufficiently propounded as Divine Truths,</hi> all that your
Church propounds for such? That you may not neither; For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
betweene us is this; <hi>Whether your Churches Proposition be a
sufficient Proposition?</hi> And therefore to suppose this, is to suppose the
question; which you knowe in Reasoning is alwaies a fault. Or Lastly,
doe you mean (for I knowe not else what possibly you can meane,) by
<hi>sufficiently presented to his vnderstanding as revealed by God;</hi> that which
all things considered, is so propos'd to him, that he might and should
and would belieue it to be true and revealed by God, were it not for
some voluntary and avoidable fault of his owne that interposeth it
selfe betweene his understanding and the truth presented to it? This is
the best construction that I can make of your words; and if you speake
of truths thus propos'd, and rejected, let it be as damnable, as you
please, to deny or disbelieue them. But then I cannot but be amaz'd
to heare you say, That <hi>D. Potter never tells you whether there be any
other points of faith, besides those which we are bound to belieue explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which a man may deny or disbelieue, though they be sufficiently presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his understanding as truths revealed or testified by Almighty God;</hi>
seeing the light it selfe is not more cleare then <hi>D. Potters</hi> Declaration

beginning his discourse thus. <q>It seemes fundamentall to the
faith, and for the salvation of every member of the Church, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and belieue all such points of faith, as whereof he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7615:22"/>
that they belong to the doctrine of Iesus Christ.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this conviction he requires three things. <q>Cleare Revelation; Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Proposition, and Capacity &amp; understanding in the hearer. For want
of cleare Revelation, he frees the Church before Christ &amp; the Disciples of
Christ from any damnable errour, though they believed not those things
which he that should now deny were no Christian. To sufficient Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
he requires two things. 1. That the points be perspicuously laid open
in themselues. 2. So forcibly, as may serue to remoue reasonable doubts to
the contrary, and to satisfie a teachable minde concerning it, against the
principles in which he hath been bred to the contrary. This Proposition
he saies is not limited to the Pope or Church, but extended to all meanes
whatsoever, by which a man may be convinced in conscience, that the
matter proposed is divine Revelation; which he professes to be done suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
not only when his conscience doth expresly beare witnesse to the
truth; but when it would doe so, if it were not choaked, and blinded by
some unruly and unmortified lust in the will. The difference being not
great between him that is wilfully blind, &amp; him that knowingly gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saieth
the Truth. The third thing he requires is Capacity and Abilitie
to apprehend the Proposall, and the Reasons of it: the want whereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth
fooles and madmen, &amp;c. But where there is no such impediment,
and the will of God is sufficiently propounded, there <hi>(saith hee)</hi> hee that
opposeth is convinced of errour; and he who is thus convinced is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique:
and heresie is a work of the Flesh which excludeth from salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>(he meanes without Repentance,)</hi> And hence it followeth, that it
is fundamentall to a Christians faith, and necessary for his salvation,
that he belieue all revealed truths of God, whereof he may be convinced
that they are from God.</q> This is the Conclusion of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Potters</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
many passages whereof you take notice of in your subsequent
disputations, and make your advantage of them. And therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but say againe, that it amazeth me to heare you say, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
this Question and never tells you <hi>whether or no there bee any
other points of faith, which being sufficiently propounded as divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
may be denied and disbelieved.</hi> Hee tells you plainely there are
none such: and therefore you cannot say, that he tels you not whether
there be any such. Againe, it is almost as strange to mee, why you
should say, this was the only thing in question, <hi>Whether a man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or disbelieue any point of faith, sufficiently presented to his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as a truth revealed by God.</hi> For to say that any thing is a thing in
question, me thinks at the first hearing of the words, imports, that it is
by some affirm'd, and deni'd by others. Now you affirme I grant, but
what Protestant ever denied, that it was a sinne to giue God the lye?
Which is the first and most obvious sense of these words. Or which
of them ever doubted, that to disbelieue is then a fault, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is so proposed to a man, that he might and should, and were it not
for his owne fault, would beleiue it? Certainly he that questions either
of these, justly deserues to haue his wits call'd in question. Produce
any one Protestant that ever did so, and I will giue you leaue to say it
is the only thing in question. But then I must tell you, that your ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7615:23"/>
Argument, viz: <hi>To deny a truth witnessed by God is damnable, But
of two that disagree one must of necessity deny some such truth, Therefore
one only can be saved;</hi> is built upon a ground cleane different from this
postulate. For though it be alwaies a fault to deny what either I doe
know, or should knowe to be testified by God; yet that which by a
cleanly conveyance you put in the place hereof, <hi>To deny a truth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
by God</hi> simply, without the circumstance of <hi>being knowne or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proposed,</hi> is so farre from being certainely damnable, that it
may be many times done without any the least fault at all. As if God
should testifie something to a man in the <hi>Indies,</hi> I that had no assurance
of this testification should not be oblig'd to beleiue it. For in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Rule of the Law has place, <hi>Idem est non esse &amp; non apparere:</hi>
not to be at all and not to appeare to me, is to me all one. <hi>If I had not
come and spoken unto you</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>you had had no sinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10 As little necessitie is there for that which followes: <hi>That of two dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
in a matter of faith one must deny some such truth.</hi> Whether by
[such] you understand, <hi>Testified at all by God;</hi> or <hi>testified and sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propounded.</hi> For it is very possible the matter in controversie may be
such a thing wherein God hath not at all declare himselfe, or not so
fully and clearely as to oblige all men to hold one way; and yet be so
overvalued by the parties in variance, as to bee esteemed a matter <hi>of
faith,</hi> and one of those things of which our Saviour saies; <hi>He that belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not shall be damn'd.</hi> Who sees not that it is possible two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
may excommunicate and damne each other for keeping Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse
tenne daies sooner or later; as well as <hi>Victor</hi> excommunicated
the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> for differing from him about Easter day? And
yet I beleiue you will confesse, that God had not then declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
about Easter; nor hath now about Christmasse. Anciently some
good Catholique Bishops excommunicated and damned others for
<hi>holding there were Antipodes:</hi> and in this question I would faine know
on which side was the sufficient proposall. <hi>The contra-Remonstrants</hi>
differ from the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> about the point of predetermination as a
matter of faith: I would knowe in this thing also, which way God
hath declar'd himselfe; whether for Predetermination or against it.
<hi>Stephen Bishop of Rome</hi> held it as a matter of faith &amp; Apostolique tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>That Heretiques gaue true Baptisme:</hi> Others there were, and they
as good Catholiques as hee, that held that this was neither matter of
<hi>Faith</hi> nor matter of <hi>Truth. Iustin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> held the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> as a matter of <hi>faith:</hi> and though <hi>Iustin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
deny it, yet you, I hope, will affirme, that some good Christians
held the contrary. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustine,</hi> I am sure, held <hi>the communicating of
Infants</hi> as much Apostolique tradition, as the Baptising of them: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Bishop and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of his time, held so too, or
held otherwise, I desire you to determine. But, sure I am, the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> at this present holds the contrary. The same S. <hi>Austin</hi> held it
no matter of faith that the <hi>Bishops of Rome were Iudges of Appeales</hi>
from all parts of the Church Catholique, no not in <hi>Major causes and
Major Persons:</hi> whether the Bishop or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did then hold
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7615:23"/>
the contrary doe you resolve me; but now I am resolv'd they doe so.
In all these differences, the point in question is esteem'd and propos'd
by one side at least as a matter of <hi>faith,</hi> and by the other rejected as not
so: and either this is to disagree in matters of faith, or you will have
no meanes to shew that we doe disagree. Now then to shew you how
weak and sandy the foundation is, on which the whole fabrick both
of your Book and Church depends, answer mee briefly to this <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
Eyther in these oppositions one of the opposite Parts err'd dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
and denyed Gods truth sufficiently propounded, or they did
not. If they did, then they which doe deny Gods truth sufficiently
propounded may goe to heaven; and then you are rash and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in excluding us, though we were guilty of this fault. If not, then
there is no such necessity, that of two disagreeing about a matter of
faith, one should deny Gods truth sufficiently propounded. And so
the Major and Minor of your Argument, are prov'd false. Yet, though
they were as true as Gospell, and as evident as Mathematicall Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
the conclusion (so impertinent is it to the Premises) might still
be false. For that which naturally issues from these propositions is not.
<hi>Therefore one only can be saved:</hi> But, <hi>Therefore one of them does some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is damnable.</hi> But with what Logick or what Charity you
can inferre either as the immediat production of the former premises,
or as a Corollary from this conclusion, Therefore <hi>one only can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
I doe not understand; unlesse you will pretend that this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is good, such a one doth something damnable, therefore he
shall certainly be damned: which whether it be not to overthrow the
Article of our Faith, which promises remission of sinnes upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and consequently to ruine the Gospell of Christ, I leave it to
the Pope and the Cardinalls to determine. For if against this it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged,
that no man can repent of the sinne wherein he dies: This
muche I have already stopped, by shewing that if it be a sinne of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
this is no way incongruous.</p>
            <p>11 <hi>To the fourth.</hi> You proceed in sleighting and disgracing your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
<hi>Pretending his objections are mean and vulgar, and such as have
been answered a thousand times.</hi> But if your cause were good, these Arts
would be needlesse. For though some of his objections have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Seeing in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient Catholiques, we tolerate extenuate &amp; excuse very many errors, and devising some shift of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deny the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and put upon them a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient sense when they are objected to us in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and conflicts with our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; we see no reason why <hi>Bertram</hi> may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same equity.</note> that make a profession of devising shifts and evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to save themselves and their Religion from the pressure of truth,
by men that are resolv'd they will say something, though they can say
nothing to purpose; yet I doubt not to make it appear, that neither by
others have they beene truly and really satisfied; and that the best An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
you give them, is to call them <hi>Mean and vulgar objections.</hi>

Reply is in <hi>Paulus Veridicus,</hi> and so your paines also might well have
been spared. But had there been no necessity to help and peece out
your confuting his Arguments with disgracing his person, (which yet
you cannot doe) you would have considered, that to them who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

D. <hi>Potters</hi> Book, &amp; the Arch-Bishops Sermon, this aspersion will
presently appear a poore detraction, not to be answered but scorn'd.
To say nothing that in D. <hi>Potter,</hi> being to answere a book by expresse
Command from Royall Authority, to leave any thing materiall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
because it had been said before, especially being spoken at large,
and without any relation to the Discourse which he was to Answere,
had been a ridiculous vanity and foule prevarication.</p>
            <p>13 <hi>To the sixt.</hi> In your sixt <hi>parag.</hi> I let all passe saving only this, <hi>That
a perswasion that men of different Religions</hi> (you must mean, or else you
speak not to the point, Christians of divers Opinions and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
<hi>may be saved, is a most pernitious heresy, and even a ground of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme.</hi>
What strange extractions Chymistry can make I know not;
but sure I am, he that by reason would inferre this conclusion, <hi>That
there is no God;</hi> from this ground, <hi>That God will save men in different
Religions,</hi> must have a higher strain in Logick, then you or I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
made shew of. In my apprehension, the other part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
<hi>That there is a God,</hi> should much rather follow from it. And
whether contradictions will flow from the same fountaine, let the
Learned judge. Perhaps you will say you intended not to deliver here
a positive and measur'd truth, and which you expected to be call'd to
account for; but only a high and tragicall expression of your just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of the wicked doctrine against which you write. If you mean
so, I shall let it passe: only I am to advertize the lesse-wary Reader,
that passionate expressions, and vehement asseverations are no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
unlesse it be, of the weaknesse of the cause that is defended by
them, or the man that defends it. And to remember you of what <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi>
saies of some such things as these, <hi>—Nubila mens est haec ubi
regnant.</hi> For my part I am not now in Passion; neither will I speak
one word which I think I cannot justify to the full: and I say and will
maintaine, that to say, <hi>That Christians of different Opinions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions
(such I mean, who hold all those things that are simply necessary
to Salvation) may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> obtain pardon for the Errours wherein they dye ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly,
by a generall Repentance; is so farre from being a ground of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme,
that to say the contrary, is to crosse in Diameter a main Article
of our Creed, and to overthrow the Gospell of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14 <hi>To the Seaventh and Eight.</hi> To the two next Paragraphes, I have
but two words to say. The one is, that I know no Protestants that <hi>hold
it necessary to be able to prove a Perpetuall Visible Church distinct from
Yours.</hi> Some perhaps undertake to doe so, as a matter of curtesy; but
I believe you will be much to seeke for any one that holds it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For though you say that Christ hath promised there shall be a
Perpetuall Visible Church; yet you yourselves doe not pretend that
he hath promised there shall be Histories and Records alwaies extant
of the Professors of it in all ages: nor that he hath any where enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us to read those Histories that we may be able to shew them.</p>
            <p>14 The other is. That <hi>Breerelie's</hi> great exactnesse, which you mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
so and amplify, is no very certaine demonstration of his fidelity.
A Romance may be told with as much variety of circumstances, as a
true Story.</p>
            <p>

16 <hi>To the Ninth and Tenth.</hi> Your desires that I would in this rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<hi>Avoid impertinencies. Not impose doctrines upon you which you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme:
Set down the substance of your Reasons faithfully and entirely: Not
weary the reader with unnecessary quotations: Object nothing to you
which I can answere my selfe, or which may be return'd upon my selfe: and
lastly, (which you repeat again in the end of your Preface) speak as cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and distinctly and univocally as possibly I can,</hi> are all very reasonable,
and shall be by me most punctually and fully satisfied. Only I have
Reason to complain, that you give us rules only and not good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in keeping them. For in some of these things I shall have frequent
occasion to shew, that <hi>Medice curateipsum,</hi> may very justly be said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you; especially for objecting what might very easily have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by you, and may be very justly returned upon you.</p>
            <p>17 To your ensuing demands, though some of them be very cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and ensnaring; yet I will give you as clear and plain and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Answers as possibly I can.</p>
            <p>18 <hi>To the Eleventh.</hi> To the first then, about <hi>the Perpetuity of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church,</hi> my Answer is: That I believe our Saviour, ever since his
Ascention, hath had in some place or other a Visible true Church on
earth: I mean a company of men, that professed at least so much truth
as was absolutely necessary for their Salvation. And I believe that
there will be somewhere or other such a Church to the Worlds end.
But the contrary doctrine I doe at no hand believe to be a damnable
heresy.</p>
            <p>19 <hi>To the twelfth.</hi> To the second, what <hi>Visible Church there was before
Luther disagreeing from the Roman?</hi> I answere, that before <hi>Luther</hi> there
were many Visible Churches in many things disagreeing from the
Roman: But not that the whole Catholique Church disagreed from
her, because she her selfe was a Part of the Whole, though much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
And to undertake to name a Catholique Church disagreeing
from her, is to make her no Part of it, which we doe not, nor need not
pretend. And <hi>for men agreeing with Protestants in all points,</hi> wee will
then produce them, when you shall either prove it necessary to be
done, which you know we absolutely deny; or when you shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a perpetuall succession of Professors, which in all points have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
with you, and disagreed from you in nothing. But this my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
to deal plainly with you, I conceive, &amp; so intended it to be very
like his, who undertook to drink up the Sea, upon condition, that he,
to whom the promise was made, should first stop the Rivers from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in. For this unreasonable request which you make to us is to your
selves so impossible, that in the very next Age after the Apostles, you
will never be able to name a man, whom you can prove to have agreed
with you in all things, nay (if you speak of such, whose Works are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and unquestioned) whom we cannot prove to have disagreed
from you in many things. Which I am so certain of, that I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my credit, and my life upon it.</p>
            <p>20 <hi>To the Thirteenth.</hi> To the third, <hi>Whether, seeing there cannot be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
any visible true Church distinct from the Roman, it followes not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7615:25"/>
that she err'd not fundamentally.</hi> I say in our sence of the word <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi>
it does follow. For if it be true, that there was then no
Church distinct from the Roman, then it must be, either because
there was no Church at all, which we deny: Or because the Roman
Church was the whole Church, which we also deny: or because she
was a Part of the Whole, which we grant. And if she were a true part of
the Church, then she retained those truths which were simply neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation, and held no errours which were inevitably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonably
destructive of it. For this is precisely necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
any man or any Church a member of the Church Catholique.
In our sence therefore of the word <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> I hope shee erred
not fundamentally: but in your sence of the word, I fear she did. That
is, she held something to be Divine Revelation, which was not; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
not to be which was.</p>
            <p>21 <hi>To the fourteenth.</hi> To the fourth. <hi>How it could be damnable to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
her errors, if they were not fundamentall?</hi> I answere. 1. Though
it were not damnable, yet if it were a fault, it was not to be done. For
a veniall sinne, with you is not damnable; yet you say, it is not to be
committed for the procuring any good. <hi>Non est faciendum malum
vel minimum, ut eveniat bonum vel maximum.</hi> 2. It is damnable to
mantaine an error against conscience, though the errour in it selfe, and
to him that believes it, be not damnable. Nay the profession not only
of an errour, but even of a truth, if not believ'd, when you think on it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I believe you will confesse to be a mortall sinne; unlesse you will
say, Hypocrisie and Simulation in Religion is not so. 3. Though we
say the errors of the Roman Church were not destructive of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but pardonable even to them that dyed in them, upon a generall
repentance: yet we deny not but in <hi>themselves they were damnable.</hi>
Nay, the very saying they were pardonable, implies they needed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and therefore in themselves were damnable: damnable <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,</hi>
though not <hi>effectually.</hi> As a poyson may be deadly in it selfe, and
yet not kill him, that together with the poyson takes an antidote: or
as felony may deserve death and yet not bring it on him that obtaines
the Kings pardon.</p>
            <p>22 <hi>To the fifteenth.</hi> To the fift. <hi>How they can be excus'd from Schisme,
who forsook her Communion upon pretence of errours which were not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable!</hi>
I answere. All that we forfake in you, is only the beliefe, and
practice, and profession of your Errors. Hereupon, you cast us out of
your Communion. And then with a strange, and contradictious, and
ridiculous hypocrisy, complain that we forsake it. As if a man should
thrust his friend out of doores, and then be offended at his departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But for us not to forsake the beliefe of your Errors, having discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them to be Errors, was impossible; and therefore to doe so could
not be damnable, believing them to be Errors. Not to forsake the
practice and profession of them, had been damnable hypocrisie; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that (which you vainly runne away with, and take for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
those errors in themselves were not damnable. Now to doe so,
and as matters now stand, not to forsake your Communion, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7615:25"/>
contradictious: seeing the condition of your Communion is,
that we must professe to believe all your doctrines not only not to be
damnable errors (which will not content you,) but also to be certain
and necessary and revealed truths. So that to demand why we forsake
your Communion upon pretence of Errors which were not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is in effect to demand why we forsooke it upon our forsaking it!
For to pretend that there are Errors in your Church though not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
is <hi>ipso facto</hi> to forsake your Communion, and to doe that which
both in your account, and as you think in Gods account, puts him
as does so, out of your Communion. So that either you must free your
Church, from requiring the belief of any errour whatsoever, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and not damnable, or whether you will or no you must free us
from Schisme. For schisme there cannot be in leaving your commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
unlesse we were obliged to continue in it. Man cannot be obliged
by Man, but to what either formally or virtually he is obliged by God,
for all just power is from God. God the eternall truth neither can nor
will obliege us to believe any the least and the most innocent falshood
to be a divine truth, that is, to erre; nor, to professe a known errour,
which is to lye. So that if you require the belief of any errour among
the conditions of your Communion, our obligation to communicate
with you ceaseth, and so the imputation of schisme to us, vanisheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nothing: but lies heavy upon you for making our seperation from
you just and necessary, by requiring unnecessary and unlawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of your Communion. Hereafter therefore, I intreat you, let
not your demand be, how could we forsake your Communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Schisme, seeing you err'd not damnably? But how we could doe
so without Schisme, seeing you err'd not at all? which if either you
doe prove, or we cannot disprove it, we will (I at least will for my
part) returne to your Communion, or subscribe my selfe Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.

answeres to the <hi>Second</hi> and the <hi>Fourth:</hi> and in my reply, <hi>Ad</hi> § 2. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the end. And though you say <hi>your repeating must be excused,</hi>
yet I dare not be so confident, and therefore forbear it.</p>
            <p>25 <hi>To the seaventeenth.</hi> To the seaventh, <hi>Whether errour against any
one truth sufficiently propounded as testified by God, destroy not the
Nature and Vnity of Faith, or at least, is not a grievous offence exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
salvation!</hi> I answere, if you suppose, as you seem to doe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
so sufficient, that the party to whom it is made is convinc'd
that it is from God, so that the denyall of it involves also with it the
denyall of Gods veracity; any such errour destroyes both faith and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7615:26"/>
salvation. But if the Proposall be only so sufficient, not, that the party
to whom it is made is convinc'd, but only that he should, and but for
his own fault would have been convinc'd of the divine verity of the
doctrine proposed: The crime then is not so great, for the beliefe
of Gods veracity may well consist with such an Errour. Yet a fault I
confesse it is (and without Repentance) damnable, if all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
considered the proposall be sufficient. But then I must tell you
that the proposall of the present Roman Church is only pretended to
be sufficient for this purpose, but is not so: especially all the Rayes of
the Divinity, which they pretend to shine so conspicuously in her
proposalls, being so darkned and even extinguished with a cloud of
contradiction, from Scripture, Reason, and the Ancient Church.</p>
            <p>26 <hi>To the Eighteenth.</hi> To the eight. <hi>How of disagreeing Protestants, both
parts may hope for salvation, seeing some of them must needs erre against
some Truth testified by God?</hi> I answere, 1. The most disagreeing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
that are, yet thus farre agree, that these books of Scripture
which were never doubted of in the Church, are the undoubted word
of God, and a perfect rule of faith. 2. That the sense of them, which
God intended, whatsoever it is, is certainly true. So that they believe
implicitely even those very truths against which they erre; and why
an implicit faith in Christ and his Word, should not suffice as well as
an implicit faith in your Church, I have desired to be resolved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your Side, but never could. 3. That they are to use their best
endeavours to beleive the Scripture in the true sense and to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to it. This if they performe (as I hope many on all Sides doe)
truly and syncerely, it is impossible but that they should believe aright
in all things necessary to salvation; that is, in all those things which
appertain to the Covenant between God and man in Christ, for so
much, is not only plainly but frequently contained in Scripture. And
believing aright touching the Covenant, if they for their parts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the condition required of them, which is syncere obedience, why
should they not expect that God will performe his promise and give
them salvation? For, as for other things which lye without the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and are therefore lesse necessary, if by reason of the seeming
conflict which is oftentimes between Scripture and Reason, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
on the one side, and Scripture, Reason, and Authority on the
other; if by reason of the variety of tempers, abilities, educations,
&amp; unavoidable prejudices, whereby mens understandings are various<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
form'd and fashion'd, they doe embrace severall Opinions, whereof
some must be erroneous; to say that God will damne them for such
errors, who are lovers of him, and lovers of truth, is to rob man of
his comfort, and God of his goodnesse; it is to make Man desperate
and God a Tyrant. <hi>But they deny Truths testified by God, and therefore
shall be damn'd.</hi> Yes, if they knew them to be thus testified by him, and
yet would deny them, that were to give God the lye, and question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
damnable. But if you should deny a truth which God had testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but only to a man in the <hi>Indies,</hi> (as I said before) and this testifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you had never heard of, or at least had no sufficient reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7615:26"/>
that God had so testified, would not you think it a hard case to
be damned for such a denyall? Yet consider I pray a little more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
the difference between them, and you will presently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the question between them is not at any time, or in any thing,
Whether God saies true or no? or whether he saies this or no? But
supposing he saies this, and saies true, whether he meanes this or no? As
for example, between <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> and <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that Christ spake these words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he meant in saying so is true: But what he meant and how he
is to be understood, that's the question. So that though some of
them deny a truth by God intended, yet you can with no reason or
justice accuse them of denying the truth of Gods Testimony, unlesse
you can plainly shew that God hath declared, and that plainly and
clearly, what was his meaning in these words. I say <hi>plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
For he that speaks obscurely and ambiguously, and no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
himselfe plainly, sure he hath no reason to be much offended
if he be mistaken. When therefore you can shew, that in this and all
other their Controversies, God hath interposed his Testimony on one
side or other; so that either they doe see it, and will not; or were it not
for their own voluntary and avoidable fault, might and should see it
and doe not; let all such Errors be as damnable as you please to make
them. In the mean while, if they suffer themselves neither to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traid
into their errors, nor kept in them by any sin of their will; if they
doe their best endeavour to free themselves from all errors, and yet
faile of it through humane frailty; so well am I perswaded of the
goodnesse of God, that if in me alone, should meet a confluence of all
such errors of all the Protestants in the World, that were thus qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I should not be so much afraid of them all, as I should be to ask
pardon for them. For, whereas that which you affright us with of
calling Gods Veracitie in Question, is but a Panicke feare, a fault that
no man thus qualified, is, or can be guilty of; to ask pardon of simple
and purely involuntary errors is tacitely to imply that God is angry
with us for them, and that were to impute to him the strange tyranny
of <hi>requiring brick, when he gives no straw; of expecting to gather, where
he strew'd not; to reap where he sowed not:</hi> of being offended with us for
not doing what he knowes we cannot doe. This I say upon a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that they doe their best endeavours to know Gods will and doe
it; which he that denyes to be possible knowes not what he saies; for
he saies in effect, That men cannot doe, what they can doe; for to doe
what a man can doe, is to doe his best endeavour. But because this
supposition, though certainly possible, is very rare, and admirable, I
say secondly, that I am verily perswaded, that God will not impute er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
to them, as sinnes, who use such a measure of industry, in finding
truth, as humane <hi>prudence</hi> and ordinary <hi>discretion</hi> (their abilities
and oportunities, their distractions and hindrances, and all other
things considered) shall advise them unto, in a matter of such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
But if herein also we faile, then our errors begin to be malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and justly imputable, as offences against God, and that love of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7615:27"/>
his truth which he requires in us. You will say then, that for those
erring <hi>Protestants,</hi> which are in this case, which evidently are farre
the greater part, they sinne damnably in erring, and therefore there is
little hope of their Salvation. To which I answer, that the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of this Reason, is somewhat strong against a <hi>Protestant;</hi> but
much weakned by coming out of the mouth of a <hi>Papist.</hi> For all sinnes
with you are not damnable; and therefore Protestants errors might be
sinnes, and yet not damnable. But yet out of courtesy to you, we
will remove this rubbe out of your way; and for the present suppose
them <hi>mortall sinnes;</hi> and is there then no hope of Salvation, for him
that commits them? Not, you will say, if he dye in them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
and such Protestants you speak of, <hi>who without repentance
dye in their errors.</hi> Yea but what if they dye in their errors with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?
then I hope you will have Charity enough to think they
may be saved. <hi>Charity Mist.</hi> takes it indeed for granted, that this
supposition is destructive of it selfe;<note place="margin">In the place above quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> and that it is impossible, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
that a man should repent of those errors wherein he dies; or
dye in those whereof he repents. But it was wisely done of Him to
take it for granted; for most certainly He could not have spoken one
word of sense for the confirmation of it. For seeing <hi>Protestants</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as well as you, Gods infinite and most admirable perfections in
himselfe, more then most worthy of all possible love: seeing they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as well as you, his infinite goodnesse to them, in creating them
of nothing; in creating them according to his own image; in creating
all things for their use and benefit; in streaming down his favours on
them every moment of their lives; in designing them, if they serve
him, to infinite and eternall happinesse; in redeeming them, not with
corruptible things, but the pretious blood of his beloved sonne: seing
they believe, as well as you, his infinite goodnesse, and patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, in expecting their conversion; in wooing, alluring, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and by all meanes, which his wisdome can suggest unto him, and
mans nature is capable of, drawing them to Repentance &amp; Salvation:
Seeing they believe these things as well as you, and for ought you
know, consider them as much as you, (and if they doe not, it is not
their Religion, but They that are too blame,) what can hinder, but that
the consideration of Gods most infinite goodnesse to them, and their
own almost infinite wickednesse against him, Gods spirit cooperating
with them, may raise them to a true and syncere and a cordiall love of
God? And seeing sorrow for having injur'd or offended the person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
or when we fear we may have offended him, is the most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
effect of true love; what can hinder, but that love which hath
oftimes constrained them, to lay down their lives for God (which
our Saviour assures us is the noblest sacrifice we can offer,) may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in them an universall sorrow for all their sinnes, both which they
know they have committed, and which they fear they may haue? In
which number, their being negligent, or not dispassionate, or not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudicate
enough in seeking the truth, and, the effect thereof, their
errors, if they be sinnes, cannot but be compriz'd. In a word, what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7615:27"/>
should hinder, but that, that Prayer<hi>—Delicta sua quis intelligit? who
can understand his faults? Lord cleanse thou me from my secret sinnes,</hi>
may be heard and accepted by God, as well from a <hi>Protestant</hi> that dies
in some errours, as from a <hi>Papist</hi> that dies in some other sins of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which perhaps he might more easily haue discovered to bee
sinnes, then a Protestant could his errours to be errours? As well from
a Protestant, that held some errour, which (as he conceived) Gods
word, and his reason, (which is also in some sort Gods word) led him
unto; as from a <hi>Dominican,</hi> who perhaps took up his opinion upon
trust, not because he had reason to beleiue it true, but because it was
the opinion of his <hi>Order;</hi> for the same man if hee had light upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Order, would in all probabilitie, haue beene of the other opinion.
For what else is the cause, that generally <hi>all the Dominicans are of one
opinion, and all the Iesuits of the other?</hi> I say, from a <hi>Dominican</hi> who
took up his opinion upon trust; and that such an opinion (if we beleiue
the writers of your Order) as if it be granted true, it were not a point
matter, what opinions any man held, or what actions any man did, for
the best would be as bad as the worst, &amp; the worst as good as the best.
And yet such is the partialitie of your Hypocrisie, that of disagreeing
Papists, neither shall deny the truth testified by God, but both may
hope for salvation: but of disagreeing Protestants (though they differ
in the same thing,) one side must deny Gods Testimony and bee inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of salvation. That a <hi>Dominican</hi> through culpable negligence, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and dying in his errour, may repent of it, though hee knowes it
not; or be saued though he doe not: But if a Protestant doe the very
same thing, in the very same point, and die in his errour, his case is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate.
The summe of all that hath been said to this Demand is this.
1. That no erring Protestant denies any truth testified by God, under
this formalitie, <hi>as testified by him;</hi> nor which they know or beleiue to
be testified by him. And therefore it is a horrible calumnie in you to
say, <hi>They call Gods Veracitie in question.</hi> For Gods undoubted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd
Veracitie, is to them the ground why they hold all they
doe hold: neither doe they hold any opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so stifly, but they will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
it rather then this one, <hi>That all which God saies is true.</hi> 2. God
hath not so clearely and plainly declared himselfe in most of these
things which are in controversie between Protestants, but that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, whose heart is right to God, and one that is a true louer of
God, and of his truth, may by reason of the conflict of contrary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
on both sides, very easily, and therefore excusably mistake, and
embrace errour for truth, and reject truth for errour. 3, If any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
or Papist be betrayed into, or kept in any Errour, by any sinne
of his will (as it is to be fear'd many millions are) such Errour is, as the
cause of it, sinfull and damnable: yet not exclusiue of all hope of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but pardonable if discover'd, upon a particular explicite repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
if not discover'd, upon a generall and implicite repentance for all
Sinnes knowne and unknowne: in which number all sinfull Errours
must of necessity be contained.</p>
            <p>17 <hi>To the 9. To the nineteenth,</hi> Wherein you are so urgent for a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7615:28"/>
Catalogue of Fundamentalls:</hi> I answer almost in your owne words,
that we also constantly urge and require to haue a particular Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of your Fundamentals, whether they be written Verities, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
Traditions, or Church Definitions? all which, you say, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
the materiall Object of your Faith: In a word of all such points
as are defin'd and sufficiently proposed; so that whosoever denies, or
doubts of any of them, is certainly in the state of damnation. A Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
I say in particular of the Proposals: and not only some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
definition, or description, under which you lurke deceitfully, of
what and what only is sufficiently proposed: wherein yet you doe not
very well agree.<note place="margin">This great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions among you, touching this matter, if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubt of it, let him read <hi>Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Picus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula in l. Theorem. in Exposit. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. quarti,</hi> and <hi>T h. Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. Tom. 3. De Sacramenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus. doct. 3. fol.</hi> 5. andhee shall bee fully satisfied that I haue done you no injury.</note> For many of you hold the Popes proposall <hi>Ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra,</hi>
to be sufficient and obligeing: Some a Councel without a Pope:
Some, of neither of them severally, but only both together: Some not
this neither in matter of manners, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledges, &amp;
tells us it is all one in effect, as if they denied it sufficient in matter of
faith: Some not in matter of faith, neither think this proposall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
without the acceptation of the Church universall: Some deny the
infallibility of the Present Church, and only make the Tradition of all
ages the <hi>infallible Propounder.</hi> Yet if you were agreed <hi>what and what
only is the Infallible Propounder,</hi> this would not satisfie us; nor yet to
say <hi>that All is fundamentall which is propounded sufficiently by him.</hi> For
though agreeing in this, yet you might still disagree <hi>whether such or
such a Doctrine were propounded or not: or if propounded, whether suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
or only unsufficiently.</hi> And it is so knowne a thing, that in many
points you doe so, that I assure my selfe you will not deny it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we constantly urge and require a particular and perfect Inventory
of all these Divine Revelations, which you say <hi>are sufficiently propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
&amp; that such a one to which all of your Church will subscribe as neither
redundant, nor deficient;</hi> which when you giue in with one hand, you
shall receiue a particular Catalogue of such Points as I call <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi>
with the other. Neither may you think mee unreasonable in
this demand, seeing upon such a particular Catalogue of your suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Proposalls as much depends, as upon a particular Catalogue of
our Fundamentalls. As for example. Whether or no a man doe not
erre in some point defined and sufficiently proposed: and whether or
no those that differ among you, differ in Fundamentalls; which if they
doe <hi>One Heaven</hi> (by your owne Rule) <hi>cannot receiue them All.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you will here complaine, that this is not to satisfie your demand,
but to avoid it, and to put you off as the <hi>Areopagites</hi> did hard causes
<hi>ad diem longissimum,</hi> and bid you come againe a hundred yeares hence:
To deale truly, I did so intend it should be. Nether can you say my
dealing with you is injurious, seeing I require nothing of you, but that,
what you require of others, you should shew it possible to be done, and
just and necessary to be required. For, for my part, I haue great reason
to suspect, it is neither the one nor the other. For whereas the Verities
which are delivered in Scripture, may be very fitly divided into <hi>such
as were written because they were necessary to be beleived,</hi> Of which
ranke are those only which constitute and make up the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7615:28"/>
God and Man in Christ: and then <hi>such as are necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
not in themselues but only by accident, because they were written.</hi>
Of which rank are many matters of History, of Prophecy, of mystery,
of Policy, of Oeconomie, &amp; such like, which are evidently not <hi>intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
to the Covenant. Now to sever exactly &amp; punctually these Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
one trom the other: what is <hi>necessary in it selfe</hi> &amp; antecedently to
the writing, from what is but only profitable in it selfe, and <hi>necessary
only because written,</hi> is a businesse of extreame great difficultie, and
extreame little necessitie. For first he that will goe about to distinguish
especially in the Story of our Saviour, what was written because it was
<hi>profitable,</hi> from what was written because <hi>necessary,</hi> shall find an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
peece of businesse of it, &amp; almost impossible that he should be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
he hath done it, when he hath done it. And then it is apparently
unnecessary to goe about it, seeing he that beleiues all, certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues
all that is necessary. And he that doth not beleiue all (I meane
all the undoubted parts of the undoubted Books of Scripture) can
hardly belieue any, neither haue we reason to beleiue he doth so. So
that, that Protestants giue you not a Catalogue of Fundamentalls, it is
not from Tergiversation (as you suspect, who for want of Charitie to
them alwaies suspect the worst,) but from Wisdome and Necessity.
For they may very easily erre in doing it; because though all which is
necessary be plaine in Scripture, yet all which is plaine is not therefore
written because it was necessary. For what greater necessity was there
that I should know S. <hi>Paul left his Cloak at Troas,</hi> then those <hi>Worlds of
Miracles,</hi> which our Saviour did, which were never written. And
when they had done it, it had been to no purpose; There being, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
now stand, as great necessitie, of believing those truths of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which are not Fundamentall, as those that are. You see then what
reason we haue to decline this hard labour, which you a rigid Taske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
haue here put upon us. Yet insteed of giving you a Catalogue
of Fundamentalls, with which I dare say you are resolu'd before it
come, never to be satisfied, I will say that to you, which if you please
may doe you as much service; and this it is. That it is sufficient for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mans salvation that he belieue the Scripture: That he endeavour to
beleiue it in the true sense of it, as farre as concernes his dutie: And that
he conforme his life unto it either by Obedience or Repentance. Hee
that does so (and all Protestants according to the <hi>Dictamen</hi> of their
Religion should doe so,) may be secure that he cannot erre fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.
And they that doe so cannot differ in Fundamentals. So that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their differences, &amp; your presumption, <hi>the same Heaven
may receiue them All.</hi>

            <p>28 <hi>To the twentieth.</hi> Your tenth &amp; last request is, <hi>to know distinctly
what is the doctrine of the Protestant English Church, in these points; and
what my private opinion.</hi> Which shall be satisfied when the Church of
England hath expressed her selfe in them; or when you haue told us
what is the doctrine of your Church, in the Question of <hi>Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
or the <hi>Immaculate Conception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29 <hi>To the 21 &amp;</hi> 22. These answers I hope in the judgement of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7615:29"/>
men are satisfactory to your Questions, though not to you,
For I haue either answer'd them, or given you a reason why I haue not.
Neither, for ought I can see, <hi>haue I flitted from things considered in
their owne nature, to accidentall or rare Circumstances,</hi> But told you my
opinion plainely what I thought of your Errours in themselues: and
what as they were qualified or malignified with good or bad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
Though I must tell you truly, that I see no reason, the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being of the damnablenesse of Errour, <hi>why you should esteeme igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
incapacitie, want of meanes to be instructed, accidentall</hi> and rare
<hi>Circumstances:</hi> As if knowledge, capacitie, having meanes of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concerning the truth of your Religion or ours, were not as rare &amp;
unusuall in the adverse part of either, as Ignorance, Incapacitie, and
want of meanes of instruction. Especially how erroneous Conscience
can be a rare thing in those that erre, or how unerring Conscience is
not much more rare, I am not able to apprehend. So that to consider
men of different Religions (the subject of this Contoversie) in their
owne nature and <hi>without circumstances,</hi> must be to consider them,
neither as ignorant, nor as knowing: neither as having, nor as wanting
meanes of Instruction: neither as with Capacity, nor without it: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with erroneous, nor yet with unerring conscience. And then what
judgement can you pronounce of them, all the goodnesse and badnesse
of an Action depending on the Circumstances. Ought not a Iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to giue sentence of an Action, to consider all the Circumstances of
it, or is it possible he should judge rightly that does not so? Neither is
it to purpose, <hi>That Circumstances being various, cannot be well compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under any generall rule:</hi> For though under any generall rule
they cannot, yet under many generall rules they may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The Question here is, you say, <hi>whether men of different Religions
may be saved?</hi> Now the subject of this Question is an ambiguous
terme and may be determined and invested with diverse and contrary
Circumstances: and accordingly contrary judgements are to be given
of it. And who then can be offended with D. <hi>Potter</hi> for distinguishing
before he defines, (the want whereof is the cheife thing that makes
defining dangerous?) Who can finde fault with him for saying, <hi>If,
through want of meanes of instruction, incapacitie, invincible or probable
ignorance a man dye in errour, he may be saved. But if he be negligent in
seeking Truth, unwilling to find it, either doth see it and will not, or might
see it and will not, that his case is dangerous, &amp; without repentance despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>
This is all that D. <hi>Potter</hi> saies: neither rashly damning all that are
of a different opinion from him, not securing any that are in matter of
Religion sinfully, that is, willingly erroneous. The Author of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
(I will abide by it) saies the very same thing, neither can I see
what adversary he hath in the maine Question but his owne shaddow;
and yet I know not out of what frowardnesse findes fault with D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
for affirming that which himselfe affirmes: and to cloude the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whereas the Question is, <hi>whether men by ignorance, dying in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
may be saved,</hi> would haue them considered <hi>neither as erring, nor
ignorant.</hi> And when the question is, whether <hi>The errors of Papists bee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7615:29"/>
damnable:</hi> to which we answer. That to them that doe or might knowe
them to be errours, they are damnable, to them that doe not, they are
not. <hi>He tels us that this is to change the state of the Question,</hi> whereas
indeed it is to state the Question, and free it from ambiguity before
you answer it: <hi>and to haue recourse to Accidentall Circumstances;</hi> as if
Ignorance were accidentall to error, or as if a man could be considered
as in errour, and not be considered as in ignorance of the Truth from
which he erres! Certainly Errour against a Truth, must needs presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a nescience of it: unlesse you will say, that a man may at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
for a Truth and resolue against it, assent to it, and dissent from
it, knowe it to be true, and beleiue it not to be true. Whether Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
&amp; Opinion touching the same thing, may stand together, is made
a Question in the Schooles: But hee that would question, whether
knowing a thing and doubting of it, much more, whether knowing it
to be true &amp; believing it to be false, may stand together, deserues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
question no other Answer but laughter. Now if Errour &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
connot consist, then Errour and Ignorance must be inseparable.
He then that professeth your errours may well be considered either as
knowing or as Ignorant. But him that does erre indeed, you can no
more conceiue without ignorance, then Long without Quantity, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
without Qualitie, a Man, and not a living Creature, to haue gone
ten miles, and not to haue gone fiue, to speak sense, and not to speake.
For as the latter in all these is implied in the former, so is Ignorance of
a Truth, supposed in errour against it. Yet such a man, though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueable
without Ignorance simply, may be very well considered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as with, or without voluntary and sinfull Ignorance. And he that
will giue a wise answer to this Question, Whether a Papist dying a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
may be saved, according to Gods ordinary proceeding; must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
him according to these severall considerations, and say, Hee
may be saved, If his ignorance were either invincible, or at least unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
and probable: if otherwise, without repentance he cannot.</p>
            <p>To the rest of this Preface, I haue nothing to say; saving what hath
been said, but this, That it is no just exception to an argument to call it
vulgar and thredbare. Truth can neither be too common nor super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated,
nor Reason ever worne out. Let your Answers be solid &amp;
pertinent, and we will never finde fault with them for being old or
common.</p>

Censure, he doth not only make himselfe guilty of that, which he judgeth to be a haynous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in others, but freeth us also from all colour of crime by this his unadvised recrimination.
For, if Roman Catholikes be likewise <hi>convicted in conscience</hi> of the Errors of Protestants; they
may, and must, in conformity to the <hi>Doctor's</hi> own rule, judge a reconciliation with them to be
also <hi>damnable.</hi> And thus, all the <hi>Want of Charity</hi> so deeply charged on us, dissolves it selfe into
this poore wonder, <hi>Roman Catholiques believe in their conscience, that the Religion which they
professe, is true, and the contrary false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Neverthelesse, we earnestly desire, and take care, that our doctrine may not be defamed
by misinterpretation. Far be it from us, by way of insultation, to apply it against Protestants, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then as they are comprehended under the generality of those who are divided from the
only one true Church of Christ our Lord, within the Communion whereof he hath confined sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Neither doe we understand, why our most deere Countrymen should be offended if the
Vniversality be particularized under the name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> first given<note n="g" place="margin">Sleidan. l. 6. fol. 84.</note> to certain <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
who <hi>protesting</hi> that they would stand out against the Imperiall decrees, in defence of the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
exhibited at <hi>Ausburge,</hi> were termed <hi>Protestants,</hi> in regard of such their <hi>protesting:</hi> which
<hi>Confessio Augustana</hi> disclaiming from, and being disclaymed by <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> our
naming or exemplifying a generall doctrine under the particular name of Protestantisme, ought
not in any particular manner to be odious in England.</p>
               <p>3 Moreover, our meaning is not, as misinformed persons may conceive, that we give Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
over to reprobation; that we offer no prayers in hope of their salvation; that we hold their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7615:30"/>
case desperate. God forbid! We hope, we pray for their Conversion; and sometimes we find hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
effects of our charitable desires. Neither is our Censure immediatly directed to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
The Tribunall of particular Iudgement is Gods alone. When any man esteemed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,
leaveth to live in this world, we doe not instantly with precipitation avouch, that he is
lodged in Hell. For we are not alwaies acquainted with what sufficiency or meanes he was furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for instruction; we doe not penetrate his capacity to understand his Catechist, we have no
revelation what light might have cleered his errours, or Contrition retracted his sinnes, in the
last moment before his death. In such particular cases, we wish more apparent signes of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but doe not give any dogmaticall sentence of perdition. How greivous sinnes, <hi>Disobedience,
Schisme,</hi> and <hi>Heresy</hi> are, is well knowne. But to discerne how farre the naturall malignity of those
great offences might be checked by Ignorance, or by some such lessening circumstance, is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
rather of <hi>Prudence</hi> then of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 Thus we allow Protestants as much Charity, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> spares us, for whom, in the
words above mentioned, and else where, he<note n="h" place="margin">See pag. 39.</note> makes <hi>Ignorance</hi> the best hope of salvation.
Much lesse comfort, can we expect from the fierce d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>trine of those chiefe Protestants, who teach
that for many ages before <hi>Luther,</hi> Christ had no visible Church upon earth. Not these men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
or such as they, but even the 39. Articles, to which the English Protestant Clergy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes,
censure our beliefe so deeply, that Ignorance can scarce, or rather not at all, excuse us
from damnation. Our doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> is affirmed to be <hi>repugnant</hi> to the plaine
words of<note n="i" place="margin">Art. 28.</note> Scripture; our <hi>Masses</hi> to be blasphemous<note n="k" place="margin">Art. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Fables,</hi> with much more to be seen
in the <hi>Articles</hi> themselves. In a certaine Confession of the Christian faith, at the end of their
books of Psalmes collected into Meeter, and printed <hi>Cum privilegio Regis Regali,</hi> they call us <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters,</hi>
and <hi>limmes of Antichrist;</hi> and having set downe a Catalogue of our doctrines, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that for them we shall after the Generall Resurrection be <hi>damned to unquenchable fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 But yet least any man should flatter himselfe with our charitable Mitigations, and thereby
wax carelesse in search of the true Church, we desire him to read the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of the <hi>Second
Part,</hi> where this matter is more explained.</p>
               <p>6 And because we cannot determine, what <hi>Iudgment</hi> may be esteemed <hi>rash,</hi> or <hi>prudent,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by weighing the reasons upon which it is grounded, we will heere, under one aspect, present
a Summary of those Principles, from which we infer, that Protestancy in it selfe unrepented de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
Salvation: intending afterward to prove the truth of every one of the grounds, till, by
a concatenation of sequels, we fall upon the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> for which we are charged with <hi>Wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7 Now, this is our gradation of reasons. Almighty God, having ordained Mankind to a
supernaturall <hi>End</hi> of eternall felicity, hath in his holy Providence setled competent and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<hi>Meanes,</hi> whereby that end may be attained. The universall grand Origen of all such means,
is the Incarnation and Death of our Blessed Saviour, whereby he merited internall grace for us;
and founded an <hi>externall</hi> visible <hi>Church,</hi> provided and stored with all those helps which might
be necessary for Salvation. From hence it followeth, that in this Church amongst other advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
there must be some effectuall meanes to beget, and conserve faith, to maintaine Vnity, to
discover and condemne Heresies, to appease and reduce Schismes, and to determine all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
in Religion. For without such meanes, the Church should not be furnished with helps
sufficient to salvation, nor God afford sufficient meanes to attayne that End, to which himselfe
ordained Mankind. This meanes to decide Controversies in faith and Religion (whether it
should be the holy Scripture, or whatsoever else) must be indued with an Vniversall Infallibility,
in whatsoever it propoundeth for a divine truth, that is, as revealed, spoken, or testifyed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, whether the matter of its nature, be great or small. For if it were subject to errour
in any one thing, we could not in any other yield it infallible assent; because we might with
good reason doubt, whether it chanced not to erre in that particular.</p>
               <p>8 Thus farre all must agree to what wee have said, unlesse they have a mind to reduce <hi>Faith</hi>
to <hi>Opinion.</hi> And even out of these grounds alone, without further proceeding, it undenyably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that of two men dissenting in matters of faith, great or small, few or many, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be saved without repentance, unlesse Ignorance accidentally may in some particular person
plead excuse. For in that case of contrary beliefe, one must of necessity be held to oppose Gods
word, or Revelation sufficiently represented to his understanding by an infallible Propounder;
which opposition to the Testimony of God is undoubtedly a damnable sin, whether otherwise,
the thing so testified, be in it selfe great or small. And thus wee have already made good, what
was promised in the argument of this Chapter, that <hi>amongst men of different Religions,</hi> one is
only capable of being saved.</p>
               <p>9 Neverthelesse, to the end that men may know in particular what is the said infallible
meanes upon which we are to rely in all things concerning Fayth, and accordingly may be able
to judge in what safety or danger, more or lesse they live; and because <hi>D. Potter</hi> descendeth to
divers particulars about Scriptures and the Church &amp;c. we will goe forward, and prove, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Scripture be in it selfe most sacred, infallible, and divine; yet it alone cannot be <hi>to us a Rule,</hi>
or Iudge, fit an able to end all doubts and debates emergent in matters of Religion; but that there
must be some externall, visible, publique, living Iudge, to whom all sorts of persons both learned
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7615:31"/>
and unlearned, may without danger of errour, have recourse; and in whose Iudgment they may
rest, for the interpreting and propounding of Gods Word or Revelation. And this living Iudge,
we will most evidently prove to be no other, but that Holy, Catholique, Apostolique, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church, which our Saviour purchased with the effusion of his most precious bloud.</p>
               <p>10 If once therefore it be granted, that the Church is that means, which God hath left for
deciding all Controversies in faith, it manifestly will follow, that shee must be infallible in all
her determinations, whether the matters of themselves be great or small; because as we said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
it must be agreed on all sides, that if that meanes which God hath left to determine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
were not infallible in all things proposed by it as truths revealed by Almighty God, it
could not settle in our minds a firme, and infallible beliefe of any one.</p>
               <p>11 From this Vniversall infallibility of Gods Church it followeth, that whosoever witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denyeth any one point proposed by her, as revealed by God, is injurious to his divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
as if he could either deceive, or be deceived in what he testifieth. The averring whereof, were
not a <hi>fundamentall</hi> error, but would overthrow the very foundation of all fundamentall points,
and therefore without repentance could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> possibly stand with salvation.</p>
               <p>12 Out of these grounds, we will shew, that although the distinction of points <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi>
and not <hi>fundamentall,</hi> be good and usefull, as it is delivered and applied by Catholique
Divines, to teach what principall Articles of faith, Christians are obliged <hi>explicitely</hi> to believe:
yet that it is impertinent to the present purpose of excusing any man from grievous sinne, who
knowingly <hi>disbelieves,</hi> that is, believes the contrary of that which Gods Church proposeth as
divine Truth. For it is one thing not to know explicitly some thing testifyed by God, &amp; another
positively to oppose what we know he hath restified. The former may often be excused from sin,
but never the latter, which only is the case in Question.</p>
               <p>13 In the same manner shall be demonstrated, that to alleadge the <hi>Creed,</hi> as containing all
Articles of faith necessary to be explicitely believed, is not pertinent to free from sinne the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
deniall of any other point knowen to be defined by Gods Church. And this were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to overthrow all that <hi>D. Potter</hi> alleadgeth, concerning the <hi>Creed:</hi> though yet by way of
Supererogation, we will prove, that there are divers important matters of Faith which are not
mentioned at all in the Creed.</p>
               <p>14 From the aforesaid maine principle, that God hath alwaies had, and alwaies will have on
earth, a Church <hi>Visible,</hi> within whose Communion Salvation must be hoped, and <hi>infallible,</hi>
whose definitions we ought to believe; we will prove, that <hi>Luther, Calvin</hi> and all other, who
continue the division in Communion, or Faith, from that Visible Church, which at, and before
<hi>Luther's</hi> appearance, was spread over the world, cannot be excused from <hi>Schisme</hi> and <hi>Heresy,</hi>
although they opposed her faith but in <hi>one only</hi> point; whereas it is manifest, they dissent from
her, in <hi>many</hi> and weighty matters, concerning as well <hi>beliefe,</hi> as practise.</p>
               <p>15 To these reasons drawne from the vertue of <hi>Faith,</hi> we will adde one other taken from
<hi>Charitas propria,</hi> the Vertue of <hi>Charity,</hi> as it obligeth us, not to expose our soule to hazard of
perdition, when we can put ourselves in a way much more secure, as we will prove, that of the
Roman Catholiques to be.</p>
               <p>16 We are then to prove these points. First, that the infallible means to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
in matters of faith, is the visible Church of Christ. Secondly, that the distinction of
points <hi>fundamentall,</hi> and <hi>not fundamentall,</hi> maketh nothing to our present Question. Thirdly,
that to say the <hi>Creed</hi> containes all fundamentall points of faith, is neither <hi>pertinent,</hi> nor <hi>true.</hi>
Fourthly, that both <hi>Luther,</hi> and all they who after him, persist in division from the <hi>Communion,</hi>
and <hi>Faith</hi> of the Roman Church, cannot be excused from <hi>Schisme.</hi> Fiftly, nor from Heresy.
Sixtly and lastly, that in regard of the precept of <hi>Charity</hi> towards ones selfe, Protestants be in
state of sinne, as long as they remaine divided from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And these six points,
shall be severall Arguments for so many ensuing Chapters,</p>
               <p>17 Only I will here observe, that it seemeth very strange, that Protestants should charge us
so deeply with <hi>Want of Charity,</hi> for only teaching, that both they, and we cannot be saved,
seeing themselves must affirme the like of whosoever opposeth any least point delivered in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
which they hold to be the sole Rule of Faith. Out of which ground they must be enforced
to let all our former Inferences passe for good. For, is it not a grievous sinne, to deny any one
truth contained in holy Writ? Is there in such deniall, any distinction betwixt points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and not fundamentall, sufficient to excuse from heresy? Is it not impertinent, to alleadge the
Creed containing all fundamentall points of faith, as if believing it alone, we were at liberty to
deny all other points of Scripture? In a word: According to Protestants; Oppose not Scripture,
there is no Errour against faith. Oppose it in any least point, the error (if Scripture be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proposed, which proposition is also required before a man can be obliged to believe even fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
points) must be damnable. What is this, but to say with us, <hi>Of persons contrary in
whatsoever point of beliefe, one party only can be saved?</hi> And <hi>D. Potter</hi> must not take it ill, if
Catholiques believe they may be saved in that Religion for which they suffer. And if by occasion
of this doctrine, men will still be charging us with <hi>Want of Charity,</hi> and be resolved to <hi>take</hi>
scandall where none is <hi>given;</hi> we must comfort our selves with that grave, and true saying of
<hi>S. Gregory: If scandall</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">S. Greg. Hom. 7. in Ezec.</note> 
                  <hi>be taken from declaring a truth, it is better to permit scandall, then
forsake the truth.</hi> But the solid grounds of our Assertion, and the sincerity of our intention in utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7615:31"/>
what wee think, yield us confidence, that all will hold for most reasonable the saying of
Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> to <hi>Anastasius</hi> the Emperour; <hi>Farre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hold it for a wrong to have truth declared to him!</hi> Let us therefore begin with that Point which

Verily a great fault, and folly, if the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
be just; if unjust, a great calumnie. Let us see
then how you make good your charge. The effect of your discourse,
if I mistake not, is this. <hi>D. Potter chargeth the Roman Church with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

ours impossible; and that for them who are convicted in Conscience of her
Errors, not to forsake her in them, or to be reconcil'd unto her, is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Therefore if Roman Catholiques be convicted in conscience of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of Protestants, they may and must judge a reconciliation with them
damnable, &amp; consequently, to judge so is no more uncharitable in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then
it is in the Doctor to judge as he does.</hi> All this I grant; nor would any
Protestant accuse you of <hi>want of Charity,</hi> if you went no further: if you

perswaded in conscience that our Religion is erroneous, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of it, though in it selfe most true, to you would be damnable.
This therefore I subscribe very willingly, and withall, that if you said

people, with telling them (as your fashion is) that <hi>Protestants confesse
Papists may be saved, but Papists confesse not so much of Protestants;
therefore yours is the safer way, and in Wisdome and Charity to our owne
soules we are bound to follow it.</hi> For granting this, you grant as much
hope of salvation to Protestants, as Protestants doe to you. If you
will not, but will still affirme, as C. M. does, that <hi>Protectants,</hi> not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers
but <hi>believers, without a particular repentance of their Religion
cannot be saved:</hi> This I say, is a <hi>want of Charity,</hi> into the society where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>D. Potter</hi> cannot bee drawn but with palpable and transparent <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistrie.</hi>
For I pray Sir what dependance is there between these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:
We that hold Protestant Religion false should be damned
if we should professe it, Therefore they also shall be damned, that hold
it true? Iust as if you should conclude, <hi>Because hee that doubts is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
if he eat,</hi> Therefore he that does not doubt is damn'd also if he eat.
And therefore though your Religion to us, or ours to you, if profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
against Conscience would be damnable; yet may it well be uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
to define it shall be so, to them that professe either this or that
according to Conscience. This recrimination therefore upon <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
wherewith you begin, is a plain Fallacie: And I feare your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
will be answerable to these beginings!</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 2. In this Paragraph, Protestants are thus farre comforted,
that they are not sent to Hell without Company; which the Poet tells
us, is the miserable <hi>comfort of miserable Men.</hi> Then we in <hi>England</hi> are
requested <hi>not to be offended with the name of Protestants.</hi> Which is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
I shall easily grant, if by it be understood those that <hi>Protest,</hi> not
against <hi>Imperiall Edicts,</hi> but against the <hi>Corruptions of the Church of
Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 3. 4, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. <hi>That you give us not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver to reprobation, That
you pray and hope for our salvation,</hi> if it be a Charity, is such a one as is
common to <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> with us: But that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
is extraordinary; Neither doe I know any man that requires
more of you then there you pretend to. For there you tell us, <hi>That
when any man, esteem'd a Protestant, dies, you doe not instantly avouch
that he is lodg'd in Hell.</hi> Where the word <hi>esteem'd</hi> is ambiguous: For it
may signifie, <hi>esteem'd truly,</hi> and <hi>esteemd falsely.</hi> Hee may be esteem'd
a Protestant that <hi>is so:</hi> And he may be esteem'd a Protestant that is <hi>not
so.</hi> And therefore I should have had just occasion to have laid to your
charge the transgression of your own chief prescription, which you
say <hi>truth exacts at our hands,</hi> that is, <hi>to speake clearely or distinctly, and
not to walk in darknesse;</hi> but that your following words to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
declare sufficiently that you speake of <hi>both sorts.</hi> For there
you tell us that the Reasons why you damne not any man that dies
with the esteem of a Protestant, are. 1. <hi>Because you are not alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with what sufficiency of means he was furnished for instruction;</hi>
You must mean touching the falshood of his own Religion, and the
truth of yours. Which reason is proper to those that are Protestants
in <hi>truth,</hi> and not only in <hi>estimation.</hi> 2. Because you doe <hi>not penetrate
his capacitie to understand his Cateohist;</hi> which is also peculiar to those,
who for want of capacitie (as you conceive) remaine Protestants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7615:32"/>
and are not only so accounted. 3. Because you have <hi>no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
what light might clear his errors;</hi> which belongs to those which
were esteem'd Protestants, but indeed were not so. 4. Because you
have <hi>no Revelation what Contrition might have retracted his sinnes:</hi>
which reason being distinct from the former, and divided from it by
the disjunctive particle, <hi>Or,</hi> insinuates unto us, that though no light
did clear the errors of a dying Protestant, yet <hi>Contrition</hi> might, for
ought you know, retract his sinnes: which appropriates this reason
also to Protestants truly so esteem'd. I wish with all my heart that
in obedience to your own prescription, you had expressed your selfe
in this matter more fully and plainly. Yet that which you say, doth
plainly enough afford us these corollaries.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That whatsoever Protestant wanteth capacity, or having it,
wanteth sufficient meanes of instruction to convince his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the falshood of his own, and the truth of the Roman
Religion, by the confession of his most rigid Adversaries, may
be saved, notwithstanding any error in his Religion.</item>
                  <item>2 That nothing hinders but that a Protestant dying a Protestant
may dye with contrition for all his sinnes.</item>
                  <item>3 That, if he doe dye with Contrition, he may and shall be saved.</item>
               </list>
               <p>4 All these acknowledgements we have from you, while you
are, as you say, stateing, but as I conceive granting the very point in
question; which was, as I have already prov'd out of C. M. <hi>whether
without uncharitablenesse you may pronounce, that Protestants dying in
the belief of their Religion, and without particular repentance and dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction
of it cannot possibly be saved.</hi> Which C. M. affirmes universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and without any of your limitations. But this presumption of his,
you thus qualify, by saying, that <hi>this sentence cannot be pronounced truly
and therefore sure not charitably, neither of those Protestants that want
meanes sufficient to instruct and convince them of the truth of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the falshood of their own: Nor of those, who, though they have
neglected the meanes they might have had, dyed with contrition, that is,
with a sorrow for all their sinnes proceeding from the love of God.</hi> So
that according to your doctrine it shall remain upon <hi>such only, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were, or but for their own fault, might have been sufficiently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the truth of your Religion, and the falshood of their own, and yet dye
in it without contrition.</hi> Which doctrine if you would stand to, and
not pull down, and pull back with one hand, what you give and build
with the other, this controversy were ended; and I should willingly
acknowledge, that which followes in your fourth paragraph; <hi>That
you allow Protestants as much Charity as</hi> D. Potter <hi>allowes you.</hi> But then
I must intreat you to alter the <hi>argument of this Chapter,</hi> and not to goe
about to give us reasons, <hi>why amongst men of different Religions, one
side only can be saved absolutely,</hi> which your Reasons drive at: But you
must temper the crudenes of your Assertion by saying, <hi>One side only
can be saved, unlesse want of Conviction, or else Repentance excuse the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Besides you must not only abstaine from damning any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in particular, but from affirming in generall, that <hi>Protestants dying
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7615:33"/>
in their Religion cannot be saved;</hi> for you must alwaies remember to
adde this caution, unlesse <hi>they were excusably ignorant of the falshood
of it, or dyed with contrition.</hi> And then considering that you cannot
know, whether or no, all things considered, they were convinc'd suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
of the truth of your Religion and the falshood of their own,
you are oblig'd by Charity to judge the best, and hope they are not.
Considering again, that notwithstanding their Errors, they may dye
with contrition, &amp; that it is no way improbable that they doe so, &amp; the
contrary you cannot be certain of, You are bound in Charity to judge
and hope they doe so. Considering thirdly and lastly, that if they dye
not with <hi>Contrition,</hi> yet it is very probable they may dye with <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
&amp; that this pretence of yours, that <hi>Contrition will serve without actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Confession, but Attrition will not,</hi> is but a nicety or phancy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to give it the true name, a Device of your own, to serve ends and
purposes; (God having no where declared himselfe, but that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he will accept of that repentance, which you are pleased to call
<hi>Contrition,</hi> he will accept of that which you call <hi>Attrition;</hi> For
though he like best the bright flaming holocaust of Love, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
not, he quenches not the smoaking flaxe of that repentance (if it
be true and effectuall) which proceeds from hope and fear:) These
things I say, considered, (unlesse you will have the Charity of your
doctrine rise up in judgement against your uncharitable practise) you
must not only not be peremptory, in damning Protestants, but you
must hope well of their Salvation: and out of this hope, you must
doe for them as well as others, those, as you conceive, Charitable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of Praying, giving Almes and offering Sacrifice, which usually
you doe, for those of whose Salvation you are well and charitably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded;
(for I believe you will never conceive so well of Protestants,
as to assure your selves they goe directly to heaven.) These things whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you doe I shall believe you think as charitably as you speak. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
then, as he said in the Comedy, <hi>Quid verba audiam cum facta vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deam?</hi>
so may I say to you, <hi>Quid verba audiam cum facta non videam?</hi>
To what purpose should you give us charitable words, which present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you retract again, by denying us your charitable actions. And as
these things you must doe, if you will stand to and make good this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Charity, so must I tell you again and again, that one thing you
must not doe; I mean, you must not affright poore people out of their
Religion, with telling them, that <hi>by the confession of both sides, your way
is safe, but in your judgement, ours undoubtedly damnable.</hi> Seeing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you deny Salvation to <hi>Protestants dying with repentance,</hi> nor
we promise it to you, <hi>if ye dye without it.</hi> For to deal plainly with you,
I know no Protestant that hath any other hope of your salvation, but
upon these grounds, that <hi>unaffected ignorance</hi> may excuse you, or <hi>true
repentance</hi> obtain pardon for you; neither doe the heavy censures
which Protestants (you say) passe upon your errors, any way hinder
but they may hope as well of you, upon repentance, as I doe. For the
<hi>fierce doctrine,</hi> which, God knowes who, teaches, that <hi>Christ for many
ages before Luther had no visible Church upon earth;</hi> will be mild e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7615:33"/>
if you conceive them to mean (as perhaps they doe) by <hi>no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church, none pure and free from corruptions,</hi> which in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is all one with no Church. But the truth is the <hi>corruption</hi> of the
Church, and the <hi>destruction</hi> of it, is not all one. For if a particular
man or Church may (as you confesse they may) hold some particular
Errors, and yet be a member of the Church universall: why may not
the Church hold some universall Error, and yet be still the Church?
especially, seeing you say, it is nothing but <hi>opposing the doctrine of the
Church, that makes an error damnable,</hi> and it is impossible that the
Church should oppose the Church, I mean that the present Church
should oppose it selfe. And then for the English Protestants, though
they censure your Errors deeply, yet, by your favour, with their deepest
censures it may well consist that <hi>invincible ignorance</hi> may excuse you
from damnation for them. For you your selfe confesse <hi>that ignorance
may excuse Errors, even in Fundamentall Articles of faith: so that a man
so erring shall not offend at all in such his ignorance or error;</hi> they are
your own words. p. 19. And againe which their heaviest censures it
may well consist, that your Errors though in themselves damnable,
yet may prove <hi>not damning</hi> to you, if you dye with true repentance,
for all your sinnes known and unknown.</p>
               <p>5 Thus much Charity therefore, if you stand to what you have
said, is interchangeably granted by each Side to the other, that Neither
Religion is so fatally <hi>destructive, but that by ignorance or repentance
salvation may be had on both Sides:</hi> though with a difference that keeps
Papists still on the more uncharitable side. For whereas we conceive
a lower degree of repentance (that which they call <hi>Attrition</hi>) if it be
true, and effectuall, and convert the heart of the penitent, will serve in
them: They pretend (even <hi>this Author</hi> which is most charitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us,) that <hi>without Contrition</hi> there is no hope for us, But though
Protestants may not obtain this purchase at so easy a rare as Papists, yet
(even Papists being Iudges) they may obtain it; and though there is
no entrance for them but at the only doore of <hi>Contrition,</hi> yet they may
enter, Heaven is not inaccessible to them. Their errors are no such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable
Istmus's between them and Salvation, but that <hi>Contrition</hi>
may make a way through them. All their Schisme and Heresy is no
such fatall poison, but that if a man ioyne with it the Antidote of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
repentance, he may dye in it, and live for ever. Thus much then
being acknowledged, I appeal to any indifferent reader, whether C.
M. be not by his <hi>Hyperaspist</hi> forsaken in the plain field, and the point
in question granted to <hi>D. Potter,</hi> viz. <hi>That Protestancy even without a
particular repentance, is not destructive of Salvation;</hi> so that all the
Controversy remaining now, is, not simply whether <hi>Protestancy unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
destroies salvation?</hi> as it was at first proposed, but <hi>Whether Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy
in it selfe</hi> (that is <hi>abstracting from ignorance and contrition) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies
Salvation?</hi> So that as a foolish fellow who gave a Knight the
Lye, desiring withall leave of him to set his Knighthood aside, was
answered by him, that he would not suffer any thing to be set aside
that belonged unto him: So might we justly take it amisse, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7615:34"/>
as you doe ignorance and repentance such necessary things
for us, you are not more willing to consider us with them, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. For my part such is my charity to you, that considering
what great necessity <hi>You</hi> have, as much as any <hi>Christian society in the
World,</hi> that these sanctuaries of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
stand open, I can very hardly perswade my selfe so much as in
my most secret consideration to devest you of these so needfull quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications:
But whensoever your errors, superstitions and impieties
come into my mind, (and besides the generall bonds of humanity and
Christianity, my own particular obligations to many of you, such
and so great, that you cannot perish without a part of my selfe,) my
only comfort is amidst these agonies, that the Doctrine and practise
too of repentance, is yet remaining in your Church: And that though
you put on a face of confidence of your innocence in point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
yet you will be glad to stand in the eye of mercy as well as your
fellowes, and not be so stout, as to refuse either Gods pardon or the
Kings.</p>
               <p>6 But for the present, Protestancy is called to the barre, and
though not sentenc'd by you to death without mercy, yet arraigned
of so much naturall malignity (if not corrected by <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi>)
as to be <hi>in it selfe, destructive of Salvation.</hi> Which controversy
I am content to dispute with you, tying my selfe to follow the Rules
prescribed by you in your <hi>Preface.</hi> Only I am to remember you, that
the adding of this limitation (<hi>in it selfe</hi>) hath made this a new Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
and that this is not the conclusion for which you were charged
with <hi>want of Charity.</hi> But that whereas according to the grounds of
your own Religion, <hi>Protestants may dye in their supposed errors, either
with excusable ignorance, or with Contrition, and if they doe so may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
you still are peremptory in pronouncing them damn'd. Which
position supposing your Doctrine true, and ours false, as it is farre from
<hi>Charity,</hi> (whose essential character it is, <hi>to judge and hope the best,</hi>) so
I beleeve that I shall cleerly evince this new, but more moderate asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of yours to be farre from verity, &amp; that it is <hi>Popery, and not Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which in it selfe destroies Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7 <hi>Ad</hi> § 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. In your gradation I shall rise so farre with you
as to grant, <hi>that Christ founded a visible Church, stored with all helps
necessary to salvation, particularly with sufficient meanes to beget and
conserve faith, to maintain unity, and compose schismes, to discover and
condemne haeresies, and to determine all controversies in Religion,</hi> which
were necessary to be determin'd. For all these purposes, he gave at the
begining (as we may see in the Ep. to the <hi>Ephesians) Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Evangelists, Pastors, and Doctours:</hi> who by word of mouth
taught their comtemporaries, and by writings (wrot indeed by
some, but approved by all of them) taught their Christian posterity to
the worlds end, how all these ends, and that which is the end of all
these ends, Salvation, is to be archieved. And these meanes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God hath still preserved, and so preserved, that they are
sufficient for all these intents. I say <hi>sufficient,</hi> though, through the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7615:34"/>
malice of men, not alwaies <hi>effectuall,</hi> for that the same meanes may be
sufficient for the compassing an end, and not effectuall, you must not
deny, who hold that <hi>God gives to all men sufficient meanes of Salvation,
and yet that all are not sav'd.</hi> I said also, sufficient to determine all
controversies, which <hi>were necessary to be determin'd.</hi> For if some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
may for many ages be undetermined, and yet in the mean
while men be sav'd; why should, or how can the Churches being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
with effectuall meanes to determine <hi>all</hi> Controversies in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be necessary to Salvation, the end it selfe, to which these meanes
are ordained being as experience shewes not necessary? Plain sense will
teach every man, that the necessity of the meanes must alwaies be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by, and can never exceed the necessity of the end. As if eating be
necessary, only that I may live, then certainly if I have no necessity to
live, I have no necessity to eat. If I have no need to be at London, I
have no need of a horse to carry me thither. If I have no need to fly,
I have no need of wings. Answer me then I pray directly, and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically,
Is it necessary that all Controversies in Religion should be
determin'd, or is it not? If it be, why is the question of <hi>Predeterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
of the <hi>immaculate conception,</hi> of the <hi>Popes indirect power in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties,</hi>
so long undetermined? if not, what is it but hypocrisy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
such great necessity of such effectuall meanes, for the atchieving
that end, which is it selfe not necessary. Christians therefore have and
shall have <hi>means sufficient</hi> (though not alwaies effectuall) <hi>to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
not all <hi>controversies</hi> but <hi>all necessary to be determined.</hi> I proceed
on farther with you, and grant that this meanes to decide controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
in Faith &amp; Religion must be indued with an Vniversall infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in whatsoever it propoundeth for a divine truth. For if it may be
false in any one thing of this nature, in any thing which God requires
men to believe, we can yeeld unto it but a wavering and fearfull as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in any thing. These grounds therefore I grant very readily, and
give you free leave to make your best advantage of them. And yet, to
deal truly, I doe not perceive how from the denyall of any of them it
would follow that Faith is Opinion: or from the granting them, that
it is not so. But for my part, whatsoever clamour you have raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, I think no otherwise of the Nature of Faith, I mean <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
Faith,</hi> then generally both Protestants and Papists doe; for I
conceive it <hi>an assent to divine Revelations upon the authority of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer.</hi>
Which though in many things it differ from opinion, (as
commonly the word <hi>opinion</hi> is understood) yet in some things, I
doubt not but you will confesse, that it agrees with it. As first, that as
Opinion is an Assent, so is faith also. Secondly that as Opinion so
Faith, is alwaies built upon lesse evidence then that of sense or science.
Which assertion you not only grant but mainly contend for in your
<hi>sixt Ch.</hi> Thirdly and lastly, that as Opinion, so Faith admits degrees;
and that as there may be a strong and weak Opinion, so there may be
a strong and weak Faith. These things if you wil grant (as sure if you
be in your right mind you will not deny any of them) I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
that this ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sounding word, <hi>Opinion,</hi> should be discarded, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7615:35"/>
that among the Intellectuall habits you should seek out some other
<hi>Genus</hi> for <hi>Faith.</hi> For I will never contend with any man about words,
who grants my meaning.</p>
               <p>8 <hi>But though the essence of Faith exclude not all weaknesse and
imperfection, yet may it be enquired, whether any certainty of Faith,
under the highest degree may be sufficient to please God and attain sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
Whereunto I answer, that though men are unreasonable, God
requires not any thing but Reason. They will not be pleas'd without
a down weight, but God is contented if the scale be turn'd. They
pretend, that heavenly things cannot be seen to any purpose, but by the
mid-day light: But God will be satisfied, if we receive any degree of
light which makes us leave the <hi>works of darknesse and walk as children
of the light.</hi> They exact a certainty of Faith above that of sence or sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
God desires only that we believe the conclusion, as much as the
premises deserve, that the strength of our Faith be equall or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the credibility of the motives to it. Now though I
have and ought to have an absolute certainty of this Thesis, <hi>All which
God reveales for truth is true,</hi> being a proposition that may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
or rather so evident to any one that understands it that it needs
it not; Yet of this Hypothesis, <hi>That all the Articles of our Faith were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
by God,</hi> we cannot ordinarily have any rationall and acquired
certainty, more then morall, founded upon these considerations: First
that the goodnesse of the precepts of Christianity, and the greatnesse
of the promises of it, shewes it, of all other Religions, most likely to
come from the fountain of goodnesse. And then that a constant, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and very generall Tradition, so credible, that no wise man
doubts of any other, which hath but the fortieth part of the credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this, such and so credible a Tradition, tell us, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
hath set his Hand and Seale to the truth of this Doctrine, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great, and glorious, and frequent miracles in confirmation of it.
Now our faith is an assent to this conclusion, that <hi>the Doctrine of
Christianity is true,</hi> which being deduc'd from the former <hi>Thesis,</hi>
which is Metaphysically certain, and from the former <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
whereof we can have but a Morall certainty, we cannot possibly by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
meanes be more certain of it then of the weaker of the premises;
as a River will not rise higher then the fountaine from which it
flowes. For the conclusion alwaies followes the worser part, if there
be any worse: and must be Negative, Particular, Contingent, or but
Morally certain, if any of the Propositions, from whence it is deriv'd
be so: Neither can we be certain of it in the highest degree, unlesse we
be thus certain of all the principles whereon it is grounded. As a man
cannot goe or stand strongly, if either of his leggs be weak. Or as a
building cannot be stable, if any one of the necessary pillars thereof be
infirme and instable. Or as, If a message be brought me, from a man
of absolute credit with me, but by a messenger that is not so, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of the truth of the Relation, cannot but be rebated and lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by my diffidence in the Relatour.</p>
               <p>9 Yet all this I say not as if I doubted, that the spirit of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7615:35"/>
implor'd by devout and humble prayer and syncere obedience,
may, and will be degrees, advance his servants higher, and give them a
certainty of adherence, beyond their certainty of evidence. But what
God gives as a reward to believers, is one thing: and what he requires
of all men, as their duty, is another: and what he will accept of out of
grace and favour, is yet another. To those that believe and live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thir faith, he gives by degrees the <hi>spirit of obsignation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi>
which makes them know (though how they know not) what
they did but believe: And to be as fully and resolutely assur'd of the
Gospell of Christ, as those which heard it from Christ himselfe with
their eares, which saw it with their eyes, which looked upon it, and
whose hands handled the word of life. He requires of all, that their
Faith should be (as I have said) proportionable to the motives and
Reasons enforcing to it; he will accept of the weakest and lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Faith, if it be living and effectuall unto true obedience. For
he it is that <hi>will not quench the smoaking flaxe, nor break the bruised
reed.</hi> He did not reject the prayer of that distressed man that cryed
unto him, <hi>Lord I believe, Lord help my unbelief.</hi> He commands us to
<hi>receive them that are weak in faith,</hi> and thereby declares that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
them. And as nothing availes with him, but Faith <hi>which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by love:</hi> So any faith, if it be but as a <hi>grain of mustard seed,</hi> if it
<hi>work by love,</hi> shall certainly avail with him and be accepted of him.
Some experience makes mee fear, that the faith of considering and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
men, is like to be crack't with too much straining: And that
being possessed with this <hi>false</hi> Principle, that it is in vain to believe the
Gospell of Christ, with such a kind or degree of assent, as they yeeld
to other matters of Tradition: And finding that their faith of it, is to
them undiscernable, from the belief they give to the truth of other
Stories; are in danger either not to believe at all, thinking not at all as
good as to no purpose, or else, though indeed they doe believe it,
yet to think they doe not, and to cast themselves into wretched ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and perplexities, as fearing they have not that, without which it is
impossible to pleas God and obtain eternall happinesse. Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this advantage, which the Divell probably may make of this
Phancy, made me willing to insist somewhat largely upon the Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.</p>
               <p>10 I returne now thither from whence I have digressed, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you, concerning the grounds afore-laid, which were, that there is
a <hi>Rule of Faith, whereby controversies may be decided, which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be decided,</hi> and that <hi>this rule is universally infallible,</hi> That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
any opinion I hold, touching Faith, or any thing else, I
may, and doe believe them, as firmely as you pretend to doe. And
therefore you may build on, in Gods name, for by Gods helpe, I shall
alwaies imbrace, whatsoever structure is naturally and rationally laid
upon them, whatsoever conclusion may, to my understanding, be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
deduced from them. You say, out of them it undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<hi>That of two disagreeing in matter of Faith, the one cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but by repentance or ignorance.</hi> I answere by distinction of those
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7615:36"/>
termes, <hi>two dissenting in a matter of Faith.</hi> For it may bee either in a
thing which is indeed a <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> in the strictest sense, that is,
something, the Beliefe whereof God requires under paine of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And so the conclusion is true, though the Consequence of it from
your former premisses either is none at all, or so obscure, that I can
hardly discerne it. Or it may be as it often falls out concerning a thing
which being indeed <hi>no matter of Faith, is yet overvalued</hi> by the Parties
at variance, and esteemed to be so. And in this sense it is neither conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
nor true. The untruth of it I haue already declared in my exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of your Preface. The inconsequence of it is of it selfe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
for who ever heard of a wilder Collection then this—</p>
               <p>God hath provided meanes sufficient to decide all Controversies
in Religion, necessary to be decided;</p>
               <p>This meanes is universally infallible,</p>
               <p>Therefore of two, that differ in anything which they esteeme a
matter of Faith, one cannot be saved.</p>
               <p>He that can finde any connection between these Propositions, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
will be able to finde good coherence between the deafe Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe's
accusation, in the Greek Epigram, and the deafe Defendants An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and the deafe Iudges sentence; And to contriue them all into a
formall Categoricall Syllogisme.</p>
               <p>11 Indeed if the matter in agitation were plainely decided, by
this infallible meanes of deciding Controversies, and the Parties in
variance knew it to be so, and yet would stand out in their dissention;
this were in one of them, direct opposition to the Testimonie of God,
and undoubtedly a damnable sinne. But if you take the liberty to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
what you please, you may very easily conclude what you list. For
who is so foolish as to grant you these unreasonable Postulates, that
every emergent Controversie of Faith is plainly decided by the means
of decision which God hath appointed, and that of the Parties liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigant,
one is alwaies such a convicted Recusant as you pretend! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if you say so, having no better warrant then you haue, or can
haue for it, this is more proper and formall uncharitablenesse, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was charg'd upon you. Me thinks, with much more Reason, and
much more Charity, you might suppose, that many of these Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
which are now disputed among Christians (all which professe
themselues lovers of Christ, and truly desirous to knowe his will and
doe it (are either <hi>not decidable</hi> by that meanes which God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and so not necessary to be decided: Or if they be, yet <hi>not so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and evidently,</hi> as to oblige all men to hold one way: or Lastly, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidable,
and evidently decided, yet you may hope that the erring part,
by reason of some veile before his eyes, <hi>some excusable ignorance or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
preiudice,</hi> does not see the Question to be decided against
him, and so opposes not that which He doth know to be the word of
God, but only that which You know to be so, and which hee might
know, were he void of prejudice. Which is a fault I confesse, but a fault
which is incident even to good and honest men very often: and not of
such a gigantique disposition as you make it, to fly directly upon God
Almighty, and to giue him the lye to his face.</p>

12 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. In all this long discourse
you only tell us what you will doe, but doe nothing. Many Positions
there are, but proofes of them you offer none, but reserue them to the
Chapters following; and there in their proper places they shall be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
The summe of all your Assumpts collected by your selfe, §. 16
is this. That <hi>the infallible meanes of determining Controversies, is the
visible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> he distinction of points Fundamentall, and not Fundamentall,
maketh nothing to the present Question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> to say the Creed containeth all Fundamentals, is neither pertinent
nor true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> whosoever persist in Division from the Communion and Faith of
the Roman Church are guilty of Schisme and Heresie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> in regard of the Precept of Charity towards ones selfe, Protestants
are in state of sinne, while they remaine divided from the Romane
Church.</p>
               <p>To all these Assertions I will content my selfe for the present to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this one, That <hi>not one of them all is true.</hi> Only I may not omit to
tell you, that if the first of them were as true as the Pope himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
it should be, yet the corollary which you deduce from it, would
be utterly inconsequent, That <hi>whosoever denies any point propos'd by the
Church, is iniurious to Gods Divine Maiestie, as if He could deceiue, or
be deceived.</hi> For though your Church were indeed as <hi>Infallible a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder
of Divine Truths</hi> as it pretends to be, yet if it appear'd not to
me to be so, I might very well belieue God most true, &amp; your Church
most false. As though the Gospell of S. <hi>Mathew</hi> be the word of God,
yet if I neither knew it to be so, nor believed it, I might belieue in God,
and yet think that Gospell a Fable. Hereafter therefore I must entreat
you to remember, that our being guilty of this impiety, depends not
only upon your being, but upon our knowing that you are so. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must you argue thus, <hi>The Church of Rome is the Infallible Propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Divine Verities, therefore he that opposes Her calls Gods Truth in
Question:</hi> But thus rather; The <hi>Church of Rome is so, and Protestants
know it to be so, therefore in opposing her, they impute to God, that either he
deceiues them, or is deceived himselfe.</hi> For as I may deny something
which you upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your knowledge have affirm'd, &amp; yet never disparage
your honesty, if I never knew that you affirm'd it: So I may bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
certaine of Gods Omniscience, and Veracitie, &amp; yet doubt
of something which he hath revealed, provided I doe not knowe, nor
belieue that he hath revealed it. So, that though your Church be the
appointed witnesse of Gods Revelations yet untill you know, that we
know she is so, you cannot without foule calumnie impute to us, That
<hi>we charge God blasphemously with deceiving, or being deceived.</hi> You will
say perhaps, That this is directly consequent from our Doctrine, That
the <hi>Church may erre,</hi> which is directed by God in all her proposalls.
True, if we knew it to be directed by him, otherwise not; much lesse if
we belieue, and know the contrary. But then if it were consequent
from our opinion, haue you so little Charitie as to say, that men are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7615:37"/>
                  <hi>iustly chargeable with all the consequences of their Opinions;</hi> Such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
I mean, as they doe not owne but disclaim, and if there were
a necessity of doing either, would much rather forsake their Opinion
then imbrace these Consequences? What opinion is there that draws
after it such a train of <hi>portentous blasphemies,</hi> as that of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi>
by the judgement of the best Writers of your own <hi>Order?</hi> And will
you say now that the <hi>Dominicans</hi> are justly chargable with all these
blasphemies? If not, seeing our case (take it at the worst) is but the
same, why should not your judgement of us be the same? I appeale
to all those Protestants that haue gone over to your side; whether
when they were most averse from it, they did ever deny or doubt of
<hi>Gods omniscience or Veracitie;</hi> whether they did ever belieue, or were
taught, that <hi>God did deceiue them or was deceiued himselfe.</hi> Nay, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
to you your selfe, &amp; desire you to deale truly, &amp; to tell Us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you doe in your heart belieue, that we doe indeed not belieue the
eternall Veracitie of the eternall Verity? And if you judge so strangely
of us, having no better ground for it, then you haue or can haue, wee
shall not need any farther proofe of your uncharitablenes towards us,
this being the extremity of true uncharitablenesse. If not, then I hope
having no other ground but this (which sure is none at all) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
us <hi>damnable Heretiques,</hi> you will cease to doe so; and hereafter
(as, if your ground be true, you may doe with more truth and Charity)
collect thus, <hi>They only erre damnably, who oppose what they know God
hath testified,</hi> But <hi>Protestants sure doe not oppose what they knowe God
hath testified, at least we cannot with Charity say they doe, Therefore they
either doe not erre damnably, or with charity we cannot say they doe so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13 <hi>Ad</hi> § 17. <hi>Protestants</hi> (you say) <hi>according to their own grounds
must hold that of Persons contrary in whatsoever point of beleife one
part only can be saved, therefore it is strangely done of them to charge
Papists with want of Charity for holding the same.</hi> The consequence I
acknowledge, but wonder much what it should be that laies upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
any necessity to doe so! You tell us it is their holding <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the sole Rule of Faith:</hi> for this, you say, obligeth them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them damn'd, that oppose any least point <hi>delivered in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
This I grant, If they oppose it after sufficient declaration, so that
either they <hi>know it to be contain'd in Scripture,</hi> or have no just probable
Reason, and which may moue an honest man to doubt whether or no
it be there contained. For to oppose in the first case in a man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues
the Scripture to be the word of God, is to giue God the lye. To
oppose in the second, is to be obstinate against Reason, and therefore a
sinne though not so great as the former. But then this is nothing to the
purpose of the necessity of damning all those that are of contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe;
and that for these Reasons. First, because the contrary beliefe
may be touching a point not at all mentioned in Scripture; and such
points, though indeed they be not <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> yet by men in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
are often over-valued and esteem'd to be so. So that, though it
were damnable to oppose any point contain'd in Scripture; yet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of a contrary beliefe (as <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Polycrates,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7615:37"/>
                  <hi>Stephen</hi>) might both be saved, because their contrary beliefe was not
touching any point contained in Scripture. Secondly, because the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
beliefe may be about the sense of some place of Scripture which
is ambiguous, and with probabilitie capable of diverse senses; and in
such cases it is no marvell, and sure no sinne, if severall men goe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
waies. Thirdly because the contrary beliefe may bee concerning
points wherein Scripture may with so great probabilitie bee alleaged
on both sides, (which is a sure note of a point <hi>not necessary</hi>) that men
of honest and upright hearts, true lovers of God and of truth, such as
desire, aboue all things, to know Gods will and to doe it, may, without
any fault at all, some goe one way, and some another, &amp; some (&amp; those
as good men as either of the former) suspend their judgements, and
expect some <hi>Elias to solue doubts,</hi> and reconcile repugnancies. Now in
all such Questions one side or other (which soever it is) holds that
which indeed is opposite to the sense of the Scripture, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
for it is impossible that God should intend Contradictions.
But then this intended sense is not so fully declared, but that they
which oppose it may verily belieue that they indeed maintaine it, and
haue great shew of reason to induce them to belieue so; and therefore
are not to be damn'd, as men opposing that which they either knowe
to be a truth delivered in Scripture, or haue no probable Reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
the contrary; but rather in Charity to be acquitted and absolv'd,
as men who endeavour to finde the Truth, but fayle of it through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailty.</p>
               <p>This ground being laid, the Answer to your ensuing Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
which you conceiue impossible, is very obvious &amp; easie.</p>
               <p>14 <hi>To the first. Whether it be not in any man a grievous sinne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
any one Truth containd'd in holy Writ?</hi> I answer, Yes, if he knewe it
to be so, or haue no probable Reason to doubt of it: otherwise not.</p>
               <p>15 <hi>To the second. Whether there be in such deniall any distinction
between Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall &amp; not Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall sufficient to excuse from Heresie?</hi>
I answer, Yes, There is such a Distinction. But the Reason is, because
these points, either in themselues, or by accident, are <hi>Fundamentall,</hi>
which are <hi>evidently contain'd in Scripture, to him that knowes them to
be so:</hi> Those not Fundamentall which are there-hence deducible but
probably only, not evidently.</p>
               <p>16 <hi>To the third. Whether it be not impertinent to alleage the Creed as
containing all Fundamentall points of Faith, as if believing it alone wee
were at Libertie to deny all other Points of Scripture?</hi> I answer, It was
never alleag'd to any such purpose; but only as a sufficient, or rather
more then a sufficient Summarie of those points of Faith, which were
of necessity to be believed actually and explicitely; and that onely of
such which were meerely and purely <hi>Credenda,</hi> and not <hi>Agenda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17 <hi>To the fourth,</hi> drawn as a Corollary from the former, <hi>Whether
this be not to say, that of Persons contrary in beliefe, one part only can bee
saved?</hi> I answer, By no meanes. For they may differ about points <hi>not
contain'd in Scripture:</hi> They may differ about the <hi>sense of some ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
Texts</hi> of Scripture: They may differ about some Doctrines, for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7615:38"/>
and against which Scriptures may be alleadged with <hi>so great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
as may justly excuse either Part from Haeresie, and a selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
obstinacy. And therefore, though <hi>D. Potter</hi> doe not take it
ill, that you believe your selves may be sav'd in your Religion; yet
notwithstanding all that hath yet been pretended to the contrary, hee
may justly condemne you, and that out of your own principles, of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
presumption,</hi> for affirming as you doe, that <hi>no man can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F our estimation, respect, and reverence to holy Scripture even Protestants
themselves doe in fact give testimony, while they possesse it from us, and take
it upon the integrity of our custody. No cause imaginable could avert our
will from giving the function of supreme and sole Iudge to holy writ, if both
the thing were not impossible in it selfe, and if both reason and experience
did not convince our understanding, that by this assertion Contentions are
increased, and not ended. We acknowledge holy Scripture to be a most
perfect rule, for as much as a writing can be a Rule: We only deny that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
either divine Tradition, though it be unwritten, or an externall Iudge to keep, to propose,
to interpret in a true, Orthodoxe, and Catholique sense. Every single book, every Chapter, yea
every period of holy Scripture is infallibly true, and wants no due perfection. But must we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
inferre, that all other Books of Scripture, are to be excluded, least by addition of them, we
may seem to derogate from the perfection of the former? When the first Bookes of the old and
new Testament were written, they did not exclude unwritten Traditions, nor the Authority of
the Church to decide Controversies; and who hath then so altered their nature, and filled them
with such jealousies, as that now they cannot agree for fear of mutuall disparagement? What
greater wrong is it for the written Word, to be compartner now with the unwritten, then for the
unwritten, which was once alone, to be afterward joyned with the written? Who ever heard,
that sto commend the fidelity of a Keeper, were to disauthorize the thing committed to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody?
Or that, to extoll the integrity and knowledge, and to avouch the necessity of a Iudge
in suits of Law, were to deny perfection in the Law? Are there not in Common wealths besides
the Lawes written &amp; unwritten, customes, Iudges appointed to declare both the one, &amp; the other,
as severall occasions may require?</p>
               <p>2 That the Scripture alone cannot be Iudge in Controversies of faith, we gather very cleerly,
From the quality of a writing in generall: From the nature of holy Writ in particular, which must
be beheved as true, and infallible: From the Editions, and translations of it: From the difficulty
to understand it without hazard of Errour: From the inconveniences that must follow upon the
ascribing of sole Iudicature to it: and finally from the Confessions of our Adversaries. And on
the other side, all these difficulties ceasing, and all other qualities requisite to a Iudge concurring
in the visible Church of Christ our Lord, we must conclude, that she it is, to whom in doubts
concerning Faith and Religion, all Christians ought to have recourse.</p>
               <p>3 The name, notion, nature, and properties of a Iudge cannot in common reason agree to
any meere writing, which, be it otherwise in its kind, never so highly qualified with sanctity and
infallibility; yet it must ever be, as all writings are, deaf, dumb, and inanimate. By a Iudge, all
wise men understand a Person endued with life, and reason, able to hear; to examine, to declare
his mind to the disagreeing parties, in such sort as that each one may know whether the sentence
be in favour of his cause, or against his pretence, and he must be appliable, and able to doe all
this, as the diversity of Controversies, persons, occasions, and circumstances may require, There
is a great and plain distinction betwixt a <hi>Iudge</hi> and a <hi>Rule.</hi> For as in a Kingdome, the Iudge
hath his rule to follow which are the received Lawes and Customes; so are not they fit or able
to declare, or be Iudges to themselves, but that office must belong to a living Iudge. The holy
Scripture may be, and is a Rule, but cannot be a Iudge, because it being alwaies the same, cannot
declare it selfe any one time, or upon any one occasion more particularly then upon any other; and
let it be read over an hundred times, it will be still the same, and no more fit alone to terminate
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7615:38"/>
controversies in faith, then the Law would be to end suits, if it were given over to the phancy, and
glosse of every single man.</p>
               <p>4 This difference betwixt a Iudge and a Rule, <hi>D. Potter</hi> perceived, when more then once,
having stiled the Scripture a <hi>Iudge,</hi> by way of correcting that terme, he addes, <hi>or rather a Rule,</hi>
because he knew that an inanimate writing could not be a <hi>Iudge.</hi> From hence also it was, that
though Protestants in their begining affirmed Scripture alone to be the Iudge of Controversies;
yet upon a more advised reflection, they changed the phrase, and said, that not Scripture, but the
Holy Ghost speaking in Scripture, is Iudge in Controversies. A difference without a disparity.
The holy Ghost speaking only in Scripture is no more intelligible to us, then the Scripture in
which he speaks: as a man speaking only Latin, can be no better understood, then the tongue
wherein he speaketh. And therefore to say, a Iudge is necessary for deciding controversies, about
the meaning of Scripture is as much as to say, he is necessary to decide what the Holy Ghost
speakes in Scripture. And it were a conceyt, equally foolish and pernitious, if one should seek
to take away all Iudges in the Kingdome, upon this nicety, that albeit Lawes cannot be Iudges,
yet the Law-maker speaking in the Law, may performe that Office; as if the Law-maker speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Law, were with more perspicuity understood, then the Law whereby he speaketh.</p>
               <p>5 But though some writing were granted to have a priviledge, to declare it selfe upon suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
that it were maintained in being, and preserved entire from corruptions; yet it is manifest,
that no writing can conserve it selfe, nor can complaine, or denounce the falsifier of it; and
therefore it stands in need of some watchfull and not erring eye, to guard it, by meanes of whose
assured vigilancy, we may undoubtedly receive it syncere and pure.</p>
               <p>6 And suppose it could defend it selfe from corruption, how could it assure us that it selfe
were Canonicall, and of infallible verity? By saying so? Of this very <hi>affirmation,</hi> there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the same Question still; how it can prove it selfe to be infallibly true? Neither can there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be an end of the like multiplied demands, till we rest in the externall Authority of some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or persons bearing witnes to the world, that such, or such a book is Scripture: and yet upon
this point according to Protestants all other Controversies in faith depend.</p>
               <p>7 That Scripture cannot assure us, that it selfe is Canonicall Scripture, is acknowledged by
some Protestants in expresse words, and by all of them in deeds. <hi>M. Hooker,</hi> whom D. <hi>Potter</hi>
ranketh<note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 131.</note> among men of great <hi>learning and Iudgement,</hi> saith: <hi>of things</hi>

                  <hi>necessary, the very
chiefest is to know what books we are to esteem holy; which point is confessed impossible for the

should be believed as an Article of the faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation:</hi> and
concerning their belief and profession of this Article, they are particularly examined when they

               </p>
               <p>8 But now in deeds, they all make good, that without the Churches authority, no certainty
can be had what Scripture is Canonicall, while they cannot agree in assigning the Canon of holy
Scripture. Of the Epistle of <hi>S. Iames, Luther</hi> hath these words: <hi>The</hi>

because they may with as much freedome abandon him, as hee was bold to alter that
Canon of Scripture, which he found receaved in Gods Church.</p>
               <p>9 What Bookes of Scripture the Protestants of England hold for Canonicall, is not
easie to affirme. In their <hi>sixt Article</hi> they say <hi>In the name of the holy Scripture, who doe
understand those Canonicall Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was
never any doubt in the Church.</hi> What meane they by these words? That by the Churches
consent they are assured what Scriptures be Canonicall? This were to make the Church
Iudge, and not Scriptures alone. Doe they only understand the agreement of the Church
to be a probable inducement? Probability is no sufficient ground for an infallible assent of
faith. By this rule (<hi>of whose authority was NEVER any doubt in the Church</hi>) the whole
book of <hi>Esther</hi> must quit the Canon, because some in the Church haue excluded it from
the Canon, as<note n="o" place="margin">Apud Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb. l. 4. hist. c. 26.</note>

of the Prophets Books: <hi>The Sermons of no Prophet, were written whole, and perfect,
but their Disciples, and Auditors snatched, now one sentence, and then another, and so put
them all into one book, and by this meanes the Bible was conserved.</hi> If this were so, the
Books of the Prophets, being not written by themselues, but promiscuously, and casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by their Disciples, will soone be called in question. Are not these errours of <hi>Luther,</hi>
fundamentall? and yet if Protestants deny the infallibility of the Church, upon what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ground can they disproue these <hi>Lutherian,</hi> and <hi>Luciferian</hi> blasphemies? ô godly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former
of the Roman Church! But to returne to our English Canon of Scripture. In the
New Testament by the aboue mentioned rule (<hi>of whose authority was never any doubt
in the Church</hi>) divers Books of the New Testament must be discanonized, to wit, all those
of which some Ancients haue doubted, and those which divers <hi>Lutherans</hi> haue of late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
It is worth the observation how the before-mentioned <hi>sixt Article,</hi> doth specify by
name all the Books of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> which they hold for Canonicall; but those of
the <hi>New Testament, as they are commonly receaved, we doe recieue, and account them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall.</hi>
The mystery is easily to be unfolded. If they had descended to particulars, they
must haue contradicted some of their chiefest Brethren. <hi>As they are commonly recieued,</hi> &amp;c.
I aske: By whom? By the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Then, by the same reason they must receiue
divers Books of the Old Testament, which they reject. By <hi>Lutherans?</hi> Then with <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
they may deny some Books of the New Testament. If it bee the greater, or lesse
number of voices, that must cry up, or down, the Canon of Scripture, our <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
will prevaile: and among Protestants the <hi>Certainty</hi> of their <hi>Faith</hi> must be reduced to
an <hi>Vncertaine</hi> Controversie of <hi>Fact,</hi> whether the number of those who reject, or of those
others who recieue such and such Scriptures, bee greater. Their Faith must alter accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to yeares, and daies. When <hi>Luther</hi> first appeared, he, and his Disciples were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
number of that new Church; and so this claime (<hi>Of being commonly received</hi>) stood
for them, till <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> grew to some equall, or greater number then that of
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and then this rule of (<hi>Commonly received</hi>) will canonize their Canon against
the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> I would gladly know, why in the former part of their Article, they say both
of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament: In the name of the holy Scripture, we doe understand those
Canonicall Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt
in the Church.</hi> and in the latter part, speaking againe of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> they giue a
farre different rule, saying: <hi>All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly
received, we doe receiue, and account them Canonicall.</hi> This I say is a rule much different
from the former (<hi>Of whose authority was NEVER any doubt in the Church.</hi>) For some
Books might be said to be <hi>Commonly received,</hi> although they were <hi>sometime</hi> doubted of <hi>by
some.</hi> If to be <hi>Commonly received,</hi> passe for a good rule to know the Canon of the <hi>New
Testament;</hi> why not of the <hi>Old?</hi> Aboue all we desire to know, upon what infallible ground
in some Bookes they agree with us against <hi>Luther,</hi> and divers principall <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and in
others jump with <hi>Luther</hi> against us? But seeing they disagree among themselues, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that they haue no certaine rule to know the Canon of Scripture, in assigning whereof
some of them must of necessity erre, because of contradictory propositions both cannot be true.</p>
               <p>10 Moreover the letters, syllables, words, phrase, or matter contained in holy Scripture
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7615:39"/>
haue no necessary, or naturall connection with divine <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>Inspiration:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by seeing, reading, or understanding them, we cannot inferre that they proceed from
God, or be confirmed by divine authoritie, as because <hi>Creatures</hi> involve a necessary rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
connection, and dependance on their <hi>Creator,</hi> Philosophers may by the light of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reason, demonstrate the existence of one prime cause of all things. In Holy Wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
there are innumerable truths not surpassing the spheare of humane wit, which are, or may
be delivered by Pagan Writers, in the selfe same words and phrase as they are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And as for some truths peculiar to Christians, (for Example, the mystery of the
blessed Trinitie &amp;c.) The only setting them down in <hi>Writing</hi> is not enough to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that such a <hi>Writing</hi> is the undoubted word of God: otherwise some sayings of <hi>Plato,
Tris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>egistus, Sybils, Ovid, &amp;c.</hi> must be esteemed Canonicall Scripture, because they fall
upon some truths proper to Christian Religion. The internall <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>inspiration</hi> which
directed and moved the Authors of Canonicall Scriptures, is a hidden <hi>Qualitie</hi> infused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their understanding and will, and hath no such particular sensible influence into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<hi>Writing,</hi> that <hi>in it</hi> we can discover, or <hi>from it</hi> demonstrate any such secret <hi>light</hi>
and <hi>inspiration;</hi> and therefore to be assured that such a <hi>Writing</hi> is divine we cannot know
from it selfe alone, but by some other extrinsecall authority.</p>
               <p>11 And here we appeale to any man of judgement, whether it be not a vaine brag
of some Protestants to tell us, that they wot full well what is Scripture, by the light of
Scripture it selfe, or (as <hi>D. Potter</hi> words it) <hi>by</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Pag. 141.</note> 
                  <hi>that glorious beame of divine light
which shines therein;</hi> even as our eye distinguisheth light from darknesse, without any
other help then light it selfe; and as our eare knowes a voice, by the voice it selfe alone.
But this vanity is refuted, by what we said even now; that the externall Scripture hath no
apparent or necessary connection with divine <hi>inspiration,</hi> or <hi>revelation.</hi> Will <hi>D. Poiter</hi> hold
all his Bretheren for blinde men, for not seeing <hi>that glorious beam of divine light which
shines in Scripture,</hi> about which they cannot agree? Corporall light may be discerned by
it selfe alone, as being evident, proportionate, and connaturall to our faculty of seeing.
That Scripture is Divine, and inspired by God, is a truth exceeding the naturall capacity
and compasse of mans understanding, to us obscure, and to be believed by divine faith,
which according to the <hi>Apostle</hi> is; <hi>argumentum</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. v. 1,</note> 
                  <hi>non apparentium; an argument,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
<hi>of things not evident:</hi> and therefore no wonder if Scripture doe not manifest it selfe
by it selfe alone, but must require some other meanes for applying it to our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Neverthelesse their own similitudes and instances, make against themselues. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a man had never read, or heard of Sunne, Moone, Fire, Candle, &amp;c. and should bee
brought to behold a light, yet in such sort as that the Agent, or Cause efficient from
which it proceeded, were kept hidden from him; could such a one, by only beholding the
light, certainly know, whether it were produced by the Sunne, or Moone &amp;c.? Or if one
heare a voice, and had never known the speaker, could he know from whom in particular
that voice proceeded? They who look upon Scripture, may well see, that some one wrote
it, but that it was written by divine inspiration, how shall they know? Nay, they cannot so
much as know who wrote it, unlesse they first know the writer, and what hand he writes:
as likewise I cannot know whose voice it is which I heare, unlesse I first both know the
person who speakes, and with what voice he useth to speak; and yet even all this supposed,
I may perhaps be deceaved. For there may be voices so like, and Hand so counterfeited,
that men may be deceaved by them, as birds were by the grapes of that skilfull Painter.
Now since Protestants affirme knowledge concerning God as our <hi>supernaturall</hi> end, must
be taken from Scripture, they cannot in Scripture alone discerne that it is his voice, or
writing, because they cannot know from whom a writing, or vioce proceeds, unlesse first
they know the person who speake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>', or writeth. Nay I say more: By Scripture alone,
they cannot so much as know, that any person doth in it, or by it, speak any thing at all:
because one may write without intent to signifie, or affirme any thing, but onely to set
downe, or as it were paint, such characters, syllables, and words, as men are wont to set
copies, not caring what the signification of the words imports: or as one transcribes a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
which himselfe understands not; or when one writes what another dictates, and in
other such cases, wherein it is cleare, that the writer speakes, or signifies nothing in such
his writing; and therefore by <hi>it</hi> we cannot heare, or understand <hi>his</hi> voice. With what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
then can any man affirme, that by Scripture it selfe they can see, that the writers
did intend to signifie any thing at all; that they were Apostles, or other Canonicall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
that they wrote their own sense, and not what was dictated by some other man;
and finally, and especially, that they wrote by the infallible direction of the Holy Ghost?</p>
               <p>12 But let us be liberall, and for the present suppose (not grant) that Scripture is,
like to corporall light, by it selfe alone able to determine, and moue our understanding to
assent; yet the similitude proues against themselues. For light is not visible, except to such
as haue eyes, which are not made by the light, but must be presupposed as produced by
some other cause. And therefore, to hold the similitude, Scripture can be cleare onely to
those who are endued with the eye of faith; or, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> aboue cited saith, to all
that <hi>haue</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 141<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7615:40"/>
after he speaketh. Faith then must not originally proceed from Scripture, but is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed,
before we can see the light thereof; and consequently there must be some other meanes
precedent to Scripture to beget Faith, which can be no other then the Church.</p>
               <p>13 Others affirme, that they know Canonicall Scriptures to be such, by the <hi>Title</hi> of the
Bookes. But how shall we know such <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> or <hi>Titles</hi> to be infallibly true? From this their

                  <hi>D. Covell</hi> acknowledgeth in
these words: <hi>It is not the word of God, which doth, or possibly can assure us, that we doe well to
think it is the word of God: the first outward motion leading men so to esteem of the Scripture, is
the Authority of Gods Church, which teacheth us to receive Marks Gospell, who was not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
and to refuse the Gospell of Thomas who was an Apostle: and to retain Lukes Gospell who
saw not Christ, and to reiect the Gospell of Nicodemus who saw him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14 Another Answer, or rather Objection they are wont to bring: That the Scripture being
a <hi>principle needs no proof among Christians.</hi> So<note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 234.</note> D. <hi>Potter.</hi> But this is either a plain begging
of the question, or manifestly untrue, and is directly against their own doctrine, and practise. If
they mean, that Scripture is one of those principles, which being the first, and the most known in
all Sciences, cannot be demonstrated by other Principles, they suppose that which is in question,
whether there be not some principle (for example, the Church) whereby we may come to the
knowledge of Scripture. If they intend, that Scripture is a Principle, but not the first, and most
known in Christianity, then Scripture may be proved. For principles, that are not the first, not
known of themselves, may, and ought to be proved, before we can yeild assent, either to them,
or to other verities depending on them. It is repugnant to their own doctrine, and practise, in as
much as they are wont to affirme, that one part of Scripture may be known to be Canonicall, and
may be interpreted by another. And since every Scripture is a principle sufficient, upon which
to ground divine faith, they must grant, that one Principle may, and sometime must be proved
by another. Yea this their Answer, upon due ponderation, falls out to prove, what we affirme.
For since all Principles cannot be proved, we must (that our labour may not be endlesse) come at
length to rest in some principle; which may not require any other proof. Such is <hi>Tradition,</hi> which
involves an evidence of fact, and from hand to hand, and age to age, bringing us up to the <hi>times,</hi>
and <hi>Persons</hi> of the Apostles, and our Saviour himselfe cometh to be confirmed by all those mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and other arguments, whereby they convinced their doctrine to be true. Wherefore the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers avouch that we must receive the sacred Canon upon the credit of Gods Church.

by the perfidious Iewes, who either by ignorance might mistake, or upon malice force the Text,
to favour their impieties. And that the Hebrew Text still retaines much ambiguity, is apparent

16 Now concerning the Translations of Protestants, it will be sufficient to set down what
the laborious, exact, and jucicious Author of the <hi>Protestants Apology &amp;c.</hi> dedicated to our late
King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory, hath to this<note n="r" place="margin">Tast. 1. Sect. 10. subd. 4: joyned with tract. 2. cap. 2. Sect. 10. subd. 2.</note> purpose. To omit (saith he) particulars, whose
recitall would be infinite, and to touch this point but generally only, the Translation of the New
Testament by <hi>Luther</hi> is condemned by <hi>Andreas, O siander Keckermannus,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> who
saith hereof to <hi>Luther. Thou dost corrupt the word of God, thou art seen to be a manifest and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
corrupter of the holy Scriptures: how much are we ashamed of thee who have hitherto estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
thee beyond all measure, and now prove thee to be such a man?</hi> And in like manner doth <hi>Luther</hi>
reject the Translation of the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> terming them in matter of Divinity, fooles, Asses, Anu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,
deceavers, and of Asse-like understanding. In so much that when <hi>Froschoverus</hi> the Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glian
Printer of <hi>Zurich</hi> sent him a Bible translated by the Divines there, <hi>Luther</hi> would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the same, but sending it back reiected it, as the Protestant Writers <hi>Hospinianus,</hi> and <hi>Lava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therus</hi>
witnesse. The translation set forth by <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> and the Divines of <hi>Basil,</hi> is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>Beza,</hi> who affirmeth that the <hi>Basil Translation is in many places wicked, and altogether
differing from the mind of the Holy Ghost.</hi> The translation of <hi>Castalio</hi> is condemned by <hi>Beza,</hi> as
being <hi>sacrilegious, wicked,</hi> and <hi>Ethnicall.</hi> As concerning, <hi>Calvins</hi> translation, that learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Writer <hi>Carolus Molineus</hi> saith thereof: <hi>Calvin in his Harmony maketh the text of the Gospell
to leap up and down: he useth violence to the letter of the Gospell, and besides this addeth to the
Text.</hi> As touching <hi>Bezas</hi> translation (to omit the dislike had thereof by <hi>Selneccerus</hi> the German
Protestant of the Vniversity of <hi>Iena</hi>) the foresaid <hi>Molinaeus</hi> saith of him, <hi>de facto mutat textum;
he actually changeth the text,</hi> and giveth farther sundry instances of his corruptions: as also <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalio
that learned Calvinist, and most learned in the tongues,</hi> reprehendeth <hi>Beza</hi> in a whole book
of this matter, and saith; that to note all his errours in translation, <hi>would require a great volume.</hi>
And <hi>M. Parkes</hi> saith: <hi>As for the Geneva Bibles, it is to be wished that either they may be purged
from those manifold errors, which are both in the text, and in the margent; or else utterly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
All which confirmeth your Maiesties grave and learned Censure, in your <hi>thinking the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva
translation to be worst of all;</hi> and that in the <hi>Marginall notes annexed to the Geneva transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
some are very partiall, untrue, seditious, &amp;c.</hi> Lastly concerning the English Translation, the
Puritans say: <hi>Our translation of the Psalmes comprized in our Book of Common Prayer, doth in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
subtraction, and alteration, differ from the Truth of the Hebrew in two hundred places at
the least.</hi> In so much as they doe therefore professe to rest doubtfull, <hi>whether a man with a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
may subscribe thereunto.</hi> And <hi>M. Carlile</hi> saith of the English Translators, that they have
<hi>depraved the sense, obscured the truth, and deceived the ignorant; that in many places they doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
the Scriptures from the right sense.</hi> And that, <hi>they shew themselves to love darknesse more
then light, falshood more then truth.</hi> And the Ministers of Lincolne Diocesse give their publike
testimony, terming the English Translation: <hi>A Translation that taketh away from the Text; that
addeth to the Text; and that, sometime to the changing, or obscuring of the meaning of the Holy
Ghost.</hi> Not without cause therefore did your Majesty affirme, that you <hi>could never yet see a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
well translated into English.</hi> Thus farre the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Protestants Apology &amp;c.</hi> And I
cannot forbear to mention in particular that famous corruption of <hi>Luther,</hi> who in the Text
where it is said (<hi>Rom. 3. v. 28. We accompt a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the
Law,</hi> in favour of Iustification by faith <hi>alone,</hi> translateth (<hi>Iustified by faith ALONE.</hi>) As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the falsification of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> is no lesse notorious, who in the Gospels of <hi>S. Matthew,
Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and in <hi>S. Paul,</hi> in place of, <hi>This is my Body, This is my Blood,</hi> translates, <hi>This
signifies my Body, This signifies my blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> And here let Prorestants consider duely of these
points. Salvation cannot be hoped for without true faith: Faith according to them relies upon
Scripture alone: Scripture must be delivered to most of them by the Translations: Translations
depend on the skill and honesty of men, in whom nothing is more certain then a most certain
possibility to erre, and no greater evidence of truth, then that it is evident some of them imbrace
falshood, by reason of their contrary translations. What then remaineth, but that truth, faith,
salvation, and all, must in them rely upon a fallible, and uncertain ground? How many poore
soules are lamentably seduced, while from preaching Ministers, they admire a multitude of Texts
of divine Scripture, but are indeed the false translations, and corruptions of erring men? Let
them therefore, if they will be assured of true Scriptures, fly to the alwaies visible Catholique
Church, against which the gates of hell can never so farre prevaile, as that she shall be permitted
to deceive the Christian world with false Scriptures. And <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe, by unfortunate expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
was at length forced to confesse thus much saying: <hi>If the</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Lib. cont. Zwingl. deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. corp. Christiin Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char.</note> 
                  <hi>world last longer, it will be
again necessary to receive the decrees of Councels, and to have recourse to them, by reason of divers
interpretations of Scripture which now raigne.</hi> On the contrary side, the Translation approved by
the Roman Church, is commended even by our adversaries: and <hi>D. Covel</hi> in particular saith, <hi>that
it was used in the Church, one thousand</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">In his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere unto M. Iohn Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges pag. 94.</note>

                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>that Translation before others.</hi> In so much, that whereas the English translations be many,
and among themselves disagreeing, he concludeth, that of all those <hi>the approved translation au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by the Church of England, is that which commeth nearest to the vulgar, and is commonly
called the Bishops Bible.</hi> So that the truth of that translation which we use, must be the rule to
judge of the goodnesse of their Bibles: and therefore they are obliged to maintain our Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
if it were but for their own sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:7615:41"/>
17 <hi>But doth indeed the source of their manifold uncertainties stop here? No, The chiefest
difficulty remaines, concerning the true meaning of Scripture: for attaining whereof, if Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
had any certainty, they could not disagree so hugely as they doe. Hence M.</hi> Hooker <hi>saith:</hi>

to seek for the ending of contentions, by submitting it selfe unto some iudiciall, and definitive sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
whereunto neither part that contendeth may, under any pretence, refuse to stand. D. Fields
<hi>words are remarkable, to this purpose:</hi> Seeing (<hi>saith he</hi>) the controversies<note n="x" place="margin">In his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Church In his Epistle dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to the L. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop.</note> of Religion in our

strength of understanding to examine them; what remaineth for men desirous of satisfaction in
things of such consequence, but diligently to search out which among all the societies in the world,
is that blessed company of holy ones, that houshold of Faith, that Spouse of Christ, and Church of
the living God, which is the Pillar and ground of Truth, that so they may imbrace her communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
follow her directions, and rest in her iudgement?</p>
               <p>18 And now that the true Interpretation of Scripture, ought to be received from the Church,
it is also proved by what we have already demonstrated, that she it is, who must declare what
Bookes be true Scripture; wherein if she be assisted by the Holy Ghost, why should we not believe
her, to be infallibly directed concerning the true meaning of them? Let Protestants therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bring some proofe out of Scripture, that the Church is guided by the Holy Ghost in discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true Scripture, and not in delivering the true sense thereof; Or else give us leave to apply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               <p>19 But besides all this, the Scriptures cannot be Iudge of Controversies; who ought to be
such, as that to him not only the learned, or Veterans, but also the unlearned, and Novices, may
have recourse: for these being capable of salvation, and endued with faith of the same nature with
that of the learned, there must be some universall Iudge, which the ignorant may understand, and
to whom the greatest Clerks must submit. Such is the Church: and the Scripture is not such.</p>
               <p>20 Now, the inconveniences which follow by referring all Controversies to Scripture <hi>alone,</hi>
are very clear. For by this principle, all is finally in very deed and truth reduced to the <hi>internall

or point of faith is delivered by divine revelation of Gods word; if a man himselfe (without
any Teacher) by reading the Scriptures, or hearing them read, be convinced of the truth of any
such conclusion: this is a sufficient proposition to proue him that gainsaith any such proofe, to be an
Heretique, and obstinate opposer of the faith.</hi> Behold what goodly safe Propounders of faith arise
in place of Gods universall visible Church, which must yeeld to a single Preacher, a Neighbour, a
man himselfe if he can read, or at least haue eares to heare Scripture read. Verily I doe not see, but
that every well-governed Civill Commonwealth, ought to concurre towards the exterminating
of this doctrine, whereby the Interpretation of Scripture is taken from the Church, and conferred
upon every man, who, whatsoever is pretended to the contrary, may be a passionate seditious
creature.</p>
               <p>23 Moreover, there was no Scripture, or written word for about two thousand yeares from
<hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moyses,</hi> whom all acknowledge to haue been the first Author of Canonicall Scripture:
And againe for about two thousand yeares more, from <hi>Moyses</hi> to Christ our Lord, holy Scripture,
was only among the people of Israel; and yet there were Gentiles endued in those daies with
divine Faith, as appeareth in <hi>Iob,</hi> and his friends. Wherefore during so many ages, the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
was the Decider of Controversies, and Instructer of the faithfull. Neither did the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Moyses,</hi> depriue the Church of her former Infallibility, or other qualities requisite for a
Judge: yea <hi>D. Potter</hi> acknowledgeth, that besides the <hi>Law,</hi> there was a living <hi>Iudge</hi> in the Iewish
Church, endued with an <hi>absolutely infallible direction in cases of moment;</hi> as all points belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to divine Faith are. Now, the Church of Christ our Lord, was before the Scriptures of the
New Testament, which were not written instantly, nor all at one time, but successiuely upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
occasions; and some after the decease of most of the Apostles: and after they were written,
they were not presently knowne to all Churches: and of some there was doubt in the Church for
some Ages after our Saviour. Shall we then say, that according as the Church by little and little
received holy Scripture, she was by the like degrees devested of her possessed Infallibility, and
power to decide Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversies in Religion? That some time Churches had one Iudge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and others another? That with moneths, or yeares, as new Canonicall Scripture grew to be
published, the Church altered her whole Rule of faith, or Iudge of Controversies? After the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
time, and after the writing of Scriptures, Heresies would be sure to rise, requiring in Gods
Church for their discovery and condemnation, <hi>Infallibilitie,</hi> either to write new Canonicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as was done in the Apostles time by occasion of emergent heresies; or <hi>infallibilitie</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
Scriptures, already written, or, without Scripture, by divine unwritten Traditions, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
of the holy Ghost to determine all Controversies, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith: <hi>The soule is</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">De test. anim. cap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the letter; and speech before Bookes; and sense before stile.</hi> Certainly such <hi>addition</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with derogation, or <hi>subtraction</hi> from the former power and infallibilitie of the Church,
would haue brought to the world <hi>division</hi> in matters of faith, and the Church had rather lost,
then gained by holy Scripture (which ought to be far from our tongues and thoughts,) it being
manifest, that for decision of Controversies, infallibilitie setled in a living Iudge, is incomparably
more usefull and fit, then if it were conceived, as inherent in some inanimate writing. Is there such
repugnance betwixt Infallibility in the Church, and Existence of Scripture, that the <hi>production</hi> of
the one, must be the <hi>destruction</hi> of the other? Must the Church wax dry, by giving to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
the milke of sacred Writ? No, No. Her Infallibility was, and is derived from an inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
fountaine. If <hi>Protestants</hi> will haue the <hi>Scripture</hi> alone for their Iudge, let them first produce
some <hi>Scripture</hi> affirming, that by the <hi>entring</hi> thereof, Infallibilitie <hi>went out</hi> of the Church, <hi>D.
Potter</hi> may remember what himselfe teacheth; That the Church is still endued with infallibility
in points fundamentall, and consequently, that infallibility in the Church doth well agree with
the truth, the sanctity, yea with the sufficiency of Scripture, for all matters necessary to Salvation.
I would therefore gladly know, out of what Text he imagineth that the Church by the comming
of Scripture, was deprived of infallibility in some points, and not in others? He affirmeth that the
Iewish Synagogue retained infallibility in her selfe, notwithstanding the writing of the <hi>Old</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7615:42"/>
and will he so unworthily and unjustly depriue the Church of Christ of infallibilitie by
reason of the <hi>New</hi> Testament? E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Rites, Punishments, Iudgements, Sacraments, Sacrifices &amp;c. were more particularly, and
minutely delivered to the Iewes, then in the New Testament is done; our Saviour leaving the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
or declaration of particulars to his Spouse the Church, which therefore stands in need
of infallibility more then the Iewish Synagogue, <hi>D. Potter,</hi>

the power and infallibilitie of the Synagogue, objects; that we might as well inferre, that <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

is very cleare. The Synagogue was a type, and figure of the Church of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

civill government of Christian Common wealths, or kingdomes. The Church succeeded to the
Synagogue, but not Christian Princes to Iewish Magistrates: And the Church is compared to a

                  <note n="o" place="margin">Ioan. c. 10.</note> joyned <hi>Vnus Pastor. One sheepfold, one Pastour:</hi> But all distinct kingdomes, or
Common-wealths, are not one Army, Family, &amp;c. And finally, it is necessary to salvation, that all
haue recourse to one Church; but for temporall weale, there is no need that all submit, or depend
upon one temporall Prince, kingdome, or Common-wealth: and therefore our Saviour hath left
to his whole Church, as being <hi>One,</hi> one Law, one Scripture, the same Sacraments, &amp;c. Whereas
kingdomes haue their severall Lawes, different governments, diversity of Powers, Magistracy &amp;c.
And so this objection returneth upon <hi>D. Potter.</hi> For as in the <hi>One</hi> Community of the Iewes, there
was one Power and Iudge, to end debates, and resolue difficulties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so in the Church of Christ,
which is <hi>One,</hi> there must be some <hi>one</hi> Authority to decide all Controversies in Religion.</p>
               <p>24 <hi>This discourse is excellently proved by ancient</hi> S. Irenaeus<note n="p" place="margin">Lib. 5. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>in these words.</hi> What if the
Apostles had not left Scriptures, ought we not to haue followed the order of Tradition which they
delivered to those to whom they committed the Churches? to which order many Nations yeeld os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
who belieue in Christ, having salvation written in their hearts by the spirit of God, without
letters or Iuke, and diligently keeping ancient Tradition. It is easie to receiue the truth from Gods
Church, seeing the Apostles haue most fully deposited in her, as in a rich storehouse, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to truth. For what? if there should arise any contention of some small question, ought wee
not to haue recourse to the most ancient Churches, and from them to receiue what is certaine and
cleare concerning the present question?</p>
               <p>25 Besides all this, the doctrine of Protestants is destructiue of it selfe. For either they have
certaine, and infallible meanes not to erre in interpreting Scripture; or they haue not. If not; then
the Scripture (to them) cannot be a sufficient ground for infallible faith, nor a meet Iudge of
Controversies. If they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ue certaine infallible meanes, and so cannot erre in their interpretations
of Scriptures; then they are able with infallibility to heare, examine, and determine all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of faith; and so they may be, and are <hi>Iudges</hi> of Controversies, although they use the Scripture
as a <hi>Rule.</hi> And thus, against their own doctrine, they constitute another Iudge of Controversies,
besides Scripture alone.</p>
               <p>26 Lastly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

it is a fundamentall point. For he will haue against him, as many Protestants as teach that by
Scripture alone, it is impossible to knowe what Bookes be Scripture, which yet to Protestants is
the most necessary and chiefe point of all other. <hi>D. Covell</hi> expresly saith: <hi>Doubtlesse</hi>

who grant that Controversies cannot be ended, without some externall living authority,
as we noted before. Besides, how can it be in us a fundamentall errour to say, the Scripture alone
is not Iudge of Controversies, seeing (notwithstanding this our beliefe) wee use for interpreting
of Scripture, all the meanes which they prescribe; as Prayer, Conferring of places, Consulting the

that our doctrine in this present Controversie is damnable. If he answer, that their Tenet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

such points; and in particular in this, that <hi>Scripture alone is Iudge of Controversies:</hi> And so, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
principle upon which their whole faith is grounded, remaines to them uncertaine: and on the
other side, for the selfe same reason, they are not certaine, but that the Church is Iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies;
which if she be, then their case is lamentable, who in <hi>generall</hi> deny her this authority, &amp;

and tyranny over any people, need not put himselfe to
the trouble and difficulty of abrogating and disanulling

not either to abolish or corrupt the holy Scriptures, the Pillars
and supporters of Christian liberty (which in regard of the numerous
multitude of copies dispersed through all places, translated into almost
all languages, guarded with all sollicitous care and industry, had been
an impossible attempt;) But the more expedite way, and therefore
more likely to be successefull, was to gain the opinion and esteem of
the <hi>publique and authoriz'd interpreter</hi> of them, and the Authority of
adding to them what doctrine she pleas'd under the title of <hi>Traditions</hi>
or <hi>Definitions.</hi> For by this meanes, she might both serve her selfe of

incurable. Leave picturing God, and worshipping him by pictures.
<hi>Teach not for Doctrine the Commandments of men.</hi> Debarre not the
Laity of the Testament of Christs blood. Let your publique Prayers

               <p>2 For neither is that true which you pretend, <hi>That we possesse the

you might keep them entire, without any thought or care to conforme

no other cause but these.</hi> But sure there is little Reason you should
measure other mens imaginations by your own, who perhaps may be
so clouded and vail'd with prejudice, that you cannot, or will not see
that which is most manifest. For what indifferent and unprejudicate
man may not easily conceive another cause which (I doe not say does,
but certainly) may pervert your wills, and avert your understandings
from submitting your religion and Church to a <hi>tryall by Scripture.</hi> I
mean the great and apparent and unavoidable danger which by this
meanes you would fall into, of loosing the Opinion which men have
of your Infallibility, and consequently your power and authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mens consciences, and all that depends upon it; so that though <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na

many among you (though I censure or judge no man) the other cause
which wrought upon <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the <hi>Craftsmen,</hi> may have with
you also the more effectuall, though more secret influence: and that is,
that <hi>by this craft we have our living;</hi> by this craft, I mean of keeping
your Proselytes from an indifferent tryall of your Religion by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and making them yeeld up and captivate their judgement unto
yours. Yet had you only said <hi>de facto,</hi> that no other cause did avert
your own will from this, but only these which you pretend; out of
Charity I should have believed you: But seeing you speak not of your
selfe, but of all of your side, whose hearts you cannot know; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
not only, That there is no other cause, but that <hi>No other is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,</hi>
I could not let this passe without a censure. As for the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of Scriptures being the sole judge of Controversies, that is, <hi>the
sole rule for man to Iudge them by</hi> (for we mean nothing else) you only
affirme it without proofe, as if the thing were evident of it selfe. And
therefore I, conceiving the contrary to be more evident, might well-content
my selfe to deny it without refutation. Yet I cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to tell me, If Scripture cannot be the Iudge of any Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
how shall that touching the <hi>Church and the notes of it</hi> be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
And if it be the sole judge of this one, why may it not of others?
Why not of All? Those only excepted wherein the Scripture it selfe
is the subject of the Question, which cannot be determined but by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
reason, the only principle, beside Scripture, which is common

are to be decided by Scripture.</hi> For if men did really and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
submit their judgements to Scripture, and that only, and would
require no more of any man but to doe so, it were impossible but that
all controversies, touching things necessary and very profitable should
be ended: and if others were continued or increased, it were no
matter.</p>
               <p>5 In the next wordes we have direct <hi>Boyes-play;</hi> a thing given
with one hand and taken away with the other; an acknowledgement
made in one line, and retracted in the next. <hi>We acknowledge</hi> (say you)
<hi>Scripture to be a perfect rule, for as much as a writing can be a Rule, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wee deny that it excludes unwritten tradition.</hi> A si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you should have
said, we acknowledge it to be as perfect a rule as a writing can be; only
we deny it to be as perfect a rule as a writing may be. Either therefore
you must revoke your acknowledgement, or retract your retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it; for both cannot possibly stand together. For if you will stand
to what you have granted, That <hi>Scripture is as perfect a rule of Faith
as a writing can be:</hi> you must then grant it both so <hi>Compleat,</hi> that it
needs no addition, and so <hi>evident,</hi> that it needs no interpretation: For
both these properties are requisite to a <hi>perfect rule;</hi> and a writing is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of both these properties.</p>
               <p>6 That both these Properties are requisite to a <hi>perfect rule,</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent:
Because that is not perfect in any kind which wants some parts
belonging to its integrity: As he is not a perfect man that wants any
part appertaining to the Integrity of a Man; and therefore that which
wants any accession to make it a perfect rule, of it selfe is not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Rule. And then, the end of a <hi>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le</hi> is to regulate and direct. Now
every instrument is more or lesse perfect in its kinde, as it is more or
lesse fit to attain the end for which it is ordained: But nothing obscure
or unevident while it is so, is fit to regulate and direct them to whom
it is so: Therefore it is requisite also to a <hi>rule</hi> (so farre as it is a Rule)
to be evident; otherwise indeed it is no <hi>rule,</hi> because it cannot serve for
direction. I conclude therefore, that both these properties are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to a perfect Rule: both to be so compleat as to need no Addition;
and to be so evident as to need no Interpretation.</p>
               <p>7 Now that a writing is capable of both these perfections, it is so
plain, that I am even ashamed to prove it. For he that denies it must
say, That <hi>something may be spoken which cannot be written.</hi> For if such
a compleat and evident rule of faith may be delivered by word of
mouth, as you pretend it may, and is; and whatsoever is delivered by
word of mouth may also be written; then such a compleat and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
rule of faith may also be written. If you will have more light
added to the Sunne, answer me then to these Questions. Whether
your Church can set down in writing all these, which she pretends to
be divine unwritten Traditions, and adde them to the verities already
written? And whether she can set us down such interpretations of all
obscurities in the Faith as shall need no farther interpretations? If shee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7615:44"/>
cannot, then she hath not that power which you pretend she hath, of
being an <hi>Infallible teacher of all divine verities,</hi> and an infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of obscurities in the faith: for she cannot teach us all divine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
if she cannot write them down; neither is that an interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which needs again to be interpreted: If she can; Let her doe it, and
then we shall have a writing, not only capable of, but, actually endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with both these perfections, of being both so compleat as to need
no Addition, and so evident as to need no Interpretation. Lastly,
whatsoever your Church can doe or not doe, no man can without
Blasphemy deny, that <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> if he had pleas'd, could have writ
us a rule of Faith so plaine and perfect, as that it should have wanted
neither any part to make up its integrity, nor any cleerenesse to make
it sufficiently intelligible: And if Christ could have done this, then
the thing might have been done; a writing there might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with both these properties. Thus therefore I conclude, a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may be so perfect a Rule, as to need neither Addition nor Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;
But the <hi>Scripture you acknowledge a perfect Rule for as much
as a writing can be a Rule,</hi> therefore it needs neither Addition nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>
               <p>8 You will say, that <hi>though a writing be never so perfect a Rule of
Faith, yet it must be beholding to Tradition to give it this Testimony,
that it is a Rule of Faith, and the Word of God.</hi> I answere: First, there is
no absolute necessity of this. For God might, if he thought good,
give it the attestation of perpetuall miracles. Secondly, that it is one
thing to be a perfect Rule of Faith, another to be proved so unto us.
And thus though a writing could not be proved to us to be a perfect rule
of Faith, by its own saying so, for nothing is prov'd true by being said
or written in a book, but only by Tradition which is a thing credible
of it selfe; yet it may be so in it selfe, and containe all the materiall
objects, all the particular articles of our Faith, without any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon Tradition; even this also not excepted, that <hi>this writing
doth containe the rule of Faith.</hi> Now when Protestants affirme against
Papists, that <hi>Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith,</hi> their meaning is not,
that by Scripture all things absolutely may be proved, which are to
be believed: For it can never be prov'd by Scripture to a gainsayer,
that there is a God, or that the book called Scripture is the word of
God; For he that will deny these Assertions when they are spoken,
will believe them never a whit the more because you can shew them
written: But their meaning is, that the Scripture, to them which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
it Divine, and a Rule of Faith, as Papists and Protestants doe,
containes all the materiall objects of Faith; is a compleat and totall,
and not only an imperfect and a partiall Rule.</p>
               <p>9 <hi>But every Book, and Chapter, and Text of Scripture is infallible
and wants no due perfection, and yet excludes not the Addition of other
bookes of Scripture; Therefore the perfection of the whole Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not the Addition of unwritten Tradition.</hi> I answere; Every Text
of Scripture though it have the perfection belonging to a Text of
Scripture, yet it hath not the perfection requisite to a <hi>perfect Rule of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7615:45"/>
Faith;</hi> and that only is the perfection which is the subject of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
So that this is to abuse your Reader with the ambiguity of the
word <hi>Perfect.</hi> In effect, as if you should say, A text of Scripture may
be a perfect Text, though there be others beside it; therefore the
whole Scripture may be a perfect Rule of Faith, though there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of this Rule, besides the Scripture, and though the Scripture
be but a part of it.</p>
               <p>10 The next Argument to the same purpose is, for Sophistry, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
german to the former. <hi>When the first bookes of Scripture were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
they did not exclude unwritten Tradition: Therefore now also, that
all the bookes of Scripture are written, Traditions are not excluded.</hi> The
sense of which argument (if it have any) must be this. When only a
part of the Scripture was written, then a part of the divine doctrine
was unwritten; Therefore now when all the Scripture is written, yet
some part of the divine doctrine is yet unwritten. If you say, your
conclusion is not that it is so, but without disparagement to Scripture,
may be so: without disparagement to the truth of Scripture, I grant
it; but without disparagement to the Scriptures being a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi>
I deny it. And now the Question is not of the Truth, but the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it; which are very different things, though you would faine
confound them. For Scripture might very well be all true, though
it containe not all necessary Divine Truth. But unlesse it doe so, it
cannot be a <hi>perfect Rule of Faith;</hi> for that which wants any thing is not
perfect. For I hope you doe not imagine, that we conceive any anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
between Gods word written and unwritten, but that both
might very well stand together. All that we say is this, that we have
reason to believe that God <hi>de Facto,</hi> hath ordered the matter so, that
all the Gospell of Christ, the whole covenant between God and man,
is now written. Whereas if he had pleas'd, he might so have dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, that part might have been written, and part unwritten: but then
he would have taken order, to whom we should have had recourse,
for that part of it which was not written; which seeing he hath not
done (as the progresse shall demonstrate) it is evident he hath left no
part of it unwritten. We know no man therefore that saies, It were
any injury to the written Word to be joyn'd with the unwritten, if
there were any wherewith it might be joyn'd; but that we deny. The
fidelity of a Keeper may very well consist with the authority of the
thing committed to his custody. But we know no one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ociety of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that is such a faithfull Keeper as you pretend. The Scripture it
selfe was not kept so faithfully by you, but that you suffered infinite
variety of Readings to creep into it; all which could not possibly be
divine, and yet, in severall parts of your Church, all of them, untill the
last Age, were so esteem'd. The interpretations of obscure places of
Scripture, which without Question the Apostles taught the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians, are wholy lost; there remaines no certainty scarce of
any one. Those <hi>Worlds of Miracles,</hi> which our Saviour did, which were
not written, for want of writing are vanished out of the memory of
men. And many profitable things which the Apostles taught and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7615:45"/>
writ not, as that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> glances at, in his <hi>second Epistle to the
Thessalon.</hi> of the <hi>cause of the hindrance of the comming of Antichrist,</hi> are
wholly lost and extinguished. So unfaithfull or negligent hath been
this keeper of Divine verities; whose eyes, like the keepers of Israell
(you say) have <hi>never flumbred nor slept.</hi> Lastly, we deny not but a
Iudge and a Law might well stand together, but we deny that there is
any such Iudge of Gods appointment. Had he intended any such
Iudge, he would have nam'd him, least otherwise (as now it is) our
<hi>Iudge of controversies</hi> should be our greatest controversy.</p>
               <p>11 <hi>Ad</hi> § 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. In your second Paragraph, you summe up
those arguments wherewith you intend to prove, that <hi>Scripture alone
cannot be Iudge in controversies.</hi> Wherein I professe unto you before
hand, that you will fight without an Adversary. For though Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
being warranted by some of the Fathers, have called Scripture
the <hi>Iudge of Controversies;</hi> and you in saying here, That Scripture <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi>
cannot be Iudge, imply that it may be called in some sense a
Iudge, though not alone: Yet to speak properly (as men should speak
when they write of Controversies in Religion) the Scripture is not a
Iudge of Controversies, but <hi>a Rule, only and the only Rule for Christians
to judge them by.</hi> Every man is to judge for himselfe with the <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Discretion,</hi> and to choose either his Religion first, and then his
Church, as we say: or as you, his Church first, and then his Religion.
But by the consent of both sides, every man is to judge and choose:
and the Rule whereby he is to guide his choyce, if he be a naturall
man, is Reason, if he be already a Christian, Scripture, which we say
is the Rule to judge controversies by. Yet not all simply, but all the
Controversies of Christians, of those, that are already agreed upon
This first Principle that, <hi>the Scripture is the word of God.</hi> But that there
is any man, or any company of men appointed to be judge for all men,
that we deny, and that I believe you will never prove. The very truth
is, we say no more in this matter, then evidence of Truth hath made
you confesse in plain termes in the beginning of this chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>Scripture is a perfect Rule of faith, for as much as a writing can be a rule.</hi>
So that all your reasons whereby you labour to dethrone the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from this office of <hi>Iudgeing,</hi> we might let passe as impertinent to
the conclusion which we maintaine, and you have already granted; yet
out of curtesy we will consider them.</p>
               <p>12 Your first is this; <hi>a Iudge must be a person fit to end controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
but the Scripture is not a person, nor fit to end controversies, no
more then the Law would be without the Iudges, therefore though it may
be a Rule it cannot be a Iudge.</hi> Which conclusion I have already gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Only my request is, that you will permit Scripture to have the
properties of a Rule, that is, to be fit to direct every one that will
make the best use of it, to that end for which it was ordained. And
that is as much as we need desire. For as if I were to goe a journey
and had a guide which could not erre, I needed not to know my way:
so on the other side if I know my way or have a plain rule to know it
by, I shall need no guide. Grant therefore Scripture to be such a Rule,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7615:46"/>
and it will quickly take away all necessity of having an infallible
guide. But <hi>without a living Iudge it will be no fitter</hi> (you say) <hi>to end
Controversies, then the Law alone to end suits.</hi> I answere, if the Law
were plain and perfect, and men honest and desirous to understand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and obey it, he that saies it were not fit to end controversies, must
either want understanding himself, or think the world wants it. Now
the Scripture, we pretend, <hi>in things necessary is plain &amp; perfect,</hi> and men,
we say, are oblig'd, under pain of Damnation, to seek the true sense of it,
and not to wrest it to their preconceived Phansies. Such a law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to such men cannot but be very fit to end all controversies, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be ended. For others that are not so, they will end when the
world ends, and that is time enough.</p>
               <p>12 Your next encounter is with them, who acknowledging the
Scripture a Rule only and not a Iudge, make the holy Ghost, speaking
in Scripture, the judge of Controversies. Which you disprove by
saying, <hi>That the holy Ghost speaking only in Scripture is no more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
to us, then the Scripture in which he speakes.</hi> But by this reason
neither the Pope, nor a Councell can be a Iudge neither. For first, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Scriptures, the writings of the Holy Ghost, to be judges, you
will not I hope offer to pretend, that their decrees, the writings of
men are more capable of this function: the same exceptions at least, if
not more, and greater lying against them as doe against Scripture. And
then what you object against the holy Ghost, speaking in Scripture, to
exclude him from this office, The same I returne upon them and their
decrees, to debarre them from it; that they speaking unto us only in
their decrees, are no more intelligible then the decrees in which they
speak. And therefore if the Holy Ghost speaking in Scripture may
not be a judge for this reason; neither may they, speaking in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
be judges for the same Reason. <hi>If the Popes decrees</hi> (you will
say) <hi>be obscure, he can explain himselfe, and so the Scripture cannot.</hi> But
the holy Ghost, that speaks in Scripture, can doe so, if he please, and
when he is pleas'd will doe so. In the mean time it will be fit for you
to wait his leasure, and to be content, that those things of Scripture
which are plain should be so, and those which are obscure should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
obscure, untill he please to declare them. Besides he can (which
you cannot warrant me of the Pope or a Councell) speak at first so
plainly, that his words shall need no farther explanation; and so in
things necessary we believe he has done. And if you say, <hi>the Decrees of
Councells touching Controversies, though they be not the Iudge, yet they
are the Iudges sentence:</hi> So, I say, the Scripture, though not the Iudge,
is the sentence of the Iudge. When therefore you conclude, <hi>That to
say a Iudge is necessary for deciding controversies, about the meaning of
Scripture, is as much as to say, he is necessary to decide what the holy
Ghost speakes in Scripture:</hi> This I grant is true, but I may not grant
that a Iudge (such a one as we dispute of) is necessary either to doe
the one, or the other. For if the Scripture (as it is in things necessary)
be plain, why should it be more necessary to have a judge to interpret
them in plain places, then to have a judge to interpret the meaning of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7615:46"/>
a Councell's decrees, and others to interpret their Interpretations, and
others to interpret theirs, and so on for ever? And where they are not
plaine, there if we, using diligence to finde the truth, doe yet misse of it
and fall into errour, there is no danger in it. They that erre, and they
that doe not erre may both be saved. So that those places which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
things necessary, and wherein errour were dangerous, need no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
interpreter because they are plaine: and those that are obscure
need none because they contain not things necessary, neither is errour
in them dangerous.</p>
               <p>13 <hi>The Law-maker speaking in the Law,</hi> I grant it, <hi>is no more easily
understood then the Law it selfe,</hi> for his speech is nothing else but the
Law: I grant it <hi>very necessary, that besides the Law-maker speaking in
the Law, there should be other Iudges to determine civill and criminall
Controversies, and to giue every man that Iustice which the Law allowes
him.</hi> But your Argument drawn from hence to shew a necessitie of a
visible Iudge in Controversies of Religion, I say is Sophisticall: and
that for many Reasons.</p>
               <p>14 First, Because the variety of Civill cases is infinite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there cannot be possibly Lawes enough provided for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of them: and therefore there must be a Iudge to supply out
of the Principles of Reason the interpretation of the Law, where it is
defectiue. But the Scripture (we say) is a perfect Rule of Faith, and
therefore needs no supply of the defects of it.</p>
               <p>15 Secondly, To execute the Letter of the Law, according to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
would be many times unjust, and therefore there is need of a
Iudge to moderate it; whereof in Religion there is no use at all.</p>
               <p>16 Thirdly, In Civill and Criminall causes the parties haue for
the most part so much interest, and very often so little honesty, that
they will not submit to a Law though never so plaine, if it bee against
them; or will not see it to be against them, though it be so never so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
whereas if men were honest, and the Law were plaine and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to all cases, there would be little need of Iudges. Now in matters
of Religion, when the Question is, whether every man bee a fit Iudge
and chooser for himselfe, we suppose men honest, and such as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the difference between a Moment and Eternity. And such men,
we conceiue, will think it highly concernes them to be of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but nothing at all that this or that Religion should be the true.
And then wee suppose that all the necessary points of Religion are
plaine and easie, &amp; consequently every man in this cause to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Iudge for himselfe; because it concernes himselfe to judge right
as much as eternall happinesse is worth. And if through his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
he judge amisse he alone shall suffer for it.</p>
               <p>17 Fourthly, In Civill Controversies we are obliged only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
passiue obedience, and not to an internall and actiue. Wee are
bound to obey the sentence of the Iudge, or not to resist it, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to belieue it just. But in matters of Religion, such a judge is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
whom we should be obliged to belieue, to haue judged right.
So that in Civill Controversies every honest understanding man is fit
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7615:47"/>
to be a Iudge; But in religion none but he that is infallible.</p>
               <p>18 Fiftly, In Civill Causes there is meanes and power, when the
Iudge has decreed, to compell men to obey his sentence: otherwise, I
belieue, Laws alone, would be to as much purpose, for the ending of
differences, as Lawes and Iudges both. But all the power in the world
is neither fit to convince, nor able to compell a mans conscience to
consent to any thing. Worldly terrour may prevaile so far as to make
men professe a Religion which they belieue not, (such men I meane,
who know not that there is a Heaven provided for Martyrs, and a Hell
for those that dissemble such truths as are necessary to bee professed:)
But to force, either any man to belieue what he belieues not, or any
honest man to dissemble what he does beleiue (if God commands him
to professe it,) or to professe what he does not belieue, all the Powers
in the World are too weak, with all the powers of Hell, to assist them.</p>
               <p>19 Sixtly, In Civill Controversies the case cannot be so put, but
there may be a Iudge to end it, who is not a party: In Controversies of
Religion, it is in a manner impossible to bee avoided but the Iudge
must be a partie. For this must be the first, whether hee be a judge or
no, and in that he must be a partie. Sure I am, the Pope, in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of our time, is a chiefe partie; for it highly concernes him, even
as much as his Popedome is worth, not to yeeld any one point of his
Religion to be erroneous. And hee is a man subject to like passions
with other men. And therefore we may justly decline his sentence, for
feare temporall respects should either blinde his judgement, or make
him pronounce against it.</p>
               <p>20 Seaventhly, In Civill Controversies, it is impossible <hi>Titius</hi>
should hold the land in question and <hi>Sempronius</hi> too: and therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Plaintiffe must injure the Defendant, by disquieting his posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or the Defendant wrong the Plaintiffe by keeping his right from
him. But in Controversies of Religion the Case is otherwise. I may
hold my opinion and doe you no wrong, and you yours and doe mee
none. Nay we may both of us hold our opinion, and yet doe our selues
no harme; provided, the difference be not touching any thing necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to salvation, and that we loue truth so well, as to bee diligent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our Conscience, and constant in following it.</p>
               <p>21 Eightly, For the ending of Civill Controversies, who does
not see it is absolutely necessary, that not only Iudges should bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
but that it should be known and unquestioned who they are?
Thus all the Iudges of our Land are known men, known to be Iudges,
and no man can doubt or question, but these are the Men. Otherwise if
it were a disputable thing, who were these Iudges, and they had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
warrant for their Authority, but only some Topicall congruities,
would not any man say such Iudges, in all likelyhood, would rather
multiply Controversies, then end them?</p>
               <p>22 Ninthly, and lastly, For the deciding of Civill Controversies
men may appoint themselues a judge. But in matters of Religion, this
office may be given to none but whom God hath designed for it: who
doth not alwaies giue us those things which we conceiue most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for our selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:7615:47"/>
23 So likewise if our Saviour, the King of Heaven, had intended
that all Controversies in Religion should be by some Visible Iudge fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
determined, who can doubt, but in plaine termes hee would haue
expressed himselfe about this matter? He would haue said plainely.
<hi>The Bishop of Rome I haue appointed to decide all emergent Controversies.</hi>
For that our Saviour design'd the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> to this Office, &amp; yet
would not say so, nor cause it to be written<hi>—ad Rei memoriam</hi>—by any
of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> or <hi>Apostles,</hi> so much as once; but leaue it to bee
drawn out of uncertain Principles, by thirteen or fourteen more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
consequences, He that can beleiue it, let him. All these Reasons, I
hope, will convince you, that though we haue, and haue great necessity
of, Iudges in Civill and Criminall causes: yet you may not conclude
from thence, that there is any publique authoriz'd Iudge to determine
Controversies in Religion, nor any necessity there should be any.</p>
               <p>24 <hi>But the Scripture stands in need of some watchfull and unerring
eye to guard it, by meanes of whose assured vigilancy, we may undoubtedly
receiue it syncere and pure.</hi> Very true, but this is no other then the
watchfull eye of divine providence: the goodnesse whereof will never
suffer, that the Scripture should be depraved and corrupted, but that
in them should be alwaies extant a conspicuous and plain way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
happinesse. Neither can any thing be more palpably unconsistent
with his goodnesse, then to suffer Scripture to be undiscernably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in any matter of moment, and yet to exact of men the beliefe of
those verities, which without their fault, or knowledge, or possibility of
prevention, were defac'd out of them. So that God requiring of men
to belieue Scripture in its purity, ingages himselfe to see it preserv'd in
sufficient purity, and you need not feare but he will satisfie his ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
You say, <hi>we can haue no assurance of this but your Churches Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie.</hi>
But if we had no other we were in a hard case; for who could
then assure us that your Church has been so vigilant, as to guard Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
from any the least alteration? There being various Lections in the
ancient copies of your Bibles, what security can your new rail'd <hi>Office
of Assurance</hi> giue us, that, that reading is true which you now receiue,
and that false which you reject? Certainly they that anciently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and made use of these divers Copies, were not all guarded by the
Churches vigilancy from having their Scripture alter'd from the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Originall in many places. For of different readings, it is not in
nature impossible that all should bee false, but more then one cannot
possibly be true. Yet the want of such a protection was no hinderance
to their salvation, and why then shall the having of it be necessary for
ours? But then this Vigilancy of your Church, what meanes haue we
to be ascertain'd of it? First, the thing is not evident of it selfe; which
is evident, because many doe not belieue it. Neither can any thing be
pretended to giue evidence to it, but only some places of Scripture; of
whose incorruption more then any other what is it that can secure me?
If you say the Churches vigilancy, you are in a Circle, proving the
Scriptures uncorrupted by the Churches vigilancy, &amp; the Churches
vigilancy by the incorruption of some places of Scripture, and againe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7615:48"/>
the incorruption of those places by the Churches vigilancy. If you
name any other meanes, then that meanes which secures mee of the
Scriptures incorruption in those places, will also serue to assure me of
the same in other places. For my part, abstracting from Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which will never suffer the way to Heaven to bee block'd up or
made invisible, I know no other meanes (I meane no other naturall and
rationall meanes) to be assured hereof, then I haue that any other
Book is uncorrupted. For though I haue a greater degree of rationall
and humane Assurance of that then this, in regard of divers considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which make it more credible, <hi>That the Scripture hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
from any materiall alteration;</hi> yet my assurance of both is of the
same kinde and condition, both Morall assurances, and neither Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or Mathematicall.</p>
               <p>25 To the next Argument the Reply is obvious; <hi>That though we
doe not belieue the books of Scripture to be Canonicall because they say so,</hi>
For other books that are not Canonicall may say they are, and those
that are so may say nothing of it: yet we belieue not this upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of your Church, but upon the Credibilitie of <hi>Vniversall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
which is a thing <hi>Credible of it selfe,</hi> and therefore fit to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
on; whereas the Authority of your Church is not so. And
therefore your rest thereon is not rationall but meerly voluntary. I
might as well rest upon the judgement of the next man I meet, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the chance of a Lottery for it. For by this meanes I only know I
might erre, but by relying on you I know I should erre. But yet (to
returne you one suppose for another) suppose I should for this and all
other things submit to her direction, how could shee assure mee that I
should not be mis-led by doing so? She pretends indeed infallibility
herein, but how can she assure us that she hath it? What, by Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
That you say cannot assure us of its own Infallibility, and therefore
not of yours. What then, by Reason? That you say may deceiue in
other things, and why not in this? How then will she assure us hereof,
By saying so? Of this very affirmation there will remain the same
Question still, How it can proue it selfe to be infallibly true. Neither
can there be an end of the like multiplied Demands, till we rest in som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
evident of it selfe, which demonstrates to the world that this
Church is infallible. And seeing there is no such Rock for the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of this Church to be setled on, it must of necessity, like the Iland
of <hi>Delos,</hi> flote up and down for ever. And yet upon this point accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Papists all other Controversies in faith depend.</p>
               <p>26 To they 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. §. <hi>The summe and substance
of the Ten next Paragraphs is this,</hi> That it appeares, by the Confessions
of some Protestants, and the Contentions of others, that the Questions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Canon of Scripture, what it is: and about the Various reading and
Translations of it, which is true and which not, are not to bee determined
by Scripture, and therefore that all Controversies of Religion are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidable
by Scripture.</p>
               <p>27 To which I have already answered saying, That when Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is affirm'd to be the rule by which all controversies of Religion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7615:48"/>
are to be decided, Those are to be excepted out of this generality
which are concerning the Scripture it selfe. For as that generall saying
of Scripture, <hi>He hath put all things under his feet,</hi> is most true, though
yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>That when it is said, he hath put all things under him,
it is manifest he is excepted who did put all things under him:</hi> So when
we say that all controversies of Religion are decidable by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is manifest to all, but cavillers, that we doe and must except
from this generality, those which are <hi>touching the Scripture it selfe.</hi>
Iust as a Merchant shewing a ship of his own, may say, all my substance
is in this ship; and yet never intend to deny, that his ship is part of his
substance, nor yet to say that his ship is in it selfe. Or as a man may
say, that a whole house is supported by the foundation, and yet never
mean to exclude the foundation from being a part of the house, or to
say that it is supported by it selfe. Or as you your selves use to say,
that the Bishop of Rome is head of the whole Church, and yet would
think us but captious sophisters should we inferre from hence, that
either you made him no part of the whole, or else made him head of
himselfe. Your negative conclusion therefore, that these <hi>Questions
touching Scripture, are not decidable by Scripture,</hi> you needed not have
cited any Authorities, nor urged any reason to prove it; it is evident
of it selfe, and I grant it without more adoe. But your corollary
from it, which you would insinuate to your unwary reader, <hi>that
therefore they are to be decided by your, or any visible Church,</hi> is a meere
inconsequence, and very like his collection, who because <hi>Pamphilus</hi>
was not to have <hi>Glycerium</hi> for his wife, presently concluded that he
must have her; as if there had been no more men in the world but
<hi>Pamphilus</hi> and himselfe. For so you as if there were nothing in the
world capable of this office, but the Scripture, or the present Church,
having concluded against Scripture, you conceive, but too hastily, that
you have concluded for the Church. But the truth is, neither the one
nor the other have any thing to doe with this matter. For first, the
Question <hi>whether such or such a book be Canonicall Scripture,</hi> though it
may be decided negatively out of Scripture, by shewing apparent and
irreconcileable contradictions between it and some other book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
Canonicall; yet affirmatively it cannot but only by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the ancient Churches: any book being to be received as
undoubtedly Canonicall, or to be doubted of as uncertain, or reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
as Apocryphall, according as it was received, or doubted of, or
rejected by them. Then for the Question, <hi>of various readings which is
the true,</hi> it is in reason evident and confessed by your own Pope, that
there is no possible determination of it, but only by comparison
with ancient Copies. And lastly for controversies about different
translations of Scripture, the learned have the same meanes to satisfy
themselves in it, as in the Questions which happen about the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any other Author, that is, skill in the language of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and comparing translations with it. In which way if there be no
certainty, I would know what certainty you have, that your <hi>Doway</hi>
old, and <hi>Rhemish</hi> new Testament are true translations? And then for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7615:49"/>
the unlearned those on your side are subject to as much, nay the very
same uncertainty with those on ours. Neither is there any reason ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
why an ignorant English Protestant may not be as secure of
the translation of our Church, that it is free from errour; if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
yet in matters of moment, as an ignorant English Papist can
be of his Rhemist Testament, or Doway Bible. The best direction I
can give them is to compare both together, and where there is no reall
difference (as in the translation of controverted places I believe there
is very little) there to be confident, that they are right; where they
differ, there to be prudent in the choice of the guides they follow.
Which way of proceeding, if it be subject to some possible errour, yet
is it the best that either we, or you have; and it is not required that we
use any better then the best we have.</p>
               <p>28 You will say, <hi>Dependance on your Churches infallibility is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
I answere, it would be so, if we could be infallibly certaine, that
your Church is infallible, that is, if it were either evident of it selfe,
and seen by its own light, or could be reduc'd unto and setled upon
some Principle that is so. But seeing you your selves doe not so much
as pretend, to enforce us to the belief hereof, by any proofes infallible
and convincing, but only to induce us to it, by such as are, by your
confession, only probable, and <hi>principall motives;</hi> certainly it will
be to very little purpose, to put off your uncertainty for the first turne,
and to fall upon it at the second: to please your selves in building your
house upon an imaginary Rock, when you your selves see and confesse,
that this very Rock stands it selfe at the best but upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a frame of timber.
I answer secondly, that this cannot be a better way, because we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
certain that your Church is not infallible, and indeed hath not
the reall prescription of this priviledge, but only pleaseth her selfe
with a false imagination and vaine presumption of it: as I shall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
demonstrate by many unanswerable arguments.</p>
               <p>29 Now seeing I make no scruple or difficulty to grant the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of this discourse, that <hi>these controversies about Scripture, are not
decidable by Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and have shewed, that your deduction from it,
that <hi>therefore they are to be determin'd by the authority of some present
Church,</hi> is irrationall, and inconsequent; I might well forbeare to tire
my selfe with an exact and punctuall examination of your premises
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which wether they be true or false, is to the Question disputed
wholly impertinent. Yet because you shall not complaine of tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation,
I will runne over them, and let nothing, that is materiall and
considerable, passe without some stricture or animadversion.</p>
               <p>30 You pretend that M. <hi>Hooker</hi> acknowledgeth that, <hi>That whereon
we must rest our assurance that the Scripture is Gods word, is the Church:</hi>
and for this acknowledgement you referre us to <hi>l. 3. Sect.</hi> 8. Let the
Reader consult the place, and he shall finde that he and M. <hi>Hooker</hi> have
been much abused, both by you here, and by <hi>M. Breerly</hi> and others
before you, and that M. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath not one syllable to your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
purpose, but very much directly to the contrary. There he tells us
indeed, <hi>that ordinarily the first introduction and probable motive to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7615:49"/>
belief of the verity is the Authority of the Church,</hi> but that it is the last
Foundation whereon our belief hereof is rationally grounded, that in
the same place he plainly denies. His words are, <hi>Scripture teacheth us,
that saving Truth which God hath discovered unto the world by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and it presumeth us taught otherwise, that it selfe is divine and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.
The Question then being by what meanes we are taught this:</hi> some
answere; <hi>that to learne it we have no other way then tradition.</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">Some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer so, but he doth not.)</note> 
                  <hi>As
namely that so we believe, because we from our Predecessors, and they from
theirs have so received. But is this enough? That which all mens experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
teacheth them, may not in any wise be denied: and by experience we
all know, that</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">The first outward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not the last assurane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> whereon we rest.</note> 
                  <hi>the first outward motive leading men to esteeme of the
Scripture, is the Authority of Gods Church. For when we know</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">The whole Church that he speaks of seemes to be that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, wherein a man is bred and brought up; and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this he makes an argument which pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a mans modesty more then his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And in saying, it seemes impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be of a contrary mind without cause, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes; There may be a just cause to be of a contrary mind, and that then it were no impudence to be so.</note> 
                  <hi>the
whole Church of God hath that opinion of the Scripture, we judge it at the
first an impudent thing for any man, bred and brought up in the Church, to
be of a contrary minde without cause. Afterwards the more we bestow
our labour upon reading or hearing the mysteries thereof,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Therefore the authority of the Church is not the pause where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we rest: we had need of more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the intrinsecall arguments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it.</note> 
                  <hi>the more we
find that the thing it self doth answer our received opinion concerning it:
so that the former inducement prevailing</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Somewhat, but not much, untill it be back'd and inforced by farther reason: it selfe therefore is not the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest reason and the last resolution.</note> 
                  <hi>somewhat with us before,
doth now much more prevaile, when the very thing hath ministred far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason. If Infidels, or Atheists chance at any time to call it in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this giveth us occasion to sift what reason there is, whereby the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Church, concerning Scripture, and our own perswasion, which
Scripture it selfe hath setled, may be proved a truth infallible.</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Observe I pray; our persuasion, and the testimony of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Scripture, may be proved true, therefore neither of them was in his account the farthest proofe.</note> 
                  <hi>In which
case the ancient Fathers, being often constrained to shew what warrant
they had so much to rely upon the Scriptures, endeavoured still to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Authority of the bookes of God by arguments, such as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
themselves must needs think reasonable, if they judge thereof
as they should. Neither is it a thing impossible, or greatly hard, even by
such kinde of proofes, so to manifest and cleare that point, that no man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall be able to deny it, without denying some apparent principle, such
as all men acknowledge to be true.</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason then built on principles common to all men, is the last resolution; unto which the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is but the first inducement.</note> By this time I hope the reader sees
sufficient proofe of what I said in my Reply to your Preface, that M.
<hi>Breerelies</hi> great ostentation of exactnesse, is no very certain argument
of his fidelity.</p>
               <p>31 <hi>But,</hi> seeing the beliefe of the Scripture is a necessary thing, and
cannot be prov'd by Scripture, how can the Church of England teach, as
she doth, Art. 6. That all things necessary are contain'd in Scripture?</p>
               <p>32 I have answered this already. And here again I say, That all
but cavillers will easily understand the meaning of the Article to be,
That all the Divine verities, which Christ revealed to his Apostles, and
the Apostles taught the Churches, are contained in Scripture. That
is, all the materiall objects of our faith; whereof the Scripture is none,
but only the meanes of conveying them unto us: which we believe
not finally, and for it selfe, but for the matter contained in it. So that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7615:50"/>
if men did believe the doctrine contained in Scripture, it should no
way hinder their salvation, not to know whether there were any
Scripture or no. Those barbarous nations <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks of were in
this case, and yet no doubt but they might be saved. The end that
God aimes at, is the beliefe of the Gospell, the covenant between God
and man; the Scripture he hath provided as a meanes for this end, and
this also we are to believe, but not as the last object of our faith, but as
the instrument of it. When therefore we subscribe to the 6. <hi>Art.</hi> you
must understand that, by <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> they mean the finall and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
objects of it, and not the meanes and instrumentall objects; and
then there will be no repugnance between what they say, and that
which <hi>Hooker,</hi> and D. <hi>Covell,</hi> and D. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> here say.</p>
               <p>33 <hi>But,</hi> Protestants agree not in assigning the Canon of holy Scripture.
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Illyricus</hi> reject the Epistle of S. <hi>Iames. Kemnitius,</hi> and other
Luth. the second of Peter, the second and third of <hi>Iohn.</hi> The Epist. to the
Heb. the Epist. of Iames, of Iude, and the Apocalyps. Therefore without
the Authority of the Church, no certainty can be had what Scripture is
Canonicall.</p>
               <p>34 So also the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> and not only Fathers, but <hi>whole
Churches</hi> differed about the certainty of the authority of the very
same bookes: and by their difference shewed, they knew no necessity
of conforming themselves herein to the judgement of your or any
Church. For had they done so, they must have agreed all with that
Church, and consequently among themselves. Now I pray tell me
plainly, Had they sufficient certainty what Scripture was Canonicall,
or had they not? If they had not, it seemes there is no such great harme
or danger in not having such a certainty whether some books be
Canonicall or no, as you require: If they had, why may not Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
notwithstanding their differences, have sufficient certainty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as well as the Ancient Fathers and Churches, notwithstanding
theirs?</p>
               <p>35 You proceed. And whereas the Protestants of <hi>England</hi> in the
6. <hi>Art.</hi> have these words, <hi>In the name of the Holy Scripture we doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
those Bookes, of whose authority was never any doubt in the
Church;</hi> you demaund, <hi>what they meane by them? Whether that by the
Churches consent they are assured what Scriptures be Canonicall?</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for them. Yes, they are so. And whereas you inferre from hence,
<hi>This is to make the Church Iudge:</hi> I haue told you already, That <hi>of this
Controversie we make the Church the Iudge;</hi> but not the present
Church, much lesse the present Roman Church, but the consent and
testimony of the <hi>Ancient and Primitive Church.</hi> Which though it be
but a highly probable inducement, and no demonstrative enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet me thinks you should not denie but it may be a sufficient
ground of faith: Whose Faith, even of the Foundation of all your Faith,
your Churches Authority, is built lastly and wholly upon <hi>Prudentiall
Motives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>36 But <hi>by this Rule the whole booke of Esther must quit the Canon;
because it was excluded by some in the Church:</hi> by <hi>Melito, Athanasius,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7615:50"/>
and Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> Then for ought I know he that should thinke
he had reason to exclude it now, might be still in the Church as well
as <hi>Melito, Athanasius, Nazianzen</hi> were. And while you thus inveigh
against <hi>Luther,</hi> and charge him with Luciferian heresies; for doing that
which you in this very place confesse that Saints in Heaven before him
have done, <hi>are you not partiall and a Iudge of evill thoughts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>37 <hi>Luther's</hi> censures of <hi>Ecclesiastes, Iob,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
though you make such tragedies with them, I see none of them but is
capable of a tolerable construction, and far from having in them any
fundamentall heresie. He that condemnes him for saying, the booke of
<hi>Ecclesiastes is not full, That it hath many abrupt things,</hi> condemnes
him, for ought I can see; for speaking truth. And the rest of the censure
is but a bold and blunt expression of the same thing. The booke of
<hi>Iob</hi> may be a true History, and yet as many true stories are, and haue
been an Argument of a Fable to set before us an example of Patience.
And though the books of the Prophets were not written by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but by their Disciples, yet it does not follow that they were
written casually: (Though I hope you will not damne all for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
that say, some books of Scripture were written casually.) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any reason they should the sooner be call'd in question
for being written by their Disciples, seeing being so written they had
attestation from themselues. Was the Prophesie of <hi>Ieremie</hi> the lesse
Canonicall, for being written by <hi>Baruch?</hi> Or because S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
dictated the Gospell, and S. <hi>Marke</hi> the Scholler writ it, is it the
more likely to be called in Question?</p>
               <p>38 But leaving <hi>Luther,</hi> you returne to our English Canon of
Scripture; And tell us, that in <hi>the new testament, by the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
rule, (of whose Authority was never any doubt in the Church)
divers books must be canoniz'd.</hi> Not so For I may believe even
those questioned bookes to have been written by the Apostles and to
be Canonicall: but I cannot in reason believe this of them so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
as of <hi>those books which were never questioned.</hi> At least I
have no warrant to damne any man that shall doubt of them or deny
them now: having the example of Saints in Heaven, either to justify,
or excuse such their doubting or deniall.</p>
               <p>39 You observe in the next place, that <hi>our sixt Article, specifying
by name all the bookes of the Old Tstament, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you phansy to your selfe <hi>a mystery of iniquity.</hi> But if this be all the

I pray take the paines to look in them, and there you shall finde

               <p>41 Certainly a very good consequence. The Church of <hi>England</hi>
receives the Bookes of the New Testament, which the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> receives; Therefore she must receive the bookes of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
which she receives. As if you should say, If you will doe
as we, in one thing, you must in all things. If you will pray to God
with us, ye must pray to Saints with us. If you hold with us, when
we have reason on our side, you must doe so, when we have no reason.</p>
               <p>42 The discourse following is but a vaine declamation. No man
thinks that this Controversie is to be tryed by most voices, but by the
Iudgement and Testimony of the ancient Fathers and Churches.</p>
               <p>43 But, <hi>with what Coherence can we say in the former part of the
Article, That by Scripture we mean those Bookes that were never doubted
of; and in the latter say, We receive all the bookes of the new Testament,
as they are commonly received, whereas of them many were doubted?</hi> I
answere. When they say, <hi>of whose authority there was never any doubt
in the Church,</hi> They mean not, those only of whose Authority there
was simply no doubt at all, by any man in the Church; But such as
were not at any time doubted of by the whole Church, or by all
Churches, but had attestation, though not universall, yet at least suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make considering men receive them for Canonicall. In which
number they may well reckon those Epistles which were sometimes
doubted of by some, yet whose number and authority was not so
great, as to prevaile against the contrary suffrages.</p>
               <p>44 But, <hi>if to be commonly received, passefor a good rule to know the
Canon of the new Testament by, why not of the Old?</hi> You conclude ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times very well, but still when you doe so, it is out of principles
which no man grants. For who ever told you, that to be <hi>commonly</hi>
received is a good Rule to know the Canon of the New Testament
by? Have you been train'd up in Schooles of subtilty, and cannot you
see a great difference, between these two, We receive the bookes of
the new Testament <hi>as they are</hi> commonly received, and we receive
those that are commonly received, <hi>because they are so?</hi> To say this, were
indeed to make, <hi>being commonly received,</hi> a Rule or Reason to know
the Canon by. But to say the former, doth no more make it a Rule,
then you should make the Church of <hi>England</hi> the rule of your recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, if you should say, as you may, The bookes of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
we receive for Canonicall, as they are received by the Church
of England.</p>
               <p>45 You demand, <hi>upon what infallible ground we agree with Luther
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7615:51"/>
against you, in some, and with you against Luther in others?</hi> And I also
demand upon what infallible ground you hold your Canon, &amp; agree
neither with us, nor <hi>Luther?</hi> For sure your differing from us both, is of
it selfe no more apparently reasonable, then our agreeing with you in
part, and in part with <hi>Luther.</hi> If you say, your Churches infallibility is
your ground: I demand againe some infallible ground both for the
Churches infallibility, and for this, that <hi>Yours is the Church;</hi> and shall
never cease multiplying demands upon demands, untill you settle me
upon a Rock; I mean, giue such an Answer, whose Truth is so evident
that it needs no further evidence. If you say, <hi>This is Vniversall Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
I reply, your Churches infallibility is not built upon it, and that the
Canon of Scripture, as we receiue it, is. For wee doe not professe our
selues so absolutely, and and undoubtedly certain; neither doe we urge
others to be so, of those Books, which haue been doubted, as of those
that never haue.</p>
               <p>46 The Conclusion of your Tenth § is, That <hi>the Divinity of a
writing cannot be known from it selfe alone, but by some extrinsecall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi>
Which you need not proue, for no wise man denies it. But
then this authority is that of <hi>Vniversall Tradition,</hi> not of your
Church. For to me it is altogether as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that the Gospell of <hi>Saint
Mathew</hi> is the word of God, as that all which your Church saies is
true.</p>
               <p>47 That Believers of the Scripture, by considering the divine
matter, the excellent precepts, the glorious promises contained in it,
may be confirmed in their faith, of the Scriptures divine Authority; &amp;
that among other inducements and inforcements hereunto, internall
arguments haue their place and force, certainly no man of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
can deny. For my part I professe, if the doctrine of the Scripture
were not as good, and as fit to come from the fountain of goodnesse,
as the Miracles, by which it was confirm'd, were great, I should want
one main pillar of my faith, and for want of it, I feare should be much
stagger'd in it. Now this and nothing else did the <hi>Doctor</hi> mean in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>The Belieuer sees, by that glorious beam of divine light which shines
in Scripture, and by many internall Arguments, that the Scripture is of
Divine Authority. By this</hi> (saith he) <hi>he sees it,</hi> that is, hee is moved to,
and strengthned in his beliefe of it: and by this partly, not wholly; by
this, not alone, but with the concurrence of other Arguments. He that
will quarrell with him for saying so, must finde fault with the <hi>Master
of the Sentences,</hi> and all his <hi>Schollers;</hi> for they all say the same. The rest
of this Paragraph, I am as willing it should be true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as you are to haue
it: and so let it passe, as a discourse wherein we are wholy uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.
You might haue met with an Answerer that would not haue
suffred you to haue said so much Truth together, but to me it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that it is nothing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>48 In the next Division, out of your liberality, you will suppose,
that Scripture, like to a corporall light, is <hi>by it selfe alone</hi> able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
and moue our understanding to assent: yet notwithstanding
this supposall, <hi>Faith still</hi> (you say) <hi>must goe before Scripture, because as
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7615:52"/>
the light is visible only to those that haue eyes: so the Scripture onely to
those that haue the Eye of Faith.</hi> But to my understanding, if Scripture
doe moue and determine our Vnderstanding to assent, then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and its moving must be before this assent, as the cause must bee
before its own effect; now this very assent is nothing else but Faith, and
Faith nothing else then the Vnderstanding's assent. And therefore
(upon this supposall) Faith doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and must originally proceed from
Scripture, as the effect from its proper cause: and the influence and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of Scripture is to be presuppos'd before the assent of faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which it moues and determines, and consequently if this suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of yours were true, there should need no other meanes precedent
to Scripture to beget Faith, Scripture it selfe being able (as here you
suppose) to determine and moue the understanding to assent, that is to
belieue them, and the Verities contained in them. Neither is this to
say, that the eyes with which we see, are made by the light by which
we see. For you are mistaken much, if you conceiue that in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
Faith answers to the Eye. But if you will not pervert it, the
Analogie must stand thus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; Scripture must answer to light; The eye of
the soule, that is the Vnderstanding, or the faculty of assenting, to the
bodily eye; And lastly assenting or believing to the act of seeing. As
therefore the light, determining the Eye to see, though it presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Eye which it determines, as every Action doth the object on
which it is imployed, yet it selfe is presuppos'd and antecedent to the
act of seeing, as the cause is alwaies to its effect: So, if you will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that Scripture, like light, moues the understanding to assent, The
Vnderstanding (that's the eye and object on which it works) must bee
before this influence upon it; But the Assent, that is the beliefe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Scripture moues, and the understanding is mov'd, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to the act of seeing, must come after. For if it did assent already,
to what purpose should the Scripture doe that which was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Nay indeed how were it possible it should be so, any more then
a Father can beget a Sonne that he hath already? Or an Architect
build an house that is built already? Or then this very world can bee
made againe before it be unmade? Transubstantiation indeed is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of such Monsters. But they that haue not sworne themselues to
the defence of Errour, will easily perceiue, that <hi>I am factum facere,</hi> and
<hi>Factum infectum facere,</hi> are equally impossible. But I digresse.</p>
               <p>49 The close of this Paragraph, is a fit cover for such a dish. There
you tell us, That <hi>if there must be some other meanes precedent to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to beget faith, this can be no other then the Church.</hi> By the Church,
we know you doe, and must understand the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> so that in
effect you say, no man can haue faith, but he must bee mou'd to it by
your Churches Authority. And that is to say, that the King and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Protestants, to whom you write, though they verily think they
are Christians &amp; belieue the Gospell, because they assent to the truth
of it, and would willingly dye for it, yet indeed are Infidels and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
nothing. The Scripture tells us, <hi>The heart of man knoweth no man,
but the spirit of man which is in him.</hi> And who are you, to take upon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7615:52"/>
you to make us belieue, that we doe not belieue, what we know we
doe? But if I may think verily that I belieue the Scripture, and yet not
belieue it; how know you that you belieue the Roman Church? I am
as verily, and as strongly perswaded that I belieue the Scripture, as
you are that you belieue the Church. And if I may be deceived, why
may not you? Againe, what more ridiculous, and against sense and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
then to affirme, That there are not millions amongst you and
us that belieue, upon no other reason then their education, and the
authority of their Parents and Teachers, and the opinion they haue of
them? The tendernesse of the subject, and aptnesse to receiue impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
supplying the defect and imperfection of the Agent! And will
you proscribe from heaven all those believers of your own Creed,
who doe indeed lay the foundation of their Faith (for I cannot call it
by any other name) no deeper then upon the Authority of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or Master, or parish Priest? Certainly, if these haue no true faith,
your Church is very full of Infidels. Suppose <hi>Xaverius</hi> by the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his life had converted some Indians to Christianity, who
could (for so I will suppose) haue no knowledge of your Church
but from him, and therefore must last of all build their Faith of the
Church upon their Opinion of <hi>Xaverius:</hi> Doe these remain as very
Pagans after their conversion, as they were before? Are they brought
to assent in their soules, and obey in their liues the Gospell of Christ,
only to be Tantaliz'd and not saved, and not benefited but deluded by
it, because, forsooth, it is a man and not the Church that begets faith
in them? What if their motiue to beleeue be not in reason sufficient?
Doe they therefore not belieue what they doe belieue, because they
doe it upon insufficient motiues? They choose the Faith imprudently
perhaps, but yet they doe choose it. Vnlesse you will haue us belieue
that, that which is done, is not done, because it is not done upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good
reason: which is to say, that never any man living ever did a foolish
action. But yet I know not why the Authority of one holy man,
which apparently has no ends upon me, joyn'd with the goodnesse of
the Christian faith, might not be a far greater and more rationall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to me to imbrace Christianity, then any I can haue to continue in
Paganisme. And therefore for shame, if not for loue of Truth, you
must recant this fancie when you write again: and suffer true faith
to be many times, where your Churches infallibility has no hand in
the begetting of it. And be content to tell us hereafter, that we belieue
not enough, and not goe about to perswade us, we belieue nothing, for
feare with telling us what we know to be manifestly false, you should
gain only this, <hi>Not to be believed when you speak truth.</hi> Some pretty
sophismes you may happily bring us to make us belieue, we belieue
nothing: but wise men know that Reason against Experience is alwaies
Sophisticall. And therefore as he that could not answer <hi>Zenoe's</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities
against the existence of Motion, could yet confute them by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, which he pretended could not be done: So if you should giue
me a hundred Arguments to perswade me, because I doe not belieue
Transubstantiation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doe not believe in God, and the <hi>Knots</hi> of them I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7615:53"/>
could not untie, yet I should cut them in peeces with doing that, and
knowing that I doe so, which you pretend I cannot doe.</p>
               <p>50 In the thirteenth division, we haue again much adoe about
nothing. A great deal of stirre you keep in confuting some, <hi>that pretend
to know Canonicall Scripture to be such, by the Titles of the Books.</hi> But
these men you doe not name, which makes me suspect you cannot. Yet
it is possible there may be some such men in the world; for <hi>Gusman
de Alfarache</hi> hath taught us that the Fooles hospitall is a large place.</p>
               <p>51 In the fourteenth §. we haue very artificiall jugling. <hi>D. Potter</hi>
had said, <hi>That the Scripture</hi> (hee desires to bee understood of those
books wherein all Christians agree) <hi>is a principle, and needs not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among Christians.</hi> His reason was, because <hi>that needs no farther
proofe which is believed already.</hi> Now by this (you say) he meanes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Scripture is one of these first Principles, and most known
in all sciences, which cannot be proved: which is to suppose, it cannot
be proved by the Church; and that is to suppose the Question: Or hee
meanes, That it is not the most known in Christianity, &amp; then it may
be prov'd. Where we see plainly, That two most different things, <hi>Most
known in all Sciences,</hi> &amp; <hi>Most known in Christianity,</hi> are captiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.
As if the Scripture might not be the first and most knowne
Principle in Christianity, and yet not the most knowne in all Sciences?
Or as if to be a First Principle <hi>in Christianity,</hi> and <hi>in all Sciences,</hi> were
all one? That Scripture is a Principle among Christians, that is, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by all that it need not be proved in any emergent Controversie
to any Christian, but may be taken for granted, I think few will deny.
You your selues are of this a sufficient Testimony; for urging against
us many texts of Scripture, you offer no proofe of the truth of them,
presuming we will not question it. Yet this is not to deny that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a Principle more knowne then Scripture; But to say, it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
not in Christianity but <hi>in Reason,</hi> nor proper to Christians, but
common to all men.</p>
               <p>52 But, <hi>it is repugnant to our practice to hold Scripture a Principle;
because we are wont to affirme, that one part of Scripture may be knowne
to be Canonicall, and may be interpreted by another.</hi> Where the former
device is againe put in practice. For to be known to be <hi>Canonicall,</hi> and
to be <hi>interpreted</hi> is not all one. That Scripture may be interpreted by
Scripture, that Protestants grant, and Papists doe not deny; neither
does that any way hinder but that this assertion—Scripture is the
word of God, may be among Christians a common Principle. But the
first, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>That one part of Scripture may proue another part Canonicall,
and need no proofe of its own being so; for that, you haue produc'd
divers Protestants that deny it; but who they are that affirme it, <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
Constat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>53 It is superfluous for you to proue <hi>out of S. Athanasius, &amp; S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
that we must receiue the sacred Canon upon the credit of Gods
Church.</hi> Vnderstanding by Church, as here you explaine your selfe,
<hi>The credit of Tradition.</hi> And that not the Tradition of the Present
Church, which we pretend may deviate from the Ancient, but <hi>such a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7615:53"/>
Tradition, which involues an evidence of Fact, and from hand to hand,
from age to age, bringing us up to the times and persons of the Apostles,
and our Saviour himselfe, commeth to be confirm'd by all these Miracles
and other Arguments, whereby they convinc'd their doctrine to be true.</hi>
Thus you. Now proue the Canon of Scripture which you receive by
such Tradition and we will allow it. Proue your whole doctrine, or
the infallibility of your Church by such a Tradition, &amp; we will yeeld
to you in all things. Take the alleaged places of S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and S.
<hi>Austine,</hi> in this sense, (which is your own,) and they will not presse us
any thing at all. We will say, with <hi>Athanasius, That only foure Gospels
are to be received, because the Canons of the Holy and Catholique Church</hi>
(understand of <hi>all Ages</hi> since the perfection of the Canon) <hi>haue so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>54 We will subscribe to S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and say, That <hi>we also would
not belieue the Gospell, unlesse the Authority of the Catholique Church did
moue us,</hi> (meaning by the Church, <hi>the Church of all Ages,</hi> and that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Christians which takes in <hi>Christ himselfe</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi>)
Neither would <hi>Zwinglius</hi> haue needed to cry out upon this saying,
had he conceived as you now doe, that by the Catholique Church,
the Church of all Ages, since Christ, was to be understood. As for the
Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> it may speak not of such Books only, as were
certainly Canonicall, and for the regulating of Faith, but also of those
which were onely profitable, and lawfull to be read in the Church.
Which in <hi>England</hi> is a very slender Argument that the book is Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
where every body knowes that Apocryphall books are read as
well as Canonicall. But howsoever, if you understand by Fathers, not
only their immediate Fathers and Predecessors in the Gospell, but
the succession of them from the Apostles; they are right in the Thesis,
that <hi>whatsoever is received from these Fathers, as Canonicall, is to be so
esteem'd;</hi> Though in the application of it, to this or that particular
book they may happily erre, and think that Book received as Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
which was only received as Profitable to be read; and think that
Book, received alwaies, and by all, which was rejected by some, and
doubted of by many.</p>
               <p>55 <hi>But we cannot be certain, in what language the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
uncorrupted.</hi> Not so certain, I grant, as of that which wee can
demonstrate: But certain enough, morally certain, as certain as the
nature of the thing will beare. So certain we may be, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
no more. We may be as certain as S. <hi>Austin</hi> was, who in his
<hi>second book of Baptisme, against the Donatists, c.</hi> 3. plainly implies, <hi>the
Scripture might possibly be corrupted.</hi> He meanes sure in matters of little
moment, such as concerne not the Covenant between God and Man.
But thus he saith. The same S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his 48. <hi>Epist.</hi> cleerly intimates,

                  </note> That <hi>in the pervestigation of the true
and genuine Text, it was perspicuously manifest to all men, that there was
no Argument more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Ancient Books.</hi> Now this ground wee haue to build upon as well as
He had: and therefore our certainty is as great, and stands upon as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ground as his did.</p>
               <p>56 This is not all I haue to say in this matter. For I will adde
moreover, that we are as certaine in what Language the Scripture is
uncorrupted, as any man in your Church was, untill <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th
set forth your own approved <hi>Edition of your Vulgar</hi> translation. For
you doe not, nor cannot, without extreme impudence deny, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
then, there was great variety of Copies currant in divers parts of
your Church, and those very frequent in various lections: all which
Copies might possibly be false in some things, but more then one sort
of them, could not possibly be true in all things. Neither were it lesse
impudence to pretend, that any man in your Church, could untill <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's</hi>
time haue any certainty what that one true Copie and reading
was (if there were any one perfectly true.) Some indeed that had got
<hi>Sixtus his Bible,</hi> might after the Edition of that very likely think them
selues cock-sure of a perfect true uncorrupted Translation, without
being beholding to <hi>Clement;</hi> but how fowly they were abused and
deceived that thought so, the Edition of <hi>Clemens,</hi> differing from that
of <hi>Sixtus</hi> in a great multitude of places, doth sufficiently demonstrate.</p>
               <p>57 This certainty therefore in what language the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
uncorrupted, is it necessary to haue it, or is it not? If it be not, I
hope we may doe well enough without it. If it be necessary, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of your Church for 1500 yeares together? All which time you
must confesse she had no such certainty: no one man being able truly
and upon good ground to say, <hi>This or that Copy of the Bible is pure, and
perfect, and uncorrupted in all things.</hi> And now at this present, though
some of you are growne to a higher degree of Presumption in this
point, yet are you as farre as ever, from any true and reall, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
assurance of the absolute purity of your Authentique Translation:
which I suppose my selfe to haue prou'd unanswerably in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>58 In the <hi>sixteenth Division,</hi> It is objected to Protestants in a
long discourse transcrib'd out of the <hi>Protestants Apologie,</hi> That <hi>their
translations of the Scripture are very different, and by each other mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
condemned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luthers Translation</hi> by <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> and <hi>others:</hi> That <hi>of

use of by the Fathers and Doctors of it. For which I desire not that my
word, but S. <hi>Austin's</hi> may be taken. <hi>They which haue translated the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
out of the Hebrew into Greek, may be numbred, but the Latine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
are innumerable. For whensoever any one, in the first times of
Christianity, met with a Greek Bible, and seem'd to himselfe to haue some
ability in both Languages, he presently ventur'd upon an Interpretation.</hi>
So <hi>He,</hi> in his <hi>second book of Christian doctrine. Cap.</hi> 11. Of all these, that
which was called the <hi>Italian Translation</hi> was esteemed best; so we may
learne from the same S. <hi>Austin in the 15. Chap. of the same book. Amongst
all these Interpretations</hi> (saith he) <hi>let the Italian be preferr'd: for it keeps
closer to the Letter, and is perspicuous in the sense.</hi> Yet so farre was the
Church of that time from presuming upon the absolute puritie and
perfection, even of this best Translation, that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> thought it
necessary to make a new Translation of the Old Testament, out of the
Hebrew fountain, (which himselfe testifies in his Book <hi>de Viris illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribus,</hi>)
And to correct the vulgar version of the New Testament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the truth of the Originall Greek; amending many errors
which had crept into it, whether by the mistake of the Author, or the
negligence of the Transcribers; which work he undertook &amp; perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at the request of <hi>Damasus,</hi> Bishop of Rome. <hi>You constraine mee</hi>
(saith he) <hi>to make a new work of an old: that after the Copies of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
haue been dispersed through the whole world, I should sit as it were
an Arbitratour amongst them, and because they vary among themselues,
should determine what are those things (in them) which consent with the
Greek verity.</hi> And after: <hi>Therefore this present Preface promises the
foure Gospels only corrected by collation with Greek Copies. But that they
might not be very dissonant from the custome of the Latine Reading, I
haue so tempered with my stile, the Translation of the Ancients, that, those
things amended which did seem to change the sense, other things I haue
suffered to remain as they were.</hi> So that in this matter Protestants must
either stand or fall with the Primitiue Church.</p>
               <p>60 The Corruption that you charge <hi>Luther</hi> with, and the falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that you impute to <hi>Zwinglius, what haue we to doe with them? or
why may not we as justly lay to your charge the Errours which</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus,
<hi>or</hi> Paulus Brugensis, <hi>or</hi> Laurentius Valla, <hi>or</hi> Cajetan, <hi>or</hi> Erasmus,
<hi>or</hi> Arias Montanus, <hi>or</hi> Augustus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nebiensis, <hi>or</hi> Pagnine, <hi>haue committed
in their Translations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>61 Which yet I say not, as if these Translations of <hi>Luther</hi> and
<hi>Zwinglius</hi> were absolutely indefensible; for what such great difference
is there between <hi>Faith without the Works of the Law,</hi> and <hi>Faith alone
without the Works of the Law?</hi> or why does not, <hi>Without, Alone,</hi> signifie
all one with, <hi>Alone, Without?</hi> Consider the matter a little better, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the use of these phrases of speech in our ordinary talke, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you will begin to doubt whether you had sufficient ground for
this invectiue. And then for <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> if it bee true (as they say it is)
that the language our Saviour spake in, had no such word as, <hi>To signifie,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:7615:55"/>
but used alwaies, <hi>to be,</hi> insteed of it, as it is certain the Scripture does in
a hundred places; then this Translation, which you so declaim against,
will prove no falsification in <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> but a calumny in you.</p>
               <p>62 But the faith of Protestants relies upon Scripture alone; Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is delivered to most of them by Translations; Translations depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the skill and honesty of Men, who certainly may erre because they are
Men, and certainly doe erre, at least some of them, because their Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are contrary. It seemes then the Faith, and consequently the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Protestants relies upon fallible and uncertaine grounds.</p>
               <p>63 This Objection, though it may seeme to doe you great service
for the present; yet I feare you will repent the time that ever you ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it against us as a fault, that we make mens salvation <hi>depend upon
uncertainties.</hi> For the objection returnes upon you many waies, as
first thus; The salvation of many millions of Papists (as they suppose
and teach) depends upon their having the Sacrament of Pennance tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
administred unto them. This again upon the Minister's being a true
Priest. That such or such a man is Priest, not himselfe, much lesse any
other can haue any possible certainty: for it depends upon a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
contingent and uncertain supposals. He that will pretend to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of it, must undertake to know for a certain all these things that
follow.</p>
               <p>64 First that he was baptized with due Matter. Secondly, with
the due forme of words, (which he cannot know, unlesse he were both
present and attentiue.) Thirdly, he must know that hee was baptiz'd
with due Intention, and that is, that the Minister of his Baptisme was
not a secret Iew, nor a Moore, nor an Atheist, (of all which kinds, I
feare experience giues you just cause to feare, that <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi>
haue Priests not a few,) but a Christian in heart, as well as Profession;
(otherwise believing the Sacrament to be nothing, in giving it he could
intend to giue nothing,) nor a <hi>Sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>satenian,</hi> nor an <hi>Arrian:</hi> but one
that was capable of having due intention, from which they that belieue
not the doctrine of the Trinity are excluded by you. And lastly, that
he was neither drunk nor distracted at the administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor out of negligence or malice omitted his intention.</p>
               <p>65 Fourthly, he must undertake to know, that the Bishop which
ordained him Priest, ordained him compleatly with due Matter, Form
and Intention: and consequently, that he againe was neither Iew, nor
Moore, nor Atheist, nor lyable to any such exception, as is unconsistent
with due Intention in giving the Sacrament of Orders.</p>
               <p>66 Fiftly, he must undertake to know, that the Bishop which
made him Priest, was a Priest himselfe, for your rule is, <hi>Nihil dat quod
non habet:</hi> And consequently, that there was again none of the former
nullities in his Baptisme, which might make him incapable of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor no invalidity in his Ordination, but a true Priest to ordaine
him again, the requisite matter and forme and due intention all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring.</p>
               <p>67 Lastly, he must pretend to know the same of him that made him
Priest, and him that made Him Priest, even untill he comes to the very
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7615:55"/>
fountain of Priesthood. For take any one in the whole train &amp; successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Ordainers, &amp; suppose him, by reason of any defect, only a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
&amp; not a true Priest, then according to your doctrine he could not
give a true, but only a supposed Priesthood; and they that receive it of
him, &amp; again, they that derive it from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can give no better then they
received; receiving nothing but a name and shadow, can give nothing
but a name and shadow: and so from age to age, from generation to
generation being equivocall Fathers, beget only equivocall Sons; No
Principle in Geometry being more certain then this, That <hi>the unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
defect of any necessary Antecedent, must needs cause a nullity of
all those Consequences which depend upon it.</hi> In fine, to know this one
thing, you must first know ten thousand others, whereof not any one
is a thing that can be known; there being no necessity that it should be
true, which only can qualify any thing for an object of Science, but
only, at the best, a high degree of probability that it is so. But then, that
often thousand probables, no one should be false; that of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
requisites, whereof any one may faile, not one should be wanting,
this to mee is extreamly improbable, and even cosen german to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
So that the assurance hereof is like a machine composed of
an innumerable multitude of pieces, of which it is strangely unlikely
but some will be out of order; and yet if any one be so, the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of necessity falls to the ground. And he that shall put together,
and maturely consider all the possible waies of lapsing, and nullifying
a Priesthood in the Church of Rome, I believe will be very inclinable
to think, that it is an hundred to one, that amongst a hundred seeming
Priests, there is not one true one. Nay, that it is not a thing very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
that amongst those many millions, which make up the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Hierarchy, there are <hi>not twenty</hi> true. But be the truth in this
what it will be, once this is certain, that They which make mens salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as you doe) depend upon Priestly Absolution, and this again (as
you doe) upon the Truth and reality of the Priesthood that gives it,
and this lastly upon a great multitude of apparent uncertainties, are
not the fittest men in the world, to object to others as a horrible crime,
<hi>That they make mens Salvation depend upon fallible and uncertain foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</hi>
And let this be the first retortion of your Argument.</p>
               <p>68 But suppose this difficulty assoyled, and that an Angell from
Heaven should ascertain you (for other assurances you can have none)
that the person, you make use of, is a true Priest, and a competent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Sacrament of Pennance; yet still the doubt will remain,
whether he will doe you that good which he can doe, whether he will
pronounce the absolving words with intent to absolve you! For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he may bear you some secret malice, and project to himselfe your
damnation, for a compleat Italian revenge. Perhaps (as the tale is of a
Priest that was lately burnt in France) he may upon some conditions
have compacted with the Divell to give no Sacraments with Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Lastly, he may be (for ought you can possibly know) a secret Iew,
or Moore, or Anti-Trinitarian, or perhaps such a one as is so farre from
intending your forgivenesse of sinnes and salvation by this Sacrament,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7615:56"/>
that in his heart he laughes at all these things, and thinkes Sinne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and Salvation a word. All these doubts you must have cleerely
resolved (which can hardly be done but by another Revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) before
you can upon good grounds assure your selfe, that your true Priest
gives you true and effectuall absolution. So that when you have done
as much as God requires for your Salvation, yet can you by no means
be secure, but that you may have the ill luck to be damn'd: which is to
make Salvation a matter of chaunce, and not of choice, and which a
man may faile of, not only by an ill life, but by ill fortune. Verily a
most comfortable Doctrine for a considering man lying upon death
bed, who either feeles or feares that his repentance is but attritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only,
and not contrition, and consequently believes that if he be not absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
really by a true Priest, he cannot possibly escape damnation.
Such a man for his comfort, you tell, first (you that will have <hi>mens sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
depend upon no uncertainties,</hi>) that though he verily believe that
his sorrow for sinnes is a true sorrow, and his purpose of amendment
a true purpose; yet he may deceive himselfe, perhaps it is not, and if it
be not, he must be damned. Yet you bid him hope well: But <hi>Spes
est rei incertae nomen.</hi> You tell him secondly, that though the party
he confesses to, seem to be a true Priest, yet for ought he knowes, or
for ought himselfe knowes, by reason of some secret undiscernable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity
in his Baptisme or Ordination, he may be none: and if he be
none, he can doe nothing. This is a hard saying, but this is not the
worst. You tell him thirdly, that he may be in such a state that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
or if he can, that he will not give the Sacrament with due Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and if he does not, all's in vaine. Put case a man by these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
should be cast into some agonies; what advise, what comfort
would you give him? Verily I know not what you could say to him,
but this; that first for the Qualification required on his part, he might
know that he desired to have true sorrow, and that that is sufficient.
But then if he should aske you, why he might not know his sorrow
to be a true sorrow, as well as his desire to be sorrowfull, to be a true
desire, I believe you would be put to silence. Then secondly, to quiet
his feares, concerning the Priest and his intention you should tell him,
by my advice, that Gods goodnesse (which will not suffer him to
damne men for not doing better then their best,) will supply all such
defects as to humane endeavours were unavoidable. And therefore
though his Priest were indeed no Priest, yet to him he should be as if
he were one: and if he gave Absolution without Intention, yet in doing
so he should hurt himselfe only and not his penitent. This were some
comfort indeed, and this were to settle mens salvation upon reasonable
certain grounds. But this I fear you will never say; for this were to
reverse many Doctrines established by your Church, and besides to
degrade your Priesthood from a great part of their honour, by les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening
the strict necessity of the Laities dependance upon them. For it
were to say, that <hi>the Priests Intention is not necessary to the obtaining of
absolution;</hi> which is to say, that it is not in the Parsons power to damne
whom he will in his Parish, because by this rule, God should supply
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7615:56"/>
the defect which his malice had caused. And besides it were to say,
that <hi>Infants dying without Baptisme might be saved,</hi> God supplying
the want of baptisme which to them is unavoidable. But beyond all
this, it were to put into my mouth a full and satisfying answere to
your Argument, which I am now returning, so that in answering my
objection you should answer your own. For then I should tell you,
that it were altogether as abhorrent from the goodnesse of God, and as
repugnant to it, to suffer an ignorant Lay-mans soule to perish, meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for being misled by an undiscernable false Translation, which yet
was commended to him by the Church, which (being of necessity to
credit some in this matter) he had reason to rely upon either above all
other; or as much as any other, as it is to damne a penitent sinner for a
secret defect in that desired Absolution, which his Ghostly Father
perhaps was an Atheist and could not give him, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was a villain and
would not. This answere therefore, which alone would serve to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
your penitent in his perplexities, and to assure him that he cannot
faile of Salvation if he will not, for feare of inconveniences you must
forbeare. And seeing you must, I hope you will come down from
the Pulpit, and preach no more against others for <hi>making mens Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
depend upon fallible and uncertain grounds,</hi> least by judging others,
you make your selves and your own Church inexcusable, who are
strongly guilty of this fault, above all the men and Churches of the
World: whereof I have already given you two very pregnant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,
drawn from your presumptions tying God and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to your Sacraments; And the efficacy of them to your Priests
Qualifications and Intentions.</p>
               <p>69 Your making the Salvation of Infants depend on Baptisme a
Casuall thing, and in the power of man to conferre, or not conferre,
would yeild me a Third of the same nature. And your suspending
the same on the Baptizer's intention a Fourth. And lastly your making
the Reall presence of Christ in the Eucharist depend upon the casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the consecrators true Priesthood and Intention, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
men to believe it for certain that he is present, and to adore
the Sacrament, which according to your Doctrine, for ought they can
possibly know, may be nothing else but a piece of bread, so exposing
them to the danger of Idolatry, and consequently of damnation, doth
offer me a Fift demonstration of the same conclusion, if I thought fit
to insist upon them. But I have no mind to draw any more out of this
Fountaine; neither doe I think it charity to cloy the Reader with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
when the subject affords variety.</p>
               <p>70 Sixtly, therefore I returne it thus. The faith of Papists relyes
alone upon their Churches infallibility. That there is any Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
and that Theirs is it, they pretend not to believe, but only upon
<hi>prudentiall motives.</hi> Dependance upon prudentiall motives they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
to be obnoxious to a possibility of erring. What then remaineth
but Truth, Faith, Salvation, and all must in them rely upon a fallible
and uncertain ground!</p>
               <p>71 Seventhly, The faith of Papists relies upon the Church alone.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7615:57"/>
The Doctrine of the Church is delivered to most of them by their
Parish Priest, or Ghostly Father, or at least by a company of Priests,
who for the most part sure, are men and not Angels, in whom nothing
is more certain then a most certain possibility to erre. What then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
but that Truth, Faith, Salvation and all, must in them rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a fallible and uncertain ground.</p>
               <p>72 Eightly thus. It is apparent and undeniable, that many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
there are, who believe your Religion upon no better grounds,
then a man may have for the beliefe almost of any Religion. As some
believe it, because their forefathers did so, and they were good People.
Some, because they were Christened, and brought up in it. Some, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many Learned and Religious men are of it. Some, because it is
the Religion of their Country, where all other Religions are persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and proscribed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some, because Protestants cannot shew a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
succession of Professors of all their Doctrine. Some, because the
service of your Church is more stately, and pompous, &amp; magnificent.
Some, because they find comfort in it. Some, because your Religion is
farther spread, and hath more professors of it, then the Religion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.
Some, because <hi>your Priests compasse Sea and Land to gain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
to it.</hi> Lastly, an infinite number, by chance, and they know not
why, but only because they are sure they are in the right. This which
I say is a most certain experimented truth, and if you will deale inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously,
you will not deny it. And without question he that builds his
faith upon our <hi>English Translation,</hi> goes upon a more prudent ground
then any of these can, with reason, be pretended to be. What then
can you alleadge but that, with you, rather then with us, Truth and
Faith and Salvation and all relies upon fallible and uncertain
grounds.</p>
               <p>73 Ninthly. Your <hi>Rhemish</hi> and <hi>Doway</hi> Translations are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to your Proselytes, (such I mean that are dispen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d with for the
reading of them,) for the direction of their Faith and lives. And the
same may be said of your Translations of the Bible into other natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
languages, in respect of those that are licenc'd to read them. This
I presume you will confesse. And moreover, that these Translations
came not by inspiration, but were the productions of humane Industry;
and that not Angels, but men were the Authors of them. Men I say,
meere men, subject to the same Passions and to the same possibility of
erring with our Translatours. And then how does it not unavoidably
follow, that in them which depend upon these translations for their
direction, Faith, and Truth, and Salvation, and all relies upon fallible
and uncertain grounds?</p>
               <p>74 Tenthly and lastly (to lay the axe to the root of the tree,) the
<hi>Helena</hi> which you so fight for, your vulgar Translation, though some
of you believe, or pretend to believe, it to be in every part and particle
of it, the pure and uncorrupted word of God; yet others among you,
and those as good &amp; zealous Catholiques as you, are not so confident
hereof.</p>
               <p>75 First, for all those who have made Translations of the whole
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7615:57"/>
Bible or any part of it different many times in sense from the Vulgar,
as <hi>Lyranus, Cajetan, Pagnine, Arias, Erasmus, Valla, Steuchus,</hi> and others,
it is apparent and even palpable, that they never dreamt of any abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
perfection and authenticall infallibility of the <hi>Vulgar Translation.</hi>
For if they had, why did they in many places reject it and differ from
it?</p>
               <p>76 <hi>Vega</hi> was present at the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> when that decree
was made, which made the <hi>Vulgar Edition</hi> (then not extant any where
in the world) <hi>authenticall,</hi> and not to be rejected upon any pretense
whatsoever. At the forming this decree <hi>Vega</hi> I say was present, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the mind of the Councell, as well as any man, and professes
that he was instructed in it by the <hi>President</hi> of it, the <hi>Cardinall S. Cruce.</hi>
And yet he hath written that <hi>the Councell in this decree, meant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this Translation free</hi> (not simply from all error) <hi>but only from
such errors, out of which any opinion pernitious to faith and manners
might be collected.</hi> This, <hi>Andradius</hi> in his defence of that Councell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of <hi>Vega,</hi> and assents to it himselfe. <hi>Driedo,</hi> in his <hi>book of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Holy Scripture,</hi> hath these words very pregnant and pertinent
to the same purpose; <hi>The See Apostolike, hath approved or accepted Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms
Edition, not as so wholly consonant to the Originall, and so entire
and pure and restored in all things, that it may not be lawfull for any man,
either by comparing it with the Fountaine to examine it, or in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to doubt, whether or no Hierome did understand the true sense of the
Scripture; but only as an Edition to be prefer'd before all others then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and no where deviating from the truth in the rules of faith and good
life. Mariana,</hi> even where he is a most earnest Advocate for the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Edition, yet acknowledges the imperfection of it in these words,
<hi>The faults of the Vulgar Edition are not approved by the Decree of the
Councell of Trent,</hi>

                  <hi>a multitude whereof we did collect from the variety
of Copies.</hi> And againe, <hi>We maintaine that the Hebrew and Greeke, were
by no meanes rejected by the Trent Fathers: And that the Latine edition
is indeed approved, yet not so, as if they did deny that some places might
be translated more plainly, some more properly; whereof it were easy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
innumerable examples.</hi> And this he there professes to have <hi>learnt
of Laines the then Generall of the Society:</hi> who was a great part of that
Councell, present at all the Actions of it, and of very great authority
in it.</p>
               <p>77 To this so great authority he addes a reason of his opinion,
which with all indifferent men will be of a farre greater authority.
<hi>If the Councell</hi> (saith he) <hi>had purposed to approve an Edition in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
and to make it of equall authority and credit with the Fountaines,
certainly they ought with exact care first to have corrected the errors of
the Interpreter:</hi> which certainly they did not.</p>
               <p>78 Lastly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe, though he will not acknowledge
any imperfection in the Vulgar Edition,<note place="margin">Bell. deverb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

case may, and does oft-times so fall out, that <hi>it is impossible to discerne
which is the true reading of the Vulgar Edition, but only by recourse unto
the Originalls, and dependance upon them.</hi>

79 From all which it may evidently be collected, that though
some of you flatter your selves with a vain imagination of the certain
absolute purity and perfection of your Vulgar Edition; yet the matter
is not so certain, and so resolved, but that the best learned men amongst
you are often at a stand, and very doubtfull sometimes whether your
Vulgar translation be true, and sometimes whether this or that be
your Vulgar Translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; sometimes undoubtedly resolved that your
Vulgar Translation is no true Translation, nor consonant to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
as it was at first delivered. And what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be alleadged, but that
out of your own grounds it may be inferred &amp; inforced upon you, that
not only in your Lay-men, but your Clergy men &amp; Schollers, Faith &amp;
Truth and Salvation &amp; all depends upon fallible &amp; uncertain grounds?
And thus by ten severall retortions of this one Argument, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to shew you, how ill you have complyed with your own
advise, which was <hi>to take heed of urging arguments that might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
upon you.</hi> I should now by a direct answer, shew that it presseth
not us at all: but I have in passing done it already, in the end of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
retortion of this argument, and thither I referre the Reader.</p>
               <p>80 Whereas therefore, you exhort them <hi>that will have assurance
of true Scriptures, to fly to your Church for it:</hi> I desire to know (if they
should follow your advise) how they should be assured that your
Church can give them any such assurance; which hath been <hi>confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
so negligent, as to suffer many <hi>whole books of Scripture</hi> to be utterly
lost. Again, in those that remain, confessedly so negligent, as to suffer
<hi>the Originalls of these that remain to be corrupted.</hi> And lastly, so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of preserving the integrity of the Copies of her Translation, as to
suffer <hi>infinite variety of Readings</hi> to come in to them, without keeping
<hi>any one perfect Copy,</hi> which might have been as the Standard, and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus</hi>
his Canon to correct the rest by. So that which was the true
reading, and which the false, it was utterly undiscernable, but only by
comparing them with the Originalls, which also she pretends <hi>to be
corrupted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>81 <hi>But</hi> Luther himselfe, by unfortunate experience, was at length
enforced to confesse thus much, saying, If the world last longer, it will be
again necessary to receive the Decrees of Councells, by reason of divers
interpretations of Scripture which now reigne.</p>
               <p>82 And what if <hi>Luther,</hi> having a <hi>Pope in his belly,</hi> (as he was wont
to say that most men had,) and desiring perhaps to have his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
passe without examining, spake such words in heat of
Argument? Doe you think it reasonable that we should subscribe to
<hi>Luther's</hi> divinations and angry speeches? will you oblige your selfe
to answer for all the assertions of your private Doctors? If not; why
doe you trouble us with what <hi>Luther</hi> saies, and what <hi>Calvin</hi> saies? Yet
this I say not, as if these words of <hi>Luther</hi> made any thing at all for
your present purpose. For what if he feared, or pretended to feare,
that, the infallibility of Councells being rejected, some men would fall
into greater errors, then were impos'd upon them by the Councells?
Is this to confesse that there is any present visible Church, upon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7615:58"/>
whose bare Authority we may infallibly receive the true Scriptures
and the true sense of them? Let the Reader judge. But in my opinion,
to feare a greater inconvenience may follow from the avoiding of the
lesse, is not to confesse that the lesse is none at all.</p>
               <p>83 For D. <hi>Covels commending your Translation,</hi> what is it to the
businesse in hand? or how proves it the perfection of it, which is here
contested, any more then S. <hi>Augustine's</hi> commending the Italian
Translation, argues the perfection of that, or that there was no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> should correct it? D. <hi>Covell</hi> commends your
Translation, and so does the <hi>Bishop of Chichester,</hi> and so does <hi>D. Iames,</hi>
and so doe I. But I commend it for a <hi>good</hi> Translation, not for a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
Good may be good, and deserve commendations; and yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may be better. And though he saies, that <hi>the then approved Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Church of England, is that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth nearest the Vulgar,</hi>
yet he does not say, that it agrees exactly with it. So that whereas you
inferre, <hi>that the truth of your Translation must be the Rule to judge of the
goodnesse of ours:</hi> this is but a vain florish. For to say of our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
That is the best which comes nearest the Vulgar, (and yet it is
but one man that saies so,) is not to say, it is therefore the best because
it does so. For this may be true by accident, and yet the truth of our
Translation no way depend upon the truth of yours. For had that
been their direction, they would not only have made a Translation
that should come neere to yours, but such a one which should exactly
agree with it, and be a Translation of your Translation.</p>
               <p>84 <hi>Ad</hi> 17. §. In this Division you charge us <hi>with great uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
concerning the true meaning of Scripture.</hi> Which hath been answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
already, by saying, That if you speak of plain places, (and in such
all things necessary are contained,) we are sufficiently certain of the
meaning of them, neither need they any Interpreter. If of obscure and
difficult places, we confesse we are uncertaine of the sense of many of
them. But then we say there is no necessity we should be certain. For
if Gods will had been we should haue understood him more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he would haue spoken more plainly. And we say besides, that as
we are uncertain, so are You too; which he that doubts of, let him
read your Commentators upon the Bible, and obserue their various
and dissonant interpretations, and he shall in this point need no further
satisfaction.</p>
               <p>85 But seeing <hi>there are contentions among us, we are taught by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Scripture, and experience</hi> (so you tell us out of M. <hi>Hooker) to
seek for the ending of them, by submitting unto some Iudiciall sentence,
whereunto neither part may refuse to stand.</hi> This is very true. Neither
should you need to persuade us to seek such a meanes of ending all our
Controversies, if we could tell where to finde it. But this wee know,
that none is fit to pronounce, for all the world, a judiciall definitiue
obliging sentence in Controversies of Religion, but only such a Man,
or such a society of Men, as is authoriz'd thereto by God. And besides
we are able to demonstrate, that it hath not been the pleasure of God
to giue to any Man, or Society of Men any such authority. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7615:59"/>
though we wish heartily that all Controversies were ended, as we
doe that all sinne were abolisht, yet we haue little hope of the one, or
the other, till the World be ended. And in the mean while, think it
best to content our selues with, and to persuade others unto an <hi>Vnity
of Charity and mutuall toleration;</hi> seeing God hath authoriz'd no man
to force all men to <hi>Vnity of Opinion.</hi> Neither doe we think it fit to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
thus, To us it seemes convenient there should be one Iudge of all
Controversies for the whole world, therefore God has appointed
one: But more modest and more reasonable to collect thus, God hath
appointed no such judge of Controversies, therefore, though it seemes
to us convenient there should be one, yet it is not so: Or though it were
convenient for us to haue one, yet it hath pleased God (for Reasons best
known to himselfe) not to allow us this convenience.</p>
               <p>86 D. <hi>Fields</hi> words which follow, I confesse, are somewhat more
pressing: and if he had been infallible, and the words had not slipt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly
from him, they were the best Argument in your Book. But
yet it is evident out of his Book, &amp; so acknowledg'd by some of your
own, That he never thought of any one company of Christians inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with such authority from God, that all men were bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
their Decrees without examination, though they seem contrary
to Scripture and Reason, which the Church of Rome requires. And
therefore if he haue in his Preface strained too high in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of
the subject he writes of, (as Writers very often doe in their Prefaces
and Dedicatory Epistles) what is that to us? Besides, by <hi>all the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
of the World,</hi> it is not impossible, nor very improbable, hee might
meane all that are, or haue been in the world, and so include even
the <hi>Primitiue Church:</hi> and her Communion we shall embrace, her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
we shall follow, her Iudgement we shall rest in, if wee belieue
the Scripture, endeavour to finde the true sense of it, and liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it.</p>
               <p>87 <hi>Ad</hi> 18. §. That the true Interpretation of the Scripture ought
to be receaved from the Church, you need not prove, for it is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
granted by them, who professe themselves very ready to receiue
all Truths, much more the true sense of Scripture, not only from the
Church, but from any societie of men, nay from any man whatsoever.</p>
               <p>88 That the <hi>Churches Interpretation of Scripture is alwaies true,</hi>
that is it which you would haue said: and that in some sense may bee
also admitted. <hi>viz.</hi> if your speake of that Church (which before
you spake of in the 14. §.) that is, of the Church of all Ages since the
Apostles. Vpon the Tradition of which Church, you there told us, <hi>We
were to receiue the Scripture, and to belieue it to bee the Word of God.</hi>
For there you teach us, that <hi>our Faith of Scripture depends on a Principle
which requires no other proofe,</hi> And that, <hi>such is Tradition, which from
hand to hand, and age to age bringing us up to the Times and Persons of
the Apostles and our Saviour himselfe, commeth to be confirmed by all
those Miracles, and other Arguments whereby they convinced their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to be true.</hi> Wherefore the Ancient Fathers avouch that wee
must receiue the sacred Scripture upon the Tradition of this Church.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7615:59"/>
The Tradition then of this Church you say must teach us what is
Scripture: and we are willing to belieue it. And now if you make it
good unto us, that the same Tradition down from the Apostles, hath
delivered from age to age, and from hand to hand, any interpretation
of any Scripture, we are ready to embrace that also. But now, if you
will argue thus: The Church in one sense, tells us what is Scripture, &amp;
we belieue, therefore if the Church taken in another sense, tell us, this
or that is the meaning of the Scripture, we are to belieue that also; this
is too transparent Sophistrie, to take any but those that are willing to
be taken.</p>
               <p>89 If there be any Traditiue Interpretation of Scripture, produce
it, and proue it to be so; and we embrace it. But the Tradition of all
ages is one thing; and the authority of the present Church, much
more of the Roman Church, which is but a Part, and a corrupted Part
of the Catholique Church, is another. And therefore though we are
ready to receiue both Scripture and the sense of Scripture upon the
authority of <hi>Originall Tradition,</hi> yet we receiue neither the one, nor
the other, upon the Authority of your Church.</p>
               <p>90 First for the Scripture, how can wee receiue them upon the
Authority of your Church: who hold now those Books to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
which formerly you rejected from the Canon? I instance, in the
<hi>Book of Macchabees,</hi> and the <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews.</hi> The first of these
you held not to be Canonicall in <hi>S. Gregories</hi> time, or else hee was no
member of your Church, for it is apparent<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Greg. Mor. l. 19. c. 13.</note> He held otherwise. The

                  </note> many places of his Works.</p>
               <p>91 If you say (which is all you can say) that <hi>Hierom spake this of
the particular Roman Church, not of the Roman Catholique Church;</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
there was none such in his time, None that was called so. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what he spake of the Roman Church, must be true of all other
Churches, if your Doctrine of the necessity of the Conformity of all
other Churches to that Church were then Catholique Doctrine.
Now then choose whether you will, either that the particular Roman
Church, was not then beleived to be the Mistresse of all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(notwithstanding, <hi>Ad hanc Ecclesiam necesse est omnem conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Ecclesiam, hoc est, omnes qui sunt undi<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan> fideles;</hi> which Card. <hi>Perron,</hi>
and his <hi>Translatresse</hi> so often translates false:) Or if you say shee was,
you will runne into a greater inconvenience, and be forced to say, that
all the Churches of that time, rejected from the Canon the Epistle to
the Hebrews, together with the Roman Church. And consequently
that the Catholique Church may erre in rejecting from the Canon
Scriptures truly Canonicall.</p>
               <p>92 Secondly, How can we receive the Scripture upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Roman Church, which hath delivered at severall times
Scriptures in many places, different and repugnant, for Authenticall &amp;
Canonicall? Which is most evident out of the place of <hi>Malachie,</hi>
which is so quoted for the Sacrifice of the Masse, that either all the
ancient Fathers had false Bibles, or yours is false. Most evident like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7615:60"/>
from the comparing of the story of <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Genesis,</hi> with that
which is cited out of it, in the <hi>Epistle to the Hebrewes,</hi> according to the
vulgar Edition. But aboue all, to any one, who shall compare the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> so evident, that the wit of man cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
it.</p>
               <p>93 And thus you see what reason we haue to belieue your Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
<hi>That your Church it is which must declare, what Books bee true
Scripture.</hi> Now for the consequence, that certainty is as liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
as the Antecedent. For if it were true, that God had promised
to assist you, for the delivering of true Scripture, would this oblige
Him, or would it follow from hence that He had oblig'd himselfe,
to teach you, not only sufficiently, but <hi>effectually</hi> and <hi>irresistibly</hi> the
true sense of Scripture? God is not defectiue in things necessary: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will he leave himselfe without witnesse, nor the World without
meanes of knowing his will and doing it. And therefore it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that by his Providence he should preserve the Scripture from any
undiscernable corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in those things which he would haue known:
otherwise it is apparent, it had not been his will, that these things
should be known, the only meanes of continuing the knowledge
of them being perished. But now neither is God lavish in superfluities,
and therefore having given us meanes sufficient for our direction, and
power sufficient to make use of these meanes, he will not constraine or
necessitate us to make use of these meanes. For that were to crosse the
end of our Creation, which was to be glorified by our free obedience:
whereas necessity and freedome cannot stand together. That were to
reverse the Law which he hath prescribed to himselfe in his dealing
with men, and that is, <hi>to set life and death before him, and to leaue
him in the hands of his own Counsell.</hi> God gaue the Wisemen a Starre
to lead them to <hi>Christ,</hi> but he did not necessitate them to follow the
guidance of this starre: that was left to their liberty. God gaue the
Children of <hi>Israel a Fire to lead them by night, and a Pillar of Cloud by
day,</hi> but he constrained no man to follow them: that was left to their
liberty. So he giues the Church, the Scripture: which in those things
which are to be believed or done, are plain and easie to be follow'd, like
the Wise men's Starre. Now that which he desires of us on our part, is
the Obedience of Faith, and loue of the Truth, and desire to finde the
true sense of it, and industry in searching it, and humility in following,
and Constancy in professing it: all which if he should work in us by an
absolute irresistible necessity, he could no more require of us, as our
duty, then he can of the Sunne to shine, of the Sea to ebb &amp; flowe, and of
all other Creatures to doe those things which by meere necessity they
must doe, and cannot choose. Besides, what an impudence is it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that <hi>your Church is infallibly directed concerning the true meaning
of the Scripture,</hi> whereas there are thousands of places of Scripture,
which you doe not pretend certainly to understand, and about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
whereof, your own Doctors differ among themselues? If
your Church be infallibly directed concerning the true meaning of
Scripture, why doe not your Doctors follow her infallible direction?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7615:60"/>
And if they doe, how comes such difference among them in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations?</p>
               <p>94 Again, why does your Church thus put her candle under a
Bushell, and keep her Talent of interpreting Scripture infallibly, thus
long wrapt up in napkins? Why sets she not forth Infallible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
or Expositions upon all the Bible? Is it because this would
not be profitable for Christians, that Scripture should be Interpreted?
It is blasphemous to say so. The Scripture it selfe tells us, <hi>All Scripture
is profitable.</hi> And the Scripture is not so much the Words as the Sense.
And if it be not profitable, why does shee imploy particular Doctors
to interpret Scriptures fallibly? unlesse we must think that fallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of Scripture are profitable, and infallible interpretations
would not be so?</p>
               <p>95 If you say <hi>the Holy Ghost, which assists the Church in interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
will move the Church to interpret when he shall think fit, and that
the Church will doe it when the Holy Ghost shall move her to doe it:</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
whether the Holy Ghost's moving of the Church to such
works as these be resistible by the Church, or irresistible. If resistible,
then the Holy Ghost may move, and the Church may not be moved.
As certainly the Holy Ghost doth alwaies move to an action, when he
shewes us plainly that it would be for the good of men, and honour of
God. As he that hath any sense will acknowledge that an infallible
exposition of Scripture could not but be, and there is no conceivable
reason, why such a work should be put off a day, but only because you
are conscious to your selves, you cannot doe it, and therefore make
excuses. But if the moving of the Holy Ghost be irresistible, and you
are not yet so mov'd to goe about this work; then I confesse you are
excused. But then I would know, whether those Popes which so long
deferred the calling of a Councell for the Reformation of your
Church, at length pretended to be effected by the Councell of Trent,
whether they may excuse themselves, for that they were not moved
by the Holy Ghost to doe it? I would know likewise, as this motion is
irresistible when it comes, so whether it be so simply necessary to the
moving of your Church to any such publique Action, that it cannot
possibly move without it? That is, whether the Pope now could not,
if he would, seat himselfe <hi>in Cathedra,</hi> and fall to writing expositions
upon the Bible for the directions of Christians to the true sense of it?
If you say he cannot, you will make your selfe ridiculous. If he can,
then I would know, whether he should be infallibly directed in these
expositions, or no? If he should, then what need he to stay for irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
motion? Why does he not goe about this noble worke presently?
If he should not, How shall we know that the calling of the Councell
of Trent was not upon his own voluntary motion, or upon humane
importunity and suggestion, and not upon the motion of the Holy
Ghost? And consequently how shall we know whether he were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant
to it or no, seeing he assists none but what he himselfe moves
to? And whether he did move the Pope to call this Councell, is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
thing, which we cannot possibly know, nor perhaps the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:7615:61"/>
96 If you say, your meaning is only, <hi>That the Church shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
guarded from giving any false sense of any Scripture, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
assisted positively to give the true sense of all Scripture:</hi> I put to
you your own Question, why should we believe the Holy Ghost will
stay there? Or, why may we not as well think he will stay at the first
thing, that is, in teaching the Church what Bookes be true Scripture?
For if the Holy Ghosts assistance be promised to all things profitable,
then will he be with them infallibly, not only to guard them from all
errors, but to guide them to all profitable truths, such as the true sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of all Scripture would be. Neither could he stay there, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them irresistibly from all Vices; Nor there neither, but infuse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them irresistibly all Vertues: for all these things would be much
for the benefit of Christians. If you say, he cannot doe this without
taking away their free will in living; I say neither can he necessitate
men to believe aright, without taking away their freewill in believing
and in professing their belief.</p>
               <p>97 To the place of S. <hi>Austine,</hi> I answere, That not the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the present Church, much lesse of a Part of it (as the Roman
Church is) was that which alone mov'd Saint <hi>Austine</hi> to believe the
Gospell, but the perpetuall Tradition of the Church of all Ages.
Which you your selfe have taught us to be the <hi>only Principle by which
the Scripture is prov'd, and which it selfe needs no proof;</hi> and to which
you have referred this very saying of S. <hi>Austine, Ego vero Evangelio
non crederem nisi &amp;c. p.</hi> 55. And in the next place which you cite out of
his book <hi>De Vtil. Cred. c.</hi> 14. he shewes, that his <hi>motives to believe,
were, Fame, Celebrity, Consent, Antiquity.</hi> And seeing this Tradition,
this Consent, this Antiquity did as fully and powerfully move him
not to believe <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> as to believe the Gospell, (the Christian Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
being as full against <hi>Manichaeus</hi> as it was for the Gospell)
therefore he did well to conclude upon these grounds, that he had
as much reason to disbelieve <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> as to believe the Gospell.
Now if you can truly say, that the same Fame, Celebrity, Consent,
Antiquity, that the same Vniversall and Originall Tradition, lyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> as did against <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> you may doe
well to apply the Argument against them; otherwise it will be to little
purpose to substitute their names in steade of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> unlesse you
can shew the thing agrees to them as well as him.</p>
               <p>98 If you say, that <hi>S. Austin speakes here of the authority of the
Present Church, abstracting from consent with the Ancient,</hi> and therefore
you, seeing you have the present Church on your side against <hi>Luther</hi>
and <hi>Calvin,</hi> as <hi>S. Austin</hi> against <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> may urge the same words
against them which <hi>S. Austin</hi> did against him;</p>
               <p>99 I answer, First that it is a vaine presumption of yours that the
<hi>Catholique Church is of your side.</hi> Secondly, that if <hi>S. Austine</hi> speake
here of that present Church, which moved him to believe the Gospel,
without consideration of the Antiquity of it, &amp; its both Personall and
Doctrinall succession from the Apostles; His argument will be like a
<hi>Buskin</hi> that will serve anylegge. It will serve to keepe an <hi>Arrian,</hi> or a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7615:61"/>
                  <hi>Grecian</hi> from being a Roman Catholique, as well as a Catholique
from being an <hi>Arrian,</hi> or a <hi>Grecian?</hi> In as much as the <hi>Arrians</hi> and
<hi>Grecians,</hi> did pretend to the title of Catholiques, and the Church, as
much as the Papists now doe. If then you should haue come to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Goth</hi> or <hi>Vandall,</hi> whom the <hi>Arrians</hi> converted to Christianity,
and should haue mov'd him to your Religion; might he not say the
very same words to you as <hi>S. Austin</hi> to the <hi>Manichaeans? I would not
beleive the Gospell, unlesse the authority of the Church did move me.
Them therefore whom I obeyed, saying beleive the Gospell, why should I
not obey saying to me, doe not beleive the Homoousians? Choose what thou
pleasest: if thou shalt say beleive the Arrians; they warne me not to give
any credit to you. If therefore I beleive them, I cannot beleive thee. If thou
say doe not beleive the Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, thou shalt not doe well to force me to the faith
of the Homoousians, because by the preaching of the Arrians I beleived
the Gospell it selfe. If you say, you did well to beleive them, commending
the Gospell, but you did not well to beleive them discommending the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousians:
Doest thou think me so very foolish, that without any reason
at all, I should beleive what thou wilt, and not beleive what thou wilt not?</hi> It
were easie to put these words into the mouth of a <hi>Grecian, Abyssine,
Georgian,</hi> or any other of any Religion. And I pray bethinke your
selves, what you would say to such a one in such a case, and imagine
that we say the very same to you.</p>
               <p>100 Whereas you aske, <hi>Whether Protestants doe not perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
those men to whom</hi> S. <hi>Austine spake, when they will have men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Roman Church delivering Scripture, but not to believe her
condemning Luther?</hi> I demand againe, whether you be well in your
wits to say, that Protestants would have men believe the Roman
Church delivering Scripture, whereas they accuse her to deliver many
bookes for Scripture which are not so? and doe not bid men to receive
any book which she delivers, for that reason, because she delivers it?
And if you meant only, Protestants will have men to believe some
bookes to be Scripture which the Roman Church delivers for such,
may not we then aske, as you doe, Doe not Papists perfectly resemble
these men, which will have men believe the Church of England deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
Scripture, but not to believe her condemning the Church of
Rome?</p>
               <p>101 And whereas you say S. <hi>Austine may seeme to have spoken Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
against Protestants, when he said, Why should I not most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
enquire, what Christ commanded, of them before all others, by whose
Authority I was moved to believe, that Christ Commanded any good
thing?</hi> I answer. Vntill you can shew that Protestants believe that
Christ commanded any good thing, that is, That they believe the
truth of Christian Religion upon the Authority of the Church of
Rome, this place must be wholly impertinent to your purpose; which
is to make Protestants believe your Church to be the infallible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder
of Scriptures and judge of Controversies: nay rather is it not
directly against your purpose? For why may not a member of the
Church of England, who received his baptisme, education and Faith
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7615:62"/>
from the Ministery of this Church, say just so to you as S. <hi>Austine</hi> here
to the Manichees? Why should I not most diligently inquire, what
Christ commanded, of them (the Church of England) before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by whose Authority I was mov'd to believe, that Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
any good thing, Can you, F. or K. or whosoever you are,
better declare to me what he said, whom I would not have thought to
have been or to be, if the belief thereof had been recommended by
you to me? This therefore (that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> did those miracles, and
taught that Doctrine which is contained evidently in the undoubted
Bookes of the New Testament) I believed by Fame, strengthned with
Celebrity &amp; Consent, (even of those which in other things are at infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
variance one with another,) and lastly by Antiquity (which gives
an universall and a constant attestation to them). But every one may
see that you, so few (in comparison of all those upon whose consent
we ground our belief of Scripture,) so turbulent, (that you damne all
to the fire, and to Hell, that any way differ from you; that you professe
it is lawfull for you, to use violence and power whensoever you can
have it, for the planting of your own doctrine, and the extirpation of
the contrary;) lastly so new in many of your Doctrines, (as in the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
and expedience of debarring the Laity the Sacramentall Cup;
the lawfulnesse and expedience of your Latine Service, Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
Indulgences, Purgatory, the Popes infallibility, his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over Kings &amp;c.) so new I say, in comparison of the undoubted
bookes of Scripture, which evidently containeth, or rather is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the sole, and adequate object of our faith: I say every one
may see that you, so few, so turbulent, so new, can produce nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Authority (with wise and considerate men). What madnesse
is this? Believe them the consent of Christians which are now, and
have been ever since Christ in the World, that we ought to believe
Christ; but learn of us what Christ said, which contradict and damne
all other parts of Christendome. Why I beseech you? Surely if they
were not at all, and could not teach me any thing, I would more easily
perswade my selfe, that I were not to believe in Christ, then that I
should learn any thing concerning him, from any other, then them by
whom I believed him: at least, then that I should learn what his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was from you, who have wronged so exceedingly his Miracles
and his Doctrine, by forging so evidently so many false Miracles for
the Confirmation of your new Doctrine; which might give us just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
had we no other assurance of them but your Authority, to
suspect the true ones. Who with forging so many false Stories, and
false Authors, have taken a faire way to make the faith of all Stories
questionable; if we had no other ground for our belief of them but
your Authority: who have brought in Doctrines plainly and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary to that which you confesse to be the word of Christ, and
which, for the most, part make either for the honour or profit of the
Teachers of them: which (if there were no difference between the
Christian and the Roman Church) would be very apt to make suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men believe that Christian Religion was a humane invention,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7615:62"/>
taught by some cunning Impostors, only to make themselves rich and
powerfull; who make a profession of corrupting all sorts of Authors:
a ready course to make it justly questionable whether any remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted.
For if you take this Authority upon you, upon the sixe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
last past; how shall we know, that the Church of that time, did not
usurpe the same authority upon the Authors of the sixe last Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and so upwards untill we come to Christ himselfe? Whose
question'd Doctrines, none of them came from the fountain of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike
tradition, but have insinuated themselves into the Streames, by
little and little, some in one age, and some in another, some more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
some more lately, and some yet are Embrio's, yet hatching,
and in the shell; as the Popes infallibility, the Blessed Virgins imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
conception, the Popes power over the Temporalties of Kings,
the Doctrine of Predetermination, &amp;c. all which yet are, or in time
may be impos'd upon Christians under the Title of <hi>Originall and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike
Tradition,</hi> and that with that necessity, that they are told,
they were as good believe nothing at all, as not believe these things to
have come from the Apostles, which they know to have been brought
in but yesterday: which whether it be not a ready and likely way to
make men conclude thus with themselves— I am told, that I were as
good believe nothing at all, as believe some points which the Church
teaches me, and not others: &amp; somethings which she teaches to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Certain, I plainly see to be New &amp; False, therefore I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nothing at all. Whether I say the foresaid grounds be not a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and likely way to make men conclude thus, and whether this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
be not too often made in Italy, &amp; Spain, and France, and in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
too, I leave it to the judgement of those that have wisdome and
experience. Seeing therefore the Roman Church is so farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a sufficient Foundation for our belief in Christ, that it is in sundry
regards a dangerous temptation against it; why should I not much
rather conclude, Seeing we receive not the knowledge of Christ and
Scriptures from the Church of Rome, neither from her must we take
his Doctrine, or the Interpretation of Scripture?</p>
               <p>102 Ad. §. 19. <hi>In this number, this Argument is contained.</hi> The
Iudge of Controversies ought to be intelligible to learned and unlearned;
The Scripture is not so, and the Church is so; Therefore the Church is the
Iudge, and not the Scripture.</p>
               <p>103 To this I answere: As to be understandible is a condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to a Iudge, so is not that alone sufficient to make a Iudge; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you might make your selfe Iudge of Controversies, by arguing;
The Scripture is not intelligible by all, but I am, therefore I am Iudge
of Controversies. If you say your intent was to conclude against the
Scripture, and not for the Church: I demand why then, but to delude
the simple with sophistry, did you say in the close of this §. <hi>Such is
the Church, and the Scripture is not such?</hi> but that you would leave it
to them to inferre in the end, (which indeed was more then you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
in the beginning) <hi>Therefore the Church is Iudge and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
not.</hi> I say Secondly; that you still runne upon a false supposition:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7615:63"/>
that God hath appointed some Iudge of all Controversies that may
happen among Christians, about the sense of obscure Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
whereas he has left every one to his liberty herein, in those
words of S. <hi>Paul, Quis<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> abundet in sensu suo &amp;c.</hi> I say thirdly.
Whereas some Protestants make the Scripture Iudge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
that they have the authority of Fathers of warrant their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of speaking: as of<note n="*" place="margin">Contra Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>Optatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>104 But speaking truly and properly the Scripture is not a Iudge
nor cannot be, but only, a <hi>sufficient Rule,</hi> for those to judge by, that
believe it to be the word of God (as the Church of England and the
Church of Rome both doe,) what they are to believe, and what they
are not to believe. I say sufficiently perfect, and sufficiently intelligible
in things necessary, to all that have understanding, whether they be
learned or unlearned. And my reason hereof is convincing and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative;
because nothing is necessary to be believed, but what is
plainly revealed. For to say, that when a place of Scripture, by reason
of ambiguous termes, lies indifferent between divers senses, whereof
one is true, and the other is false, that God obliges men under pain of
damnation, not to mistake through error and humane frailty, is to
make God a Tyrant, and to say that he requires us certainly to attain
that end, for the attaining whereof we have no certain meanes; which
is to say, that, like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he gives no straw, and requires brick; that
he reapes where he sowes not; that he gathers where he strewes not,
that he will not be pleas'd with our utmost endeavours to please him,
without full and exact and never failing performance; that his will is
we should doe what he knowes we cannot doe; that he will not accept
of us according to that which we have, but requireth of us what we
have not. Which whether it can consist with his goodnes, with his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
&amp; with his word, I leave it to honest men to judge. If I should
send a servant to Paris, or Rome, or lerusalem, and he using his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
diligence not to mistake his way, yet notwithstanding, meeting
often with such places where the road is divided into severall waies,
whereof every one is as likely to be true, and as likely to be false as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, should at length mistake and goe out of the way; would not
any man say that I were an impotent, foolish and unjust master, if I
should be offended with him for doing so? And shall we not tremble
to impute that to God, which we would take in foule scorne, if it were
imputed to our selves? Certainly, I for my part fear I should not loue
God if I should think so strangely of him.</p>
               <p>105 Againe. When you say, <hi>that unlearned, and ignor ant men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand Scripture,</hi> I would desire you to come out of the
clouds, and tell us what you meane: Whether, that they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all Scripture, or that they cannot understand any Scripture,
or that they cannot understand so much as is sufficient for their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Heaven. If the first; I believe the Learned are in the same case.
If the Second; every mans experience will confute you: for who is
there that is not capable of a sufficient understanding of the Story, the
Precepts, the Promises, and the Threats of the Gospell? If the third;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7615:63"/>
that they may understand something, but not enough for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
I aske you, first. Why then doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> say to <hi>Timothy, The
Scriptures are able to make him wise unto Salvation?</hi> Why does Saint
<hi>Austine</hi> say, <hi>Eaquae manifest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> vivendi?</hi> Why does every one of
the four Evangelists intitle their book <hi>The Gospell,</hi> if any necessary
and essentiall part of the Gospell were left out of it? Can we imagine,
that either they omitted something necessary, out of ignorance not
knowing it to be necessary? Or knowing it to be so, malitiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
it? Or out of negligence' did the work they had undertaken by
halfes? If none of these things can without Blasphemy be imputed to
them, considering they were assisted by the Holy Ghost in this work,
then certainly it most evidently followes, that every one of them writ
the whole Gospell of Christ; I mean all the essentiall and necessary
parts of it. So that if we had no other book of Scripture, but one of
them alone, we should not want any thing necessary to Salvation. And
what one of them has more then another, it is only profitable, and not
necessary. Necessary indeed to be believed, because revealed; but not
therefore revealed, because necessary to be believed.</p>
               <p>106 Neither did they write only for the learned, but for all men.
This being one especial meanes of the preaching of the Gospel, which
was commanded to be preached, not only to learned men but <hi>to all
men.</hi> And therefore, unlesse we will imagine the Holy Ghost and them
to have been wilfully wanting to their own desire and purpose, we
must conceive, that they intended to speak plain, even to the capacity
of the simplest; at least touching all things necessary to be published
by them, and believed by us.</p>
               <p>107 <hi>And whereas you pretend it</hi> is so easie, and obvious both for the
learned and the ignorant, both to know which is the Church, and what are
the Decrees of the Church, and what is the sense of those Decrees: <hi>I say,
this is a vaine pretense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>108 For first; How shall an unlearned man whom you haue sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
now ignorant of Scripture, how shall he know which of all the
Societies of Christians is indeed the Church? You will say perhaps,
<hi>he must examine them by the notes of the Church, which are perpetuall
Visibilitie, Succession, Conformitie with the ancient Church. &amp;c.</hi> But
how shall he know, first, that these are the notes of the Church, unlesse
by Scripture, which you say he understands not? You may say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
he may be told so. But seeing men may deceive, and be deceived,
and their words are no demonstrations, how shall he be assured that
what they say is true? So that at the first he meets with an impregnable
difficulty, and cannot know the Church but by such notes, which
whether they be the notes of the Church he cannot possibly know.
But let us suppose this <hi>Isthmus</hi> digged through, and that he is assured
these are the notes of the true Church: How can he possible be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Iudge, which society of Christians hath title to these notes, and
which hath not? Seeing this triall of necessity requires a great suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of knowledge of the monuments of Christian Antiquity, which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7615:64"/>
no unlearned can haue, because he that hath it cannot be unlearned.
As for example, how shall he possibly be able to know whether the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had a perpetuall Succession of Visible Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
which held alwayes the same Doctrine which they now hold,
without holding any thing to the contrary; unlesse he hath first exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
what was the Doctrine of the Church in the first age, what in the
second, and so forth? And whether this be not a more difficult work,
then to stay at the first Age, and to examine the Church by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of her Doctrine, with the Doctrine of the first age, every man
of ordinary understanding may judge.</p>
               <p>108 Let us imagine him advanc'd a step farther, and to know
which is the Church: how shall he know what that Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
seeing the Church hath not been so carefull in keeping of her
decrees, but that many are lost, and many corrupted? Besides, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Learned among you are not agreed concerning divers things,
whether they be <hi>De Fide</hi> or not; how shall the unlearned doe? Then
for the sense of the Decrees, how can he be more capable of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of them, then of plain Texts of Scripture, which you will
not suffer him to understand? Especially, seeing the Decrees of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Popes and Councells are conceived so obscurely, that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
cannot agree about the sense of them. And then they are written all
in such languages which the ignorant understand not, and therefore
must of necessity rely herein upon the uncertain and fallible authority
of some particular men, who informe them that there is such a Decree.
And if the Decrees were translated into Vulgar languages, why the
Translators should not be as fallible as you say the Translators of
Scripture are, who can possibly imagine?</p>
               <p>109 Lastly, how shall an unlearned man, or indeed any man, be
assured of the certainty of that Decree, the certainty whereof depends
upon suppositions which are impossible to be known whether they be
true or no? For it is not the Decree of a Councell, unlesse it be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by a true Pope. Now the Pope cannot be a true Pope if he came in
by Simony: which whether he did or no, who can answer mee? He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be true Pope unlesse he were baptized, and baptized he was not,
unlesse the Minister had due Intention. So likewise he cannot be a true
Pope, unlesse he were rightly ordained Priest, and that again depends
upon the Ordainers secret Intention, and also upon his having the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall
Character. All which things, as I have formerly proved,
depend upon so many uncertain suppositions, that no humane judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can possibly be resolved in them. I conclude therefore, that not
the learnedst man amongst you all, no not the Pope himselfe, can, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the grounds you goe upon, have any certainty, that any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of any Councell is good and valid, and consequently, not any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that it is indeed the Decree of a Councell.</p>
               <p>110 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 20. If by a <hi>private spirit,</hi> you mean, a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
that a Doctrine is true, which some men pretend, but cannot
prove to come from the spirit of God: I say to referre Controversies
to Scripture, is not to referre them to this kind of private Spirit. For
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7615:64"/>
is there not a manifest difference between saying, <hi>the spirit of God tels
me that this is the meaning of such a Text</hi> (which no man can possibly
know to be true, it being a secret thing) &amp; between saying, <hi>these &amp; these
Reasons I have to shew, that this or that is true doctrine, or that this or
that is the meaning of such a Scripture?</hi> Reason being a Publique and
certain thing and exposed to all mens tryall and examination. But now
if by <hi>privat spirit</hi> you understand every mans particular Reason, then
your first and second inconvenience will presently be reduced to one,
and shortly to none at all.</p>
               <p>111 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 20. And does not also giving the office of Iudicature to
the Church, come to conferre it upon every particular man? For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any man believes the Church infallible, must he not have reason
to induce him to believe it to be so? and must he not judge of those
reasons, whether they be indeed good and firme, or captious and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall?
Or would you have all men believe all your Doctrine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Churches infalli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>y, and the Churches infallibility they
know not why?</p>
               <p>112 Secondly, supposing they are to be guided by the Church,
they must use their own particular reason to find out which is the
Church. And to that purpose you your selves give a great many notes,
which you pretend first to be Certain notes of the Church, and then
to be peculiar to your Church, and agreeable to none else; but you doe
not so much as pretend, that either of those pretenses is evident of it
selfe, and therefore you goe about to prove them both by reasons; and
those reasons I hope every particular man is to judge of, whether they
doe indeed conclude and convince that which they are alleadged for:
that is, that these markes are indeed certain notes of the Church, and
then that your Church hath them, and no other.</p>
               <p>113 One of these notes, indeed the only note of a true and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Church, is conformity with Antiquity; I mean the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church of all, that is the Primitive and Apostolique. Now how
is it possible any man should examine your Church by this note, but
he must by his own particular judgement, find out what was the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Primitive Church, and what is the Doctrine of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church, and be able to answer all these Arguments which are
brought to prove repugnance between them? otherwise he shall but
pretend to make use of this note for the finding the true Church, but
indeed make no use of it, but receive the Church at a venture, as the
most of you doe; not one in a hundred being able to give any tolerable
reason for it. So that in stead of reducing men to particular reason,
you reduce them to none at all, but to chance and passion, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
and such other waies, which if they lead one to the truth, they
lead hundreds, nay thousands to falshood. But it is a pretty thing to
consider, how these men can blow hot and cold out of the same mouth
to serve severall purposes. Is there hope of gaining a Proselite? Then
they will tell you, God hath given every man Reason to follow; and if
the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the Ditch. That it is no
good reason for a mans religion, that he was borne and brought up in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7615:65"/>
it: For then a Turke should have as much reason to be a Turke; as a
Christian to be a Christian. That every man hath a judgement of
Discretion; which if they will make use of they shall easily finde:
that the true Church hath alwaies such and such markes, and that
their Church has them, and no other but theirs. But then if any of
theirs be perswaded to a syncere and sufficient tryall of their Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
even by their own notes of it, and to try whether they be indeed so
conformable to Antiquity as they pretend, then their note is changed:
you must not use your own reason nor your judgement, but referre
all to the Church, and believe her to be conformable to Antiquity,
though they have no reason for it, nay though they have evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to the contrary. For my part, I am certain that God hath given
us our Reason to discern between Truth and Falshood, and he that
makes not this use of it, but beleeves things he knowes not why, I say
it is by chance that he believes the Truth, and not by choice: and that
I cannot but feare, that God will not accept of this <hi>Sacrifice of fooles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>114 But you that would not have men follow their reason, what
would you have them to follow? their Passion? Or pluck out their eyes
and goe blindfold? <hi>No,</hi> you say <hi>you would have them follow Authority.</hi>
On gods name let them; we also would have them follow Authority;
for it is upon the Authority of Vniversall Tradition, that we would
have them believe Scripture. But then as for the Authority which
you would have them follow, you will let them see reason why they
should follow it. And is not this to goe a little about? to leave reason
for a short turne, and then to come to it again, and to doe that which
you condemne in others? It being indeed a plain impossibility for any
man to submit his reason but to reason: for he that does it to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
must of necessity think himselfe to have greater reason to believe
that Authority. Therefore the confession cited by <hi>Brerely,</hi> you need
not think to have been extorted from <hi>Luther</hi> and the rest. It came very
freely from them, and what they say you practise as much as they.</p>
               <p>115 And whereas you say that a <hi>Protestant admits of Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
Church, as farre as they agree with Scripture, which upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is himselfe:</hi> I say you admit neither of them, nor the Scripture it
selfe, but only so farre as it agrees with your Church: and your
Church you admit because you think you have reason to doe so: so
that by you as well as by Protestants all is finally resolved into your
own reason.</p>
               <p>116 Nor doe Heretiques only but Romish Catholiques also set
up as many judges, as there are men and women in the Christian
world. For doe not your men and women judge your Religion to be
true, before they believe it, as well as the men and women of other
Religions? Oh but you say, <hi>They receive it not because they think it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Scripture, but because the Church tells them so.</hi> But then I
hope they believe the Church because their own reason tells them
they are to doe so. So that the difference between a Papist and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
is this, not that the one judges and the other does not judge, but
that the one judges his guide to be infallible, the other his way to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7615:65"/>
manifest. <hi>This same pernitious Doctrine is taught by Brentius, Zanchius,
Cartwright, and others.</hi> It is so in very deed: But it is taught also by
some others, whom you little think of. It is taught by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he
saies, <hi>Try all things, hold fast that which is good.</hi> It is taught by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
in these words, <hi>Belieue not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they
be of God or no.</hi> It is taught by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in these, <hi>Bee yee ready to render a
reason of the hope that is in you.</hi> Lastly, this very pernitious Doctrine is
taught by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in these words, <hi>If the blinde lead the blind, both
shall fall into the ditch.</hi> And <hi>why of your selues iudge you not what is
right?</hi> All which speeches, if they doe not advise men to make use of
their Reason for the choice of their Religion, I must confesse my selfe
to understand nothing. Lastly, not to bee infinite, it is taught by M.
<hi>Knot</hi> himselfe, not in one page only, or chapter of his <hi>Book,</hi> but all his
Book over, the very writing and publishing whereof, supposeth this
for certaine, that the readers are to be Iudges, whether his Reasons
which he brings, be strong and convincing; of which sort wee haue he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
met with none: or else captious, or impertinences, as indifferent
men shall (as I suppose) haue cause to judge them.</p>
               <p>117 But you demand, <hi>What good Statesmen would they be, who
should ideate, or fancy such a Commonwealth, as these men haue framed to
themselues a Church?</hi> Truly if this be all the fault they haue, that they
say, <hi>Every man is to use his own iudgement in the choice of his Religion,
and not to belieue this or that sense of Scripture, upon the bare Authority
of any Learned man or men, when he conceiues he has reasons to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
which are of more weight then their Authority:</hi> I know no reason
but, notwithstanding all this, they might be as good Statesmen as any
of the Society. But what has this to doe with Common-wealths,
where men are bound only to externall obedience, unto the Laws and
judgements of Courts, but not to an internall approbation of them, no
nor to conceale their Iudgment of them, if they disapprove them? As
if I conceiued I had reason to mislike the law of punishing simple
theft with death, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> did, I might professe lawfully
my judgement, and represent my Reasons to the King or Common-wealth
in a Parliament, as S<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> did, without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any fault, or fearing any punishment.</p>
               <p>118 To the place of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> wherewith this Paragraph is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
I shall need giue no other Reply, but onely to desire you to
speak like an honest man, and to say, whether it be all one for a man, <hi>to
allow and disallow in every Scripture what he pleases,</hi> which is, either to
dash out of Scripture such Texts or such Chapters, because they crosse
his opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or to say (which is worse,) <hi>Though they be Scripture they
are not true?</hi> Whether I say for a man thus to allow and disallow in
Scripture what he pleases, be all one, and no greater fault, then to allow
that sense of Scripture which he conceiues to be true and genuine, and
deduc'd out of the words, and to disallow the contrary? For Gods
sake, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, tell me plainly; In those Texts of Scripture, which you alleage
for the infallibility of your Church, doe not you allow what sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
you think true, and disallow the contrary? And doe you not this by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7615:66"/>
the direction of your private reason? If you doe, why doe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it in others? If you doe not, I pray you tell me what direction
you follow? or whether you follow none at all? If none at all, this is
like drawing Lots, or throwing the Dice for the choice of a Religion.
If any other: I beseech you tell me what it is. Perhaps you will say,
<hi>the Churches Authority;</hi> and that will be to dance finely in a round,
thus, To belieue the Churches Infallible Authority, because the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
avouch it; &amp; to belieue that Scriptures say and mean so, because
they are so expounded by the Church. Is not this for a Father to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his Sonne, and the Sonne to beget his Father? For a foundation to
support the house, and the house to support the foundation? Would
not <hi>Campian</hi> haue cryed out at it, <hi>Ecce quos gyros, quos Maeandros?</hi> And
to what end was this going about, when you might as well at first
haue concluded the Church infallible because she saies so; as thus to
put in Scripture for a meere stale, and to say, the Church is infallible
because the Scripture saies so, and the Scripture meanes so because the
Church saies so, which is infallible? Is it not most evident therefore
to every intelligent man, that you are enforced of necessity to doe that
your selfe, which so tragically you declaime against in others? The
Church, you say, is infallible; I am very doubtfull of it: How shall I
know it? The Scripture you say affirmes it, as in the 59. of <hi>Esay, My
spirit that is in thee, &amp;c.</hi> Well I confesse I finde there these words: but
I am still doubtfull, whether they be spoken of the Church of Christ:
&amp; if they be, whether they mean as you pretend. You say, the Church
saies so, which is infallible. Yea but that is the Question, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be begg'd but proved. Neither is it so evident as to need
no proofe: otherwise why brought you this Text to proue it? Nor is
it of such a strange quality, aboue all other Propositions, as to bee able
to proue it selfe. What then remaines but that you say, Reasons
drawn out of the Circumstances of the Text, will evince that this is
the sense of it. Perhaps they will. But Reasons cannot convince mee,
unlesse I judge of them by my Reason; and for every man or woman
to relye on that, in the choice of their Religion, and in the interpreting
of Scripture, you say is a horrible absurditie; and therefore must nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make use of your own in this matter, nor desire mee to make use
of it.</p>
               <p>119 But <hi>Vniversall Tradition</hi> (you say, and so doe I too,) <hi>is of it
selfe credible: and that has in all ages taught the Churches infallibility
with full consent.</hi> If it haue, I am ready to belieue it. But that it has I
hope you would not haue me take upon your word: for that were to
build my selfe upon the Church, and the Church upon You. Let then
the Tradition appeare; for a secret Tradition is somewhat like a silent
Thunder. You will perhaps produce, for the confirmation of it, some
sayings of some Fathers, who in every Age taught this Doctrine; (as
<hi>Gualterius</hi> in his Chronologie undertakes to doe, but with so ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
that I heard an able Man of your Religion professe, that <hi>in the
first three Centuries, there was not one Authority pertinent:</hi>) but how
will you warrant that none of them teach the contrary? Again, how
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7615:66"/>
shall I be assured that the places haue indeed this sense in them? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is not one Father for 500. yeares after Christ, that does say
in plain termes, <hi>The Church of Rome is infallible.</hi> What, shall wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
your Church that this is their meaning? But this will be again to
goe into the Circle, which made us giddy before; To proue the
Church Infallible because Tradition saies so, Tradition to say so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Fathers say so, The Fathers to say so, because the Church
saies so, which is infallible. Yea, <hi>but reason will shew this to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them.</hi> Yes, if we may use our Reason, and rely upon it. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as light shewes nothing to the blinde, or to him that uses not his
eyes; so reason cannot proue any thing to him that either has not, or
uses not his reason to judge of them.</p>
               <p>120 Thus you haue excluded your selfe from all proofe of your
Churches infallibility from Scripture or Tradition. And if you flye
lastly to Reason it selfe for succour, may not it justly say to you, as
<hi>Iephte</hi> said to his Brethren, <hi>Yee haue cast me out and banished me, and doe
you now come to me for succour?</hi> But if there be no certainty in Reason,
how shall I be assured of the certainty of those which you alleage for
this purpose? Either I may judge of them, or not: if not, why doe you
propose them? If I may, why doe you say I may not, and make it such
a monstrous absurdity, That men in the choyce of their Religion
should make use of their Reason? which yet, without all question,
none but unreasonable men can deny, to haue been the chiefest ende
why Reason was given them.</p>
               <p>122 <hi>Ad</hi> § 22. <hi>An Heretique he is</hi> (saith D. Potter) <hi>who opposeth
any truth, which to be a divine revelation he is convinced in conscience
by any meanes whatsoever: Be it by a Preacher or Lay-man, be it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Scripture, or hearing them read.</hi> And from hence you infer, that
<hi>he makes all these safe propounders of Faith.</hi> A most strange and illogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
deduction! For may not a private man by evident reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
another man, that such or such a Doctrine is divine revelation,
and yet though he be a true propounder in this point, yet propound
another thing falsely, and without proofe, and consequently not be a
safe propounder in every point? Your Preachers in their Sermons, do
they not propose to men divine Revelations, and doe they not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
convince men in conscience, by evident proofe from Scripture,
that the things they speak are Divine revelations? And whosoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus convinc'd, should oppose this Divine revelation, should hee
not be an Heretique, according to your own grounds, for calling
Gods own Truth into question? And would you think your selfe well
dealt with, if I should collect from hence, that you make every Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
a safe, that is, an infallible Propounder of Faith? Be the meanes
of Proposall what it will, sufficient or insufficient, worthy of credit, or
not worthy, though it were, if it were possible, the barking of a Dog, or
the chirping of a Bird, or were it the discourse of the Divell himselfe,
yet if I be, I will not say convinc'd, but persuaded, though falsly, that
it is a Divine revelation, and shall deny to belieue it, I shall be a formall,
though not a materiall Heretique. For he that believes, though falsly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7615:67"/>
any thing to be Divine revelation, &amp; yet will not believe it to be true,
must of necessity believe God to be false, which according to your
own Doctrine, is the formality of an Heretique.</p>
               <p>123 And how it can be any way advantagious to Civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that men without warrant from God should usurpe a tyranny
over other mens consciences, and prescribe unto them without reason,
and sometimes against reason, what they shall believe, you must shew
us plainer if you desire we should believe. For to say, <hi>Verily I doe not
see but that it must be so,</hi> is no good demonstration. For whereas you
say, <hi>that a man may be a passionate &amp; seditious creature,</hi> from whence you
would have us inferre, that he may make use of his interpretation to
satisfie his passion, and raise sedition: There were some colour in this
consequence, if we (as you doe) made private men infallible interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for others; for then indeed they might lead Disciples after them,
and use them as instruments for their vile purposes: But when we say
they can only interpret for themselves, what harme they can doe by
their passionate or seditious interpretations, but only endanger both
their temporall and eternall happinesse, I cannot imagine. For though
we deny the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be an infallible Iudge, yet
we doe not deny, but that there are Iudges which may proceed with
certainty enough against all seditious Persons, such as draw men to
disobedience either against Church or State, as well as against Rebells,
and Traytors, and Theeves, and Murderers.</p>
               <p>124 <hi>Ad</hi> § 23. The next § in the begining argues thus: <hi>For many
ages there was no Scripture in the World: and for many more, there was
none in many places of the world: yet men wanted not then and then some
certain direction what to believe: Therefore there was then an infallible
Iudge.</hi> Iust as if I should say, <hi>Yorke</hi> is not my way from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
therefore <hi>Bristol</hi> is: Or a dogge is not a horse, therefore he is a
man. As if God had no other waies of revealing himselfe to men,
but only by Scripture and an infallible Church. S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidorus
Pelusiota</hi> conceaved he might use other meanes. And S. <hi>Paul</hi>
telleth us that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>might be known by his workes;</hi> and that
<hi>they had the Law written in their hearts.</hi> Either of these waies might
make some faithfull men without either necessity of Scripture or
Church.</p>
               <p>125 <hi>But D. Potter saies,</hi> you say, <hi>In the Iewish Church there was
a living Iudge, indowed with an absolute infallible direction in cases of
moment: as all points belonging to divine Faith are.</hi> And where was
that infallible direction in the Iewish Church when they should have
received Christ for their Messias, and refused him? Or perhaps this
was not a case of moment. D. <hi>Potter</hi> indeed might say very well, not
that the high Priest was infallible, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or certainly he was not) but that
his determination was to be of necessity obeyed, though for the justice
of it there was no necessity that it should be believed. Besides, it is one
thing to say, that the living judge in the Iewish Church, had an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
direction: another, that he was necessitated to follow this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
This is the priviledge which you challenge. But it is that, not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7615:67"/>
this, which the Doctor attributes to the Iewes. As a man may truely
say, the wise men had an infallible direction to Christ, without saying
or thinking that they were constrained to follow it, and could not do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
otherwise.</p>
               <p>126 <hi>But either the Church retaines still her infallibility, or it was
devested of it upon the receiving of Holy Scripture; which is absurd.</hi> An
argument me thinkes like this, Either you have hornes or you have
lost them: but you never lost them, therefore you have them still. If
you say you never had hornes; so say I, for ought appeares by your
reasons, the Church never had infallibility.</p>
               <p>127 <hi>But some Scriptures were received in some places and not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
therefore if Scriptures were the Iudge of Controversies, some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
had one Iudge and some another.</hi> And what great inconvenience is
there in that, that one part of <hi>England</hi> should have one Iudge, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
another? especially seeing the bookes of Scripture which
were received by those that received fewest, had as much of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christianity in them, as they all had which were received by
any; all the necessary parts of the Gospell being contained in every
one of the four Gospells, as I have prov'd: So that they which had all
the bookes of the New Testament had nothing superfluous: For it
was not superfluous but profitable, that the same thing should be said
divers times, and be testified by divers witnesses: And they that had
but one of the four Gospells wanted nothing necessary: and therefore
it is vainly infer'd by you, that <hi>with months and yeares, as new Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Scriptures grew to be published, the Church altered her rule of Faith
and judge of Controversies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>128 <hi>Heresies</hi> you say, <hi>would arise after the Apostles time and after
the writing of Scriptures: These cannot be discovered, condemned &amp; avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
unlesse the Church be infallible; Therefore there must be a Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi>
But I pray tell me, Why cannot Heresies be sufficiently discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
condemned, &amp; avoided, by them which believe Scripture to be the
rule of Faith? If Scripture be sufficient to Informe us what is the faith,
it must of necessity be also sufficient to teach us what is Heresy: seeing
Heresy is nothing but a manifest deviation from, and an opposition to
the faith. That which is streight will plainly teach us what is croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
and one contrary cannot but manifest the other. If any one should
deny, that there is a God: That this God is omnipotent, omniscient,
good, just, true, mercifull, a rewarder of them that seek him, a puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher
of them that obstinatly offend him; that Iesus Christ is the Sonne
of God, and the Saviour of the World: that it is he by obedience to
whom men must look to be saved: If any man should deny either his
Birth, or Passion, or Resurrection, or Assention, or sitting at the right
hand of God: his having all power given him in Heaven and Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That it is he whom God hath appointed to be judge of the quick and
the dead: that all men shall rise again at the last day: That they which
believe and repent shall be sav'd: That they which doe not believe or
repent shall be damned: If a man should hold, that either the keeping
of the <hi>Mosaicall</hi> Law is necessary to Salvation: or that good works are
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7615:68"/>
not necessary to Salvation: In a word, if any man should obstinatly
contradict the truth of any thing plainly delivered in Scripture, who
does not see, that every one which believes the Scripture, hath a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
meanes to discover, and condemne, and avoid that Heresy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any need of an infallible guide? If you say, that <hi>the obscure places of
Scripture contain matters of Faith:</hi> I answere, that it is a matter of faith
to believe that the sense of them, whatsoever it is, which was intended
by God is true; for he that does not doe so calls Gods Truth into
question. But to believe this or that to be the true sense of them, or, to
believe the true sense of them, and to avoid the false, is not necessary
either to Faith or Salvation. For if God would have had his meaning
in these places certainly known, how could it stand with his wisdome,
to be so wanting to his own will and end, as to speak obscurely? or
how can it consist with his justice, to require of men to know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the meaning of those words, which he himselfe hath not revealed?
Suppose there were an absolute Monarch, that in his own absence
from one of his Kingdomes, had written Lawes for the government
of it, some very plainly, and some very ambiguously, and obscurely,
and his Subjects should keep those that were plainly written with all
exactnesse, and for those that were obscure, use their best diligence to
find his meaning in them, and obey them according to the sense of
them which they conceived; should this King either with justice or
wisdome be offended with these Subjects, if by reason of the obscurity

               <p>128 But, <hi>It is more usefull &amp; fit,</hi> you say, <hi>for the deciding of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
to haue besides an infallible rule to goe by, a living infallible Iudge
to determine them: &amp; from hence</hi> you <hi>conclude, that certainly there is such
a Iudge.</hi> But why then may not another say, that it is yet more usefull
for many excellent purposes, that all the Patriarchs should bee infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then that the Pope only should? Another, that it would bee yet
more usefull, that all the Archbishops of every Province should be so,
then that the Patriarchs only should be so. Another, That it would be
yet more usefull, if all the Bishops of every Diocesse were so. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it would be yet more available, that all the Parsons of every
Parish should be so. Another, that it would be yet more excellent, if
all the Fathers of Families were so. And lastly, another, that it were
much more to be desired that every Man and every Woman were so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
just as much as the prevention of Controversies, is better then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of them, and the prevention of Heresies better then the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of them; and upon this ground conclude, by your own very
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence, That not only a generall Councell, nor only the Pope, but
all the Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Pastors, Fathers, nay all the
men in the World are infallible. If you say now, as I am sure you will,
that this conclusion is most grosse, and absurd against sense and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
then must also the ground be false, from which it evidently and

in humane reason it were incomparably more fit and usefull for
the decision of Controversies, then that the successour of the Apostles
should haue none of these gifts, and for want of the signes of Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
be justly questionable whether he be his successour or no: and
will you now conclude, That the Popes haue the gift of doing Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
as well as the Apostles had?</p>
               <p>130 It were in all reason very usefull and requisite, that the Pope
should, by the assistance of Gods Spirit, be freed from the vices &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of men, lest otherwise, the Authority given him for the good of
the Church, he might imploy (as divers Popes you well know haue

for the Church, that Infallibility should be setled in the Popes
Person, then in a generall Councell: That so the meanes of deciding
Controversies might be speedy, easy and perpetuall, whereas that of
generall Councells is not so. And will you hence inferre, that not the
Church Representative, but the Pope is indeed the infallible Iudge of
Controversies? certainly if you should, the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors would
not think this a good conclusion.</p>
               <p>132 It had been very commodious (one would think) that, seeing
either Gods pleasure was the Scripture should be translated, or else in
his Providence he knew it would be so, that he had appointed some
men for this businesse, and by his Spirit assisted them in it, that so we
might have Translations as Authenticall as the Originall: yet you see
God did not think fit to doe so.</p>
               <p>133 It had been very commodious (one would think) that the
Scripture should have been, at least for all things necessary, a Rule,
plain and perfect: And yet you say, it is both imperfect and obscure, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in things necessary.</p>
               <p>134 It had been most requisite (one would think) that the Copies
of the Bibles, should have been preserved free from variety of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which makes men very uncertain in many places, which is the
word of God, and which is the errour or presumption of man: and yet
we see God hath not thought fit so to provide for us.</p>
               <p>135 Who can conceive, but that an Apostolike Interpretation of
all the difficult places of Scripture, would have been stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gely benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to the Church, especially there being such danger in mistaking the
sense of them, as is by you pretended, and God in his providence fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
that the greatest part of Christians, would not accept of the
Pope for the Iudge of Controversies? And yet we see God hath not
so ordered the matter.</p>

                  </gap>dge of Controversies, that
it would have been infinitely beneficiall to the Church, perhaps as
much as all the rest of the Bible, that in some Book of Scripture which
was to be undoubtedly received, this one Proposition had been set
down in Termes, <hi>The Bishops of Rome shall be alwaies Monarchs of the
Church, &amp; they either alone, or with their adherents, the Guides of faith,
and the Iudges of Controversies that shall arise amongst Christians?</hi> This,
if you will deal ingenuously, you cannot but acknowledge; for then all
true Christians would have submitted to him, as willingly as to Christ
himselfe, neither needed you and your fellowes, have troubled your
selfe to invent so many Sophismes for the proofe of it. There would
have been no more doubt of it among Christians, then there is of the
Nativity, Passion, Resurrection or Ascention of Christ. You were
best now rubbe your forehead hard, and conclude upon us, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this would have been so usefull to have been done, therefore it
is done. Or if you be (as I know you are) too ingenuous to say so, then
must you acknowledge, that the ground of your Argument, which is
the very ground of all these absurdities, is most absurd; and that it is
our duty to be humbly thankfull for those sufficient, nay abundant
meanes of Salvation, which God hath of his own goonesse granted us:
and not conclude, he hath done that which he hath not done, because
forsooth, in our vain judgements it seemes convenient he should have
done so.</p>
               <p>137 But you demand <hi>what repugnance there is betwixt infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Church, and existence of Scripture, that the production of the
one must be the destruction of the other?</hi> Out of which words I can frame
no other argument for you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this. <hi>There is no Repugnance between the
Scriptures existence, and the Churches infallibility, therefore the Church
is infallible.</hi> Which consequence will then be good, when you can
shew, that nothing can be untrue, but that only which is impossible;
that whatsoever may be done, that also is done. Which, if it were true,
would conclude both you and me to be infallible, as well as either
your Church, or Pope: in as much as there is no more repugnance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Scriptures existence and our infallibility, then there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theirs.</p>
               <p>138 <hi>But if Protestants will have the Scripture alone for their Iudge,
let them first produce some Scripture, affirming, that by the entring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
infallibility went out of the Church.</hi> This Argument put in forme
runs thus. No Scripture affirmes that by the entring thereof, infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
went out of the Church: Therefore there is an infallible Church,
&amp; therefore the Scripture alone is not Iudge, that is, the Rule to judge
by. But as no Scripture affirmes that by the entring of it, Infallibility
went out of the Church, so neither doe we, neither have we any need
to doe so. But we say, that it continued in the Church even together
with the Scriptures, so long as Christ &amp; his Apostles were living, and
then departed: God in his providence having provided a plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Rule, to supply the defect of liuing and infallible Guides. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7615:69"/>
if your cause were good, so great a wit as yours is, would devise
better Arguments to maintain it. We can shew no Scripture affirming
Infallibility to haue gone out of the Church, therefore it is Infallible.
Somewhat like his discourse that said, It could not bee prov'd out of
Scripture, that the <hi>King of Sweden</hi> was dead, therefore hee is still li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
Me thinks in all reason, you that challenge privileges, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
from the condition of Men, which is to be subject to errour; You
that by vertue of this privilege usurp authority over mens conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
should produce your Letters-patents from the King of Heaven, &amp;
shew some expresse warrant for this Authority you take upon you,
otherwise you know the rule is, <hi>Vbicontrarium non manifestè probatur

               </p>
               <p>139 <hi>But</hi> D. Potter <hi>may remember what himselfe teacheth, That the
Church is still endued with Infallibility in points Fundamentall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that Infallibility in the Church doth well agree with the Truth,
the Sanctitie, yea with the sufficiency of Scripture, for all matters necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to salvation.</hi> Still your discourse is so far from hitting the white,
that it roves quite besides the But. You conclude that the infallibility
of the Church may well agree with the Truth, the Sanctity, the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of Scripture. But what is this but to abuse your Reader with
the proofe of that which no man denies? The Question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an infallible Church might agree with Scripture, but whether,
there be an Infallible Church? <hi>Iam dic Posthume de tribus Capellis.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
you must know there is a wide difference between, <hi>being infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in Fundamentals,</hi> and being an <hi>infallible Guide even in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
D. Potter</hi> saies, that the Church is the former: that is, There
shall be some men in the world, while the world lasts, which erre not
in Fundamentals; for otherwise there should be no Church: For to
say, the Church, while it is the Church, may erre in Fundamentalls,
implies contradiction, and is all one as to say, The Church: while it is
the Church, may not be the Church. So that to say, that the Church
is infallible in Fundamentalls, signifies no more but this, There shall
be a Church in the world for ever. But wee utterly deny the Church
to be the latter; for to say so, were to oblige our selves to finde some
certain Society of men, of whom we might be certain, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe, nor can erre in Fundamentals, nor in declaring what is Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
what is not Fundamentall: and consequently to make any
Church an infallible Guide in Fundamentals, would be to make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in all things, which she proposes and requires to be believed.
This therefore we deny both to your and all other Churches of any
one denomination, as the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Abyssine:</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
we deny it simply to any Church. For no Church can possibly
be fit to be a Guide, but only a Church of some certain denominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For otherwise no man can possibly know which is the true Church,
but by a pre-examination of the doctrine controverted, and that were
not to be guided by the Church to the true doctrine, but by the true
doctrine to the Church. Hereafter therefore, when you heare Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
say, The Church is Infallible in Fundamentalls, you must not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7615:70"/>
conceiue them, as if they meant as you doe, that some Society of
Christians, which may be known by adhering to some one Head, for
example, the Pope, or the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> is infallible in
these things: but only thus, That true Religion shall never be so farre
driven out of the world, but that it shall alwaies haue some where or
other, some that believe and professe it, in all things necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>140 But, <hi>you would therefore gladly know out of what Text he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
that the Church, by the comming of Scripture, was deprived of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
in some points, and not in others?</hi> And I also would gladly know,
why you doe thus frame to your self vaine imaginations, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> father
them upon others? We yeeld unto you, That there shall be a Church
which never erreth in some points because (as wee conceive,) God
hath promised so much; but not, there shall be such a Church which
doth or can erre in no points, because we finde not that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
such a Church; and therefore wee may not promise such a one
to our selves. But for the Churches being deprived by the Scripture
of Infallibility, in some points and not in others, that is a wild notion
of your own, which we haue nothing to doe with.</p>
               <p>141 But he affirmeth, that <hi>the Iewish Church retained Infallibility
in her selfe; and therefore it is unjustly, and unworthily done of him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
the Church of Christ of it.</hi> That the Iewes had sometimes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
miraculous direction from God, in some cases of moment, hee
doth affirme and had good warrant: but that the Synagogue was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
Infallible, he no where affirmes, and therefore it is unjustly &amp;
unworthily done of you to obtrude it upon him. And indeed how can
the Infallibility of the Synagogue be conceived, but only by setling it
in the High Priest, and the company adhering and subordinate unto
him? And whether the high Priest was Infallible, when he believed
not Christ to be the Messias, but condemn'd and excommunicated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that so professed, and caused him to be crucified for saying so, I leaue it
to Christians to judge. But then suppose God had been so pleased to
doe as he did not, to appoint the Synagogue an infallible guide: Could
you by your rules of Logick constrain him, to appoint such a one to
Christians also, or say unto him, that, in wisdome he could not doe
otherwise? Vaine man that will be thus alwaies tying God to your
imaginations! It is well for us that he leaves us not without directions
to him, but if he will doe this sometime by living Guides, sometime
by written rules, what is that to you? may not he doe what he will with
his own?</p>
               <p>142 <hi>And whereas you say for the further enforcing of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that there is greater reason to think the Church should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
then the Synagogue: because to the Synagogue all Laws and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
&amp;c. were more particularly, and minutely delivered, then in the
new Testament is done, our Saviour leaving particulars to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Church.</hi> But I pray walk not thus in generality, but tell us
what <hi>particulars?</hi> If you mean particular rites, &amp; ceremonies, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for goverment, we grant it, and you know we doe so. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7615:70"/>
our only hath left a generall injunction by S. <hi>Paul, Let All things bee
done decently and in Order.</hi> But what Order is fittest, i. e. what Time,
what Place, what Manner, &amp;c. is fittest, that he hath left to the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Governers of the Church. But if you mean, that hee hath
only concerning maters of faith, the subject in Question, prescribed in
generall, that we are to heare the Church, and left it to the Church
to determine what particulars we are to belieue: The Church being
nothing else but an aggregation of Believers, this in effect is to say, He
hath left it to all Believers to determine what Particulars they are to
believe. Besides it is so apparently false, that I wonder you could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
your selfe, or think we should be contented with a bare saying,
without any shew or pretence of proofe.</p>
               <p>143 As for D. <hi>Potters</hi> objection against this Argument, <hi>That as
well you might inferre, that Christians must haue all one King, because
the Iewes had so,</hi> For ought I can perceive, notwithstanding any thing
answered by you, it may stand still in force, though the truth is, it
is urg'd by him not against the Infallibility but the Monarchy of the
Church. For whereas you say, the disparity is very cleare: Hee that
should urge this argument for one Monarch over the whole world,
would say that this is to deny the Conclusion, and reply unto you, that
there is disparity, as matters are now order'd, but that there should not
be so. For that there was no more reason to believe that the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
government of the Iews was a Pattern for the Ecclesiasticall
government of Christians, then the Civill of the Iewes, for the Civill
of the Christians. He would tell you, that the Church of Christ, and
all Christian Commonwealths, and Kingdomes, are one and the same
thing: and therefore he sees no reason why the Synagogue should be
a Type and Figure of the Church, and not of the Commonwealth.
He would tell you, that as the Church succeeded the Iewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
so Christian Princes should succeed to Iewish Magistrates:
that is the Temporal Governours of the Church should be Christians.
He would tell you, that as the Church is compar'd to a house, a
Kingdome, an Army, a Body, so all distinct Kingdomes might and
should be one Armie, one Familie, &amp;c. and that it is not so, is the thing
he complaines of. And therefore you ought not to think it enough to
say it is not so, but you should shew why it should not be so; and why
this argument will not follow, The Iewes had one King, therefore
all Christians ought to haue: as well as this, The Iewes had one High
Priest over them all, therefore all Christians also ought to haue. Hee
might tell you moreover, that the Church may haue one Master, one
Generall, one Head, one King, and yet he not be the Pope, but Christ.
He might tell you, that you beg the Question, in saying without proof,
that it is necessary to salvation, that all (whether Christians or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
have recourse to one Church, if you mean by one Church, one
particular Church, which is to govern and direct all others: and that
unlesse you mean so, you say nothing to the purpose. And besides, he
might tell you, and that very truly, that it may seeme altogether as
available for the Temporall good of Christians to be under one Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7615:71"/>
Prince, or Comonwealth, as for their salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be subordinate
to one Visible Head. I say as necessary, both for the prevention of the
effusion of the Blood of Christians by Christians, &amp; for the defence of
Christendome, from the hostile invasions of Turks, &amp; Pagans. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
al this he might infer, that though now, by the fault of men, there were
in severall Kingdomes, severall Lawes, Governments and Powers; yet
that it were much more expedient, that there were but one. Nay, not
only expedient, but necessary; if once your ground be setled for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
rule, that what kinde of government the Iewes had, that the
Christians must haue. And if you limit the generality of this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and frame the Argument thus: What kinde of Ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
the Iews had, that the Christians must haue, But They were
governed by one High Priest, therefore These must be so: He will say
that the first proposition of this syllogisme, is altogether as doubtfull
as the conclusion; and therefore neither fit nor sufficient to prove it,
untill it selfe be proved. And then besides, that there is as great reason
to believe this, That what kinde of Civill government the Iews had,
that the Christians must haue. And so D. <hi>Potters</hi> objection remaines
still unanswered: That there is as much reason to conclude a necessity
of one King over all Christian Kingdomes, from the Iews having one
King; as one Bishop over all Churches, from their being under our
High Priest.</p>
               <p>144 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 24.<note place="margin">Irenaeus l. 3. c. 3.</note> Neither is this Discourse confirm'd by <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
at all. Whether by this discourse you mean that immediatly forgoing,
of the analogy between the Church and the Synagogue, to which
this speech of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> alleadged here by you, is utterly and plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent;
Or whether by this discourse, you mean (as I think you
doe) not your discourse, but your conclusion which you discourse on,
that is, that <hi>Your Church is the infallible Iudge in Controversies.</hi> For
neither has <hi>Irenaeus</hi> one syllable to this purpose; neither can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of what he saies, with any colour of consequence. For first
in saying, <hi>What if the Apostles had not left Scripture, ought we not to
have followed the order of Tradition?</hi> And in saying, <hi>That to this order
many Nations yeild assent, who believe in Christ, having Salvation writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in their hearts, by the Spirit of God, without Letters or Inke, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
keeping ancient Tradition:</hi> Doth he not plainly shew, that
the Tradition he speakes of, is nothing else, but the very same that is
written: nothing but to believe in Christ? To which, whether Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
alone, to them that believe it, be not a sufficient guide, I leave it to
you to judge. And are not his wordes just as if a man should say, If
God had not given us the light of the Sunne, we must have made use
of candles and torches: If we had had no eyes, we must have felt out
our way: If we had no leggs, we must have used crutches. And doth
not this in effect import, that while we have the Sunne, we need no
candles? While we have our eyes, we need not feele out our way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
While we enjoy our leggs, we need not crutches? And by like reason,
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> in saying, <hi>If we had had no Scripture, we must have followed Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and they that have none, doe well to doe so,</hi> doth he not plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7615:71"/>
that to them that have Scripture, and believe it, Tradition is
unnecessary? which could not be, if the Scripture did not contain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
the whole tradition. Which whether <hi>Irenaeus</hi> believed or no,
these words of his may informe you, <hi>Non enim per alios &amp;c. we have
received the disposition of our Salvation from no others, but from them,
by whom the Gospell came unto us. Which Gospell truly, the Apostles
first preached, and after wards by the will of God, delivered in writing to
us, to be the Pillar and Foundation of our faith.</hi>

two observations, and his acknowledgment ensuing upon
them, are very considerable, and as I conceive, as home to my purpose
as I would wish them. His first <hi>Notandum</hi> is, <hi>That in the Christian
Doctrine, some things are simply necessary for the Salvation of all men; as
the knowledge of the Articles of the Apostles Creed; and besides, the
knowledg of the ten Commandements, and some of the Sacraments. Other
things not so necessary, but that a man may be saved, without the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
knowledge, and belief, and profession of them.</hi> His Second Note is,
<hi>That those things which were simply necessary, the Apostles were wont to
preach to all men; But of other things not all to all, but somethings to all, to
wit, those things which were profitable for all, other things only to Prelats
and Priests.</hi> These things premised, he acknowledgeth, <hi>That all those
things were written by the Apostles, which are necessary for all, and which
they were wont openly to preach to all; But that other things were not all
written: And therefore, when Irenaeus saies that the Apostles wrot what
they Preach in the World, it is true,</hi> saith he, <hi>and not against Traditions,
because they preached not to the People all things, but only those things,
which were necessary or profitable for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>145 So that at the most; you can inferre from hence, but only a
suppositive necessity of having an infallible Guide, and that grounded
upon a false supposition, In case we had no Scripture, but an absolute
necessity hereof, and to them who have and believe the Scripture,
which is your assumption, cannot with any colour from hence be
concluded, but rather the contrary.</p>
               <p>146 Neither because (as He saies) it was <hi>then easy to receive the
Truth from Gods Church, then,</hi> in the Age next after the Apostles, Then,
when all the ancient and Apostolike Churches were at an agreement
about the Fundamentalls of Faith: Will it therefore follow that now,
1600 yeares after, when the ancient Churches are divided almost into
as many Religions as they are Churches, every one being the Church
to it selfe, and hereticall to all other, that it is as easy, but extremely
difficult or rather impossible, to find the Church first independently
of the true Doctrine, and then to find the truth by the Church.</p>
               <p>147 As for the last clause of the sentence, it will not any whit
advantage, but rather prejudice your assertion. Neither will I seek to
avoid the pressure of it, by saying, that he speaks of <hi>small Questions,</hi> and
therefore not of Questions touching things necessary to Salvation,
which can hardly be called small Questions; But I will favour you so
farre, as to suppose, that saying this of small Questions, it is probable,
he would have said it much more of the Great: but I will answere that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7615:72"/>
which is most certain and evident, and which I am confident, you
your selfe, were you as impudent as I believe you modest, would not
deny; that the ancient Apostolique Churches are not now, as they
were in <hi>Irenaeus's</hi> time: then they were all at unity about matters of
faith, which unity was a good assurance that what they so agreed in,
came from some one common Fountaine, and they had no other then
of Apostolike Preaching. And this is the very ground of <hi>Tertullian's</hi> so
often mistaken <hi>Prescription against Heretiques, Variasse debuerat Error
Ecclesiarum, quod autem apud multos unum est, non est erratum sed tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum:</hi>
If the Churches had erred they could not but have varied, but
that which is one among so many, came not by Error but Tradition.
But now the case is altered, and the mischiefe is, that these ancient
Churches are divided among themselves; and if we have recourse to
them, one of them will say this is the way to heaven, another that. So
that now in place of receiving from them certain and cleare truths,
we must expect nothing but certain and cleare contradictions.</p>
               <p>148 Neither will the <hi>Apostles depositing with the Church, all things
belonging to truth,</hi> be any proof that the Church shall certainly keep
this <hi>depositum,</hi> entire, and syncere, without adding to it, or taking
from it; for this whole <hi>depositum</hi> was committed to every particular
Church, nay, to every particular man, which the Apostles converted.
And yet no man, I think, will say, that there was any certainty, that it
should be kept whole and inviolate by every man, and every Church.
It is apparent out of Scripture, it was committed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and by
him consigned to other faithfull men: and yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it not
superfluous, earnestly to exhort him to the carefull keeping of it:
which exhortation you must grant had been vain and superfluous, if
the not keeping of it had been impossible. And therefore though <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
saies, <hi>The Apostles fully deposited in the Church all truth,</hi> yet he
saies not, neither can we inferre from what he saies, that the Church
should alwaies infallibly keep this <hi>depositum,</hi> entire without the losse
of any truth, and syncere without the mixture of any falshood.</p>
               <p>149 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 25. But you proceed and tell us, <hi>That beside all this,
the Doctrine of Protestants is destructive of it selfe. For either they have
certain and Infallible meanes not to erre in interpreting; or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> If not,
Scripture to them cannot be a sufficient ground for infallible faith: If they
have, and so cannot erre in interpreting Scripture, then they are able
with infallibility to heare and determine all controversies of faith; and so
they may be, and are Iudges of Controversies, although they use the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as a Rule. And thus against their own doctrine, they constitute another
Iudge of Controversies beside Scripture alone.</hi> And may not we with as
much reason substitute Church and Papists, instead of Scripture and
Protestants, and say unto you, Besides all this, the doctrine of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
is destructive of it selfe. For either they have certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
meanes not to erre, in the choice of the Church, and interpreting
her decrees, or they have not: If not, then the Church to them cannot
be a sufficient (but meerely a phantasticall) ground for infallible faith,
nor a meet Iudge of Controversies: (For unlesse I be infallibly sure
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7615:72"/>
that the Church is Infallible, how can I be upon her Authority infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
sure, that any thing she saies is Infallible?) If they have certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
meanes, and so cannot erre in the choice of their Church, and
in interpreting her decrees, then they are able with Infallibility to
heare, examine, and determine all controversies of faith, although
they pretend to make the Church their Guide. And thus against their
own Doctrine, they constitute another Iudge of controversies, besides
the Church alone. Nay every one makes himselfe a chooser of his
own Religion, and of his own sense of the Churches decrees, which
very thing in Protestants they so highly condemne: and so in judging
others, condemne themselves.</p>
               <p>150 Neither in saying thus haue I only cry'd quittance with you:
but that you may see how much you are in my debt, I will shew unto
you, that for your Sophisme against our way, I haue given you a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
against yours. First, I say, your Argument against us, is a
transparent fallacy. The first part of it lyes thus: Protestants haue no
meanes to interpret, without errour, obscure and ambiguous places of
Scripture; therefore plain places of Scripture ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
ground of Faith. But though we pretend not to certain meanes of not
erring, in interpreting all Scripture, particularly such places as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and ambiguous, yet this me thinks should be no impediment but
that we may have certain meanes of not erring in and about the sense
of those places, which are so plain and cleer that they need no Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and in such we say our Faith is contain'd. If you aske me how I
can be sure that I know the true meaning of these places? I aske you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
can you be sure that you understand what I, or any man else saies?
They that heard our Saviour and the Apostles preach, could they haue
sufficient assurance, that they understood at any time, what they would
have them doe? if not, to what end did they heare them? If they
could, why may we not be as well assured, that we understand suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
what we conceive plaine in their writings?</p>
               <p>151 Againe, I pray tell us, whether you doe certainly know the
sense of these Scriptures, with which you pretend you are led to the
knowledge of your Church? If you doe not, how know you that
there is any Church Infallible, and that these are the notes of it, &amp; that
this is the, Church that hath these notes? If you doe, then give us
leave to haue the same meanes, and the same abilities to know other
plain places, which you have to know these. For if all Scripture be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
how come you to know the sense of these places? If some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it be plain, why should we stay here?</p>
               <p>152 And now, to come to the other part of your dilemma; in
saying, <hi>If they have certain meanes, and so cannot erre,</hi> mee thinkes you
forget your selfe very much, and seeme to make no difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
having certain meanes to doe a thing, and the actuall doing of
it. As if you should conclude, because all men have certain meanes of
Salvation, therefore all men certainly must be saved, and cannot doe
otherwise; as if whosoever had a horse must presently get up and ride;
Whosoever had meanes to find out a way, could not neglect those
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7615:73"/>
meanes and so mistake it, God be thanked, that we have sufficient
meanes to be certain enough of the truth of our Faith. But the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of not being in possibility of erring, that we challenge not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have as little reason as you to doe so: and you have none at
all. If you aske, seeing we may possibly erre, how can we be assured
we doe not? I ask you again, seeing your eye-fight may deceive you,
how can you be sure you see the Sunne, when you doe see it? Perhaps
you may be in a dream, and perhaps you, and all the men in the World
have been so, when they thought they were awake, and then only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
when they thought they dreamt. But this I am sure of, as sure as
that God is good, that he will require no impossibilities of us: not an
Infallible, nor a certainly—unerring belief, unlesse he hath given us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
meanes to avoid error; and if we use those which we have, will
never require of us, that we use that which we have not.</p>
               <p>153 Now from this mistaken ground, that it is all one to have
meanes of avoiding errour, and to be in no danger nor possibility of
errour; You inferre vpon us as an absurd conclusion, <hi>That we make
our selves able to determine Controversies of faith with Infallibility, and
Iudges of Controversies.</hi> For the latter part of this inference, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and imbrace it. We doe make our selves Iudges of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies:
that is, we doe make use of our own understanding in the
choice of our Religion. But this, if it be a crime, is common to us
with you, (as I have proved above) and the difference is, not that wee
are choosers, and you not choosers, but that we, as we conceive, choose
wisely, but you being wilfully blind choose to follow those that are
so too; not remembring what our Saviour hath told you, <hi>when the
blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</hi> But then again I must
tell you, you have done ill to confound together, Iudges, and infallible
Iudges; unlesse you will say, either that we have no Iudges in our
Courts of Civill judicature, or that they are all Infallible.</p>
               <p>154 Thus haue we cast off your dilemma, and broken both the
hornes of it. But now my retortion lies heavy upon you, and will not
be turned off. For first you content not your selves with a morall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the things you beleive, nor with such a degree of assurance of
them, as is sufficient to produce obedience to the condition of the new
Covenant, which is all that we require. Gods Spirit, if he please, may
work more, a certainty of adherence beyond a certainty of evidence.
But neither God doth, nor man may require of us as our dutie, to
give a greater assent to the conclusion then the premises deserue; to
build an infallible Faith upon Motives that are only highly credible,
and not infallible, as it were a great and heavy building upon a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
that hath not strength proportionable. But though God require
not of us such unreasonable things, You doe, and tell men they cannot
be saved, unlesse they beleive your proposals with an infallible Faith.
To which end they must beleive also your Propounder, your Church,
to be simply Infallible. Now how is it possible for them to give a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
assent to the Churches infallibility, unlesse they have some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
meanes to know that she is infallible? Neither can they infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7615:73"/>
know the infallibility of this meanes, but by some other, and so
on for ever: unlesse they can dig so deep as to come at length to the
Rock, that is, <hi>to settle all upon something evident of it selfe,</hi> which is not
so much as pretended. But the last resolution of all is into Motives,
which indeed upon examination will scarce appeare probable, but are
not so much as avouched to be any more then very credible. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
if I aske you why you doe beleive Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? What can
you answer, but because it is a Revelation of the Prime Verity. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
again, how can you assure your selfe or me of that, being ready
to embrace it if it may appeare to be so? And what can you say, but
that you know it to be so, because the Church saies so, which is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
If I aske, what meane You by your Church? You can tell me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but the company of Christians which adhere to the <hi>Pope.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
then lastly: Why should I beleive this company to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Propounder of Divine Revelation? And then you tell me,
that there are many Motives to induce a man to this beleife. But are
these Motives lastly infallible? No say you, but very credible. Well,
let them passe for such, because now we have not leasure to examine
them. Yet me thinks seeing the Motives to believe the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
are only very credible, it should also be but as credible that
your Church is Infallible, and as credible, and no more, perhaps some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
lesse, that her proposals, particularly Transubstantiation, are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelations. And me thinks You should require only a Morall,
and modest assent to them, and not a Divine as you call it, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Faith. But then of these Motives to the Churches Infallibility, I
hope you will give us leave to consider, and judge whether they be
indeed Motives, and sufficient; or whether they be not Motives at all,
or not sufficient; or whether these Motives or inducements to your
Church be not impeached, and opposed with Compulsives, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements
from it; or lastly, whether these Motives which You use,
be not indeed only Motives to Christianity, and not to <hi>Popery:</hi> giue
me leave for distinction sake to call your Religion so. If we may not
judge of these things, how can my judgment be moved with that
which comes not within its cognizance? If I may, then at least I am
to be a Iudge of all these Controversies. 1. Whether every one of
these Motives be indeed a Motive to any Church? 2. If to some,
whether to Yours? 3. If to Yours, whether sufficient, or insufficient?
4. Whether other Societies haue not as many, and as great Motives
to draw me to them? 5. Whether I haue not greater reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
you doe erre, then that you cannot? And now Sir I pray let me
trouble You with a few more Questions. Am I a sufficient Iudge of
these Controversies, or no? If of these, why shall I stay here, why not
of others? Why not of all? Nay doth not the true examining of these
few, containe and lay upon me the examination of all? What other
Motives to your Church have you, but your Notes of it? <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
gives some 14. or 15. And one of these fifteene containes in it the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of all controversies, and not only so, but of all uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Doctrines. For how shall I, or can I know the Church of <hi>Romes</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:7615:74"/>
conformity with the Ancient Church, unlesse I know first what the
Ancient Church hid hold, and then what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth
hold; and lastly, whether they be conformable, or if in my judgment
they seeme not conformable, I am then to think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
not to be the Church, for want of the Note which she pretends is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and perpetuall to it. So that for ought I can see, Iudges we are and
must be of all sides, every one for himselfe, and God for us all.</p>
               <p>155 <hi>Ad</hi> § 26. I answere; This assertion, that <hi>Scripture alone is
Iudge of all Controversies in Faith,</hi> if it be taken properly, is neither
a Fundamentall nor Vnfundamentall point of Faith, nor no point of
Faith at all, but a plaine falshood. It is not <hi>a Iudge of Controversies
but a Rule to Iudge them by;</hi> and that not an absolutly perfect Rule,
but as perfect as a written Rule can be; which must alwayes need some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, which is either evidently true, or evidently credible to give
attestation to it, and that in this case is Vniversall Tradition. So that
Vniversall Tradition is the Rule to judge all Controversies by. But then
because nothing besides Scripture, comes to us with as full a streame
of Tradition as Scripture, Scripture alone, and no unwritten Doctrine,
nor no Infallibility of any Church, having attestation from Tradition
truely Vniversall; for this reason we conceive, as the Apostles persons
while they were liuing were the only Iudges of controversies, so their
Writings, now they are dead, are the only Rule for us to judge them by:
There being nothing unwritten, which can goe in upon halfe so faire
cards, for the title of Apostolike Tradition, as these things which by
the confession of both Sides are not so: I mean <hi>the doctrine of the Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi>
and <hi>of the necessity of the Eucharist for Infants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>156 Yet when we say, the Scripture is the only Rule to judge all
Controversies by, me thinks you should easily conceiue, that wee
would be understood of all those that are possible to be judg'd by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and of those that arise among such as believe the Scripture. For
if I had a controversie with an Atheist whether there were a God or
no, I would not say, that the Scripture were a Rule to judge this by: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that doubting whether there be a God or no, he must needs doubt
whether the Scripture be the word of God: or if hee does not, hee
grants the Question, and is not the man we speak of. So likewise, if I
had a controversie about the Truth of Christ with a lew, it would be
vainly done of me, should I presse him which the Authority of the
new Testament which he believes not, untill out of some principles
common to us both, I had persuaded him that it is the Word of God.
The New Testament therefore while he remaines a Iew would not be
a fit Rule to decide this Controversie; In as much as that which is
doubted of it selfe, is not fit to determine other doubts. So likewise if
there were any that believed Christian Religion, and yet believed not
the Bible to be the Word of God, though they believed the matter
of it to be true, (which is no impossible supposition, for I may believe
a book of S. <hi>Austines,</hi> to containe nothing but the Truth of God, &amp; yet
not to haue been inspired by God himselfe,) against such men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there were no disputing out of the Bible; because nothing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7615:74"/>
can be a proof to it selfe. When therefore we say the Scripture is
a sufficient meanes to determine all controversies, we say not this, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Atheists, Iewes, Turks, or such Christians (if there be any such)
as believe not Scripture to be the word of God. But among such men
only, as are already agreed upon this, That the Scripture is the Word
of God, we say all controversies that arise about Faith, are either not
at all decidable &amp; consequently not necessary to be believed one way
or other, or they may be determined by Scripture. In a Word, That
all things necessary to be believed are evidently contain'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and what is not there evidently contained, cannot be necessary to
be believed. And our reason hereof is convincing; because nothing
can challenge our beliefe, but what hath descended to us from Christ
by Originall and Vniversall Tradition: Now nothing but Scripture
hath thus descended to us, Therefore nothing but Scripture can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
our beliefe. Now then to come up closer to you, and to answer
to your Question, not as you put it, but as you should haue put it: I say,
That this position, <hi>Scripture alone is the rule whereby they which belieue
it to be Gods Word are to judge all Controversies in Faith,</hi> is no fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
point. Though not for your Reasons: For your first and strongest
reason you see is plainly voided and cut off by my stating of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
as I haue done, and supposing in it that the parties at variance are
agreed about this, That the Scripture is the word of God; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that this is none of their Controversies. To your second, That
<hi>Controversies cannot be ended without some living Authority,</hi> We haue
said already, that necessary Controversies may be &amp; are decided. And
if they be not ended, this is not through defect of the Rule, but through
the default of Men. And for these that cannot thus be ended, it is not
necessary they should be ended. For if God did require the ending of
them, he would have provided some certain meanes for the ending of
them. And to your Third, I say, that your pretence of using these
meanes is but hypocriticall: for you use them with prejudice, and with
a setled resolution not to believe any thing which these meanes happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may suggest into you, if it any way crosse your pre-conceav'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion
of your Churches infallibility. You give not your selves li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of judgement in the use of them, nor suffer your selves to bee
led by them to the Truth, to which they would lead you, would you
but be as willing to believe this consequence, Our Church doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Scripture, therefore it doth erre, therefore it is not Infallible, as
you are resolute to believe this, The Church is infallible, therefore it
doth not erre, and therefore it doth not oppose Scripture, though it
seem to doe so never so plainly.</p>
               <p>157 You pray, but it is not that God would bring you to the true
Religion, but that he would confirm you in your own. You conferre
places, but it is that you may confirm, or colour over with plausible
disguises your erroneous doctrine, not that you may judge of them &amp;
forsake them if there be reason for it. You consult the Originalls, but
you regard them not when they make against your Doctrine or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:7615:75"/>
158 You adde not only the Authority, but the Infallibility, not
of Gods Church, but of the Roman, a very corrupt and degenerous
part of it: whereof D. <hi>Potter</hi> never confessed, that it cannot erre dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.
And which being a company made up of particular men, can
afford you no help, but the industry, learning, and wit of private men:
and that these helps may not help you out of your errour, tell you, that
you must make use of none of all these to discover any errour in the
Church, but only to maintaine her impossibility or erring. And lastly,
D. <hi>Potter</hi> assures himselfe that your Doctrine and practises are damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough in themselves; Only he hopes (and <hi>spes est rei incertae no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>)
he hopes, I say, that the Truths which you retain, especially
the necessity of repentance and faith in Christ, will bee as an antidote
to you against the errours which you maintain; and that your super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
may burne, yet they amongst you, <hi>Qui sequun tur Absalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
in simplicitate cor dis</hi> may be saved, <hi>yet so as by fire.</hi> Yet his think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so is no reason for you or me to think so, unlesse you suppose him
infallible; and if you doe, why doe you write against him?</p>
               <p>159 Notwithstanding, though not for these reasons, yet for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
I conceive this Doctrine not Fundamentall: Because if a man
should believe Christian Religion wholly, and entirely, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to it, such a man, though he should not know or not believe
the Scripture to be a Rule of Faith, no nor to be the word of God, my
opinion is he may be saved; and my reason is, because he performes the
entire condition of the new Covenant, which is, that we believe the
matter of the Gospell, and not that it is contained in these or these
Bookes. So that the Bookes of Scripture are not so much the objects
of our faith, as the instruments of conveying it to our understanding;
and not so much of the being of the Christian Doctrine, as requisite to
the well being of it. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tels us (as M. K. acknowledgeth) of some
barbarous Nations, that <hi>believed the Doctrine of Christ, and yet belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not the Scripture to be the word of God, for they never heard of it,
and Faith comes by hearing:</hi> But these barbarous people might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
therefore men might be saved without believing the Scripture to
be the word of God; much more without believing it to be a Rule,
and a perfect Rule of Faith. Neither doubt I, but if the bookes of
Scripture had been proposed to them by the other parts of the
Church, where they had been before received, and had been doubted
of, or even rejected by those barbarous nations, but still by the bare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
and practise of Christianity, they might be saved: God requiring
of us under pain of damnation, only to believe the verities therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and not the divine Authority of the bookes wherein they are
contained. Not but that it were now very strange and unreasonable,
if a man should belieue the matter of these bookes, and not the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the bookes: and therefore if a man should professe the not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of these, I should have reason to fear he did not believe that.
But there is not alwaies an equall necessity for the belief of those
things, for the belief whereof there is an equall reason. We have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as great reason to believe there was such a man as <hi>Henry the eight
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7615:75"/>
K. of England,</hi> as that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> suffered under <hi>Pontius Pila<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> yet
this is necessary to be believed, and that is not so. So that if any man
should doubt of or disbelieve that, it were most unreasonably done of
of him, yet it were no mortall sinne, nor no sinne at all: God having
no where commanded men under pain of damnation to believe all
which reason induceth them to believe. Therefore as an Executor,
that should performe the whole will of the dead; should fully satisfy
the Law, though he did not believe that Parchment to be his written
Will, which indeed is so? So I believe, that he who believes all the
particular doctrines which integrate Christianity, and lives according
to them, should be saved, though he neither believed nor knew that the
Gospels were written by the Evangelists, or the Epistles by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
               <p>160 This discourse whether it be rationall and concluding or no,
I submit to better judgement; But sure I am, that the corollary which
you draw from this position, <hi>that this point is not Fundamenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> is very
inconsequent; that is, <hi>that we are uncertain of the truth of it,</hi> because
we say the whole Church, much more particular Churches and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
men may erre in points not Fundamentall. A pretty sophisme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon this Principle, that whosoever possibly may erre, he
cannot be certain that he doth not erre. And upon this ground, what
shall hinder me from concluding, that seeing you also hold, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particular Churches, nor private men are Infallible even in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls,
that even the Fundamentalls of Christianity, remain to you
uncertain? A Iudge may possibly erre in judgement, can he therefore
never have assurance that he hath judged right? A travailer may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
mistake his way, must I therefore be doubtfull whether I am in
the right way from my Hall to my Chamber? Or can our London
carrier have no certainty, in the middle of the day, when he is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and in his wits, that he is in the way to London? These you see
are right worthy consequences, and yet they are as like your own, as
an egge to an egge, or milke to milke.</p>
               <p>161 And <hi>for the selfe same reason</hi> (you say) <hi>we are not certain, that
the Church is not Iudge of Controversies:</hi> But now this selfe same ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be no reason, and therefore, for all this, we may be certain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that the Church is no Iudge of Controversies. The ground of
this sophisme is very like the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that we can be certain of the
falshood of no propositions, but these only which are damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
But I pray good Sir, give me your opinion of these: The Snow is
black, the Fire is cold, that M. <hi>knot</hi> is Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> that the
whole is not greater then a part of the whole, that twise two make not
foure: In your opinion, good Sir, are these damnable Haeresies? or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not so, have we no certainty of the falshood of them?
I beseech you Sir to consider seriously, with what strange captions,
you have gone about to delude your King and your Country; and if
you be convinced, they are so, give glory to God, and let the world
know it, by your deserting that Religion, which stands upon such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
foundations.</p>

162 Besides (you say) <hi>among publique conclusions defended in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
the yeare 1633. to the Questions, Whether the Church have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to determine controversies of Faith? And to interpret holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
The answere to both is affirmative.</hi> But what now if I should tell
you, that in the year 1632. among publique Conclusions defended in
Doway, one was, <hi>That God predeterminates men to all their Actions
good, bad, and indifferent?</hi> Will you think your selfe obliged to be of
this opinion? If you will, say so: If not, doe as you would be done by.
Again, me thinkes so subtil a man as you are, should easily apprehend
a wide difference between Authority to doe a thing, and Infallibility in
doing it: &amp; againe, between a conditionall infallibility &amp; an absolute.
The former, the Doctor together with the Article of the Church of
England, attributeth to the Church, nay to particular Churches, and I
subscribe to his opinion: that is, an Authority of determining contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of faith, according to plain and evident Scripture and Vniversall
Tradition, and Infallibility while they proceed according to this Rule.
As if there should arise an Heretique, that should call in Question
Christs Passion and Resurrection, the Church had Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
this Controversy, and infallible direction how to doe it, and to
excommunicate this man, if he should persist in errour. I hope you
will not deny but that the Iudges have Authority to determine crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and Civill Controversies; and yet I hope you will not say, that
they are absolutely Infallible in their determinations. Infallible while
they proceed according to Law, and if they doe so: but not infallibly
certain that they shall ever doe so. But that the Church should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
assisted by Gods spirit to decide rightly all emergent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
even such as might be held diversly of divers men, <hi>Salva
compage fidei,</hi> and that we might be absolutely certain that the Church
should never faile to decree the truth, whether she used meanes or no,
whether she proceed according to her Rule or not; or lastly that we
might be absolutely certain that she would never fail to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her Rule, this the defender of these conclusions said not:
and therefore said no more to your purpose, then you have all this
while, that is, just nothing.</p>
               <p>163 Ad §. 27. To the place of <hi>S. Austin</hi> alleaged in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph.
I Answer. First that in many things you will not bee
tried by S. <hi>Augustines</hi> judgement, nor submit to his authority; not
concerning Appeals to Rome, not concerning Transubstantiation, not
touching the use and worshiping of Images, not concerning the State
of Saints soules before the day of judgement, not touching the Virgin
Maries freedome from actuall and originall sinne, not touching the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the Eucharist for Infants, not touching the damning Infants
to hell that dye without Baptisme, not touching the knowledge of
Saints departed, not touching Purgatory, not touching the fallibility
of Councells, even generall Councells, not touching perfection and
perspicuity of Scripture in matters necessary to Salvation, not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Auricular Confession, not touching the halfe Communion, not
touching Prayers in an unknown tongue; In these things, I say, you will
not stand to S. <hi>Austines</hi> judgement, and therefore can with no reason
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7615:76"/>
or equity require us to doe so in this matter. 2. To S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in
heat of disputation against the Donatists, and ransacking all places for
arguments against them, we oppose S. <hi>Austine</hi> out of this heat, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the doctrine of Christianity calmely, and mode rately; where he

not of the Roman but the Catholique Church, of farre greater extent,
and therefore of farre greater credit and authority then the Roman
Church. 4 He speaks of a point not expressed, but yet not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by Scripture; whereas the errors we charge you with, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
by Scripture. 5 He saies not that Christ has recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Church to us for <hi>an Infallible definer of all emergent controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi>
but for a <hi>credible witnesse of Ancient Tradition.</hi> Whosoever
therefore refuseth to follow the practise of the Church (understand
<hi>of all places and ages</hi>) though he be thought to resist our Saviour,
what is that to us, who cast off no practises of the Church, but such as
are evidently post-nate to the time of the Apostles, and plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the practise of former and purer times. Lastly it is evident, and
even to impudence it selfe undeniable, that upon this ground, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving
all things taught by the present Church as taught by Christ,
Error was held, for example, the necessity of the Eucharist for infants,
and that in S. <hi>Austines</hi> time, and that by S. <hi>Austine</hi> himselfe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without controversy this is no certain ground for truth, which
may support falshood as well as truth.</p>
               <p>164 To the Argument wherewith you conclude, I Answere,
That though the visible Church shall alwaies without faile propose
so much of Gods revelation, as is sufficient to bring men to Heaven,
for otherwise it will not be the visible Church, yet it may sometimes
adde to this revelation things superfluous, nay hurtfull, nay in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
damnable, though not unpardonable; and sometimes take
from it things very expedient and profitable, and therefore it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
without si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne, to resist in some things the Visible Church of
Christ. But you presse us farther, and demand, <hi>what visible Church was
extant, when Luther began, whether it were the Roman or Protestant
Church?</hi> As if it must of necessity either be Protestant or Roman, or
Roman of necessity, if it were not Protestant! yet this is the most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
fallacy of all your disputers, by some specious Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
weak men that the Church of Protestants cannot be the true
Church; and thence to inferre, that without doubt it must be the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
But why may not the Roman be content to be a part of it, and the
Grecian another? And if one must be the whole, why not the Greek
Church, as well as the Roman? there being not one Note of your
Church which agrees not to her as well as to your own; unlesse it be,
that she is poor, and oppressed by the Turk, and you are in glory and
splendor.</p>
               <p>165 Neither is it so easy to be determined as you pretend, <hi>That
Luther and other Protestants opposed the whole visible Church in matters
of Faith,</hi> neither is it so evident that <hi>the Visible Church may not fall into
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7615:77"/>
such a state wherein she may be justly opposed.</hi> And lastly for calling the
distinction of <hi>points into Fundamentall and not Fundamentall,</hi> an evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I believe you will find it easier to call it so, then to prove it so. But
that shall be the issue of the Controversy in the next Chapter.</p>

they haue an Answer (such as it is) that the Catholike Church cannot perish, yet may erre in
points not fundamentall, and therefore <hi>Luther</hi> and other Protestants were obliged to forsake her
for such errors, under paine of <hi>Damnation;</hi> as if (forsooth) it were <hi>Damnable,</hi> to hold an error
not <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> nor <hi>Damnable.</hi> If you wonder how they can teach, that both Catholiques,
and Protestants may be saved in their severall professions; they salve this contradiction, by saying,
that we both agree in all fundamentall points of faith, which is enough for salvation. And yet,
which is prodigiously strange, they could never be induced to give a Catalogue what points in
particular be fundamentall, but only by some generall description, or by referring us to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed,</hi> without determining, what points therein be fundamentall, or not fundamentall
for the matter; and in what sense, they be, or be not such: and yet concerning the meaning of
divers points contained, or reduced to the <hi>Creed,</hi> they differ both from us, and among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And indeed, it being impossible for them to exhibit any such Catalogue, the said distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of points, although it were pertinent, and true, cannot serve them to any purpose, but still
they must remaine uncertaine, whether or not they disagree from one another; from the ancient
Fathers; and from the Catholique Church, in points fundamentall: which is to say, they have
no certainty, whether they enjoy the substance of Christian Faith, without which they cannot
hope to be saved. But of this more heerafter.</p>
               <p>2 And to the end, that what shall be said concerning this distinction, may be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
wee are to observe; that there be two precepts, which concerne the vertue of faith, or our
obligation to <hi>believe</hi> divine truths. The one is by Divines called <hi>Affirmative,</hi> whereby we are
obliged to have a positive explicite belief of some chief Articles of Christian faith. The other is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ermed <hi>Negative,</hi> which <hi>strictly</hi> binds us not not to disbelieve, that is, not to believe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of any one point sufficiently represented to our understanding, as revealed, or spoken by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God. The said <hi>Affirmative Precept</hi> (according to the nature of such commands) injoynes
some act to be performed, but not at all <hi>times,</hi> nor doth it equally bind all sorts of <hi>persons,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of all <hi>objects</hi> to be believed. For <hi>objects;</hi> we grant that some are more necessary to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely,
and severall believed then other: either because they are in themselves more great, and
weighty; or els in regard they instruct us in some necessary Christian duty towards God, our
selves, or our Neighbour, For <hi>persons;</hi> no doubt but some are obliged to know distinctly more
then others, by reason of their office, vocation, capacity or the like. For <hi>times;</hi> we are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to be still in act of exercising acts of faith, but according as severall occasions permit, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
The second kind of precept called <hi>Negative,</hi> doth (according to the nature of all such
commands) oblige <hi>universally,</hi> all <hi>persons,</hi> in respect of all <hi>objects;</hi> and at all <hi>times; se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>per &amp;
pro semper,</hi> as Divines speak. This generall doctrine will be more cleere by examples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not
obliged to be alwaies helping my Neighbour, because the <hi>Affirmative</hi> precept of <hi>Charity,</hi> bindeth
only in some particular cases: But I am alwaies bound by a <hi>Negative</hi> precept, never to doe him
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7615:77"/>
any hurt, or wrong. I am not alwaies bound to utter what I know to be true: yet I am obliged,
never to speak any one least untruth, against my knowledge. And (to come to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
there is no <hi>Affirmative</hi> precept, commanding us to be at <hi>all times</hi> actually believing any
one, or <hi>all</hi> Articles of faith: But we are obliged, <hi>never</hi> to exercise any act against any one truth,
known to be revealed. All sorts of <hi>persons</hi> are not bound explicitely, and distinctly to know all
things testified by God either in Scripture, or otherwise: but every one is obliged, not to believe
the contrary of any one point, known to be testified by God. For that were in fact to affirme,
that God could be deceived, or would deceive, which were to overthrow the whole certainty of
our faith, wherein the thing most principall, is not the point which we believe, which Divines call
the <hi>Materiall Object,</hi> but the chiefest is the <hi>Motive</hi> for which we believe, to wit, Almighty Gods
infallible revelation, or authority, which they terme the <hi>Formall Object</hi> of our faith. In two sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
therefore, and with a double relation, points of faith may be called fundamentall, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation, The one is taken with reference to the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Precept, when the points
are of such quality that there is obligation to know and believe them explicitely and severally.
In this sense we grant that there is difference betwixt points of faith, which <hi>D. Potter</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 209.</note> to
no purpose laboureth to prove against his Adversary, who in expresse words doth grant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate

word in defence of his distinction, as it was impugned by <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> and as it is
wont to be applied by Protestants. The other sense, according to which, points of faith may be
called <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> and necessary to salvation, with reference to the <hi>Negative</hi> precept of faith,
is such, that we cannot without grievous sinne, and forfeiture of salvation, disbelieve any one
point, sufficiently propounded, as revealed by Almighty God. And in this sense we avouch, that
there is no distinction in points of faith, as if to reject some must bee damnable, and to reject
others, equally proposed as Gods word, might stand with salvation. Yea the obligation of the
<hi>Negative</hi> precept is farre more strict, then is that of the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> which God freely imposed,
and may freely release. But it is impossible, that he can dispense, or give leave to disbelieue, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
what he affirmeth: &amp; in this sense, sin &amp; damnation are more inseparable from <hi>error</hi> in points
<hi>not fundamentall,</hi> then from <hi>ignorance</hi> in Articles <hi>fundamentall.</hi> All this I shew by an example,
which I wish to be particularly noted for the present, and for divers other occasions hereafter.
The <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> containes divers fundamentall points of faith, as the Deity, Trinity
of Persons, Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of our Saviour Christ &amp;c. It containes also
some points, for their matter, and nature in themselves not fundamentall; as under what Iudge
our Saviour suffered, that he was buried, the circumstance of the time of his Resurrection the
third day &amp;c. But yet neverthelesse, whosoever once knowes that these points are contained in
the Apostles <hi>Creed,</hi> the deniall of them is damnable, and is in that sense a <hi>fundamentall</hi> error; and
this is the precise point of the present question.</p>
               <p>3 And all that hitherto hath been said, is so manifestly true, that no Protestant or Christian,
if he doe but understand the termes, and state of the Question, can possibly deny it: In so much
as I am amazed, that men who otherwise are endued with excellent wits, should so enslave
themselves to their Predecessors in Protestantisme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as still to harp on this distinction, and never
regard how impertinently, &amp; untruly it was implied by them at first, to make all Protestants seem
to be of one fayth, because forsooth they agree in fundamentall points. For the difference among
Protestants, consists not in that some believe some points, of which others are ignorant, or not
bound expressely to know (as the distinction ought to be applied;) but that some of them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe,
and directly, wittingly, and willingly oppose what others doe believe to be testified by
the word of God, wherein there is no difference between points fundamentall, and not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall;
Because till points fundamentall be sufficiently proposed as revealed by God, it is not
against faith to reject them, or rather without sufficient proposition it is not possible prudently to
believe them; and the like is of points not fundamentall, which assoone as they come to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
propounded as divine Truths, they can no more be denyed, then points fundamentall
propounded after the same manner. Neither will it avayle them to their other end, that for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Church in being, it is sufficient that she doe not erre in points fundamentall. Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
if in the mean time she maintain any one Errour against Gods revelation, be the thing in it selfe
never so small, her Errour is damnable, and destructive of salvation.</p>
               <p>4 But <hi>D. Potter</hi> forgetting to what purpose Protestants make use of their distinction, doth
finally overthrow it, and yields to as much as we can desire. For, speaking of that <hi>measure</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 211<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> &amp;
<hi>Quantity of faith without which none can be saved,</hi> he sayth: <hi>It is enough to believe some things by
a vertuall faith, or by a generall, and as it were, a negative faith, whereby they are not denyed
or contradicted.</hi> Now our question is in case that divine truths, although not fundamentall, be
denied and contradicted; aad therefore, even according to him, all such deniall excludes salvation.
After, he speaks more plainly. <hi>It is true</hi> (saith he) <hi>whatsoever</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 212<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>is revealed in Scripture, or
propoundid by the Church out of Scripture, is in some sense fundamentall, in regard of the divine
authority of God, and his word, by which it is recommended: that is, such as may not be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

contradicted without Infidelity: such as every Christian is bound with humility, and reverence to
believe, whensoever the knowledge thereof is offered to him. And further: Where</hi>

for us, that it is a <hi>Fundamentall</hi> error to deny any one point, though never so small, if once
it be sufficiently propounded, as a divine truth, and that there is, in this sense, no distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
points fundamentall, and not fundamentall? And if any should chance to imagine, that it
is against the foundation of faith, not to believe points <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> although they be not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
propounded, <hi>D. Potter</hi> doth not admit of this<note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 246.</note> difference betwixt points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and not fundamentall. For he teacheth, that <hi>sufficient proposition of revealed truth is required
before a man can be convinced,</hi> and for want of sufficient conviction he excuseth the Disciples
from heresy, although they believed not our Saviours Resurrection,<note n="g" place="margin">Pag. 246.</note> which is a very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
point of faith. Thus then I argue out of <hi>D. Potters</hi> own confession: No error is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unlesse the contrary truth be sufficiently propounded as revealed by God: Every error is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
if the contrary truth be sufficiently propounded as revealed by God: Therefore all errors
are alike for the generall effect of damnation, if the difference arise not from the manner of being
propounded. And what now is become of their distinction?</p>
               <p>5 I will therefore conclude with this Argument. According to all Philosophy and Divinity,
the <hi>Vnity,</hi> and distinction of every thing followeth the Nature and Essence thereof, and therefore
if the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>being</hi> of faith, be not taken from the matter which a man believes, but from
the motive for which he believes, (which is Gods word or Revelation) we must likewise affirme
that the <hi>Vnity,</hi> and <hi>Diversity</hi> of faith, must be measured by Gods revelation (which is alike for
all objects) and not by the smalnesse, or greatnesse of the matter which we believe. Now, that
the nature of faith is not taken from the greatnesse, or smalnesse of the things believed, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest;
because otherwise one who believes only fundamentall points, and another who together
with them, doth also believe points not fundamentall, should have faith of different natures, yea
there should be as many differences of faith, as there are different points which men believe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to different capacities, or instruction &amp;c. all which consequences are absurd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must say, that <hi>Vnity in Faith</hi> doth not depend upon points fundamentall, or not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
but upon Gods revelation equally or unequally proposed: and Protestants preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an <hi>Vnity</hi> only by reason of their agreement in fundamentall points, doe indeed induce as
great a multiplicity of faith as there is multitude of different objects which are believed by them,
and since they disagree in things <hi>Equally revealed</hi> by Almighty God, it is evident that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the very <hi>Formall motive</hi> of faith, which is Gods revelanon and consequently loose all <hi>Faith,</hi>
and <hi>Vnity</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>6 The first part of the Title of this Chapter (<hi>That the distinction of points fundamentall
and not fundamentall in the sense of Protestants, is both impertinent and untrue</hi>) being demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated;
let us now come to the second: <hi>That the Church is infallible in all her definitions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they concerne points fundamentall, or not fundamentall,</hi> And this I prove by these reasons.</p>
               <p>7 It hath been shewed in the precedent Chapter, that the Church is Iudge of Controversies;
which she could not be, if she could erre in any one point, as <hi>Doctor Potter</hi> would not deny, if he
were once perswaded that she is Iudge. Because if the could erre in some points, we could not rely
upon her <hi>Authority</hi> and Iudgment in any one thing.</p>
               <p>8 This same is proved by the reason we alleadged before, that seeing the Church was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in all her definitions ere Scripture was written (unlesse we will take away all certainty of faith
for that time) we cannot with any shew of reason affirme, that shee hath been deprived thereof
by the adjoyned confort, and helpe of sacred writ.</p>
               <p>9 Moreover to say, that the Catholique Church may propose any false doctrine, maketh her
lyable to <hi>damnable</hi> sinne and error; and yet D. <hi>Potter</hi> teacheth that the Church cannot erre <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.</hi>
For if in that kind of Oath, which Divines call <hi>Assertorium,</hi> wherein God is called to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
every falshood is a deadly sinne in any private person whatsoever, although the thing be of
it selfe neither materiall, nor prejudiciall to any; because the quantity, or greatnesse of that sinne
is not measured so much by the thing which is affirmed, as by the manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; and authority where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is avouched, and by the injury that is offered to Almighty God in applying his testimony to
a falshood: in which respect it is the unanimous consent of all Divines, that in such kind of
Oathes, no <hi>levitas materiae,</hi> that is, <hi>smallnes of matter,</hi> can excuse from a morall sacriledge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>morall</hi> vertue of Religion which respects worship due to God: If I say, every least fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
be deadly sinne in the foresaid kind of Oath; much more pernicious a sinne must it be in the
<hi>publique person</hi> of the Catholique Church to propound untrue Articles of faith, thereby fastning
Gods <hi>prime Verity</hi> to falshood, and inducing and obliging the world to doe the same. Besides,
according to teh doctrine of all Divines, it is not only injurious to Gods Eternall Verity, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
things by him revealed, but also to propose as revealed truths, things not revealed: as in
common wealths it is a haynous offence to coyne either by counterfeiting the metall or the
stamp, or to apply the Kings seale to a writing counterfeit, although the contents were supposed
to be true. And whereas, to shew the detestable sinne of such pernitious fictions, the Church doth
most exemplarly punish all broachers of fained revelations, visions; miracles, prophecies &amp;c. as in
particular appeareth in the Councell of<note n="h" place="margin">Sub. Leon. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iob) doth God need your lye, that for him you may speak deceipts?</hi> And that of
the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is most truly verified in fictitious revelations: <hi>If any</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Cap. ult. v. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>shall adde to these things,
God will adde unto him the plagues which are written in this book:</hi> and <hi>D. Potter</hi> saith, <hi>to adde</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Pag. 122.</note> 
                  <hi>to it</hi> (speaking of the Creed) <hi>is high presumption, almost as great as to detract from it.</hi> And
therefore to say the Church may addefalse Revelations, is to accuse her of high presumption, and
of pernitious errour excluding salvation.</p>
               <p>10 Perhaps some will here reply that although the Church may erre, yet it is not imputed to
her for sinne, by reason shee doth not erre upon malice, or wittingly, but by ignorance, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</p>
               <p>11 But it is easily demonstrated that this excuse cannot serve. For if the Church be assisted
only for points fundamentall, she cannot but know, that she may erre in points not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
at least she cannot be certain that she cannot erre, and therefore cannot be excused from
headlong and pernitious temerity, in proposing points not fundamentall, to be believed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
as matters of faith, wherein she can have no certainty, yea which alwaies imply a falshood.
For although the thing might chance to be true, and perhaps also revealed; yet for the <hi>matter,</hi> she
for her part, doth alwaies expose her selfe to danger of falshood and error; and in fact doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
erre in the <hi>

                     </gap>anner</hi> in which she doth propound any matter not fundamentall; because shee
proposeth it as a point of faith <hi>certainly</hi> true, which yet is alwaies uncertain, if she in such things
may be deceived.</p>
               <p>12 Besides, if the Church may erre in points not fundamentall, she may erre in proposing
some Scripture for Canonicall, which is not such: or else not erre in keeping and conserving from
corruptions such Scriptures as are already believed to be Canonicall. For I will suppose, that in
such Apocrypha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Scripture as she delivers, there is no fundamentall error against faith, or that
there is no falshood at all, but only want of divine testification: in which case D. <hi>Potter</hi> must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grant, that it is a fundamentall error, to apply divine revelation to any point not revealed, or
else must yeeld, that the Church may erre in her <hi>Proposition,</hi> or <hi>Custody</hi> of the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And so we cannot be sure whether she have not been deceived already, in Bookes recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by her, and accepted by Christians. And thus we shall have no certainty of Scripture, if
the Church want certainty in all her definitions. And it is worthy to be observed, that some
Bookes of Scripture which were not alwaies known to be Canonicall, have been afterward recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for such; but never any one book, or syllable defined by the Church to be Canonicall, was
afterward questioned, or rejected for Apocryphall. A signe, that Gods Church is infallibly assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by the holy Ghost, never to propose as divine truth, any thing not revealed by God: and that,
<hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ission</hi> to define points not sufficiently discussed is laudable, but <hi>Commission</hi> in propounding

               <p>13 Nay, to limit the generall promises of our Saviour Christ made to his Church to points

and manner of interpreting the Scripture, limit the Infallibility of the Apostles words, &amp;
preaching, only to Points fundamentall: and whatsoever generall Texts of Scripture shall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
for their infallibility, they may, by <hi>D. Potter</hi> example be explicated, and restrained to
points fundamentall. By the same reason it may be farther affirmed, that the Apostles, and other
writers of Canonicall Scripture, were endued with infallibility, only in setting down points fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.
For if it be urged, that <hi>all Scripture is divinely inspired;</hi> that it is the word of God
&amp;c. <hi>D. Potter</hi> hath afforded you a ready answer, to say, that <hi>Scripture is inspired &amp;c.</hi> only in those
parts, or parcels, wherein it delivereth fundamentall points. In this manner <hi>D. Fotherby</hi> saith:
<hi>The Apostle</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">In his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Serm. 2. pag. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>twice in one Chapter professed, that this he speaketh, and not the Lord, He is very
well content that where he lacks the warrant of the expresse word of God, that part of his writings
should be esteemed as the word of man. D. Potter</hi> also speaks very dangerously towards this purpose,
<hi>Sect.</hi> 5. where he endeavoureth to prove, that the infallibility of the Church is limited to points
fundamentall, because <hi>as Nature, so God is neither defective in</hi>

                  <hi>you for ever,</hi> he saith: <hi>Though that promise was</hi>

the Apostles (who had the Spirits guidance in a more high and absolute manner, then any since
them) yet it was made to themfor the behoof of the Church, and is verified in the Church Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.
But all truth is not simply all, but all of some kind. To be led into all truths, is to know, and
believe them. And who is so simple as to be ignorant, that there are many millions of truths (in
Nature, History, Divinity) whereof the Church is simply ignorant. How many truths lye unrevea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea
in the infinite treasury of Gods wisdome, wherewith the Church is not acquainted &amp;c. so then,
the truth it selfe enforceth us to understand by (all truths) not simply all, not all which God can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
reveal, but all pertaining to the substance of faith, all truth absolutely necessary to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Mark what he saith. That promise (<hi>The spirit shall lead you into all truth,) was made direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7615:79"/>
to the Apostles, and is verified in the universall Church, but by all truth is not understood simply
all, but all apperraining to the substance of faith, and absolutely necessary to salvation.</hi> Doth it
not hence follow, that the promise made to the Apostles of being led into all truth, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
only of all truth absolutely necessary to salvation? and consequently their preaching, and
writing, were not infallible in points not fundamentall? or if the Apostles were infallible in all
things which they proposed as divine truth, the like must be affirmed of the Church, because <hi>D.
Potter</hi> teacheth, the said promise <hi>to be verified in the Church.</hi> And as he limits the aforesaid
words to points fundamentall; so may he restrain, what other text soever that can be brought for
the universall infallibility of the Apostles or Scriptures. So he may; and so he must, least other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he receive this answer of his own from himselfe, <hi>How many truths lye unrevealed in the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
treasurie of Gods wisdome, wherewith the Church is not acquainted?</hi> And therefore to verify
such generall sayings, they must be understood of truths absolutely necessary to Salvation. Are
not these fearfull consequences? And yet <hi>D. Potter</hi> will never be able to avoid them, till he come
to acknowledge the infallibility of the Church in all points by her proposed as divine truths; and
thus it is universally true that she is lead into all truth, in regard that our Saviour never permits her
to define, or teach any falshood.</p>
               <p>14 All, that with any colour may be replied to this argument is; That if once we call any
one Book, or parcell of Scripture in question; although for the matter it contain no fundamentall
error, yet it is of great importance and fundamentall, by reason of the consequence; because if
once we doubt of one Book received for Canonicall, the whole canon is made doubtfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and therefore the infallibility of Scripture must be universall, and not confined within
compasse of points fundamentall.</p>
               <p>15 I answere: For the thing it selfe it is very true, that if I doubt of any one parcell of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
received for such, I may doubt of all: and thence by the same parity I inferre, that if we did
doubt of the Churches infallibility in some points, we could not believe her in any one, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not in propounding <hi>Canonicall</hi> Bookes, of any other points fundamentall, or not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall;
which thing being most absurd, and withall most impious, we must take away the
ground thereof, and believe that she cannot erre in any point great or small: and so this reply doth
much more strengthen what we intend to prove. Yet I adde, that Protestants cannot make use
of this reply with any good coherence to this their distinction, and some other doctrines which
they defend. Por if D. <hi>Potter</hi> can tell what points in particular be fundamentall (as in his 7. <hi>Sect.</hi>
he pretendeth) then he may be sure, that whensoever he meetes with such points in Scripture, in
them it is infallibly <hi>true,</hi> although it might erre in others: and not only <hi>true</hi> but <hi>cleere,</hi> because
Protestants teach, that in matters necessary to Salvation, the Scripture is so cleere, that all such
necessary truths are either manifestly contained therein, or may be cleerely deduced from it,
Which Doctrines being put together, to wit: That Scriptures cannot erre in points fundamentall;
that they cleerely containe all such points; and that they can tell what points in particular be such,
I mean fundamentall; it is manifest, that it is sufficient for Salvation, that Scripture be infallible
only in points fundamentall. For supposing these doctrines of theirs to be true, they may be sure
to find in Scripture all points necessary to Salvation, although it were fallible in other points of
lesse moment. Neyther will they be able to avoid this impiety against holy Scripture, till they
renounce their other doctrines. and in particular, till they believe that Christs promise to his
Church, are not limited to points fundamentall.</p>
               <p>16 Besides, from the fallibility of Christs Catholique Church in some points, it followeth,
that no true Protestant earned, or unlearned, doth or can with assurance believe the universall
Church in any one point of doctrine. Not in points of lesser moment, which they call <hi>not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall;</hi>
because they believe that in such points she may erre. Not in <hi>fundamentalls;</hi> because
they must know what points be fundamentall, before they goe to learn of her, least otherwise they
be rather deluded, then instructed; in regard that her certain, and infallible direction extends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to points fundamentall. Now, if before they addresse themselves to the Church, they must
know what points are fundamentall, they learn not of her, but will be as fit to teach, as to be
taught by her: How then are all Christians so often, so seriously, upon so dreadfull menaces, by
Fathers, Scriptures, and our blessed Saviour himselfe, counselled and commanded to seeke, to hear,
to obey the Church? <hi>S. Austine</hi> was of a very different mind from Protestants: <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>the</hi>

Christ declareth to speak the truth.</hi> But it seemes D. <hi>Potter</hi> is of opinion that this doctrine about
not rebaptizing such as were baptized by Heretiques, is no necessary point of faith, nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
an heresie: wherein he contradicteth S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> from whom we haue now heard, that
what the Church teacheth, is truly said to be taught by Scripture; and consequently to deny this
particular point, delivered by the Church, is to oppose Scripture it selfe. Yet if he will needs hold,
that this point is not fundamentall, we must conclude out of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> (as we did concerning
the baptizing of Children) that the infallibility of the Church reacheth to points not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
The same Father in another place, concerning this very question of the validity of Baptisme
conferred by Heretiques, saith: <hi>The</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">De Bapt. cont. Donat. lib. 5. cap. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostles indeed haue prescribed nothing of this, but this
Custome ought to be believed to be originally taken from their tradition, as there are many things
that the universall Church observeth which are therefore with good reason believed to haue been
commanded by the Apostles, although they be not written.</hi> No lesse cleer is <hi>S. Chrysoslome</hi> for the
infallibility of the Traditions of the Church. For treating these words (2. <hi>Thess. 2. Stand, &amp; hold
the Traditions which you haue learned whether by speech or by Epistle</hi>) saith: <hi>Hence it is</hi>

                  <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that they delivered not all things by letter, but many things also without writing, and these
also are worthy of beliefe. Let us therefore account the tradition of the Church to be worthy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.
It is a Tradition: Seek no more.</hi> Which words are so plainly against Protestants, that <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
is as plaine with <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> saying: I <hi>answer</hi>

                  <hi>that this is an inconsiderate speech, and
unworthy so great a Father.</hi> But let us conclude with <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> that the Church cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue

               <p>17 And as I haue proved that Protestants, according to their grounds, cannot yeeld infallibls
assent to the Church in any one point: so by the same reason I prove, that they cannot rely upon
Scripture it selfe in any one point of faith. Not in points of lesser moment (or not fundamentall)
because in such points the Catholique Church, (according to D. <hi>Potter</hi>) and much more any
Protestant may erre, and thinke it is contained in Scripture, when it is not. Not in points funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
because they must first know what points be fundamentall, before they can bee assured.
that they cannot erre in understanding the Scripture, and consequently independantly of Scripture,
they must foreknow all fundamentall points of faith: and therefore they doe not indeed rely upon
Scripture, either for fundamentall, or not fundamentall points.</p>
               <p>18 Besides, I mainly urge D. <hi>Potter,</hi> and other Protestants, that they tell us of certain points
which they call fundamentall, and we cannot wrest from them a list in particular of such points,
without which no man can tell whether or no he erre in points fundamentall, and be capable of
salvation. And which is most lamentable, insteed of giving us such a Catalogue, they fall to wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle

What times doe we behold? If one may be a member of the true Church, and yet deny the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

or rather are we not worse, then eyther of them? If they who deny our Saviours divinity might
be accounted the Church of God, how will they deny that favour to those ancient Heretiques,
who denied our Saviours true humanity? and so the totall deniall of Christ will not exclude one
from being a member of the true Church. S. <hi>Hilary</hi>

And in another place<note n="w" place="margin">Pag. 253.</note> he sheweth so much good liking of this doctrine, that he explicateth and

in a little Book in Latine intituled, <hi>Dissertatio de pace &amp; concordia Ecclesiae,</hi> endeavoureth

teach the contrary, which could not happen if they could agree what be fundamentall points. You

And yet many Protestants are so farre from holding that Doctrine to be a fundamentall errour,

which although it were true, yet you see it serves not to bring you to a particular knowledge, &amp;
agreement in such points. And no wonder. For (besides what I haue said already in the begining
of this Chapter, and am to deliver more at large in the next) after so much labour and spent paper
to prove that the <hi>Creed</hi> containes all fundamentall points, you conclude: <hi>It remaines</hi>

the contrary may <hi>remain very probable,</hi> and so all remain as full of uncertainty, as before. The
whole <hi>Rule,</hi> say you, &amp; the sole <hi>Iudge</hi> of your faith, must be Scripture. Scripture doth indeed deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
divine Truths, but seldome doth qualify them, or declare whether they be, or be not, absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to salvation. You fall<note n="b" place="margin">P. 215.</note> heavy upon <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> because he demands a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Catalogue of fundamentall points, which yet you are obliged in conscience to doe, if you be
able. For without such a Catalogue, no man can be assured whether or no, he haue faith sufficient
to Salvation. And therefore take it not in ill part, if we againe and againe demand such a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.
And that you may see we proceed fairely, I will performe, on our behalfe, what we request
of you, and doe here deliver a Catalogue, wherein are comprized all points by us taught to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, in these words. <hi>We are obliged, under paine of damnation, to believe whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Catholique visible Church of Christ proposeth, as revealed by Almighty God.</hi> If any be of
another minde, all Catholiques denounce him to be no Catholique. But enough of this. And I go
forward with the Infallibility of the Church in all points.</p>
               <p>20 For, euen out of your own doctrine, that the Church cannot erre in points necessary to
salvation, any wise man will inferre, that it behoves all, who haue care of their soules, not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
her in any one point. 1. Because they are assured, that although her doctrine proved not to
be true in some point, yet even according to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> the errour cannot be fundamentall, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiue
of faith, and salvation: neither can they be accused of any least imprudence in erring (if
it were possible) with the universall Church. Secondly, since she is, under paine of eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be believed, and obeyed in some things, wherein confessedly she is endued with infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
I cannot in wisedome suspect her credit in matters of lesse moment. For who would trust ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in matters of highest consequence, and be affraid to rely on him in things of lesse moment?
Thirdly, since (as I said) we are undoubtedly obliged not to forsake her in the chiefest, or funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
points, and that there is no Rule to know precisely what, and how many those fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
points be; I cannot without hazard of my soule, leaue her in any one point, least perhaps that
point, or points wherein I forsake her, proue indeed to be fundamentall, and necessary to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Fourthly, that visible Church which cannot erre in points fundamentall, doth without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
propound all her Definitions concerning matters of faith to be believed under Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's
or Curses, esteeming all those who resist, to be deservedly cast out of her Communion, and
holding it a point necessary to salvation, that we believe she cannot erre: wherein if she speak true,
then to deny any one point in <hi>particular,</hi> which she defineth, or to affirm in <hi>generall,</hi> that she may
erre, puts a man into state of damnation. Whereas to belieue her in such points as are not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to salvation, cannot endanger salvation; and likewise to remain in her Communion, can bring
no great harme, because she cannot maintain any damnable errour, or practise: but to be divided
from her (she being Christs Catholique Church) is most certainly damnable. Fifthly, the true
Church, being in lawfull, and certain possession of Superiority and Power, to command and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Obedience, from all Christians in some things; I cannot without grievous sinne withdraw
my obedience in any one, unlesse I evidently know, that the thing commanded comes not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compasse of those things to which her Power extendeth. And who can better inform me,
how far God's Church can proceed, then Gods Church her selfe? Or to what Doctour can the
Children and Schollers, with greater reason, and more security, fly for direction, then to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and appointed <hi>Teacher</hi> of all Christians? In following her, I shall sooner be excused, then
incleaving to any particular S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct, or Person, teaching, or applying Scriptures against her doctrine,
or interpretation. Sixtly, the fearfull examples of innumerable persons who forsaking the
Church upon pretence of her errors, haue failed, even in fundamentall points, and suffered ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of their Salvation, ought to deter all Christians, from opposing her in any one doctrine, or
practises as (to omit other, both ancient and modern heresies) we see that divers chiefe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
pretending to reform the corruptions of the Church, are come to affirm, that for many Ages
she erred to death, and wholy perished; which D. <hi>Potter,</hi> cannot deny to be a fundamentall Errour
against that Article of our Creed, <hi>I believe the Catholique Church,</hi> as he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

because they confined the universall Church within <hi>Africa,</hi> or some other smal tract of soile.
Least therefore I may fall into some fundamentall errour, it is most safe for me to belieue all the
Decrees of that Church, which cannot err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fundamentally: especially if we adde; That according
to the Doctrine of Catholique Divines, one errour in faith, whether it be for the matter it selfe,
great or small, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stroies faith, as is shewed in <hi>Charity Mistaken;</hi> and consequently to accuse the
Church of any one Errour, is to affirm, that she lost all faith, and erred damnably: which very say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is damnable, because it leaues Christ no visible Church on earth.</p>
               <p>21 To all these arguments I adde this demonstration: D. <hi>Potter</hi> teacheth, that <hi>there neither

himselfe,</hi> But if the Church of Christ can erre in some points of faith, men not only may, but must
forsake her in those, (unlesse D. <hi>Potter</hi> will haue them to believe one thing, and professe another:)
and if such errours, and corruptions should fall out to be about the Churches Liturgy, publique
Service, administration of Sacraments, and the like; they who perceive such errours, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
leaue her externall Communion. And therefore if once we grant the Church may erre, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
followeth that men may, and ought to forsake her (which is against D. <hi>Potters</hi> own words,) or
else they are inexcusable who left the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, under pretence of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
which they grant, not to be fundumentall. And if D. <hi>Potter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> think good to answer this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he must remember his own doctrine to be, that even the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church may erre in
points not fundamentall.</p>
               <p>22 Another argument for the universall Infallibility of the Church, I take out of D. <hi>Potters</hi>
own words. <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>we</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 97.</note> 
                  <hi>did not dissent in some opinions from the present Roman Church,
we could not agree with the Church truly Catholique.</hi> These words cannot be true, unlesse he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
that the <hi>Church truly Catholique,</hi> cannot erre in points not fundamentall. For if she may
erre in such points, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which he affirmeth to erre only in points <hi>not fundamentall,</hi>
may agree with the <hi>Church truly Catholique,</hi> if she likewise may erre in points <hi>not fundamentall.</hi>
Therefore either he must acknowledge a plain contradiction in his own words, or else must grant
that the <hi>Church truly Catholique</hi> cannot erre in points <hi>not fundamentall,</hi> which is what we inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to proue.</p>
               <p>23 If <hi>Words</hi> cannot perswade you, that in all Controversies you must rely upon the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church; at least yeeld your assent to <hi>Deeds.</hi> Hitherto I haue produced Arguments
drawn, as it were, <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> from the Wisdome, and Goodnesse of God, who cannot faile to
haue left some infallible meanes to determine Controversies, which, as we haue proved, can be no
other, except a Visible Church, infallible in all her Definitions. But because both Catholiques and
Protestants, receive holy Scripture, we may thence also proue the infallibility of the Church in all
matters which concern Faith and Religion. Our Saviour speaketh clearly: <hi>The gates of Hell</hi>

                  <hi>of Errour.</hi> All which words seem cleerly
enough to proue, that the Church is universally infallible, without which, unity of faith could not
be conserved against <hi>every winde of Doctrine:</hi> And yet <hi>Doctor Potter</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Pag. 151. 153.</note> limits these promises
and priviledges to <hi>fundamentall</hi> points, in which he grants the Church cannot erre. I urge the
words of Scripture, which are universall, and doe not mention any such restraint. I alleadge that
most reasonable, and receaved Rule, that Scripture is to be understood literally, as it soundeth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
some manifest absurdity force us to the contrary. But all will not serue, to accord our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
interpretations. In the mean time divers of <hi>Doctor Potters</hi> Brethren step in, and reject his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
as over large, and somewhat tasting of Papistry: And therefore they restrain the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Texts, either to the Infallibility which the Apostles, and other sacred Writers had in penning
of Scripture: or else to the <hi>invisible</hi> Church of the Elect; and to them, not absolutely, but with a
double restriction, that they shall not fall <hi>damnably,</hi> and <hi>finally;</hi> and other men haue as much right
as these, to interpose their opinion, and interpretation. Behold we are three at debate about the
selfe same words of Scripture: We conferre divers places and Text: We consult the Originalls:
We examine Translations. We endeavour to pray heartily: We professe to speak sincerely; To
seek nothing but truth and salvation of our own soules, and that of our Neighbours; and finally
we use all those meanes, which by Protestants themselues are prescribed for finding out the true
meaning of Scripture: Neverthelesse we neither doe, or haue any possible meanes to agree, as long
as we are left to our selues; and when we should chance to be agreed, the doubt would still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
whether the thing it selfe be a <hi>fundamentall</hi> point or no: And yet it were great impiety to
imagine that God, the Lover of soules, hath left no certaine infallible meanes; to decide both this,
and all other differences arising about the interpretation of Scripture, or upon any other occasion.
Our remedy therefore in these contentions must be, to consult, and heare God's Visible Church,
with submissiue acknowledgment of her Power, and Infallibility in whatsoever she proposeth as a
revealed truth: according to that divine advice of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in these words. <hi>If at length</hi>

               <p>2 <hi>If you obiect to them discords in matter of faith without any

all things necessary to salvation: and their mutuall suffering one

there delivered. And for their agreement in all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of Religion, either they haue meanes to agree about them, or not:
If you say they haue, why did you before deny it? If they haue not
meanes; why doe you finde fault with them, for not agreeing?</p>
               <p>3 You will say, that their fault is, that by <hi>remaining Protestants
they exclude themselues from the meanes of agreement, which you haue,</hi>
and which by submission to your Church they might haue also. But
if you haue meanes of agreement, the more shame for you that you still
disagree. For who, I pray, is more inexcusably guilty, for the omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any duty; they that either haue no meanes to doe it, or else
know of none they haue, which puts them in the same case as if they
had none: or they which professe to haue an easie and expedite means
to doe it, and yet still leaue it undone? <hi>If you had been blind</hi> (saith our
<hi>Saviour</hi> to the <hi>Pharisees) you had had no sinne, but now you say you see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
therefore your sinne remaineth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 If you say, you <hi>doe agree in matters of Faith,</hi> I say this is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous:
for you define matters of faith to be those wherein you agree.
So that to say, you agree in <hi>matters of faith,</hi> is to say, you agree in those
things wherein you doe agree. And do not Protestants doe so likewise?
Doe not they agree in those things, wherein they doe agree?</p>
               <p>5 But <hi>you are all agreed that only those things wherein you doe agree
are matters of faith.</hi> And Protestants if they were wise, would doe so
too. Sure I am they haue reason enough to doe so: seeing all of them
agree with explicite faith in all those things, which are plainly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
delivered in Scripture, that is, in all which God hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7615:82"/>
revealed: and with an implicite faith, in that sense of the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which God intended whatsoever it was. Secondly, That which
you pretend is false; for else, why doe some of you hold it against faith,
to take or allow the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> others as learned and honest
as they, that it is against Faith and unlawfull to refuse it and allow
the refusing of it? Why doe some of you hold, that it is <hi>de Fide,</hi> that
the Pope is Head of the Church by divine Law, others the contrary?
Some hold it de <hi>Fide,</hi> that the blessed Virgin was freefrom Actuall
sinne, others that it is not so. Some, that the Popes Indirect power over
Princes in Temporalties is <hi>de Fide,</hi> Others the contrary. Some, that it is
Vniversall Tradition, and consequently <hi>de Fide,</hi> that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>
was conceived in originall sinne, others the contrary.</p>
               <p>6 But what shall we say now, if you be not agreed touching your
pretended meanes of agreement, how then can you pretend to Vnity
either Actuall or Potentiall more then Protestants may? Some of you
say, the Pope alone without a Councell may determine all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies:
But others deny it. Some, that a Generall Councell without a
Pope may doe so: Others deny this. Some, Both in conjunction are
infallible determiners: Others againe deny this. Lastly, some among
you, hold the Acceptation of the decrees of Councells by the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Church to be the only way to decide Controversies: which others
deny, by denying the Church to be Infallible. And indeed what way
of ending Controversies can this be, when either part may pretend,
that they are part of the Church, and they receiue not the decree, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole Church hath not received it?</p>
               <p>7 Againe, Meanes of agreeing differences are either Rationall and
well grounded and of Gods appointment, or voluntary and taken up
at the pleasure of men. Meanes of the former nature, we say, you haue
as little as we. For where hath God appointed, that the Pope, or a
Councell, or a Councell confirm'd by the Pope, or that Society of
Christians which adhere to him, shall be the <hi>Infallible Iudge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.</hi>
I desire you to shew any one of these Assertions plainely set
down in Scripture, (as in all Reason a thing of this nature should be) or
at least delivered with a full consent of Fathers, or at least taught in
plain tearmes by any one Father for foure hundred yeares after <hi>Christ.</hi>
And if you cannot doe this (as I am sure you cannot) and yet will still
be obtruding your selues upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us for our Iudges, who will not cry out,
<hi>—perisse frontem de rebus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8 But then for meanes of the other kinde, such as yours are, we
haue great abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of them. For besides all the waies which you haue
devised, which we may make use of when wee please, we haue a great
many more, which you yet haue never thought of, for which we haue
as good colour out of Scripture as you haue for yours. For first, wee
could if we would, try it by Lots, whose doctrine is true, and whose
false. And you know it is written,<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 16. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lot is cast into the lap, but the

                  <hi>If any man want wisdome

Lastly, we might referre it to the Iewes, for without all doubt of
them it is written,<note n="p" place="margin">Isay. 59. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>my spirit that is in thee &amp;c.</hi> All these meanes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
whereof not any one but hath as much probability from
Scripture, as that which you obtrude upon us, offer themselves upon
a suddain to me: happily many more might be thought on, if we had
time, but these are enough to shew, that would we make use of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and devised meanes to determine differences, we had them in
great abundance. And if you say these would faile us, and contradict
themselves; so, as we pretend, have yours. There have been Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Popes: Councells against Councells: Councells confirmed by
Popes, against Councells confirmed by Popes: Lastly the Church of
some Ages against the Church of other Ages.</p>
               <p>9 Lastly, whereas you find fault, <hi>That Protestants upbraided with
their discords, answer that they differ only in points not Fundamentall,</hi>
I desire you tell me whether they doe so, or doe not so; If they doe so,
I hope you will not find fault with the Answer: If you say they doe
not so, but in points Fundamentall also; then they are not members of
the same Church one with another, no more then with you: And
therefore why should you object to any of them, their differences
from each other, any more then to your selves, their more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
differences from you?</p>
               <p>10 But <hi>they are convinc'd sometimes even by their own confessions,
that the Ancient Fathers taught divers points of Popery: and then they
reply, those Fathers may neverthelesse be saved, because those errors were
not Fundamentall.</hi> And may not you also be convinc'd by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of your own men, that the Fathers taught divers points held by
Protestants against the Church of Rome, and divers against Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
and the Church of Rome? Doe not your Purging Indexes,
clip the tongues, and seal up the lips of a great many for such confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7615:83"/>
And is not the above cited confession of your <hi>Doway</hi> Divines,
plain and full to the same purpose? And doe not you also, as freely as
we, charge the Fathers with errors, &amp; yet say they were saved? Now
what else doe we understand by an <hi>unfundamentall</hi> error, but such
a one with which a man may possibly be saved? So that still you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in condemning others for your own faults, and urging arguments
against us, which returne more strongly upon your selves.</p>
               <p>11 But your will is, <hi>we should remember that Christ must alwaies
have a visible Church.</hi> Ans. Your pleasure shall be obeyed, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you will not forget, that there is a difference between perpetuall
Visibility, and perpetuall Purity. As for the answere, which you make
for us, true it is, we believe the <hi>Catholique Church cannot perish,</hi> yet
that she may, and did erre in points not Fundamentall; and that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
were oblig'd to forsake these errors of the Church, as they
did, though not the Church for her errors, for that they did not, but
continued still members of the Church. For it is not all one (though
you perpetually confound them) <hi>to forsake the errors of the Church,</hi>
and to <hi>forsake the Church:</hi> or to <hi>forsake the Church in her Errors,</hi> and
<hi>simply to forsake the Church:</hi> No more then it is for me to renounce
my Brothers or my Friends Vices or Errors, and to renounce my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or my Friend. The Former then was done by Protestants, the
latter was not done. Nay not only not from the Catholique, but not
so much as from the Roman, did they seperate <hi>per omnia,</hi> but only in
those practises which they conceived superstitious or impious. If you
would at this time propose a forme of Liturgy, which both Sides
hold lawfull, and then they would not joyne with you in this Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
you might have some colour then to say, they renounce your
communion absolutely. But as things are now ordered, they cannot
joyne with you in prayers, but they must partake with you in unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
practises, and for this reason, they (<hi>not absolutely, but thus farre</hi>)
separate from your communion. And this, I say, they were obliged to
doe under pain of damnation. <hi>Not as if it were damnable to hold an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
not damnable,</hi> but because it is damnable outwardly to professe &amp;
maintaine it, and to joyn with others in the practise of it, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
they did not hold it. Now had they continued in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
that they must have done, <hi>vid.</hi> have professed to believe and
externally practis'd your Errors, whereof they were convinced that
they were Errors: which, though the matters of the Errors had been
not necessary, but only profitable, whether it had not been damnable
dissimulation and hypocrisy, I leave it to you to judge. You your selfe
tell us within two pages after this, <hi>that you are obliged never to speak
any one least lye against your knowledge,</hi> §. 2. now what is this but to
live in a perpetuall lye?</p>
               <p>12 As for that which in the next place you seeme so to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at, That <hi>both Catholiques and Protestants, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of Protestants, may bee saved in their severall professions,
because forsooth, we both agree in all Fundamentall points:</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were,
this proposition so crudely set down, as you have here set
it down, I know no Protestant will justify. For you seeme to make
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7615:83"/>
them teach, that it is an indifferent thing, for the attainment of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether a man believe the Truth or the Falshood; and that they
care not in whether of these Religions a man live or dye, so he dye in
either of them: whereas all that they say is this, That those amongst
you which want meanes to find the Truth and so dye in error, or use
the best meanes they can with industry, and without partiality to find
the truth, and yet dye in error, these men, thus qualified, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these errors may be saved. Secondly for those that have
meanes to find the Truth, and will not use them, they conceive, though
their case be dangerous, yet if they dye with a generall repentance for
all their sinnes, knowne and unknowne, their Salvation is not despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
The Truths which they hold, of Faith in Christ, and Repentance,
being as it were an antidote against their errors, and their negligence
in seeking the Truth. Especially seeing by confession of both sides we
agree in much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is simply, &amp; indispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sably necessary to salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>13 <hi>But seeing we make such various use of this distinction, is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously
strange that we will never be induc'd to give in a particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
what points be fundamentall?</hi> And why I pray is it so <hi>prodigiously
strange</hi> that we give no answer to an unreasonable demand? God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath told us,<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 12. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>That where much is given, much shall be required;
where litle is given, litle shall be required.</hi> To Infants, Deafe-men, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
nothing for ought wee knowe, is given, and if it bee so, of
them <hi>nothing</hi> shall be required. Others perhaps may have meanes only
given them to beleive,<note n="b" place="margin">6. Heb. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>That God is, and that he is a rewarder of them
that seeke him;</hi> and to whom thus much only is given, to them it shall
not be damnable, that they beleive but only thus much. Which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
is very manifest from the Apostle, in the <hi>Epist. to the Heb:</hi> where
having first said, <hi>that without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
as his reason, <hi>for whosoever commeth unto God, must beleive that
God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him.</hi> Where in my
opinion, this is plainly intimated, that this is the <hi>minimum quòd sic,</hi>
the lowest degree of Faith, wherewith, in men capable of Faith, God
will be pleased: and that with this lowest degree he will be pleased,
where meanes of rising higher are deficient. Besides, if without this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
<hi>that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him,</hi> God
will not be pleased, then his will is that we should beleive it. Now his
will it cannot be, that we should beleive a falshood, It must be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
true, that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him. Now it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that they which never heard of Christ, may seek God, therefore
it is true that even they shall please him, and be rewarded by him; I say
rewarded, not with bringing them immediatly to salvation without
Christ, but with bringing them according to his good pleasure, first,
to faith in Christ, and so to salvation. To which beleife the story of
<hi>Cornelius</hi> in the 10. <hi>chap. of the Acts</hi> of the Apostles, and S. <hi>Peter's</hi>
words to him, are to me a great inducement. For first it is evident he
beleeved not in Christ, but was a meer Gentile, &amp; one that knew not but
men might be worshipped, and yet we are assured <hi>that his prayers and
almes</hi> (even while he was in that state) <hi>came up for a memoriall before
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7615:84"/>
God; That his prayer was heard, and his Almes had in remembrance in the
sight of God.</hi> v. 4. that upon his, <hi>Then fearing God and working righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>
(such as it was) <hi>he was accepted with God.</hi> But how accepted?
Not to be brought immediatly to salvation, but to be promoted to a
higher degree of the knowledge of Gods will: For so it is in the 4. &amp; 5.
v. <hi>Call for Simon whose sirname is Peter, he shall tell thee what thou oughtest
to doe,</hi> and at the 33. vers. <hi>We are all here present before God, to heare all
things that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded thee of God.</hi> So that though even in his Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisme,
he was accepted in his present state, yet if he had continued in it,
&amp; refused to beleive in Christ after the sufficient revelation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
to him, and Gods will to have him beleive it, he that was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before, would not have continued accepted still; for then that
condemnation had come upon him, <hi>that light was come unto him, and
he loved darknesse more then light.</hi> So that (to proceed a step farther)
to whom faith in Christ is sufficiently propounded, as necessary to
Salvation, to them it is simply necessary &amp; Fundamentall to believe in
Christ, that is, to expect remission of sinnes and Salvation from him,
upon the performance of the conditions he requires; among which
conditions one is, that we believe what he has revealed, when it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
declared, to have been revealed by him: For by doing so, <hi>we
set to our seale, that God is true, and that Christ was sent by him.</hi> Now
that may be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declared to one (all things considered,) which,
(all things considered) to another is not sufficiently declared: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that may be Fundamentall and necessary to one, which to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
is not so. Which variety of circumstances, makes it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to set down an exact Catalogue of Fundamentalls, and proves your
request as reasonable, as if you should desire us (according to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
to make a coat to fit the Moon in all her changes; or to giue you
a garment that will fit all statures; Or to make you a dyall to serve all
meridians; or to designe particularly, what provision will serve an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for a year: whereas there may be an army of ten thousand, there
may be of 100000. And therefore without seting downe a catalogue
of Fundamentalls in particular (because none that can be given, can u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally
serve for all men, God requiring more of them to whom he
gives more, and lesse of them to whom he gives lesse) we must content
our selves by a generall description to tell you what is Fundamentall.
And to warrant us in doing so, we have your own example §. 19.
where being engaged to giue us a catalogue of Fundamentalls, in stead
thereof you tell us only in generall, <hi>that all is fundamentall, and not to
be disbeleeved under pain of damnation, which the Church hath defin'd.</hi>
As you therefore think it enough to say in generall, <hi>that all is Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
which the Church has defined,</hi> without setting down in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
a compleat-Catalogue of all things, which in any age the Church
has defined (which I believe you will not undertake to doe, and if you
doe, it will be contradicted by your Fellowes:) So in reason you might
think it enough for us also to say in generall, <hi>that it is sufficient for any
mans salvation, to believe that the Scripture is true, and containes all
things necessary for salvation; and to doe his best endeavour to find and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7615:84"/>
believe the true sense of it:</hi> without delivering any particular catalogue
of the Fundamentalls of Faith.</p>
               <p>14 Neither <hi>doth the want of such a catalogue</hi> leave us in such a
<hi>perplexed uncertainty</hi> as you pretend. For though perhaps we cannot
exactly distinguish in the Scripture, what <hi>is revealed because it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi>
from what is <hi>necessary consequently and accidentally, meerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is revealed:</hi> yet we are sure enough, that all that is necessary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way is there, and therefore in believing all that is there, we are sure
to believe all that is necessary. And if we erre from the true and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
sense of some, nay of many obscure or ambiguous texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet we may be sure enough, that we erre not damnably: because,
if we doe indeed desire and endeavour to finde the Truth, we may be
sure we doe so, and as sure that it cannot consist with the revealed
goodnesse of God, to damne him for error, that desires and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to find the Truth.</p>
               <p>15 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 2. The effect of this Paragraph (for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
us) is this, that <hi>for any man to deny belief to any one thing be it
great or small known by him, to be revealed by almighty God for a truth,
is in effect to charge God with falshood: for it is to say that God affirmes
that to be Truth, which he either knowes to be not a Truth, or which he
doth not know to be a Truth: and therefore without all controversy this
is a damnable sinne.</hi> To this I subscribe with hand and heart: adding
withall, that not only he which knowes, but he which believes (nay
though it be erroneously) any thing to be revealed by God, and yet
will not believe it, nor assent unto it, is in the same case, and commits
the same sinne of derogation from Gods most perfect and pure Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity.</p>
               <p>16 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 3. I said purposely (<hi>known by himselfe, and belieues
himselfe</hi>) For as, without any disparagement of a mans honesty, I may
believe something to be false, which he affirmes, of his certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be true, provided I neither know nor believe that he has so
affirmed: So without any the least dishonour to Gods eternall never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing
veracity, I may doubt of, or deny some truth revealed by him,
if I neither know nor believe it to be revealed by him.</p>
               <p>17 Seeing therefore the crime of calling Gods veracity into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and consequently (according to your grounds) of erring Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
is chargeable upon those only, that <hi>believe the contrary</hi> of
any one <hi>point known (not by others but themselves) to be testified by
God:</hi> I cannot but fear (though I hope otherwise) that your heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
you of a great calumny and egregious sophistry, in imputing
fundamentall, and damnable error to disagreeing Protestans; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
forsooth, <hi>some of them disbelieve, and directly wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
oppose, what others doe believe to be testified by the word of God.</hi>
The sophistry of your discourse will be apparent, if it be contrived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a syllogisme: Thus therefore in effect you argue;</p>
               <p>Whosoever disbelieves any thing known by himselfe to be
revealed by God, imputes falshood to God, and therefore errs
fundamentally.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:7615:85"/>
But Some Protestants disbelieve these things, which Others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be testified by God;</p>
               <p>Therefore they impute falshood to God, and erre Fundamentally.</p>
               <p>Neither can you with any colour pretend, that in these words
<hi>known to be testified by God,</hi> you meant, <hi>not by himselfe, but by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
Seeing he only in fact affirmes, that God does deceive or is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
who denyes some things which himselfe knowes or believes to
be revealed by God, as before I have demonstrated. For otherwise
if I should deny beleefe to some which God had revealed secretly to
such a man as I had never heard of, I should be guilty of calling
Gods veracity into Question, which is euidently false. Besides, how
can it be avoided, but the Iesuits and Dominicans, the Dominicans
and Franciscans must upon this ground differ Fundamentally, and one
of them erre damnably, seeing the one of them disbelieves; and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
opposes, what the others believe to be the word of God?</p>
               <p>18 Whereas you say that <hi>the difference among Protestants consists
not in this, that some believe some points of which others are ignorant,
or not bound expresly to know:</hi> I would gladly know, whether you
speak of Protestants differing <hi>in profession only, or in opinion also.</hi>
If the first, why doe you say presently after, <hi>that some disbelieve, what
others of them believe?</hi> If they differ in opinion, then sure they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the truth of each other's opinions: it being impossible and
contradictious, that a man should know one thing to be true, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the contrary, or know it and not believe it. And if they doe not
know the truth of each others opinions, then, I hope, you will grant
they are ignorant of it. If your meaning were, they <hi>were not ignorant,
that each other held these Opinions, or of the sense of the opinions which
they held:</hi> I Answere, this is nothing to the convincing of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
of the truth of them, and these remaining unconvinced of
the truth of them, they are excusable if they doe not believe.</p>
               <p>9 But <hi>ignorance of what we are expresly bound to know, is it selfe a
fault, and therefore cannot be an excuse:</hi> and therefore if you could shew
the Protestants differ in those points, the truth whereof (which can be
but one) they were bound expresly to know, I should easily yeeld
that one side must of necessity be in a mortall crime. But for want of
proofe of this, you content your selfe only to say it; and therefore
I also might be contented only to deny it, yet I will not, but give a
reason for my deniall. And my reason is, because our obligation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
to know any divine Truth, must arise from Gods manifest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
of it, and his revealing unto us that he has revealed it, and
that his will is, we should believe it: Now in the points controverted
among Protestants, he hath not so dealt with us, therefore he hath not
laid any such obligation upon us. The major of this syllogisme is
evident, and therefore I will not stand to prove it. The minor also
will be evident to him that considers, that in all the Controversies of
Protestants, there is a seeming conflict of Scripture with Scripture,
Reason with Reason, Authority with Authority: which how it can
consist with the manifest revealing of the truth of either Side, I cannot
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7615:85"/>
well understand. Besides, though we grant that Scripture, Reason, and
Authority, were all on one side, and the apparences of the other side all
answerable: yet if we consider the strange power that education and
prejudices instilled by it, haue over even excellent understandings, wee
may well imagine, that many truths which in themselues are revealed
plainly enough, are yet to such or such a man, prepossest with contrary
opinions, not revealed plainly. Neither doubt I but God, who knows
whereof we are made, and what passions we are subject unto, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
such infirmities, and not enter into judgement with us for
those things, which, all things considered, were unavoidable.</p>
               <p>20 But till Fundamentalls (<hi>say you</hi>) be sufficiently proposed (as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by God) it is not against Faith to reject them; or rather it is not
possible prudently to belieue them: And points unfundamentall being thus
sufficiently proposed as divine Truths, may not be denied; Therefore you
conclude there is no difference between them: <hi>Ans. A Circumstantiall
point, may by accident become Fundamentall, because it may bee so
proposed that the deniall of it, will draw after it the deniall of this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
truth,</hi> that all which God saies is true. <hi>Notwithstanding in
themselues there is a main difference between them:</hi> Points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
being those onely which are revealed by God, and commanded to bee
preacht to all, and believed by all. Points circumstantiall being such, as
though God hath revealed them, yet the Pastors of the Church are not
bound under paine of damnation particularly to teach them unto all men
every where, and the people may be securely ignorant of them.</p>
               <p>21 You say, <hi>Not erring in points Fundamentall, is not sufficient for
the preservation of the Church; because any Errour maintained by it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Gods revelation is destructive.</hi> I answer. If you mean against
Gods Revelation known by the Church to be so, it is true; but impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the Church should doe so, for <hi>ipso Facto</hi> in doing it, it were a
Church no longer. But if you mean against some Revelation, which
the Church by errour thinks to bee no Revelation, it is false. The
Church may ignorantly disbelieue such a Revelation, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
a Church; which thus I proue. That the Gospell was to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to all Nations, was a Truth revealed before our Saviours Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in these words, <hi>Goe and teach all Nations. Mat.</hi> 29. 19. Yet through
prejudice or inadvertence, or some other cause, the Church disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it; as it is apparent out of the 11. and 12. Chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> untill the
conversion of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and yet was still a Church. Therefore to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belieue
some divine Revelation, not knowing it to be so, is not destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of salvation, or of the being of the Church. Again, It is a plaine
Revelation of God, that<note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 28.</note> the Sacrament of the Eucharist <hi>should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
in both kindes:</hi> and<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 15. 16. 26.</note> that the publique Hymnes and <hi>Prayers
of the Church should be in such a language as is most for edification;</hi> yet
these Revelations the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not seeing, by reason of the
veile before their eyes, their Churches supposed infallibility, I hope
the deniall of them shall not be laid to their charge, no otherwise then
as <hi>building hay and stubble on the Foundations, not overthrowing the
Foundation it selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:7615:86"/>
22 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 2. In the beginning of this Paragraph, wee haue this
Argument against this Distinction; <hi>It is enough (by D. Potters confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to belieue some things negatiuely, i. e. not to deny them;</hi> Therefore all
deniall of any divine truth excludes Salvation. As if you should say:
One Horse is enough for a man to goe a journey: Therefore without
a horse no man can goe a journey. As if some Divine Truthes, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
Those which are plainly revealed, might not be such, as of necessity
were not to be denied: and others for want of sufficient declaration,
deniable without danger. Indeed if D. <hi>Potter</hi> had said there had been
no divine Truth, declared sufficiently or not declared, but must upon
pain of damnation be believed, or at least not denied, then might you
justly haue concluded as you doe: but now, that some may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
and that some may be denied without damnation why they may
not both stand together I doe not yet understand.</p>
               <p>23 In the Remainder you in ferre out of D. <hi>Potters</hi> words, <hi>That all
errours are alike damnable, if the manner of propounding the contrary
Truths be not different:</hi> which for ought I know, all Protestants, and
all that haue sense must grant. Yet I deny your illation from hence,
That <hi>the distinction of points into fundamentall and unfundamentall is
vaine and uneffectuall for the purpose of Protestants.</hi> For though being
alike propos'd as divine truths, they are by accident alike necessary,
yet the reall difference still remaines between them, that they are not
alike necessary to be proposed.</p>
               <p>24 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 5. The next Paragraph, if it be brought out of the clouds,
will I belieue haue in it these Propositions. 1. <hi>Things are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their different natures. 2. The Nature of Faith is taken, not from
the matter believed, for then they that believed different matters should
haue different Faiths, but from the Motive to it. 3. This Motiue is Gods
Revelation. 4. This Revelation is alike for all obiects. 5. Protestants
disagree in things equally revealed by God: Therefore they forsake the
formall motiue of faith: and therefore haue no faith nor unity therein.</hi>
Which is truly a very proper and convenient argument to close up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
weak discourse, wherein both the Propositions are false for matter,
confused and disordered for the forme, and the conclusion utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequent.
First for the second Proposition, who knowes not that
the Essence of all Habits (&amp; therefore of Faith among the rest) is taken
from their Act, and their Object? If the Habit be generall, from the
Act and Object in generall, if the Habit be speciall, from the Act and
Object in speciall. Then for the motiue to a thing, that it cannot be of
the Essence of the thing to which it moues, who can doubt, that
knows that a motiue is an efficient cause: and that the efficient is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
extrinsecall to the effect? For the fourth, that <hi>Gods Revelation
is alike for all objects,</hi> It is ambiguous: and if the sense of it be, that his
Revelation is an equall Motive to induce us to belieue all objects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by him, it is true, but impertinent: If the sense of it be, that all
objects revealed by God are alike (that is, alike plainly and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly)
revealed by him, it is pertinent, but most untrue. Witnesse the
great diversity of Texts of Scripture, whereof some are so plain and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7615:86"/>
evident, that no man of ordinary sense can mistake the sense of them.
Some are so obscure and ambiguous, that to say this or this is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sense of them, were high presumption. For the 5. <hi>Protestants disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in things equally revealed by God!</hi> In themselues perhaps, but not
equally to them: whose understandings by reason of their different
Educations are fashioned, and shaped for the entertainment of various
opinions, and consequently some of them, more enclined to belieue
such a sense of Scripture, others to belieue another; which to say that
God will not take into his consideration in judging mens opinions, is
to disparage his goodnesse. But to what purpose is it, that these things
are equally revealed to both, (as the light is equally revealed to all
blind men,) if they be not fully revealed to either? The sense of this
Scripture, <hi>Why are they then baptiz'd for the dead?</hi> and this, <hi>He shall bee
saved, yet so as by fire,</hi> and a thousand others, is equally revealed to you
and to another interpreter, that is certainly to neither. Hee now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
one sense of them, and you another; and would it not be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
inference, if I should conclude now as you doe; That you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the formall motiue of faith, which is Gods revelation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
loose all faith and unity therein? So likewise the Iesuites and
Dominicans, the Franciscans and Dominicans disagree about things
equa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly revealed by Almighty God: and seeing they doe so, I beseech
you let me understand, why this reason will not exclude them as well
as Protestants <hi>from all faith and unity therein?</hi> Thus you haue fayl'd
of your undertaking in your first part of your Title, and that is a very
ill <hi>omen,</hi> especially in points of so streight mutuall dependance, that
we shall haue but slender performance in your second assumpt. Which
is, <hi>That the Church is infallible in all her Definitions, whether concerning
points Fundamentall, or not Fundamentall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25 <hi>Ad</hi> § 7. &amp; 8. The Reasons in these two paragraphs, as they
were alleaged before, so they were before answered, and thither I
remit the Reader.</p>
               <p>26 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 9. 10. 11. I grant that the Church <hi>cannot without dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
sinne, either deny any thing to be true, which she knowes to be Gods
truth:</hi> or propose <hi>any thing as his truth, which she knowes not to be so.</hi>
But that she may not doe this by ignorance or mistake, and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
damnable sinne, that you should haue proved, but haue not. But,
say you <hi>this excuse cannot serue: for if the Church bee assisted onely for
points fundamentall, she cannot but know that she may erre in points not
fundamentall.</hi> Ans. It does not follow, unlesse you suppose, that the
Church knowes that she is assisted no farther. But if, being assisted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so farre, she yet did conceaue by errour her assistance absolute and
unlimited, or if knowing her assistance restrained to fundamentalls,
she yet conceived by errour, that she should bee guarded, from propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
any thing but what was fundamentall, then the consequence is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
false. <hi>But at least she cannot be certain that she cannot erre, and
therefore cannot be excus'd from headlong and pernicious temerity in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
points not fundamentall, to be believed by Christians as matters of
faith.</hi> Ans. Neither is this deduction worth any thing; unlesse it bee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7615:87"/>
understood of such unfundamentall points, as shee is not warranted to
propose by evident Text of Scripture. Indeed if she propose such, as
<hi>matters of faith certainly true,</hi> she may well be questioned, <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto?</hi>
Shee builds without a foundation, and <hi>saies thus saith the Lord,
when the Lord doth not say so:</hi> which cannot be excus'd from rashnesse
and high presumption; such a presumption, as an Embassadour should
commit, who should say in his Masters name that for which hee hath
no commission. Of the same nature, I say, but of a higher straine: as
much as the King of Heaven, is greater then any earthly King. But
though she may erre in some points not fundamentall, yet may shee
haue certainty enough in proposing others; as for example, these,
<hi>That Abraham begat Isaac,</hi> that S. <hi>Paul had a Cloak,</hi> that <hi>Timothy was
sick;</hi> because these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not Fundamentall. i. e. no essentiall parts of
Christianity, yet are evidently, and undeniably set down in Scripture,
and consequently, may be without all rashnes propos'd by the Church
as certaine divine Revelations. Neither is your Argument concluding
when you say, <hi>If in such things she may be deceived, she must be alwaies
uncertain of all such things.</hi> For my sense may sometimes possibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
me, yet I am certain enough that I see what I see, and feel what I
feel. Our Iudges are not infallible in their judgements, yet are they
certain enough, that they judge aright, and that they proceed according
to the evidence that is given, when they condemne a theef, or a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
to the gallows. A Traveller is not alwaies certain of his way,
but often mistaken: and does it therefore follow that hee can haue no
assurance that Charing crosse is his right way from the Temple to
White-Hall? The ground of your errour here, is your not distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
between Actuall certainty and Absolute infallibility. Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians
are not infallible in their own science: yet they are very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of those things, which they see demonstrated. And Carpenters
are not infallible, yet certain of the straightnesse of those things which
agree with their rule and square. So though the Church be not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
certain, that in all her Definitions, whereof some are about dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and ambiguous matters, she shall proceed according to her Rule,
yet being certain of the infallibility of her rule, and that in this or that
thing she doth manifestly proceed according to it, she may be certaine
of the Truth of some particular decrees, and yet not certain that shee
shall never decree but what is true.</p>
               <p>27 <hi>Ad</hi> § 12. <hi>But if the Church may erre in points not fundamentall,
she may erre in proposing Scripture, and so we cannot bee assur'd whether
she haue not been deceived already.</hi> The Church may erre in her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
or custody of the Canon of Scripture, if you understand by
the Church, any present Church of one denomination, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> example,
the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> or so. Yet haue we sufficient certainty of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not from the bare testimony of any present Church, but from V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
Tradition, of which the testimony of any present Church is
but a little part. So that here you fall into the Fallacy, <hi>à dicto secundum
quid ad dictum simpliciter.</hi> For in effect this is the sense of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Vnlesse the Church be infallible, we can haue no certainty of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7615:87"/>
Scripture from the authority of the Church: Therefore unlesse the
Church be infallible, we can have no certainty here of at all. As if a
man should say; If the vintage of France miscarry, we can have no wine
from France: Therefore if that Vintage miscarry we can have no
Wine at all. And for the incorruption of Scripture, I know no other
rationall assurance we can have of it, then such as we have of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption
of other ancient Bookes, that is, the consent of ancient
Copies: such I mean <hi>for the kind,</hi> though it be farre <hi>greater for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of it.</hi> And if the spirit of God give any man any other assurance
hereof, this is not rationall and discursive, but supernaturall and infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
An assurance it may be to himselfe, but no argument to another.
As for the infallibility of the Church, it is so farre from being a proofe
of the Scriptures incorruption, that no proofe can be pretended for it,
but incorrupted places of Scripture: which yet are as subject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
as any other, and more likely to have been corrupted (if it had
been possible) then any other, and made to speak as they doe, for the
advantage of those men, whose ambition it hath been a long time, to
bring all under their authority. Now then, if any man should prove
the Scriptures uncorrupted, because the Church saies so which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible:
I would demand again touching this very thing, that there is
an infallible Church, seeing it is not of it selfe evident, how shall I be
assured of it? And what can he answer, but that the Scripture saies so
in these and these places? Hereupon I would aske him, how shall I
be assured, that the Scriptures are incorrupted in thse places? seeing it
is possible, and not altogether improbable, that these men, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be thought infallible, when they had the government of all
things in their own hands, may have altered them for their purpose.
If to this he answer again, that the Church is infallible, and therefore
cannot doe so, I hope it would be apparent, that he runs round in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and proves the Scriptures incorruption, by the Churches infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the Churches infallibility by the Scriptures incorruption, and
that is in effect the Churches infallibility, by the Churches infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Scriptures incorruption by the Scriptures incorruption.</p>
               <p>28 Now for your observation, that <hi>some Bookes, which were not
alwaies known to be Canonicall, have been afterwards received for such.
But never any book or syllable defined for Canonicall, was afterwards
questioned or rejected for Apocryphall:</hi> I demand, touching the first
sort, whether they were commended to the Church by the Apostles
as Canonicall or not? If not, seeing the whole faith was preached by
the Apostles to the Church, and seeing after the Apostles, the
Church pretends to no new Revelations, how can it be an Article of
faith to believe them Canonicall? And how can you pretend, that your
Church which makes this an article of faith, is so assisted as not to
propose any thing as a divine truth which is not revealed by God? If
they were, how then is the Church an infallible keeper of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
Scripture, which hath suffered some Bookes of Canonicall Scripture,
to be lost? &amp; others to loose for a long time their being Canonicall, at
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7615:88"/>
least, the necessity of being so esteemed, and afterwards, as it were by
the law of <hi>Post liminium</hi> hath restored their Authority and Canonical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
unto them? If this was delivered by the Apostles to the Church,
the point was sufficiently discussed, and therefore your Churches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to teach it for some ages, as an article of faith, nay degrading
it from the number of articles of faith, and putting it among disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
problems, was surely not very laudable. If it were not revealed by
God to the Apostles, and by the Apostles to the Church, then can it
be no Revelation, and therefore her presumption in proposing it as
such, is inexcusable.</p>
               <p>19 And then for the other part of it, <hi>that never any book or syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
defined for Canonicall, was afterwards question'd or rejected for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphall:</hi>
Certainly it is a bold asseveration, but extreamly false. For
I demand; The Book of <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> and <hi>Wisdome,</hi> the <hi>Epistle of Saint
Iames,</hi> and <hi>to the Heb.</hi> were they by the Apostles appoved for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
or no? If not, with what face dare you approve them, and yet
pretend that all your doctrine is Apostolicall? Especially seeing it is
evident that this point is not deducible by rationall discourse from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other defined by them. If they were approved by them, this I
hope was a sufficient definition: and therefore you were best rub your
forehead hard, and say, that these Books were never questioned. But if
you doe so, then I shall be bold to aske you, what bookes you meant
in saying before, <hi>Some bookes which were not alwaies known to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
have been afterwards received?</hi> Then for the book of <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi>
I hope you will say, it was defin'd for Canonicall before S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
time: and yet he, lib. 19. Moral, c. 13. citing a testimony out of it,
prefaceth to it after this manner, <hi>Concerning which matter we doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
if we produce a testimony out of Bookes although not Canonicall, yet
set forth, for the edification of the Church. For Eleazar in the Book of
Machabees.</hi> &amp;c. Which if it be not to reject it from being Canonicall, is
without question, at least to question it. Moreover, because you are
so punctuall, as to talk of words and syllables, I would know whether
before <hi>Sixtus Quint us</hi> his time, your Church had a defined Canon
of Scripture, or not? If not, then was your Church surely a most Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
keeper of Scripture, that for 1500 yeares had not defined what
was Scripture, and what was not. If it had, then I demand, was it
<hi>that,</hi> set forth by <hi>Sixtus,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> set forth by <hi>Clement,</hi> or a <hi>third</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from both? If it were that set forth by <hi>Sixtus,</hi> then is it now
condemned by <hi>Clement:</hi> if that of <hi>Clement,</hi> it was condemned I say,
but sure you will say contradicted and question'd by <hi>Sixtus;</hi> If diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from both, then was it question'd and condemned by both, and
still lies under the condemnation. But then lastly, suppose it had
been true, <hi>That both some Book not known to be Canonicall had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
and that <hi>never any after receiving had been questioned:</hi> How
had this been a signe that the Church is infallibly assisted by the Holy
Ghost? In what mood or figure, would this conclusion follow out of
these Premises? Certainly your flying to such poor signes, as these are,
is to me a great signe, that you labour with penury of better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7615:88"/>
and that, thus to catch at shadowes and bul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ushes, is a shrewd
signe of a sinking cause.</p>
               <p>30 Ad §. 13. <hi>We are told here,</hi> That the generall promises of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
to the Church, must not be restrained only to points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
Because then the Apostles words and writings may also be so restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<hi>The Argument put in forme, and made compleat by supply of
the concealed Proposition runs thus;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Infallibility promised to the present Church of any age, is
as absolute and unlimited, as that promised to the Apostles in
their Preaching and Writings:</p>
               <p>But the Apostles Infallibility is not to be limited to Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls:</p>
               <p>Therefore neither is the Churches Infallibility thus to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Or thus;</p>
               <p>The Apostles Infallibility in their Preaching and writing may
be limited to Fundamentalls as well as the Infallibility of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church: But that is not to be done: Therefore this also is not
to be done.</p>
               <p>Now to this Argument, I answere, that if by <hi>may be as well,</hi> in the
major Proposition, be understood, <hi>may be as possibly:</hi> it is true, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.
If by it we understand, <hi>may be as iustly and rightly,</hi> It is
very pertinent but very false. So that as D. <hi>Potter limits the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Present Church unto Fundamentalls, so another may limit the
Apostles unto them also.</hi> He may doe it <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de iure</hi> he cannot;
that may be done and done lawfully: this also may be done, but not
lawfully. That may be done, and if it be done cannot be confuted:
This also may be done, but if it be done, may easily be confuted. It
is done to our hand in this very Paragraph, by five words taken out of
Scripture, <hi>All Scripture is divinely inspired.</hi> Shew but as much for the
Church: Shew where it is written, <hi>That all the decrees of the Church are
divinely inspired;</hi> and the Controversy will be at an end. Besides, there
is not the same reason for the Churches absolute infallibility, as for
the Apostles and Scriptures. For if the Church fall into error, it may
be reformed by comparing it with the rule of the Apostles doctrine
and Scripture. But if the Apostles have erred in delivering the
doctrine of Christianity, to whom shall we have recourse, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
and correcting their error? Again, there is not so much
strength required in the Edifice as in the Foundation: and if but wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have the ordering of the building, they will make it much a surer
thing, that the foundation shall not fail the building, then that the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
shall not fall from the foundation. And though the building be
to be of Brick or Stone, and perhaps of wood, yet if it may be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
they will have a rock for their foundation, whose stability is a
much more indubitable thing, then the adherence of the structure to it.
Now the Apostles &amp; Prophets, and Canonicall Writers, are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Church, according to that of S. <hi>Paul, built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Apostles and Prophets;</hi> therefore their stability, in reason
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7615:89"/>
ought to be greater then the Churches, which is built upon them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
a dependent Infallibility (especially if the dependance be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary)
cannot be so certain, as that on which it depends: But the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of the Church, depends upon the Infallibility of the Apostles,
as the streightnesse of the thing regulated, upon the streightnesse of
the Rule: and besides this dependance is voluntary, for it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Church to deviate from this Rule; being nothing else but an
aggregation of men, of which every one has free will, and is subject
to passions and errour: Therefore the Churches infallibility, is not so
certain as that of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>31 Lastly, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum fact a videam?</hi> If you be so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
as the Apostles were, shew it as the Apostles did; <hi>They went
forth</hi> (saith <hi>S. Marke) and Preached every where, the Lord working
with them, and confirming their words with Signes following.</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that God should lye, and that the eternall Truth should set
his hand and seale to the confirmation of a falshood, or of such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
as is partly true and partly false. The Apostles Doctrine was
thus confirmed, therefore it was intirely true, and in no part either
false or uncertain. I say in no part of that which they delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
as a certain divine Truth, and which had the Atte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Miracles. For that the Apostles themselves, even after the sending
of the holy Ghost, were, and through inadvertence or prejudice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for a time in an errour, repugnant to a revealed Truth, it is as I
have already noted unanswerably evident, from the <hi>story of the Acts of
the Apostles.</hi> For notwithstanding our Saviours expresse warrant &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
<hi>to goe and Preach to all Nations,</hi> yet untill S. <hi>Peter</hi> was better
informed by a vision from Heaven, and by the conversion of <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
both he and the rest of the Church, held it unlawfull for them, to goe
or preach the Gospell to any but the Iewes.</p>
               <p>32 And for those things which they professe to deliver as the
dictates of humane reason and prudence, and not as divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
why we should take them to be divine revelations, I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
nor how we can doe so, and not contradict the Apostles, and God
himselfe. Therefore when S. Paul saies, in the 1. Epist. to the <hi>Cor. 7. 12.
To the rest speak I, not the Lord;</hi> And again, <hi>concerning Virgins I have
no commandement of the Lord, but I deliver my Iudgement:</hi> If we will
pretend, that the Lord did certainly speak, what S. <hi>Paul</hi> spake, and
that his judgement was Gods commandement, shall we not plainly
contradict S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that spirit by which he wrote? which moved
him to write, as in other places divine Revelations, which he certainly
knew to be such, so in this place, his own judgement, touching some
things which God had not particularly revealed unto him. And if <hi>D.
Potter</hi> did speak to this purpose (<hi>that the Apostles were Infallible only
in these things which they spake of certain knowledge</hi>) I cannot see what
danger there were in saying so. Yet the truth is, you wrong <hi>D. Potter.</hi>
It is not he, but <hi>D. Stapleton</hi> in him, that speakes the words you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
at. D. <hi>Stapleton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> saith he, p. 140. is full and punctuall to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
then sets down the effect of his discourse l. 8. <hi>Princ. Doct. 4. c.</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:7615:89"/>
15. and in that, the words you cavill at, and then, p. 150. he shuts up this
paragraph with these words, <hi>thus D. Stapleton.</hi> So that if either the
Doctrine, or the reason be not good, <hi>D. Stapleton,</hi> not <hi>D. Potter</hi> is to
answer for it.</p>
               <p>33 Neither doe D. <hi>Potter's</hi> ensuing words <hi>limit the Apostles infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
to truths absolutely necessary to salvation,</hi> if you read them with
any candor: for it is evident, he grants the <hi>Church infallible in Truths
absolutely necessary;</hi> and as evident, that he <hi>ascribes to the Apostles, the
spirits guidance, and consequently infallibility in a more high and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
manner then any since them.</hi> From whence, thus I argue: Hee that
grants the Church infallible in Fundamentals, and ascribes to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
the infallible guidance of the Spirit, in a more high and absolute
manner then to any since them, limits not the Apostles infallibility to
Fundamentals; But D. <hi>Potter</hi> grants to the Church such a limited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
and ascribes to the Apostles, <hi>The Spirits infallible guidance
in a more high and absolute manner;</hi> therefore hee limits not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
infallibility to Fundamentals. I once knew a man out of curtesie,
help a lame dog over a stile, and he for requitall bit him by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
Iust so you serue D. <hi>Potter.</hi> He out of curtesie grants you, that
those words, <hi>The Spirit shall lead you into all Truth, and shall abide with
you ever,</hi> though in their high and most absolute sense, they agree on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Apostles, yet in a conditionall, limited, moderate, secundary
sense, they may be understood of the Church. But saies, that if they be
understood of the Church, <hi>All, must not be simply all,</hi> No, nor so large
an All, as the Apostles All, <hi>but all necessary to salvation.</hi> And you to
requite his curtesie, in granting you thus much cavill at him, as if hee
had prescribed these bounds to the Apostles also, as well as the present
Church. Whereas, he hath explained himselfe to the contrary, both
in the clause fore-mentioned, <hi>The Apostles, who had the spirits guidance
in a more high and absolute manner then any since them,</hi> and in these
words ensuing, <hi>whereof the Church is simply ignorant,</hi> and againe,
<hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erewith the Church is not acquainted.</hi> But most clearly in those
which being most incompatible to the Apostles, you with an &amp;c, I
cannot but feare craftily, haue conceal'd: <hi>How many obscure Texts of
Scripture which she understands not? How many Schoole Questions which
she hath not, happily cannot determine? And for matters of fact it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that the Church may erre;</hi> and then concludes, <hi>That we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by, All truths, not simply All, But</hi> (if you conceiue the words as
spoken of the Church) <hi>All Truth absolutely necessary to salvation.</hi> And
yet beyond all this, the negative part of his answer, agrees very well
to the Apostles themselues, for that <hi>All which they were led into,</hi> was
not simply All, otherwise S. <hi>Paul</hi> erred in saying, <hi>we know in part;</hi> but
such an All, as was requisite to make them the Churches Foundations.
Now such they could not be without freedome from errour in all
those things which they delivered constantly, as certaine revealed
Truths. For if we once suppose they may haue erred in some things of
this nature, it will be utterly undiscernable what they haue erred in, &amp;
what they haue not. Whereas though wee suppose the Church hath
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7615:90"/>
err'd in somethings, yet we haue meanes to know, what she hath err'd
in, and what she hath not. I mean by comparing the Doctrine of the
present Church, with the doctrine of the Primitiue Church delivered
in Scripture. But then last of all, suppose the <hi>Doctor</hi> had said (which I
know he never intended) that this promise in this place made to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
was to bee understood only of a Truth absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation; Is it consequent that he makes their Preaching and
Writing not Infallible in points not fundamentall? Doe you not blush
for shame at this Sophistry? The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> saies, no more was promised in
this place; Therefore he saies no more was promised! Are there not
other places besides this? And may not that be promised in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which is not promised in this?</p>
               <p>34 <hi>But if the Apostles were Infallible, in all things propos'd by them
as Divine Truths, the like must be affirm'd of the Church, because Doctor
Potter teacheth the said promise to be verified in the Church.</hi> True, hee
does so, but not in so absolute a manner. Now what is oppos'd to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
but limited, or restrained? To the Apostles then it was made, &amp;
to them only, yet the words are true of the Church. And this very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
might haue been made to it, though here it is not. They agree to
the Apostles <hi>in a higher,</hi> to the Church <hi>in a lower</hi> sense: to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<hi>in a more absolute,</hi> to the Church in <hi>a more limited</hi> sense. To the
Apostles <hi>absolutely,</hi> for the <hi>Churches direction:</hi> to the Church <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
by adherence to that direction, and so farre as she doth adhere to it.</hi>
In a word, the Apostles were led into all Truths by the Spirit, <hi>efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
The Church is led also into all truth by the Apostles <hi>writings, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficienter.</hi>
So that the Apostles and the Church, may be fitly compared
to the Starre and the Wisemen. The Starre was directed by the finger
of God, and could not but goe right to the place where Christ was:
But the Wise men were led by the Starre to Christ; led by it, I say, not
<hi>efficaciter,</hi> or <hi>irresistibiliter,</hi> but <hi>sufficienter,</hi> so that if they would
they might follow it, if they would not, they might choose. So was it
between the Apostles writing Scriptures, &amp; the Church. They in their
writing were Infallibly assisted to propose nothing as a divine Truth,
but what was so. The Church is also led into all Truth, but it is by the
intervening of the Apostles writings: But it is, as the Wisemen were
led by the Starre, or as a Traveller is directed by a Mercuriall statue, or
as a Pilot by his Card and Compasse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> led sufficiently, but not irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
led so that she may follow, not so that she must. For seeing the
Church is a society of men, whereof every one (according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Romish Church) hath freewill in believing; it follows,
that the whole aggregate has freewill in believing. And if any man say
that at least <hi>it is morally impossible, that of so many w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ereof all may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
aright, not any should doe so:</hi> I answer, It is true, if they did all giue
themselues any liberty of judgement. But if all (as the case is here) cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
their understandings to one of them, all are as likely to erre as
that one. And he more likely to erre then any other, because hee may
erre and thinks he cannot, &amp; because he conceiues the Spirit absolutly
promis'd to the succession of Bishops, of which many haue been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7615:90"/>
and confessedly wicked men, <hi>Men of the World:</hi> whereas
this Spirit is the <hi>Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receiue, because
he seeth him not, neither knoweth him.</hi> Besides, let us suppose, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this nor in any other place, God had promised any more unto
them, but to lead them into all Truth, necessary for their own &amp; other
mens salvation: Does it therefore follow that they were <hi>de facto,</hi> led
no farther? God indeed is oblig'd by his Veracity to doe all that hee
has promised, but is there any thing that binds him to doe no more?
May not he be better then his word, but you will quarrell at him?
May not his Bounty exceed his Promise? And may not we haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
enough that oftimes it does so? God did not promise to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
in his vision at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> any more then what he askt, which was
<hi>wisdome to govern his people,</hi> and that he gaue him. But yet I hope you
will not deny that we haue certainty enough that he gaue him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which neither God had promised, nor he had asked. If you doe,
you contradict God himselfe: For <hi>Behold</hi> (saith God) <hi>because thou
hast asked this thing, I haue done according to thy word. Loe, I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thee a Wise and an Vnderstanding heart, so that there was none like
thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. And I
haue also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
so that there shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee in all
thy dayes.</hi> God, for ought appeares, never oblig'd himselfe by promise,
to shew S. <hi>Paul</hi> those <hi>Vnspeakable mysteries,</hi> which in the third Heaven
he shewed unto him: and yet I hope we haue certainty enough, that he
did so. God promises to those that <hi>seek his Kingdome and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
thereof, that all things necessary shall be added vnto them,</hi> and in
rigour by his promise he is obliged to doe no more, and if hee giue
them necessaries he hath discharged his obligation: Shall we therefore
be so injurious to his bounty towards us, as to say it is determined by
the narrow bounds of meere necessity? So though God had obliged
himselfe by promise, to giue his Apostles infallibility onely in things
necessary to salvation; neverthelesse it is utterly inconsequent, that he
gaue them no more, then by the rigour of his promise he was engaged
to doe; or that we can haue no assurance of any farther assistance that
he gaue them: especially when he himselfe, both by his word, and by
his works hath assured us, that he did assist them farther. You see by
this time that your chaine of <hi>feareful consequences</hi> (as you call them)
is turned to a rope of sand, and may easily bee avoided without any
flying to your imaginary infallibility of the Church in all her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posalls.</p>
               <p>35 <hi>Ad</hi> § 14. <hi>&amp; 15. Doubting of a Book receaved for Canonicall,</hi> may
signifie, either doubting whether it be Canonicall; or supposing it to
be Canonicall, whether it be True. If the former sense were yours, I
must then againe distinguish of the terme, <hi>received;</hi> For it may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy,
<hi>either received by some particular Church,</hi> or by the <hi>present Church
Vniversall,</hi> or <hi>the Church of all Ages.</hi> If you meant the word in either
of the former senses, that which you say is not t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e. A man may justly
and reasonably doubt of some Texts, or some Book received by some
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7615:91"/>
particular Church, or by the Vniversall Church of this present time,
whether it be Canonicall or no: and yet haue just reason to belieue, &amp;
no reason to doubt, but that other Books are Canonicall. As <hi>Eusebius</hi>
perhaps, had reason to doubt of the Epistle of S. <hi>Iames;</hi> the Church
of Rome in <hi>Hierom's</hi> time of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> And yet they did
not doubt of all the Books of the Canon, nor had reason to doe so. If
by <hi>Received,</hi> you meant, <hi>Received by the Church of all Ages,</hi> I grant he
that doubts of any one such Book, has as much reason to doubt of all.
But yet here again I tell you, that it is possible a man may doubt of
one such book, and yet not of all: because it is possible men may doe
not according to reason. If you meant your words in the latter sense;
then I confesse he that belieues such a Book to be Canonicall, i. e. the
word of God, and yet (to make an impossible supposition) believes it
not to be true, if he will doe according to reason, must doubt of all the
rest, and belieue none. For there being no greater reason to believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing true, then because God hath said it, nor no other reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
the Scripture to be true, but only because it is Gods word; hee
that doubts of the Truth of any thing said by God, hath as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to belieue nothing that he saies: and therefore if he will doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to reason, neither must nor can believe any thing he saies. And
upon this ground you conclude rightly, that <hi>the infallibility of true
Scripture must be Vniversall, and not confin'd to points fundamentall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>36 <hi>And this Reason why we should not refuse to beleiue any part of
Scripture, upon pretence that the matter of it is not Fundamentall, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
to be convincing. But the same reason you say is as convincing for the
Vniversall infallibility of the Church. For</hi> (say you) <hi>unlesse shee be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in all things, we cannot belieue her in any one.</hi> But by this reason
your Proselytes, knowing you are not Infallible in all things, must not,
nor cannot belieue you in any thing. Nay you your selfe must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
your selfe in any thing, because you know that you are not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
in all things. Indeed if you had said <hi>wee could not rationally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
her for her own sake, and upon her own word and authority in any
thing,</hi> I should willingly grant the consequence. For an authority
subject to errour can be no firm or stable foundation of my beliefe in
any thing: and if it were in any thing, then this authority being one &amp;
the same in all proposalls, I should haue the same reason to belieue all,
that I haue to belieue one, and therefore must either doe unreasonably,
in believing any one thing, upon the sole warrant of this authority, or
unreasonably in not believing all things equally warranted by it. Let
this therefore be granted; and what will come of it? <hi>Why then,</hi> you say,
<hi>we cannot belieue her in propounding Canonicall Books.</hi> If you mean still
(as you must doe unlesse you play the Sophister) <hi>not upon her own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
I grant it: For we belieue Canonicall Books not upon the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the present Church,</hi> but upon <hi>Vniversall Tradition.</hi> If you
mean, <hi>Not at all,</hi> and that with reason we cannot believe these Books
to be Canonicall, which the Church proposes, I deny it. There is no
more consequence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

No Geometritian is Infallible in all things, therefore not in these things
which the domonstrates. M. <hi>Knot</hi> is not Infallible in all things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may not believe that he wrote a Book, entituled <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>37 But <hi>though the reply be good, Protestants cannot make use of it,
with any good coherence to this distinction, and some other Doctrine of
theirs: because they pretend to be able to tell, what points are Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and what not; and therefore though they should believe Scripture er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
in others, yet they might be sure it err'd not in these.</hi> To this I
answer. That if without dependance on Scripture, they did know
what were Fundamentall, and what not, they might possibly believe
the Scripture true in Fundamentalls, and erroneous in other things.
But seeing they ground their beliefe, that <hi>such and such things only are
Fundamentalls,</hi> only upon <hi>Scripture,</hi> and goe about to prove their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
true, only by Scripture, then must they suppose the Scripture
true absolutely and in all things, or else the Scripture could not be a
sufficient warrant to them, to believe this thing, that these only points
are Fundamentall. For who would not laugh at them if they should
argue thus, The Scripture is true in something; the Scripture saies
that these points only are Fundamentall, therefore this is true, that
these only are so! For every Fresh-man in Logick knowes that from
meer particulars nothing can be certainly concluded. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, this reason is firme, and demonstrative, The Scripture is true
in all things; But the Scripture saies, that these only points are the
Fundamentalls of Christian Religion, therefore it is true, that these
only are so. So that the knowledge of Fundamentalls being it selfe
drawen from Scripture, is so farre from warranting us to believe the
Scripture is, or may be in part True, and in part False; that it selfe can
have no foundation, but the Vniversall truth of Scripture. For to be
a Fundamentall truth, presupposes to be a truth; now I cannot know
any Doctrine to be a divine and supernaturall Truth, on a true part of
Christianity, but only because the Scripture saies so, which is all true:
Therefore, much more can I not know it, to be a Fundamentall
truth.</p>
               <p>33 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 16. To this Parag. I answer. Though the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not Infallible, I cannot believe her in every thing she saies, yet I
can and must believe her in every thing she proves, either by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Reason, or universall Tradition, be it Fundamentall, or be it not
Fundamentall. This you say, we <hi>cannot, in points not Fundamentall,
because in such we believe she may erre.</hi> But this I know, we can: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though she may erre in some things, yet she does not erre in what
she proves, though it be not Fundamentall. Again you say, <hi>we cannot
doe it in Fundamentalls, because we must know what points be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
before we goe to learn of her.</hi> Not so, but I must learn of the
Church, or of some part of the Church, or I cannot know any thing
Fundamentall or not Fundamentall. For how can I come to know,
that there was such a man as Christ, that he taught such Doctrine,
that he and his Apostles did such miracles in confirmation of it, that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7615:92"/>
the Scripture is Gods word, unlesse I be taught it. So then the Church
is, though <hi>not a certain Foundation and proof of my Faith, yet a necessary
introduction to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>39 But the <hi>Churches infallible direction, extending only to Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls,
unlesse I know them before I goe to learn of her, I may be rather
deluded then instructed by her.</hi> The reason and connexion of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
I fear neither I nor you doe well understand. And besides
I must tell you, you are too bold in taking that which no man grants
you, <hi>that the Church is an infallible direction in Fundamentalls.</hi> For if
she were so, then must we not only learn Fundamentalls of her, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>learn of her what is fundamentall, and take all for fundamentall which
she delivers to be such.</hi> In the performance whereof, if I knew any
one Church to be infallible, I would quickly be of that Church. But
good Sir, you must needs doe us this favour, to be so acute, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between, being <hi>infallible in fundamentalls,</hi> and being an <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
guide in fundamentalls.</hi> That she shall be alwaies <hi>a Church infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
in fundamentalls,</hi> we easily grant; for it comes to no more but
this, <hi>that there shall be alwaies a Church.</hi> But that there shall be alwaies
such a Church, which is an infallible Guide in fundamentalls, this we
deny. For this cannot be without setling a known infallibility in some
one known society of Christians, (as the Greek or the Roman, or
some other Church) by adhering to which Guide, men might be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to believe aright in all Fundamentalls. A man that were destitute
of all meanes of communicating his thoughts to others, might yet in
himselfe, and to himselfe be infallible, but he could not be a Guide to
others. A man or a Church that were invisible, so that none could
know how to repaire to it for direction, could not be an infallible
guide, and yet he might be in himselfe infallible. You see then there
is a wide difference between these two, and therefore I must beseech
you not to confound them, nor to take the one for the other.</p>
               <p>40 But they that <hi>know what points are Fundamentall, otherwise
then by the Churches authority, learn not of the Church:</hi> Yes, they may
learn of the Church, that the Scripture is the word of God, and from
the Scripture, that such points are fundamentall, others are not so; and
consequently learn, even of the Church, even of your Church, that
all is not fundamentall, nay all is not true, which the Church teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be so. Neither doe I see what hinders, but a man may learn of
a Church, how to confure the errors of that Church which taught
him: as well as of my Master in Physick, or the Mathematicks, I may
learn those rules and principles, by which I may confute my Masters
erroneous conclusions.</p>
               <p>41 But you aske, <hi>If the Church be not an infallible teacher, why are
we commanded to hear, to seek, to obey the Church?</hi> I Answer. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<hi>to seek the Church,</hi> I have not yet met with any, and I believe
you, if you were to shew them, would be your selfe to seek. But yet if
you could produce some such, we might seek the Church to many
good purposes, without supposing her <hi>a Guide infallible.</hi> And then for
<hi>hearing and obeying the Church,</hi> I would fain know, whether none may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7615:92"/>
be heard and obeyed, but those that are infallible? Whether parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches, Governors, Pastors, Parents, be not to be heard and
obeyed? Or whether all these be Infallible? I wonder you will thrust
upon us so often, these worne out-objections, without taking notice of
their Answers.</p>
               <p>42 Your Argument from S. <hi>Austine's</hi> first place, is a fallacy, <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto
secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter.</hi> If the <hi>whole Church practise
any of these things (matters of order and decency,</hi> for such only there he
speaks of,) <hi>to dispute whether that ought to be done, is insolent madnesse.</hi>
And from hence you inferre, <hi>If the whole Church practise any thing, to
dispute whether it ought to be done, is insolent madnesse.</hi> As if there were
no difference between <hi>any thing, and any of these things?</hi> Or as if I
might not esteem it pride and folly, to contradict and disturbe the
Church for matter of order, pertaining to the time and place, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumstances of Gods worship; and yet account it neither pride
nor folly, to goe about to reforme some errors, which the Church
hath suffered to come in, and to vitiate the very substance of Gods
worship. It was a practise of the whole Church in S. <hi>Austines</hi> time,
and esteem'd an Apostolique Tradition, even by Saint <hi>Austine</hi> himself,
<hi>That the Eucharist should be administred to infants:</hi> Tell me Sir, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you; Had it been insolent madnesse to dispute against this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
or had it not? If it had, how insolent and mad are yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that have
not only disputed against it, but utterly abolished it? If it had not, then
as I say, you must understand S. <hi>Austines</hi> words, not simply of all
things, but (as indeed he himselfe restrained them) <hi>of these things, of
matter of Order, Decency, and Vniformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>43 In the next place, you tell us out of him, <hi>That that which has
been alwaies kept, is most rightly esteem'd to come from the Apostles:</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
right, and what then? Therefore the Church cannot erre in defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Controversies. Sir I beseech you, when you write again, doe
us the favour to write nothing but syllogismes, for I find it still an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
trouble, to find out the concealed propositions, which are to
connect the parts of your enthymemes. As now for example, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
unto you, I am at my wits end, and have done my best endeavour,
to find some glue, or sodder, or cement, or chaine, or thred, or anything
to tye this antecedent and this consequent together, and at length am
inforced to give it over, and cannot doe it.</p>
               <p>44 But the Doctrines, that <hi>Infants are to be baptized, and those
that are baptized by Heretiques, are not to be re-baptized, are neither of
them to be proved by Scripture: And yet according to</hi> S. <hi>Austine they are
true Doctrines, and we may be certain of them upon the Authority of the
Church, which we could not be, unless the Church were Infallible; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Church is infallible.</hi> I answer, that there is no repugnance but
we may be certain enough, of the Vniversall Traditions of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church, such as in S. <hi>Austin's</hi> account, these were which here are
spoken of, and yet not be certain enough, of the definitions of the
present Church. Vnlesse you can shew (which I am sure you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doe) that the Infallibility of the present Church, was alwaies a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7615:93"/>
of the ancient Church. Now your main businesse is to prove
the present Church infallible, not so much in consigning ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as in defining emergent controversies. Again, it followes not,
because the Churches Authority, is warrant enough for us to believe
some doctrine, touching which the Scripture is silent, therefore it is
Warrant enough to believe these, to which the Scripture seemes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant.
Now the Doctrines which S. <hi>Austine</hi> received upon the
Churches Authority, were of the first sort; the Doctrines for which
we deny your Churches infallibility are of the second. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though the Churches authority, might be strong enough, to bear
the weight which S. <hi>Austine</hi> laid upon it, yet happily if may not be
strong enough, to bear that which you lay upon it. Though it may
support some Doctrines without Scripture, yet surely not against it.
And last of all, to deal ingeniously with you and the World, I am not
such an Idolater of S. <hi>Austine,</hi> as to think a thing proved sufficiently
because he saies it, nor that all his sentences are oracles; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in this thing, that whatsoever was practised or held by the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Church of his time, must needs have come from the Apostles.
Though considering the neerenesse of his time to the Apostles, I think
it a good probable way, and therefore am apt enough to follow it,
when I see no reason to the contrary. Yet I professe I must have better
satisfaction, before I can induce my selfe to hold it certain and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And this, not because Popery would come in at this dore, as some
have vainly feared, but because by the Church Vniversall of some
time, and the Church Vniversall of other times, I see plain contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
held and practised. Both which could not come from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
for then the Apostles had been teachers of falshood. And
therefore the belief or practise of the present Vniversall Church, can
be no infallible proof, that the Doctrine so beleived, or the custome
so practised came from the Apostles. I instance in the doctrine of the
<hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the <hi>Eucharists necessity for infants:</hi> both which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
have been taught by the consent of the eminent Fathers of
some ages, without any opposition from any of their Contemporaries:
and were delivered by them, not as Doctors, but as Witnesses, not as
their own opinions, but as Apostolike Traditions. And therefore
measuring the doctrine of the Church by all the Rules which Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Perron</hi> gives us for that purpose, both these Doctrines must
be acknowledged to have been the doctrines of the Ancient Church of
some age, or ages; And that the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctrines were Catholique at
some other time, I believe you will not think it needfull for me to
prove. So that either I must say, the Apostles were fountaines of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious
doctrines, or that being the Vniversall Doctrine of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church, is no sufficient proof that it came originally from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
Besides, who can warrant us, that the Vniversall Traditions
of the Church were all Apostolicall? seeing in that famous place for
Traditions, in <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

               <p>45 No lesse you say is S. <hi>Chrysost. for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Traditions of the Church.</hi> But you were
to prove the Church infallible, not in her Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
(which we willingly grant, if they be as
universall as the Tradition of the undoubted
books of Scripture is, to be as infallible as the
Scripture is; for neither does being written
make the word of God the more infallible, nor
being unwritten make it the lesse infallible:)
Not therefore in her universall Traditions, were
you to prove the Church infallible, but in all her
Decrees and definitions of Controversies. To
this point when you speak you shall have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
but hitherto you doe but wander.</p>
               <p>46 But let us see what S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saies,
<hi>They (the Apostles) delivered not all things in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
(who denies it?) <hi>but many things also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
writing,</hi> (who doubts of it?) <hi>and these also are
worthy of belief.</hi> Yes, if we knew what they were.
But many things are worthy of belief, which are
not necessary to be believed: As that <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
was Emperour of Rome is a thing worthy of
belief, being so well testified as it is, but yet it
is not necessary to be believed; a man may be
saved without it. Those many workes which <hi>our Saviour did (which
S. Iohn supposes, would not have been contained in a world of bookes</hi>) if
they had been written, or if God by some other meanes had preserv'd
the knowledge of them, had been as worthy to be believed, and as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
as those that are written. But to shew you how much a more
faith full keeper Records are then report, those few that were written
are preserved &amp; believed, those infinitly more that were not written,
are all lost and vanished out of the memory of men. And seeing God
in his providence, hath not thought fit to preserve the memory of
them, he hath freed us from the obligation of believing them: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
obligation ceases, when it becomes impossible. Who can doubt
but the Primitive Christians, to whom the Epistles of the Apostles
were written, either of themselves understood, or were instructed by
the Apostles, touching the sense of the obscure places of them? These
Traditive interpretations, had they been written and dispersed, as the
Scriptures were, had without question been preserved, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are. But to shew how excellent a keeper of the Tradition, the
Church of Rome hath been, or even the Catholique Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7615:94"/>
want of writing they are all lost, nay were all lost, within a few ages
after Christ. So that if we consult the ancient Interpreters, we shall
hardly find any two of them agree about the sense of any one of them.
<hi>Cardinall Perron,</hi> in his discourse of Traditions, having alleaged this
place for them, <hi>Hold the Traditions &amp;c.</hi> tells us we <hi>must not answer that
S. Paul speaks here, only of such Traditions, which (though not in this
Epist. to the Thess.) yet were afterwards written, and in other bookes of
Scripture: because it is upon occasion of Tradition</hi> (touching the <hi>cause</hi> of
the <hi>hinderance of the comming of Antichrist,) which was never written,
that he laies this iniunction upon them, to hold the Traditions.</hi> Well,
let us grant this Argument good, and concluding; and that the Church
of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> or the Catholique Church (for what S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ
to one Church he writ to all,) were to hold some unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and among the rest, what was the cause of the hinderance of the
comming of Antichrist. But what if they did not performe their duty
in this point, but suffered this Tradition to be lost out of the memory
of the Church? Shall we not conclude, that seeing God would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any thing necessary to salvation to be lost, and he has suffered this
Tradition to be lost, therefore the knowledge or belief of it, though it
were a profitable thing, yet it was not necessary? I hope you will not
challenge such authority over us, as to oblige us to impossibilities, to
doe that which you cannot doe your selves. It is therefore requisite
that you make this command possible to be obeyed, before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
obedience unto it. Are you able then to instruct us so well; as
to be fit to say unto us, <hi>Now ye know what withholdeth?</hi> Or doe you
your selves know that ye may instruct us? Can yee, or dare you say,
this or this was this hindrance which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here meant, and all men
under pain of damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are to believe it? Or if you cannot, (as I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you cannot) goe then, &amp; vaunt your Church, for the only Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
Faithfull, Infallible keeper of the Apostles Traditions; when
here this very Tradition, which here in particular was deposited with
the Thessalonians and the Primitive Church, you have utterly lost it,
so that there is no footstep or print of it remaining, which with Divine
faith we may rely upon. Blessed therefore be the goodnesse of God,
who seeing that what was not written, was in such danger to be lost,
took order, that what was necessary should be written! Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes</hi>
counsell therefore, of <hi>accounting the Churches Traditions
worthy of belief,</hi> we are willing to obey: And if you can of any thing
make it appear, that <hi>it is Tradition,</hi> we will seek no farther. But this
we say withall, that we are perswaded you cannot make this appear in
any thing, but <hi>only the Canon of Scripture,</hi> and that there is nothing
now extant, and to be known by us, which can put in so good plea, to
be the unwritten word of God, as the unquestioned Books of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Scripture, to be the written word of God.</p>
               <p>47 You conclude this Parag. with a sentence of S. <hi>Austin's</hi> who
saies, <hi>The Church doth not approve, nor dissemble, nor doe these things
which are against Faith or good life:</hi> and from hence you conclude, <hi>that
it never hath done so, nor ever can doe so.</hi> But though the argum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

hold in Logick <hi>à non posse, ad non esse,</hi> yet I never heard, that it would
hold back again, <hi>à no nesse, ad non posse.</hi> The Church cannot doe this,
therefore it does it not, followes with good consequence: but the
Church does not this, therefore it shall never doe it, nor can never doe
it, this I believe will hardly follow. In the Epistle next before to the
same <hi>Ianuarius,</hi> writing of the same matter, he hath these words, <hi>It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
that the things you enquire of, must be of that third kind of things,
which are different in divers places. Let every one therefore doe, that
which he findes done in the Church to which he comes, for none of them
is against Faith or good manners.</hi> And why doe you not inferre from
hence, that <hi>no particular Church can bring up any Custome that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
faith or good manners?</hi> Certainly this consequence has as good
reason for it as the former. If a man say of the Church of England,
(what S. <hi>Austine</hi> of the Church) that she neither approves, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles,
nor does any thing against faith or good manners, would
you collect presently, that this man did either make or think the
Church of England infallible? Furthermore, it is observable out of
this, and the former Epistle, that this Church <hi>which did not</hi> (as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
according to you, thought) <hi>approve or dissemble, or doe any thing
against faith or good life,</hi> did yet tolerate and dissemble vain supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and humane presumptions, and suffer all places to be full of
them, and to be exacted, as, nay more severely then the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God himselfe. This S. <hi>Austine</hi> himselfe professeth in this
very Epistle. <hi>This</hi> (saith he) <hi>I doe infinitely grieve at, that many most
wholsome precepts of the divine Scripture, are little regarded; and in the
mean time, all is so full of so many presumptions, that he is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
found fault with, who during his octaves, toucheth the earth with
his naked foot, then he that shall bury his soul in drunkennesse.</hi> Of these
he saies, <hi>that they were neither contained in Scripture, decreed by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
nor corroborated by the Custome of the Vniversall Church. And
though not against faith, yet unprofitable burdens of Christian liberty;
which made the condition of the Iewes more tolerable then that of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
And therefore he professes of them, <hi>Approbare non possum, I
cannot approve them.</hi> And <hi>ubi facult as tribuitur, resecanda existimo,
I think they are to be cut off, wheresoever we have power.</hi> Yet so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were they rooted, and spread so farre, through the indiscreet devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people, alwaies more prone to superstition then true piety,
and through the connivence of the Governors, who should have
strangled them at their birth, that himselfe, though he grieved at
them, and could not allow them, yet for fear of offence he durst not
speak against them, <hi>multa hujusmodi propter nonnu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Catholique Church it selfe, did see and dissemble, and tolerate
them; for these are the things of which he presently saies after, <hi>the
Church of God</hi> (and you will have him speak of the true Catholique
Church) <hi>placed between Chaffe &amp; Tares, tolerates many things.</hi> Which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7615:95"/>
was directly against the command of the holy spirit, given the
Church by S. <hi>Paul; To stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ hath
made her free, and not to suffer her selfe to be brought in bondage to these
servile burdens.</hi> Our Saviour tels the Scribes and Pharises, <hi>that in
vain they worshipped God, teaching for Doctrines mens Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
For that laying aside the Commandments of God, they held the
Traditions of men, as the washing of pots, and cups, and many other such
like things.</hi> Certainly that which S. <hi>Austine</hi> complaines of, as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
fault of Christians of his time, was paralell to this: <hi>Multa</hi> (saith
he) <hi>quae in divinis libris saluberrima praecepta sunt, minus curantur;</hi>
This I suppose I may very well render in our Saviours words, <hi>The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God are laid aside;</hi> and then; <hi>tam multis presumptioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
sic plena sunt omnia, all things, or all places, are so full of so many
presumptions, and those exacted with such severity, nay with Tyranny,
that he was more severely censur'd, who in the time of his Octaves tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the earth with his naked feet, then hee which dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wned and buried his
soul in drink.</hi> Certainly, if this be not <hi>to teach for Doctrines mens
Commandements,</hi> I know not what is. And therefore these superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Christians might be said, <hi>to worship God in vain,</hi> as well as Scribes
and Phraises. And yet great variety of superstitions of this kind, were
then already spread over the Church, being different in divers places.
This is plain from these words of S. <hi>Austin</hi> of them, <hi>diversorum lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum
diversis moribus innumerabiliter variantur;</hi> and apparent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the stream of them was grown so violent, that he durst not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opose

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, I dare not freely speak against
them.</hi> So that to say, the Catholique Church tolerated all this, and
for fear of offence, durst not abrogate or condemne it, is to say (if we
judge rightly of it) that the Church with silence and connivence ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
tolerated Christians to <hi>worship God in vain.</hi> Now how this
tolerating of Vniversall superstition in the Church, can consist with
the assistance and direction of Gods omnipotent spirit to guard it from
superstition, &amp; with the accomplishment of that pretended prophecy
of the Church, <hi>I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Ierusalem, which
shall never hold their peace day nor night;</hi> besides how these superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being thus noutished, cherished, and strengthened by the practise
of the most, and urged with great violence upon others as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God, and but fearfully opposed or contradicted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
might in time take such deepe roote, and spread their branches
so farre, as to passe for universall Customes of the Church, he that
does not see, sees nothing. Especially, considering the catching
and contagious nature of this sinne, and how fast ill weeds spread,
and how true and experimented that rule is of the Historian, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla

some such superstition had not already even in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time,
prevailed so farre, as to be <hi>Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>etudine universae Ecclesiae roboratum,</hi>
who can doubt that considers, that the practise of <hi>Communicating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
had even then got the credit, and authority, not only of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7615:95"/>
Custome, but also of an Apostolique Tradition.</p>
               <p>48 But (you will say) notwithstanding all this, S. <hi>Austin here war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
us, that the Church can never either approue or dissemble or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
any thing against faith or goodlife, and so long you may rest securely
upon it.</hi> Yea, but the same S. <hi>Austine</hi> tels us in the same place, <hi>that the
Church may tolerate humane presumptions, and vain superstitions, and
those urg'd more severely then the Commandements of God:</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
superstition be a sinne or no, I appeal to our Saviours words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cited, and to the consent of your Schoolmen. Besides if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it rightly, we shall finde, that the Church is not truly said only to
tolerate these things, but rather, that a part and farre the lesser, tolerated
and dissembled them in silence, and a part, &amp; a farre greater publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vowed and practis'd them, and urg'd them upon others with great
violence, and that continued still a part of the Church. Now why the
whole Church might not continue the Church, and yet doe so, as well
as a part of the Church might continue a part of it, and yet doe so, I
desire you to inform me.</p>
               <p>49 But now after all this adoe, what if S. <hi>Austine</hi> saies not this
which is pretended of the Church, <hi>viz. That she neither approues, nor
dissembles, nor practises any thing against Faith or good life,</hi> but onely
of good men in the Church? Certainly, though some Copies read as
you would haue it, yet you should not haue dissembled, that others
read the place otherwise. <hi>viz. Ecclesia multa tolerat, &amp; tamen quae sunt
contra Fidem &amp; bonam vitam, nec bonus approbat, &amp;c. The Church tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
many things; and yet what is against faith or good life, a good man
will neither approue, nor dissemble, nor practise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>50 <hi>Ad</hi> § 17. <hi>That Abraham begat Isaac,</hi> is a point very far from being
Fundamentall; and yet I hope you will grant, that Protestants belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Scripture to be the word of God, may bee certain enough of the
truth and certainty of it. For what if they say that the Catholique
Church, and much more themselues may possibly erre in some unfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
points, is it therefore consequent, they can be certaine of
none such? What if a wiser man then I may mistake the sense of some
obscure place of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> may I not therefore without any arrogance
or inconsequence, conceiue my selfe certain that I understand him in
some plain places, which carry their sense before them? And then for
points Fundamentall, to what purpose doe you say, <hi>That we must first
know what they be, before we can be assured that wee cannot erre in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Scripture;</hi> when we pretend not at all to any assurance
that we cannot erre, but only to a sufficient certainty, that we doe not
erre, but rightly understand those things that are plain, whether Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
or not Fundamentall? That <hi>God is, and is a rewarder of them
that seek him:</hi> That <hi>there is no salvation but by faith in Christ:</hi> That by
<hi>repentance and faith in Christ Remission of sinnes may be obtained:</hi> That
<hi>there shall be a Resurrection of the Body:</hi> These wee conceive both true,
because the Scripture saies so, and Truths Fundamentall, because they
are necessary parts of the Gospell, whereof our Saviour saies, <hi>Qui non
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7615:96"/>
crediderit, damnabitur.</hi> All which we either learne from Scripture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
or learne of those that learne it of Scripture, so that neither
Learned nor Vnlearned pretend to know these things independently
of Scripture. And therefore in imputing this to us, you cannot excuse
your selfe from having done us a palpable injury.</p>
               <p>51 <hi>Ad</hi> § 18. And I urge you as mainly as you urge D. <hi>Potter</hi> &amp;
other Protestants, that you tell us that all the Traditions, and all the
Definitions of the Church are Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points, &amp; we cannot wrest
from you <hi>a list in particular of all such Traditions and Definitions;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, no man can tell whether or no he erre in points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and be capable of salvation; (For I hope erring in our fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
is no more exclusiue of salvation the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erring in yours.) And which
is most lamentable, insteed of giving us such a Catalogue, you also fall
to wrangle among your selues about the making of it; Some of you,
as I haue said aboue, holding somethings to be <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> which
others deny to be so.</p>
               <p>52 <hi>Ad</hi> § 19. I answ. That these differences between Protestants,
concerning Errours damnable and not damnable, Truths fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and not fundamentall, may be easily reconcil'd. For either the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
they speak of <hi>may be purely and simply involuntary,</hi> or it may be in
respect of the <hi>cause of it voluntary.</hi> If the cause of it be some volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and avoidable fault, the Errour is it selfe sinfull, and consequently
in its own nature damnable; As if by negligence in seeking the Truth,
by unwillingnesse to finde it, by pride, by obstinacy, by desiring that
Religion should be true which sutes best with my ends, by feare of
mens ill opinion, or any other worldly feare, or any other worldly
hope, I betray my selfe to any error contrary to any divine revealed
Truth, that Errour may be justly stiled a sinne, and consequently of it
selfe to such a one damnable. But if I be guilty of none of these faults,
but be desirous to know the Truth, and diligent in seeking it, and advise
not at all with flesh &amp; bloud about the choice of my opinions, but only
with God, &amp; that Reason that he hath given me, if I be thus qualifi'd,
and yet through humane infirmity fall into errour, that errour cannot
be damnable. Again, the party erring may be conceived either to dye
with contrition for all his sins known and unknown, or without it; If
he dye without it, this errour in it selfe damnable, will bee likewise so
unto him: If he dye with contrition (as his errour can bee no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but he may) his errour though in it selfe damnable, to him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your doctrine, will not proue so. And therefore some of
those Authors whom you quote, speaking of Errours whereunto men
were betrayed, or wherein they were kept by their Fault, or Vice, or
Passion (as for the most part men are:) Others speaking of them, as
errours simply and purely involuntary, and the effects of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity;
some as they were <hi>retracted by Contrition</hi> (to use your own
phrase) others, as they were not, no marvell though they haue past up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, some a heavier, &amp; some a milder, some an absolving, &amp; some
a condemning sentence. The best of all these errours, which here you
mention, having malice enough too frequently mixed with it, to sink a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7615:96"/>
man deep enough into hell: and the greatest of them all, being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your Principles, either no fault at all, or very Veniall, where
there is no malice of the will conjoyn'd with it. And if it be, yet as the
most malignant poyson, will not poison him that receives with it a
more powerfull Antidote: so I am confident your own Doctrine will
force you to confesse, that whosoever dies with Faith in Christ, and
Contrition for all sinnes known and unknown (in which heap all his
sinfull errours must be compriz'd,) can no more be hurt by any the
most malignant and pestilent errour, then S. <hi>Paul</hi> by the viper which
he shook of into the fire. Now touching the <hi>necessity of Repentance
from dead works, and Faith in Christ Iesus the Sonne of God, and Saviour
of the World,</hi> they all agree; and therefore you cannot deny, but they
agree about all that is simply necessary. Moreover, though, if they
should goe about to choose out of Scripture all these Propositions &amp;
Doctrines which integrate and make up the body of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
peradventure there would not be so exact agreement amongst them,
as some say there was between the 70. Interpreters, in translating the
Old Testament; yet thus far without controversie they doe all agree,
that in the Bible all these things are contained, and therefore, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
does truly and sincerely believe the Scripture, must of necessity
either in <hi>hypothesi,</hi> or at least <hi>in thesi,</hi> either <hi>formally,</hi> or at least <hi>virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
either <hi>explicitely,</hi> or at least <hi>implicitely,</hi> either in <hi>Act</hi> or at least in
<hi>preparation of minde,</hi> belieue all things Fundamentall: It being not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
nor required of Almighty God, to belieue the true sense of
Scripture in all places, but only that we should endeavour to doe so, &amp;
be prepar'd in minde to doe so, whensoever it shall be sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to us. Suppose a man in some disease were prescribed a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
consisting of twenty ingredients, and he advising with Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
should finde them differing in opinion about it, some of them tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, that all the ingredients were absolutely necessary; some, that
only some of them were necessary, the rest only profitable, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<hi>ad melius esse,</hi> lastly some, that some only were necessary, some
profitable, and the rest superfluous, yet not hurtfull; Yet all with one
accord agreeing in this, That the <hi>whole receipt had in it all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
for the recovery of his health, and that if hee made use of it, hee
should infallibly finde it successefull: what wise man would not think
they agreed sufficiently for his direction to the recovery of his health?
lust so, these Protestant Doctors, with whose discords you make such
Tragedies, agreeing in <hi>Thesi</hi> thus far, that the <hi>Scripture evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
all things necessary to Salvation,</hi> both for matter of Faith and of
practise, and that whosoever believes it, and endeavours to finde the
true sense of it, and to conform his life unto it, shall certainly performe
all things necessary to salvation, and undoubtedly be saved; agreeing I
say thus farre, what matters it for the direction of men to salvation,
though they differ in opinion, touching what points are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and what not? What Errours absolutely repugnant to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and what not? Especially considering that although they differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Question of the necessity of these Truths, yet for the most
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7615:97"/>
part they agree in this that Truths they are, and profitable at least,
though not simply necessary. And though they differ in the Question,
whether the contrary Errours be destructive of salvation, or no, yet in
this they consent, that Errours they are, &amp; hurtful to Religion, though
not destructive of Salvation. Now that which God requires of us is
this; That we should belieue the Doctrines of the Gospell to bee
Truths, not all, necessary Truths, for all are not so, and consequently,
the repugnant Errours to be falshoods; yet not all such falshoods, as
unavoidably draw with them damnation upon all that hold them, for
all doe not so.</p>
               <p>53 Yea but <hi>you say, it is very requisite we should agree upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Catalogue of Fundamentall points, for without such a Catalogue, no
man can be assured whether or no, he hath faith sufficient to salvation.</hi>
This I utterly deny as a thing evidently false, and I wonder you should
content your selfe magisterially to say so, without offering any proof
of it. I might much more justly, think it enough barely to deny it,
without refutation, but I will not. Thus therefore I argue against it.</p>
               <p>Without being able to make a Catalogue of Fundamentals, I
may be assured of the Truth of this Assertion, if it be true, That
<hi>the Scripture containes all necessary points of faith,</hi> and know that I
belieue explicitely all that is exprest in Scripture, and implicitely
all that is contained in them: Now he that belieues all this, must
of necessity believe all things necessary; Therefore without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to make a Catalogue of Fundamentals, I may be assured
that I belieue all things necessary, and consequently that my faith
is sufficient.</p>
               <p>I said, of the truth of this Assertion, <hi>if it be true:</hi> Because I will not here
enter into the Question of the truth of it, it being sufficient for my
present purpose, that it may be true, and may be believed without any
dependance upon a Catalogue of Fundamentalls. And therefore if
this be all your reason, to demand a particular Catalogue of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls,
we cannot but think your demand unreasonable. Especially
having your selfe expressed the cause of the difficulty of it, and that is,
<hi>Because Scripture doth deliver Divine Truths, but seldom qualifies them,
or declares whether they be or be not absolutely necessary to salvation.</hi> Yet
not so seldome, but that out of it I could giue you an abstract of the
Essentiall part of Christianity, if it were necessary, but I haue shewed
it not so, by confuting your reason, pretended for the necessity of it, &amp;
at this time I haue no leasure to doe you curtesies that are so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to my selfe. Yet thus much I will promise, that when you deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>a particular Catalogue of your Church Proposals</hi> with one hand, you
shall receiue a particular Catalogue of what I conceiue Fundamentall,
with the other. For as yet, I see no such faire proceeding as you talke
of, nor any performance on your own part of that which so clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
you require on ours. For as for the Catalogue which he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e you
haue given us, in saying. <hi>You are obliged under pain of damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
whatsoever the Catholique visible Church of Christ proposeth as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by Almighty God,</hi> it is like a covey of one Patridg, or a flock of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7615:97"/>
one sheep, or a Fleet compos'd of one ship, or an Army of one man. The
Author of <hi>Charity mistaken, demands a particular Catalogue of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
points;</hi> And <hi>We</hi> (say you) <hi>again and again demand such a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</hi>
And surely, if this one Proposition, which here you think to
stop our mouthes with, be a Catalogue, yet at least such a Catalogue it
is not, and therefore as yet you haue not perform'd what you require.
For if to set down such a Propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherein are compriz'd all points
taught by us to be necessary to salvation, will serue you insteed of a
Catalogue, you shall haue Catalogues enough. As, we are oblig'd to
belieue all under pain of damnation which God commands us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue.
There's one Catalogue. We are oblig'd under pain of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to belieue all, whereof we may be sufficiently assured, that Christ
taught it his Apostles, his Apostles the Church. There's another. We
are oblig'd under pain of damnation to belieue Gods word, &amp; all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it to be true. There's a third. If these generalities will not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you, but you will be importuning us to tell you in particular,
what they are which Christ taught his Apostles, and his Apostles the
Church, what points are contained in Gods word; Then I beseech you
doe us reason, and giue us a particular and <hi>exact Inventory of all your
Church Proposalls, without leaving out, or adding any,</hi> such a one which
all the Doctors of your Church will subscribe to, &amp; if you receiue not
then a Catalogue of Fundamentals, I for my part will giue you leaue
to proclaim us Banckrupts.</p>
               <p>54 Besides this deceitfull generality of your Catalogue (as you
call it,) another main fault we finde with it, that it is extreamly ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous;
and therefore to draw you out of the clouds, giue me leaue to
propose some Questions to you concerning it. I would know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whether by believing, you mean explicitely or implicitely? If
you mean implicitely, I would know whether your Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
be under pain of damnation to be believed explicitely, or no?
Whether any other point or points besides this, be under the same pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
to be believed explicitely, or no? And if any, what they bee? I
would know what you esteem the Proposalls of the Catholike visible
Church? In particular, whether the Decree of a Pope <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi>
that is, with an intent to oblige all Christians by it, be a sufficient and
an obliging proposall? Whether men without danger of damnation
may examine such a Decree, and if they think they have just cause, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to obey it? Whether the Decree of a Councell, without the <hi>Popes</hi>
confirmation, be such an obliging proposall, or no? Whether it be so
in case there be no <hi>Pope,</hi> or in case it be doubtfull who is <hi>Pope?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Decree of a generall Councell confirm'd by the <hi>Pope,</hi> be such
a Proposall, and whether he be an Heretique that thinks otherwise?
Whether the Decree of a particular Councell confirm'd by the <hi>Pope,</hi>
be such a proposall? Whether the Generall uncondemn'd practise of
the Church for some ages be such a sufficient Proposition? Whether
the consent of the most eminent Fathers of any age, agreeing in the
affirmation of any doctrine, not contradicted by any of their Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries,
be a sufficient Proposition? Whether the Fathers testifying
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7615:98"/>
such or such a doctrine or practise to be Tradition, or to bee the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or practise of the Church, be a sufficient assurance that it is so?
Whether we be bound under pain of damnation, to belieue every Text
of the vulgar Bible, now authoriz'd by the Roman Church, to bee the
true translation of the Originalls of the Prophets, and Evangelists, and
Apostles, without any the least alteration? Whether they that lived
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Bible of <hi>Sixtus</hi> was set forth, were bound under pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to believe the same of that? And if not of that, of what Bible
they were bound to believe it? Whether the Catholique visible
Church be alwaies that Society of Christians which adheres to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Rome? Whether every Christian, that hath ability and opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
be not bound to endeavour to know explicitely the Proposalls
of the Church? Whether Implicite Faith in the Churches Veracity,
will not saue him that Actually and Explicitely disbelieves some do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church, not knowing it to be so; and Actually belieues
some damnable Heresie, as that God has the shape of a man? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an ignorant man be bound to believe any point to be decreed by
the Church, when his Priest or Ghostly Father assures him it is so?
Whether his Ghostly Father may not erre in telling him so, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any man can be oblig'd under pain of damnation, to belieue an
Errour? Whether he be bound to believe such a thing defined, when
a number of Priests, perhaps ten or twenty tell him it is so? And
what assurance he can haue, that they neither erre, nor deceive him in
this matter? Why Implicite Faith in Christ, or the Scriptures should
not suffice for a mans salvation, as well as implicit faith in the Church?
Whether when you say, <hi>Whatsoever the Church proposeth,</hi> you meane
all that ever she propos'd, or that only which she now proposeth; and
whether shee now proposeth all that ever she did propose? Whether
all the Books of Canonicall Scripture were sufficiently declared to the
Church to be so, and propos'd as such by the Apostles? And if not,
from whom the Church had this declaration afterwards? If so, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all men ever since the Apostles time, were bound under paine of
damnation to believe the Epistle of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
to be Canonicall; at least, not to disbelieve it, &amp; believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
Lastly, why it is not sufficient for any mans salvation to use the
best meanes he can to inform his conscience, and to follow the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it? To all these demands when you haue given faire and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
answers, you shall heare further from me.</p>
               <p>55 <hi>Ad</hi> § 20. At the first entrance into this Parag. from our own
Doctrine, <hi>That the Church cannot erre in Points necessary, it is concluded
if we are wise, we must for sake it is nothing, least we should for sake it in
something necessary.</hi> To which I answer, First, that the supposition as
you understand it, is falsely impos'd upon us, and as we understand it
will doe you no service. For when we say, that there shall be <hi>a Church
alwaies,</hi> some where or other, <hi>unerring in Fundamentalls,</hi> our meaning
is but this, that <hi>there shall be alwaies a Church,</hi> to the very being where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is repugnant that it should erre in fundamentals; for if it should
doe so, it would want the very essence of a Church, and therefore cease
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7615:98"/>
to be a Church. But we never annexed this privilege <hi>to any one Church
of any one Denomination,</hi> as the Greek or the Roman Church: which if
we had done, and set up some setled certain Society of Christians, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishable
from all others by adhering to such a Bishop for our
Guide in fundamentals, then indeed, and then only might you with
some colour, though with no certainty, haue concluded that we could
not in wisdome, <hi>forsake this Church in any point, for feare of forsaking
it in a necessary point.</hi> But now that we say not this of any one determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Church, which alone can perform the office of Guide or Director,
but indefinitely of the Church, meaning no more but this, <hi>That there
shall be alwaies in some place or other, some Church that erres not in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls;</hi>
will you conclude from hence, that we cannot in wisdome
forsake this or that, the Roman or the Greek Church, for feare of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in Fundamentalls?</p>
               <p>56 Yea, but you may say (for I will make the best I can of all your
Arguments,) <hi>That this Church thus unerring in Fundamentalls, when
Luther arose, was by our confession the Roman; and therefore wee ought
not in wisdome to haue departed from it in any thing.</hi> I answer: First, that
we confesse no such thing, that the Church of Rome was then this
Church, but only a Part of it, and that the most corrupted and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible.
Secondly, that if by adhering to the church, we could haue
been thus far secured, this Argument had some shew of reason. But
seeing wee are not warranted thus much by any privilege of that
Church, that She cannot erre fundamentally, but only from Scripture,
which assures us that she doth erre very haynously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> collect our hope,
that the Truths she retaines &amp; the practise of them, may proue an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
to her, against the Errors which she maintaines in such Persons,
as in simplicity of heart follow this <hi>Absalom;</hi> wee should then doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the light of our conscience, and so sinne damnably if we should
not abandon the profession of her Errours though not Fundamentall.
Neither can we thus conclude, we may safely hold with the church of
Rome in all her points, for she cannot erre damnably; For this is false,
she may, though perhaps she does not: But rather thus, These points
of Christianity, which have in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of Antidotes against the
poyson of all sinnes and errours, the Church of Rome, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
much corrupted, still retaines; therefore wee hope shee erres not
fundamentally, but still remaines a Part of the Church. But this can be
no warrant to us to think with her in all things: seeing the very same
Scripture, which puts us in hope she erres not fundamentally, assures
us that in many things, and those of great moment she erres very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously.
And these Errours though to them that believe them, wee
hope they will not be pernicious, yet the professing of them against
conscience, could not but bring to us certain damnation. <hi>As for the
feare of departing from some fundamentall truths withall, while we depart
from her errours,</hi> Happily it might work upon us, if adhering to her
might secure us from it, and if nothing else could: But both these are
false. For first, adhering to her in all things cannot secure us from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in Fundamentals: Because though <hi>de facto</hi> we hope shee does not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7615:99"/>
erre, yet we know no privileges she has but she may erre in them her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
and therefore we had need haue better security hereof then her
bare Authority. Then secondly, without dependance on her at all, we
may be secured that we doe not erre fundamentally; I meane by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
al those things plainly set down in Scripture, wherein all things
necessary, and most things profitable are plainly delivered. Suppose <hi>I</hi>
were travelling to <hi>London,</hi> and knew two waies thither, the one very
safe and convenient, the other very inconvenient, and dangerous, but
yet a way to <hi>London:</hi> and that I overtook a Passenger on the way, who
himselfe believed, and would fain perswade me, there was no other
way but the worse, and would perswade me to accompany him in it,
because I confessed his way, though very inconvenient, yet a way; so
that going that way we could not faile of our journies end, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of both parties: but he believed, my way to be none at all; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I might justly feare, least out of a desire of leaving the worst way,
I left the true, and the only way: If now I should not bee more secure
upon my own knowledge, then frighted by this fallacy, would you
not beg me for a fool? Iust so might you think of us, if we would bee
frighted out of our own knowledge by this bugbeare. For the only &amp;
the main reason why we believe you not to erre in Fundamentalls, is
your holding the <hi>Doctrines of faith in Christ and Repentance:</hi> which
knowing we hold as well as you, notwithstanding our departure from
you, we must needs know that we doe not erre in Fundamentalls, as
well as we know that you doe not erre in some Fundamentals, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot possibly feare the contrary. Yet let us be more liberall
to you, and grant that which can never be proved, that God had said
in plain tearmes, <hi>The Church of Rome shall never destroy the Foundation,</hi>
but with all had said, <hi>that it might and would lay much hay and stubble
upon it;</hi> That you should never hold any Errour destructive of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but yet many that were prejudiciall to Edification: I demand,
might we haue dispensed with our selves in the believing and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
these Errours in regard of the smalnesse of them? Or had it not
been a damnable sinne to doe so, though the Errours in themselves
were not damnable? Had we not had as plain direction to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you in some things profitable, as to adhere to you in things necessary?
In the beginning of your Book, when it was for your purpose to haue
it so, the greatnesse or smalnesse of the matter was not considerable,
the Evidence of the Revelation was all in all. But here wee must erre
with you in small things, for feare of loosing your direction in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and for feare of departing too far from you, not goe from you at
all, even where we see plainly that you haue departed from the
Truth.</p>
               <p>57 Beyond all this, I say, that this which you say <hi>in wisdome we
are to doe,</hi> is not only unlawfull, but, if we will proceed according to
reason, impossible. I meane to adhere to you in all things, having no
other ground for it, but because you are (as we will now suppose) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in some things, that is, in Fundamentalls. For, whether by
skill in Architecture a large structure may be supported by a narrow
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7615:99"/>
foundation, I know not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but sure I am, in reason, no conclusion can
be larger then the Principles on which it is founded. And therefore if I
consider what I doe, and be perswaded, that your infallibility, is but
limited, and particular, and partiall, my adherence upon this ground,
cannot possibly be Absolute and Vniversall and Totall. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that should I meet with such a man amongst you (as I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
there be many) that would grant your Church infallible only
in fundamentalls, which what they are he knowes not, and therefore
upon this only reason adheres to you in all things: I say that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
that it may be demonstrated, that such a man adheres to you,
with a fiduciall and certain assent in nothing. To make this cleare (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
at the first hearing it may seem strange) give me leave, good Sir,
to suppose you the man, and to propose to you a few questions, and to
give for you such answers to them, as upon this ground you must of
necessity give, were you present with mee. First, supposing you hold
your Church infallible in fundamentalls, obnoxious to errour in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, and that you know not what points are fundamentall, I
demand, C. Why doe you believe the doctrine of Transubstantiation?
K. because the Church hath taught it, which is infallible. C. What?
Infallible in all things, or only in Fundamentalls? K. in Fundamentals
only. C. Then in other points She may erre? K. she may. C. and doe
you know what Points are Fundamentall, what not? K. No, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I believe her in all things, least I should disbelieve her in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls.
C. How know you then, whether this be a fundamentall
Point or no? K. I know not. C. It may be then (for ought you know)
an unfundamentall point? K. yes, it may be so. C. And in these you
said the Church may erre? K. yes I did so. C. Then possibly it may
erre in this? K. It may doe so. C. Then what certainty have you, that
it does not erre in it? K. None at all, but upon this supposition, that
this is a fundamentall. C. And this supposition you are uncertain of?
K. Yes, I told you so before. C. And therefore, you can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of that, which depends upon this uncertainty, saving only a
suppositive certainty, if it be a fundamentall truth, which is in plain
English to say, you are certain it is true, if it be both true and neccessary.
Verily Sir, if you have no better faith then this, you are no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.
K. Good words I pray! I am so, and God willing will be so.
C. You mean, in outward profession and practise, but in belief you
are not, no more then a Protestant is a Catholique. For every Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
yeelds such a kind of assent to all the proposalls of the Church,
for surely they believe them true, if they be fundamentall truths. And
therefore you must either believe the Church Infallible in all her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posalls,
be they foundations, or be they superstructions, or else you
must believe all Fundamentall which shee proposes, or else you are
no Catholique. K. But I have been taught, that <hi>seeing I believed the
Church infallible in points necessary, in wisdome I was to believe her in
every thing.</hi> C. That was a pretty plausible inducement, to bring
you hither, but now you are here, you must goe farther, and believe
her infallible in all things, or else you were as good goe back again,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7615:100"/>
which will be a great disparagement to you, and draw upon you both
the bitter and implacable hatred of our Part, and even with your own,
the imputation of rashnesse and levitie. You see, I hope, by this time,
that though a man did believe your Church infallible in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
yet he has no reason to doe you the curtesy, of believing all her
proposalls; nay if he be ignorant what these Fundamentalls are, he has
no certain ground to believe her, upon her Authority in any thing. And
whereas you say, it can be no imprudence to erre with the Church; I
say, it may be very great imprudence, if the question be, Whether we
should erre with the present Church, or hold true with God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p>58 <hi>But we are under pain of Damnation to believe and obey her in
greater things, and therefore cannot in wisdome suspect her credit in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of lesse moment,</hi> Ans. I have told you already, that this is falsely to
suppose, that wee grant that in some certain points, some certain
Church is infallibly assisted, and under pain of damnation to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
whereas all that we say is this, that in some place or other, some
Church there shall be, which shall retain all necessary Truths. Yet if
your supposition were true, I would not grant your conclusion, but
with this exception, unlesse the matter were past suspicion, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
certain, that in these things, I cannot believe God, and believe
the Church. For then I hope you will grant, that be the thing of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so little moment, were if, for instance, but that <hi>S. Paul left his cloak
at Troas,</hi> yet I were not to gratify the Church so farre, as for her sake
to disbelieve what God himselfe has revealed.</p>
               <p>59 Whereas you say, <hi>Since we are undoubtedly obliged to believe
her in Fundamentalls, and cannot know precisely, what those fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls
be, we cannot without hazard of our soules leave her in any point;</hi>
I ans. First, that this argument proceeds upon the same false ground
with the former. And then, that I have told you formerly, that you
fear where no fear is; And though we know not precisely, just how
much is Fundamentall, yet we know, that the Scripture containes all
Fundamentalls and more too; and therefore that in believing that, we
believe all Fundamentalls and more too. And consequently in depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from you, can be in no danger of departing from that which may
prove a Fundamentall truth: For we are well assured that certain Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
can never prove Fundamentall Truths.</p>
               <p>60 Whereas you adde, That <hi>that visible Church which cannot
erre in Fundamentall, propounds all her definitions without distinction to
be believed under Anathema's:</hi> Ans. Again you begge the question,
supposing untruly, that there is, any <hi>that Visible Church,</hi> I mean any
Visible Church of one Denomination, which cannot erre in points
Fundamentall. Secondly, proposing definitions to be believed under
Anathema's, is no good argument, that the Propounders conceive
themselves infallible; but only, that they conceive the Doctrine they
condemne is evidently damnable. A plain proof hereof is this, that
particular Councells, nay Particular men, have been very liberall of
their Anathema's, which yet were never conceived infallible, either
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7615:100"/>
by others or themselves. If any man should now deny Christ to be
the Saviour of the world, or deny the Resurrection, I should make no
great scruple of Anathematizing his doctrine, and yet am very farre
from dreaming of Infallibility.</p>
               <p>61 And for the <hi>Visible Churches holding it a point necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that we believe she cannot erre,</hi> I know no such tenet; unlesse
by the Church, you mean the Roman Church, which you have as
much reason to doe, as that petty King in Africk hath, to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himself
King of all the world. And therefore your telling us, <hi>if she
speak true, what danger is it not to believe her? and if false, that it is not
dangerous to believe her,</hi> Is somewhat like your Popes setting your
Lawyers to dispute whether <hi>Constantines Donation</hi> were valid or no;
whereas the matter of fact was the farre greater question, whether
there were any such Donation, or rather when without question
there was none such. That you may not seem to delude us in like
manner, make it appear, that the visible Church doth hold so as you
pretend: and then whether it be true or false, we will consider after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
But for the present, with this invisible tenet of the Visible
Church, wee will trouble our selves no farther.</p>
               <p>62 The effect of the next Argument is this, <hi>I cannot without grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
sinne disobey the Church, unlesse I know she commands those things
which are not in her power to command: and how farre this power extends,
none can better informe me then the Church. Therefore I am to obey, so
farre as the Church requires my obedience.</hi> I answer, First, that neither
hath the Catholique Church, but only a corrupt part of it declared
her selfe, nor required our obedience, in the points contested among
us. This therefore is falsely, and vainly supposed here by you, being
one of the greatest questions amongst us. Then secondly, that God
can better informe us, what are the limits of the Churches power,
then the Church her selfe, that is, then the Roman Clergy, who being
men subject to the same passions with other men, why they should be
thought the best Iudges in their own cause, I doe not well understand!
But yet we oppose against them, no humane decisive Iudges, not any
Sect or Person, but only God and his Word. And therefore it is in
vain to say, That <hi>in following her, you shall be sooner excused, then in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
any Sect or Man applying Scriptures against her Doctrine:</hi> In as
much as we never went about to arrogate to our selves that infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or absolute Authority, which we take away from you. But if you
would haue spoken to the purpose, you should haue said, that in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
her you should sooner haue been excusd, then in cleaving to
the Scripture, and to God himselfe.</p>
               <p>63 Whereas you say, <hi>The fearfull examples of innumerable persons,
who for saking the Church, upon pretence of her errours, have failed even
in fundamentall points, ought to deterre all Christians from opposing her
in any one doctrine or practise;</hi> This is, just as if you should say, divers
men have fallen into Scylla, with going too farre from Charybdis, be
sure therefore ye keep close to Charybdis: divers leaving Prodigality,
have fallen into covetousnesse, therefore be you constant to prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7615:101"/>
Many have fallen from worshipping God perversely and foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not to worship him at all, from worshipping many Gods, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
none; this therefore ought to deterre men, from leaving super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
or Idolatry, for fear of falling into Atheisme and Impiety. This
is your counsell and Sophistry: but God saies clean contrary; <hi>Take
heed you swerve not, either to the right hand or to the left: you must not
doe evill that good may come thereon;</hi> therefore neither that you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
a greater evill, you must not be obstinate in a certain error, for
fear of an uncertain. What if some, forsaking the Church of Rome,
have forsaken Fundamentall truths? Was this because they forsook the
Church of Rome? No sure, this is <hi>causa pro non causa:</hi> for else all that
have forsaken that Church should have done so, which we say they
have not. But because they went too farre from her, the golden mean,
the narrow way is hard to be found, and hard to be kept; hard, but not
impossible: hard, but yet you must not please your selfe out of it,
though you erre on the right hand, though you offend on the milder
part, for this is the only way that leads to life, and few there be that
find it. It is true if we said, there were no danger in being of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church, and there were danger in leaving it, it were madnesse to
perswade any man to leave it. But we protest and proclaime the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and that we have very little hope of their Salvation, who either
out of negligence in seeking the truth, or unwillingnesse to find it, live
and dye in the errors and impieties of that Church: and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but conceive those feares to be most foolish, and ridiculous, which
perswade men to be constant in one way to hell, least happily if they
leave it, they should fall into another.</p>
               <p>64 But, <hi>Not only others, but even Protestants themselves, whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
ought most to move us, pretending to reforme the Church are come
to affirme that she perished for many ages: which D. Potter cannot deny to
be a fundamentall errour, against the Article of the Creed, I believe the
Catholique Church, seeing he affirmes, the Donatists erred Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
in confining it to Africa.</hi> To this I Answer, First, that the errour
of the Donatists was not, that they held it possible that some, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or most parts of Christendome, might fall away from Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that the Church may loose much of her amplitude, and be
contracted to a narrow compasse in comparison of her former extent:
which is prov'd not only possible but certain, by irrefragable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
For who knowes not, that Gentilisme, and Mahumetisme,
mans wickednesse deserving it, and Gods providence permitting it,
have prevail'd, to the utter extirpation of Christianity, upon farre
the greater part of the world? And S. <hi>Austin</hi> when he was out of the
heat of Disputation, confesses the Militant Church to be <hi>like the
Moon,</hi> sometimes increasing, and sometimes decreasing. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was no errour in the Donatists, that they held it possible, that the
Church, from a larger extent, might be contracted to a lesser: nor
that they held it possible to be reduced to Africa; (For why not to
Africk then, as well as within these few ages, you pretend it was to
Europe? But their error was, that they held <hi>de facto,</hi> this was done
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7615:101"/>
when they had no just ground or reason to doe so: and so upon a vain
pretence which they could not justify, seperated themselves from the
communion of all other parts of the Church: and that they required it
as a necessary condition to make a man a member of the Church, that
he should be of their communion, and divide himselfe from all other
Communions from which they were divided: which was a condition
both unnecessary and unlawfull to be required, and therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
of it was directly opposite to the Churches Catholicisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the
very same nature with their Errours who required Circumcision, and
the keeping of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as necessary to salvation. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
requires harder or heavier conditions of men, then God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of them, he it is that is properly an Enemie of the Churches
Vniversality, by hindering either Men or Countries from adjoyning
themselves to it; which, were it not for these unnecessary and therefore
unlawful conditions, in probability would haue made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> members of
it. And seeing the present Church of Rome perswades men they were
as good (for any hope of Salvation they haue) not to be Christians as
not to be Roman Catholiques, believe nothing at all, as not believe all
which they impose upon them: Be absolutely out of the Churches
Communion, as be out of their Communion, or be in any other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be not guilty of the same crime, with the <hi>Donatists</hi> &amp; those
Zelots of the Mosaicall Law, I leave it to the judgement of those
that understand reason! This is sufficient to shew the vanity of this
Argument. But I adde moreover, that you neither haue named those
Protestants who held the Church to haue perished for many ages;
who perhaps held not the destruction but the corruption of the church;
not that the true Church, but that the pure Church perished: or rather
that the Church perished not from its life and existence, but from its
purity and integrity, or perhaps from its splendour and visibility. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have you proved by any one reason, but only affirmed it, to be a
fundamentall Errour, to hold, that the Church militant may possibly
bee driven out of the world, and abolished for a time from the face of
the earth.</p>
               <p>65 <hi>But to accuse the Church of any Errour in faith, is to say, she lost
all faith: For this is the Doctrine of Catholique Divines, that one Errour
in faith destroyes faith.</hi> To which I answer, that to accuse the Church
of some Errour in faith, is not to say she lost all faith: For this is not the
doctrine of Catholique Divines; But that he which is an Heretique in
one Article, may haue true faith of other Articles. And the contrary
is only said and not shewed in <hi>Charity Mistaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>66 <hi>Ad</hi> § 21. D. <hi>Potter</hi> saies, <hi>We may not depart from the Church
absolutely, and in all things:</hi> and from hence you conclude: <hi>Therefore
we may not depart from it in any thing.</hi> And this Argument you call a
Demonstration. But a Fallacy, <hi>à dicto simpliciter ad dictum secundum
quid,</hi> was not used heretofore to be called a Demonstration. D. <hi>Potter</hi>
sayes not, that you may not depart from any opinion or any practise
of the Church: for you tell us in this very place, that he saies, even the
Catholique may erre: and every man may lawfully depart from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7615:102"/>
He only sayes, <hi>you may not cease to be of the Church, nor depart
from those things which make it so to be;</hi> and from hence you inferre a
necessity of forsaking it in nothing. Iust as if you should argue thus:
You may not leaue your friend or brother, therefore you may not
leave the Vice of your friend, or the Errour of your brother. What he
saies of the Catholique Church, p. 75. the same hee extends presently
after, <hi>to every true, though never so corrupted part of it.</hi> And why doe
you not conclude from hence, that no particular Church (according
to his judgement) can fall into any Errour, and call this a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
too? For as he saies, p. 75. That <hi>there can be no just cause to depart
from the whole Church of Christ, no more then from Christ himselfe;</hi> So
p. 76. He tells you, that <hi>whosoever forsakes any one true member of
this body, for sakes the whole.</hi> So that what he saies of the one, hee saies
of the other; and tells you, that neither Vniversall nor Particular
Church, so long as they continue so, may bee forsaken, hee meanes,
<hi>Absolutely,</hi> no more then Christ himselfe may be forsaken absolutely:
For the Church is the body of Christ, and whosoever forsakes either
the Body, or his coherence to any one part of it, must forsake his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
and relation to the Head. Therefore whosoever forsakes
the Church, or any Christian, must forsake Christ himselfe.</p>
               <p>67 But then he tells you plainly in the same place, <hi>That it may be
lawfull and necessary to depart from a Particular Church in some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Practises:</hi> And this he would haue said even of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church, if there had been occasion, but there was none. For there
he was to declare and justifie our departure, not from the Catholique
Church, but the Roman, which we maintain to be a particular Church.
But in other places, you confesse his doctrine to be, that even the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
church may erre in points not Fundamentall; which you doe
not pretend that he ever imputed to Christ himselfe. And therefore
you cannot with any candor interpret his words, as if he had said, We
may not forsake the Church in any thing, no more then Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
but only thus, We may not cease to be of the Church, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it absolutely and totally, no more then Christ himselfe. And thus
we see sometimes a mountain may travail, and the production may
be a mouse.</p>
               <p>68 <hi>Ad</hi> § 22. But D. <hi>Potter, either contradicts himselfe, or else must
grant the Church infallible; Because he saies, if we did not differ from the
Roman, we could not agree with the Catholique: which saying supposes the
Catholique Church cannot erre.</hi> Answer, This Argument, to giue it
the right name, is an obscure and intricate nothing. And to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
so, let us suppose, in contradiction to your supposition, either
that the Catholique Church may erre, but doth not, but that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
actually doth: or that the Catholique Church doth erre in some
few things, but that the Roman erres in many more. And is it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
in both these cases (which yet both suppose the Churches Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility)
a man may truly say, unlesse I dissent in some opinions from
the Roman Church, I cannot agree with the Catholique? Either
therefore you must retract your imputation laid upon D. <hi>Potter,</hi> or
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7615:102"/>
doe that which you condemne in him, and be driven to say, that the
same man may hold some errours with the Church of Rome, and at
the same time with the Catholique Church not hold but condemne
them. For otherwise in neither of these cases is it possible for the same
man at the same time, to agree both with the Roman and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
               <p>69 In all these Texts of Scripture, which are here alleaged in this
last Section of this Chapter, or in any one of them, or in any other,
doth God say cleerly and plainly, <hi>The Bishop of Rome and that Society
of Christians which adheres to him shall bee ever the infallible guide of
Faith?</hi> You will confesse, I presume, he doth not, and will pretend, it
was not necessary. Yet if the King should tell us the Lord Keeper
should judge such and such causes, but should either not tell us at all,
or tell us but doubtfully who should be Lord Keeper, should we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing the neerer for him to an end of contentions? Nay rather
would not the dissentions about the Person who it is, increase con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
rather then end them? Iust so it would have been, if God had
appointed a Church tobe judge of Controversies, and had not told us
which was that Church. Seeing therefore God does nothing in vain
and seeing it had been in vain, to appoint a judge of Controversies, and
not to tell us plainly who it is, and seeing lastly, he hath not told us
plainly, no not at all who it is, is it not evident he hath appointed none?
Ob. But (you will say perhaps) <hi>if it be granted once, that some Church
of one denomination, is the infallible guide of faith, it will be no difficult
thing to prove, that yours is the Church, seeing no other Church pretends
to be so.</hi> Ans. Yes, the Primitive and the Apostolique Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to be so. That assures us, that the <hi>spirit was promised, and given
to them, to lead them into all saving truth,</hi> that they might lead others.
Ob. <hi>But that Church is not now in the world, and how then, can it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be the guide of Faith?</hi> Ans. It is now in the world sufficiently,
to be our guide: not by the Persons of those men that were members
of it, but by their Writings which doe plainly teach us, what truth they
were led into, and so lead us into the same truth. Ob. <hi>But these writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
were the writings of some particular men, and not of the Church of
those times: how then doth that Church guide us by these writings? Now
these places shew that a Church is to be our guide, therefore they cannot
be so avoided.</hi> Ans. If you regard the conception and production of
these writings, they were the writings of particular men: But if you
regard the Reception, and approbation of them, they may be well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the writings of the Church, as having the attestation of the
Church, to have been written by those that were inspired, and directed
by God. As a statute, though pen'd by some one man, yet being rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Parliament, is called the Act, not of that man, but of the
Parliament. Ob. But the <hi>words seem cleerly enough to prove, that the
Church, the Present Church of every Age, is Vniversally infallible.</hi> Ans.
For my part, I know I am as willing and desirous, that the Bishop or
Church of Rome should be infallible, (provided I might know it) as
they are to be so esteemed. But he that would not be deceived must
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7615:103"/>
take heed, that he take not his desire that a thing should be so, for a
reason that it is so. For if you look upon Scripture, through such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
as these, they will appeare to you, of what colour pleases your
fancies best: and will seem to say, not what they doe say, but what you
would have them. As some say the <hi>Manna,</hi> wherewith the Israelites
were fed in the Wildernesse, had in every mans mouth, that very tast
which was most agreeable to his palate. For my part I professe, I have
considered them a thousand times, and have looked upon them (as
they say,) on both sides, and yet to me they seeme to say no such
matter.</p>
               <p>70 Not the First. For the <hi>Church may erre, and yet the gates
of Hell not prevail against her.</hi> It may erre, and yet continue still a true
Church, and bring forth Children unto God, and send soules to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And therefore this can doe you no service, without the plain beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the point of Question. <hi>viz.</hi> That every errour is one of the
gates of Hell. Which we absolutely deny, and therefore, you are not
to suppose, but to prove it. Neither is our denyall without reason.
For seeing you doe, and must grant, that a particular Church, may
hold some errour, and yet be still a true member of the Church: why
may not the Vniversall Church, hold the same errour, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the true Vniversall?</p>
               <p>71 Not the Second or Third. For <hi>the spirit of Truth, may be with
a Man, or a Church for ever, and teach him all Truth:</hi> And yet he may
fall into some errour, if this, <hi>all,</hi> be not <hi>simply all,</hi> but all of some kind:
which you confesse to be so unquestioned and certain, that you are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with D. <hi>Potter,</hi> for offering to prove it. Secondly, he may fall
into some errour, even contrary to the truth which is taught him, if
it be taught him <hi>only sufficiently, and not irresistibly,</hi> so that he may
learne it if he will, not so that he must and shall, whether he will or no.
Now who can ascertain me, that the spirits teaching is not of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Or how can you possibly reconcile it, with your doctrine of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
in believing, if it be not of this nature? Besides, the word in the
Originall is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies, to be a guide and director only,
not to compell or necessitate. Who knowes not, that a guide may set
you in the right way, and you may either negligently mistake, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
leave it? And to what purpose doth God complain so often, and
so earnestly of some, that <hi>had eyes to see and would not see, that stopped
their eares, and closed their eyes, least they should hear and see?</hi> Of others
<hi>that would not understand, least they should doe good: that the light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the darknesse comprehended it not:</hi> That <hi>he came unto his own,
and his own received him not: That light came into the world, and men
loved darknesse more then light? To what purpose should he wonder, so
few believed his report, and that to so few his arme was revealed: And
that when he comes, he should find no faith upon earth; If his outward
teaching were not of this nature,</hi> that it might be followed, and might
be resisted? And if it be, then God may teach, and the Church not
learn: God may lead, and the Church be refractory and not follow.
And indeed, who can doubt, that hath not his eyes vailed with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7615:103"/>
that God hath taught the Church of Rome plain enough in the
Ep. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>all things in the Church are to be done for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,</hi>
and that, in any publique Prayers, or Thanks-givings, or
Hymnes, or Lessons of instruction, to <hi>use a language,</hi> which the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<hi>generally understand not,</hi> is not for edification? Though the
Church of Rome will not learne this, for feare of confessing an errour,
and so overthrowing her Authority, yet the time will come, when it
shall appeare, that not only by Scripture, they were taught this suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
and commanded to believe, but by reason and common sense.
And so for the Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in both kindes, who can deny but they
are taught it by our Saviour <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. in these words, according to most
of your own expositions, <hi>Vnlesse you eat the Flesh of the sonne of Man,
and drink his Blood, you have no life in you.</hi> (If our Saviour speake
there of the Sacrament, as to them he does, because they conceive he
does so.) Though they may pretend, that receiving in one kind, they
receive the blood together with the body, yet they can with no face
pretend that they drink it: And so obey not our Saviours injunction
according to the letter, which yet they <hi>professe is litterally, alwaies to
be obeyed, unlesse some impiety, or some absurdity force us to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
and they are not yet arrived to that impudence to pretend, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there is impiety or absurdity in receiving the Communion in
both kinds. This therefore they if not others, are plainly taught by
our Saviour in this place. But by S. <hi>Paul</hi> all without exception, when
he saies, <hi>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread and
drinke of this Chalice.</hi> This (<hi>a Man</hi>) that is to examine himselfe, is
<hi>every man,</hi> that can doe it: as is confessed on all hands. And therefore
it is all one, as if he had said, <hi>let every man examine himselfe, and so let
him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup.</hi> They which acknowledge
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, and S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell to be the Word of God, one
would thinke should not deny, but that they are taught these two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
plain enough. Yet we see they neither doe, nor will learn them.
I conclude therefore, that the spirit may very well teach the Church,
and yet the Church fall into and continue in Error, by not regarding
what she is taught by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>72 But all this I have spoken upon a supposition only, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto you, that though these promises, had been made unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church of every age (I might have said though they had been to
the Church of Rome by name,) yet no certainty of her Vniversall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
could be built upon them. But the plain truth is, that these
Promises are vainly arrogated by you, and were never made to you,
but to the Apostles only. I pray deale ingenuously and tell me, who
were they of whom our Saviour saies, <hi>These things have I spoken unto
you, being present with you.</hi> c. 14. 25. <hi>But the comforter, shall teach you
all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have
told you</hi> v. 26? Who are they to whom he saies, <hi>I goe away and come
again unto you; and I have told you before it come to passe:</hi> v. 28. 29. <hi>You
have been with me from the beginning:</hi> c. 15. v. 27? And again, <hi>these
things I have told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7615:104"/>
that I told you of them: and these things I said not to you at the begining,
because I was with you.</hi> c. 16. 4. <hi>And because I said these things unto you,
sorrow hath filled your hearts.</hi> v. 6? Lastly, who are they of whom he
saith v. 12. <hi>I have yet many things to say unto you, but yee cannot beare
them now?</hi> Doe not all these circumstances appropriate this whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of our Saviour to his Disciples, that were then with him, and
consequently, restrain the Promises of the spirit of truth, which was
<hi>to lead them into all truth,</hi> to their Persons only? And seeing it is so, is
it not an impertinent arrogance and presumption, for you to lay claim
unto them, in the behalfe of your Church? Had Christ been present
with your Church? Did the Comforter bring these things to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of your Church, which Christ had before taught and she
had forgotten? Was Christ then departing from your Church? And
did he tell of his departure before it came to passe? Was your Church
with him from the begining? Was your Church filled with sorrow,
upon the mentioning of Christs departure? Or lastly, did he, or could
he have said to your Church, which then was not extant, <hi>I have yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things to say unto you, but ye cannot beare them now?</hi> as he speaks in the
13. v. immediatly before the words by you quoted. And then goes
on, <hi>Howbeit when the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all
Truth.</hi> Is it not the same <hi>You</hi> he speaks to, in the 13. v. and that he
speaks to in the 14? And is it not apparent to any one that has but halfe
an eye, that in the 13. he speaks only to them that then were with him?
Besides in the very text by you alleaged, there are things promised,
which your Church cannot with any modesty pretend to. For there
it is said, <hi>the spirit of Truth,</hi> not only <hi>will guide you into all Truth,</hi> but
also <hi>will shew you things to come.</hi> Now your Church (for ought I
could ever understand) does not so much as pretend to the spirit of
Prophecie, and knowledge of future events: And therefore hath as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
cause to pretend to the former promise, of being <hi>led by the spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all truth.</hi> And this is the Reason, why both You in this place, and
generally, your Writers of Controversies, when they entreat of this
Argument, cite this Text perpetually by halfes, there being in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of it, a cleere, and convincing Demonstration, that you have
nothing to doe with the former. Vnlesse you will say, which is most
ridiculous, that when our Saviour said, <hi>He will teach you &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>he
will shew you &amp;c.</hi> He meant one <hi>You</hi> in the former clause, and another
<hi>You</hi> in the latter.</p>
               <p>73 Ob. But this <hi>is to confine Gods spirit to the Apostles only, or to
the Disciples, that then were present with him: which is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to many places of Scripture.</hi> Ans. I confesse, that to confine the Spirit
of God to those that were then present with Christ is against Scripture.
But I hope it is easy to conceive a difference, between confining the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> to them: and confining <hi>the promises made in this place</hi> to
them. God may doe many things which he does not promise at all:
much more, which he does not promise in such or such a place.</p>
               <p>74 Ob. But <hi>it is promised in the 14. Chap. that this spirit shall abide
with them for ever: Now they in their persons were not to abide for ever,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7615:104"/>
and therefore the Spirit could not abide with them, in their Persons for
ever, seeing the coexistence of two things, supposes of necessity; the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of either. Therefore the promise was not made to them only in
their Persons, but by them to the Church, which was to abide for ever.</hi>
Ans. Your Conclusion is, <hi>not to them only,</hi> but your Reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
either nothing at all, or that this Promise of abiding with them
for ever, was not made to their Persons at all; or if it were, that it was
not performed. Or if you will not say (as I hope you will not) that it
was not performed, nor that it was not made to their Persons at all;
then must you grant, that the word <hi>for ever,</hi> is here used in a sense
restrained, and accommodated to the subject here entreated of; and
that it signifies, <hi>not eternally,</hi> without end of time, <hi>but perpetually</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption, for the time of their liues. So that the force, and
sense of the Words is, that they should never want the Spirits as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in the performance of their function: And that the Spirit would
not (as Christ was to doe,) stay with them for a time, and afterwards
leave them, but would abide with them, if they kept their station, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the very end of their lives, which is mans <hi>for ever.</hi> Neither is this
use of the word, <hi>for ever,</hi> any thing strange, either in our ordinary
speech, wherein we use to say, this is mine for ever, this shall be yours
for ever, without ever dreaming of the Eternity, either of the thing or
Persons. And then in Scripture, it not only will bear, but requires this
sense very frequently, as <hi>Exod. 21. 6. Deut. 15. 17. his master shall boar
his eare through with an awle, and he shall serve him for ever. Ps. 52. 9.
I will praise thee for ever. Ps. 61. 4. I will abide in thy Tabernacle for ever.
Ps. 119. 111. Thy Testimonies have I taken as mine heritage for ever:</hi>
and lastly in the Epist. to <hi>Philemon, He therefore departed from thee for
a time, that thou shouldest receive him for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>75 And thus, I presume, I have shewed sufficiently, that this <hi>for
ever,</hi> hinders not, but that the promise may be appropriated to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
as by many other circumstances I have evinc'd it must be.
But what now, if the place produced by you, as a main pillar of your
Churches infallibility, prove upon tryall, an engine to batter and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
it, at least, (which is all one to my purpose) to take away
all possibility of our assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of it? This will seem strange newes to you
at first hearing, &amp; not farre from a prodigy. And I confesse, as you here
in this place, and generally all your Writers of controversy, by whom
this text is urged, order the matter, it is very much disabled, to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
service against you in this question. For with a bold sacriledge, and
horrible impiety, somewhat like <hi>Procrustes</hi> his cruelty, you perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
cut off the head and foot, the begining and end of it; and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your confidents, who usually read no more of the Bible, then
is alleadged by you, only these words, <hi>I will ask my Father, and he shall
give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever, even the
spirit of Truth,</hi> conceale in the mean time, the words before, and the
words after; that so, the promise of Gods Spirit, may seem to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
whereas it is indeed most cleerely and expresly conditionall:
being both in the words before, restrained to those only, that <hi>love God
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7615:105"/>
and keep his Commandements:</hi> and in the words after, flatly denyed to
all, whom the Scriptures stile by the name of <hi>the World,</hi> that is, as the
very Atheists give us plainly to understand, <hi>to all wicked and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men.</hi> Behold the place entire, as it is set down in your own Bible.
<hi>If ye love mee keep my Commandements, and I will aske my Father, and
he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever,
even the spirit of the Truth, whom the world cannot receive.</hi> Now from
the place there restored and vindicated from your mutilation, thus I
argue against your pretence. We can have no certainty of the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of your Church, but upon this supposition, that your Popes are
infallible in confirming with the Decrees of Generall Councells: we
can have no certainty hereof, but upon this supposition, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truth is promised to him, for his direction in this work. And of
this again we can have no certainty, but upon supposall, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
the condition, whereunto the promise of the spirit of truth is
expresly limited, <hi>viz. That he love God and keep his Commandements;</hi>
and of this finally, not knowing the Popes heart, we can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
at all; therefore from the first to the last, we can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
at all of your Churches infallibility. This is my first argument:
Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place another followes, which will charge you as home as the
former. If many of the Roman See, were such men as could not receive
the spirit of Truth, even men of the World, that is Worldly, Wicked,
Carnall, Diabolicall men, then the Spirit of Truth, is not here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but flatly denied them: and consequently we can have no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
neither of the Decrees of Councells, which these Popes confirme,
nor of the Churches infallibility, which is guided by these decrees:
But many of the Roman See, even by the confession of the most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
defenders of it, were such men: therefore the spirit of truth is
not here promised but denyed them, and consequently we can have no
certainty, neither of the Decrees which they confirme, nor of the
Churches infallibility, which guides herselfe by these Decrees.</p>
               <p>76 You may take as much time as you think fit, to answer these
Arguments. In the mean while I proceed to the consideration of the
next text alleaged for this purpose by you: out of S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Ep. to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy:</hi>
where he saith, as you say <hi>the Church is the Pillar and ground of
truth.</hi> But the truth is you are somewhat to bold with S. <hi>Paul.</hi> For he
saies not in formall termes, what you make him say, <hi>the Church is the
Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> neither is it certain that he meanes so: for
it is neither impossible nor improbable, that these words <hi>the pillar and
ground of truth,</hi> may have reference not to the Church, but to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
the sense of the place <hi>that thou maist know how to behave thy selfe,
as a pillar and ground of truth, in the Church of God, which is the house
of the living God,</hi> which exposition offers no violence at all to the
words, but only supposes an Ellipsis of the Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the greek ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ordinary. Neither wants it some likelihood, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> comparing
the Church to a house, should here exhort <hi>Timothy,</hi> to carry himself,
as a Pillar in that house should doe, according as he had given other
Principall men in the Church, the name of Pillars; rather then, having
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7615:105"/>
called the Church a <hi>House,</hi> to call it presently a <hi>Pillar;</hi> which may
seem somewhat heterogeneous. Yet if you will needs have S. <hi>Paul</hi>
referre this not to <hi>Timothy</hi> but the Church, I will not contend about
it any farther, then to say, possibly it may be otherwise. But then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
I am to put you in mind, that the Church which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here
speaks of, was that in which <hi>Timothy</hi> conversed, and that was a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church, and not the Roman; and such you will not have to be
Vniversally Infallible.</p>
               <p>77 Thirdly, if we grant you out of curtesy (for nothing can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
us to it) that he both speaks of the Vniversall Church, and saies
this of it, then I am to remember you, that many Attributes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are not notes of performance, but of duty, and teach us not what
the thing or Person is of necessity, but what it should be. <hi>Ye are the
salt of the Earth,</hi> said our Saviour to his disciples: not that this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was inseparable from their Persons, but because it was their office
to be so. For if they must have been so of necessity, and could not have
been otherwise, in vain had he put them in fear of that which followes,
<hi>If the salt hath lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
good for nothing, but to be cast forth, and to be trodden under foot.</hi>
So the Church may bee by duty, the pillar and ground, that is, the
Teacher of Truth, of all truth, not only necessary but profitable to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and yet she may neglect and violate this duty, and be in fact
the teacher of some Errour.</p>
               <p>78 Fourthly and lastly, if we deal most liberally with you, and
grant that the Apostle here speaks of the Catholique Church, calls it
the <hi>Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> and that not only because it should, but
because it alwaies shall and will be so, yet after all this, you have done
nothing; your bridge is too short, to bring you to the bank where you
would be, unlesse you can shew that by truth here, is certainly meant,
not only <hi>all necessary</hi> to salvation, but all that is profitable, absolutely
and <hi>simply All.</hi> For that the true Church alwaies shall bee the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer
and teacher of all necessary truth, you know we grant and must
grant, for it is of the essence of the Church to be so, and any company
of men were no more a Church without it, then any thing can be a
man, and not be reasonable. But as a man may be still a man, though
he want a hand or an eye, which yet are profitable parts, so the Church
may be still a Church, though it be defective in some profitable truth.
And as a man may be a man, that has some biles and botches on his
body, so the Church may be the Church, though it have many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
both in doctrine and practice.</p>
               <p>79 And thus you see we are at liberty from the former places;
having shewed that the sense of them, either must or may be such as
will doe your Cause no service. But the last you suppose, will be a
Gordian knot, and ties us fast enough: The words are, <hi>He gave some
Apostles, and some Prophets &amp;c. to the consummation of Saints, to the
work of the Ministry &amp;c. Vntill we all meet into the Vnity of faith &amp;c.
That we be not hereafter Children, wavering and carried up and downe
with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> Out of which words, this is the only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7615:106"/>
which you collect, or I can collect for you.</p>
               <p>There is no meanes to conserve unity of Faith, against every wind
of Doctrine, unlesse it be a Church universally infallible.</p>
               <p>But it is impious to say there is no meanes to conserue unity of
faith against every wind of Doctrine:</p>
               <p>Therefore there must be a Church Vniversally Infallible.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I answere, that your major is so farre from being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that it is plainly confuted, by the place alleadged. For that tels us
of another meanes for this purpose, to wit, the <hi>Apostles, and Prophets,
and Evangelists, and Pastors, and Doctors,</hi> which Christ gave upon his
Ascention, and that their <hi>consummating the Saints, doing the work of the
Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Edifying the body of Christ,</hi> was the meanes to bring
those (which are there spoken of, be they who they will,) to <hi>the unity
of Faith, and to perfection in Christ,</hi> that they might not be <hi>wavering,
and carried about, with every wind of false Doctrine.</hi> Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and Prophets, and Evangelists, and Pastors, and Doctors, are
not the present Church; therefore the Church is not the only means
for this end, nor that which is here spoken of.</p>
               <p>80 Peradventure by, <hi>he gave,</hi> you conceive, is to be understood,
<hi>he promised that he would give unto the worlds end.</hi> But what reason
have you for this conceipt? Can you shew that the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hath
this signification in other places, and that it must have it in this place?
Or will not this interpretation drive you presently to this blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
absurdity, that God hath not performed his promise? Vnlesse
you will say, which for shame I think you will not, that you have
now, and in all ages since Christ have had Apostles, and Prophets,
and Evangelists: for as for Pastors, and Doctors alone, they will not
serve the turne. For if God promised to give all these, then you must
say he hath given all, or else that he hath broke his promise. Neither
may you pretend, that the <hi>Pastors and Doctors were the same with the
Apostles, and Prophets, and Evangelists, and therefore having Pastors
and Doctors, you have all.</hi> For it is apparent, that by these names, are
denoted severall Orders of men, cleerely distinguished and diversified
by the Originall Text; but much more plainly by your own Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for so you read it, <hi>some Apostles, and some Prophets, and other some
Evangelists, and other some Pastors and Doctors:</hi> and yet more plainly
in the paralell place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. to which we are referr'd by your Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Translation, <hi>God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
Prophets, thirdly Teachers,</hi> therefore this subterfuge is stopped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you. Ob. But <hi>how can they, which died in the first Age, keep us in
Vnity, and guard us from Errour, that live now, perhaps in the last? This
seemes to be all one; as if a man should say, that Alexander, or Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
should quiet a mutiny in the King of Spaines Army.</hi> Ans. I hope you
will grant, that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Euclid,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and
<hi>Salust,</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Livie,</hi> were dead many ages since; and yet that
we are now preserved from error by them, in a great part of Physick,
of Geometry, of Logick, of the Roman story. But what if these men
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7615:106"/>
had writ by divine Inspiration, and writ compleat bodies of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
they professed, and writ them plainly and perspicuously? You
would then have granted, I believe, that their works had been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to keep us from errour, and from dissention in these matters. And
why then should it be incongruous to say, that the Apostles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Evangelists, and Pastors, and Doctors, which Christ gave
upon his ascention, by their writings, which some of them writ but all
approved, are even now sufficient meanes, to conserve us in Vnity
of faith, and guarde us from errour? Especially seeing these writings
are, by the confession of all parts, true and divine, and as we pretend
and are ready to prove, contain a plain and perfect Rule of Faith; and
as the<note n="*" place="margin">Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on.</note> Chiefest of you acknowledge, <hi>contain immediatly, all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
and Fundamentall points of Christianity,</hi> referring us to the
Church and Tradition only for some minute particularities. But tell
me I pray, the Bishops that composed the Decrees of the Councell of
<hi>Trent,</hi> and the Pope that confirmed them, are they meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
you in Unity, and keepe you from Error, or are they not?
Peradventure you will say, <hi>their Decree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are, but not their Persons:</hi> but
you will not deny I hope, that you owe your Vnity, and freedome
from Error, to the Persons that made these Decrees: neither will you
deny, that the writings which they have left behind them, are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for this purpose. And why may not then the Apostles writings
be as fit for such a purpose, as the Decrees of your Doctors? Surely
their intent in writing was to conserve us in Vnity of Faith, and to
keep us from errour, and we are sure God spake in them; but your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
from whence they are, we are not so certain. Was the Holy-Ghost
then unwilling, or unable to direct them so, that their writings
should be fit and sufficient to attain that end they aimed at in writing?
For if he were both able and willing to doe so, then certainly he did
doe so. And then their writings may be very sufficient meanes, if we
would use them as we should doe, to preserve us in Vnity, in all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
points of Faith, and to guard us from all pernitious Error.</p>
               <p>81 If yet you be not satisfied, but will still pretend that, <hi>all these
words by you cited, seem clearly enough to prove, that the Church is Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
infallible, without which Vnity of Faith could not be conserved
against every wind of Doctrine:</hi> I Ans. That to you, which will not
understand, that there can be any meanes to conserve the Vnity of
Faith, but only that which conserves your authority over the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
it is no marvell that these words seem to prove, that the Church,
nay that your Church is universally infallible. But we that have no
such end, no such desires, but are willing to leave all men to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
provided they will not improve it to a Tyranny over others,
we find it no difficulty to discern between <hi>dedit</hi> and <hi>promisit, he gave
at his Ascention,</hi> and <hi>he Promised to the worlds end.</hi> Besides, though you
whom it concernes, may happily flatter your selves, that you have not
only Pastors, and Doctors, but Prophets, and Apostles, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
and those distinct from the former still in your Church; yet we
that are disinteressed persons, cannot but smile at these strange ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7615:107"/>
Lastly, though you are apt to think your selves such neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
instruments for all good purposes, and that nothing can be well
done unlesse you doe it; that no unity or constancy in Religion can be
maintained, but inevitably Christendome must fall to ruine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
unlesse you support it: yet we that are indifferent and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and well content, that God should give us his owne favours, by
means of his own appointment, not of our choosing, can easily collect
out of these very words, that not the infallibility of your, or of any
Church, but the <hi>Apostles, and Prophets, and Evangelists &amp;c. which
Christ gave upon his Ascention,</hi> were designed by him, for the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all these excellent purposes, by their preaching while they lived,
and by their writings for ever. And if they faile hereof, the Reason is
not any insufficiency or invalidity in the meanes, but the voluntary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse
of the subjects they have to deal with: who, if they would
be themselves, and be content that others should be, in the choice of
their Religion the servants of God and not of men; if they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the way to heaven is no narrower now, then Christ left it,
his yoak no heavier then he made it; that the belief of no more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
is required now to Salvation, then was in the Primitive Church;
that no errour is in it selfe destructive, and exclusive from Salvation
now, which was not then; if instead of being zealous Papists, earnest
Calvinists, rigid Lutherans, they would become themselves, and be
content that others should be plain and honest Christians; if all men
would believe the Scripture, and freeing themselves from prejudice
and passion, would syncerely endeavour to finde the true sense of it,
and live according to it, and require no more of others, but to doe so;
nor denying their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Communion to any that doe so, would so order
their publique seruice of God, that all which doe so may without scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or hypocrisy, or protestation against any part of it, joyne with
them in it: who does not see that (seeing as we suppose here, and shall
prove hereafter,) all necessary truths, are plainly and evidently set
down in Scripture, there would of necessity be among all men, in all
things necessary, Vnity of Opinion? And notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding any other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
that are or could be, Vnity of Communion and Charity and
mutuall toleration? By which meanes, all Schisme and Heresy, would
be banished the world, and those wretched contentions which now
rend and teare in pieces, not the coat, but the members and bowels of
Christ, which mutuall pride and Tyranny, and cursing, and killing,
and damning, would fain make immortall, should speedily receive a
most blessed catastrophe. But of this hereafter, when we shall come to
the question of Schisme, wherein I perswade my selfe, that I shall
plainly shew, that the most vehement accusers, are the greatest offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and that they are indeed at this time, the greatest Schismatiques,
who make the way to heaven narrower, the yoak of Christ heavier,
the differences of Faith greater, the conditions of Ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
harder, and stricter, then they were made at the begining
by Christ and his Apostles: they who talk of Unity, but aime at Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and will have peace with none, but with their slaves and vassals.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7615:107"/>
In the mean while, though I have shewed how Vnity of Faith, &amp; Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Charity too, may be preserved without your Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
yet seeing you modestly conclude from hence, not that your
Church is, but only <hi>seemes to be</hi> universally infallible, meaning to
your selfe, of which you are a better judge then I: Therefore I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grant your conclusion, and proceed.</p>
               <p>82 Whereas you say, That D. <hi>Potter limits those promises and
privileges to fundamentall points:</hi> The truth is, with some of them hee
meddles not at all, neither doth his Adversary giue him occasion: Not
with those out of the Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> To the
rest he giues other answer besides this.</p>
               <p>83 But <hi>the words of Scripture by you alleaged are Vniversall, and
mention no such restraint to Fundamentals,</hi> as D. <hi>Potter</hi> applies to them:
I answer, That of the fiue Texts which you alleage, four are indefinite,
and only one universall, and that you confesse is to be restrained, and
are offended with D. <hi>Potter</hi> for going about to proue it. And <hi>Whereas
you say, they mention no restraint,</hi> intimating that therefore they are not
to be restrained, I tell you, this is no good consequence; for it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
out of the matter and circumstances, that they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in a restrained sense, notwithstanding no restraint be mentioned.
That place quoted by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and applied by him to our Saviour, <hi>He
hath put all things under his feet,</hi> mentions no exception; yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels
us, not only that it is true or certain, but <hi>it is manifest, that He is excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
which did put all things under him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>84 But <hi>your interpretation is better then D. Potters, because it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall.</hi>
I answer, His is Literall as well as yours: and you are mistaken if
you think a restrained sense may not be a literall sense; for to <hi>Restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
Literall</hi> is not opposed but <hi>unlimited</hi> or absolute, and to <hi>Literall,</hi> is
not oppos'd <hi>Restrained,</hi> but <hi>Figuratiue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>85 Whereas you say D. <hi>Potters Brethren reiecting his limitation,
restrain the mentioned Texts to the Apostles,</hi> implying hereby a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
between them and him: I answer, So does D. <hi>Potter</hi> restrain all
of them which he speaks of, in the pages by you quoted, to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
in the direct and primary sense of the words. Though he tels you
there, the words in a more restrained sense are true, being understood
of the Church Vniversall.</p>
               <p>86 As for your pretence, That <hi>to finde the meaning of those places,
you conferre divers Texts, you consult Originals, you examin Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and use all the meanes by Protestants appointed,</hi> I haue told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that all this is vain and hypocriticall, if (as your manner &amp; your
doctrine is) you giue not your selfe liberty of judgement in the use of
these meanes; if you make not your selves Iudges of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only Advocats
for the doctrine of your Church, refusing to see what these meanes
shew you, if it any way make against the doctrine of your Church,
though it be as cleare as the light at noone. Remoue prejudice, Even
the ballance, and hold it even, make it indifferent to you which way
you goe to heaven, so you goe the true, which Religion be true so you
be of it, then use the meanes and pray for Gods assistance, and as sure
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7615:108"/>
as God is true, you shall be lead into all necessary Truth.</p>
               <p>87 Whereas you say, <hi>you neither doe, nor haue any possible meanes
to agree, as long as you are left to your selues:</hi> The first is very true, That
while you differ, you doe not agree. But for the second, That you haue
no possible means of agreement, as long as you are left to your selues,
i. e. to your own reasons and judgement, this sure is very false, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe you offer any proofe of it, unlesse you intended this, that you
<hi>doe not</hi> agree, for a proof that you <hi>cannot;</hi> which sure is no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
not halfe so good as this which I oppose against it: D. <hi>Potter</hi>
and I by the use of these meanes by you mentioned doe agree concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the sense of these places, therefore there is a possible meanes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
and therefore you also if you would use the same meanes,
with the same minds, might agree so farre as it is necessary, and it is not
necessary that you should agree further. Or if there bee no possible
meanes to agree about the sense of these Texts, whilst wee are left to
our selves, then sure it is impossible that we should agree in your sense
of them which was: That the Church is universally infallible. For if
it were possible for us to agree in this sense of them, then it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for us to agree. And why then said you of the selfe same Texts
but in the page next before, <hi>These words seem cleerly enough to proue
that the Church is Vniversally infallible,</hi> A strange forgetfulnesse, that
the same man, almost in the same breath should say of the same words,
They seem cleerly enough to proue such a conclusion true, &amp; yet that
three indifferent men, all presum'd to be lovers of Truth, and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
searchers of it should haue no possible meanes, while they follow
their own reason to agree in the Truth of this Conclusion!</p>
               <p>88 Whereas you say, that <hi>it were great impiety to imagine that
God, the lover of Soules, hath left no certaine infallible meanes to decide
both this and all other differences arising about the interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or upon any other occasion:</hi> I desire you to take heed, you commit
not an impiety in making more impieties then Gods Commandements
make. Certainly God is no way oblig'd either by his promise or his
Loue to giue us all things, that we may imagine would be convenient
for us, as formerly I haue proved at large. It is sufficient that he denies
us nothing necessary to Salvation. <hi>Deus non deficit in necessariis, nec re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundat
in superfluis:</hi> So D. <hi>Stapleton.</hi> But that the ending of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
or having a certain meanes of ending them, is necessary to
Salvation, that you haue often said and suppos'd, but never proved,
though it be the main pillar of your whole discourse. So little care
you take how slight your Foundations are, so your building make a
faire shew. And as little care, how you commit those faults your selfe,
which you condemne in others. For you here charge them with great
impiety, who imagine that <hi>God the lover of Soules hath left no infallible
meanes to determine all differences arising about the interpretation of
Scripture, or upon any other occasion:</hi> And yet afterwards being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by D. <hi>Potter, why the Questions between the Iesuits &amp; Dominicans
remain undetermined?</hi> You returne him this crosse interrogatory, <hi>Who
hath assured you that the point wherein these learned men differ, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7615:108"/>
Truth, or capable of definition, or is not rather by plain Scripture
indeterminable, or by any Rule of faith?</hi> So then when you say, <hi>it were
great impiety to imagine that God hath not left infallible meanes to decide
all differences;</hi> I may answer, It seemes you doe not believe your selfe.
For in this controversie which is of as high consequence as any can be,
you seem to be doubtfull whether there be any meanes to determin it.
On the other side, when you aske D. <hi>Potter, who assured him that there
it any meanes to determine this Controversie?</hi> I answer for him, that you
have, in calling <hi>it a great impiety to imagine that there is not some infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
meanes to decide this and all other differences arising about the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Scripture, or upon any other occasion.</hi> For what trick you
can devise to shew that this difference, between the Dominicans and
Iesuits, which includes a difference about the sense of many Texts of
Scripture, &amp; many other matters of moment, was not included under
<hi>this and all other differences,</hi> I cannot imagine. Yet if you can finde out
any, thus much at least we shall gain by it, <hi>that generall speeches are not
alwaies to be understood generally, but sometimes with exceptions and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>89 But if there be any infallible meanes to decide all differences, I
beseech you name them. <hi>You say it is to consult and heare Gods Visible
Church with submissive acknowledgment of her Infallibility.</hi> But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the difference be (as here it is) <hi>whether your Church be infalli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le,</hi>
what shall decide that? If you would say (as you should dot) Scripture
and Reason, then you foresee that you should be forced to grant that
these are fit meanes to decide this Controversie, and therefore may be
as fit to decide others. Therefore to avoid this, you runne into a most
ridiculous absurdity, and tell us that this difference also, whether the
Church be infallible, as well as others, must be agreed by <hi>a submissiue
acknowledgment of the Churches infallibility.</hi> As if you should haue
said, My Brethren I perceiue this is a great contention amongst you,
whether the Roman Church be infallible? If you will follow my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
I will shew you a ready meanes to end it; you must first agree that
the Roman Church is infallible, and then your contention whether
the Roman Church be infallible, will quickly be at an end. Verily a
most excellent advice, and most compendious way of ending all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
even without troubling the Church to determine them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
why may not you say in all other differences, as you haue done in this?
Agree that the Pope is supream head of the Church: That the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament is turned into the body, &amp;
bloud of Christ: That the Communion is to be given to Lay-men but
in one kind: That Pictures may be worshipped: That Saints are to bee
invocated; and so in the rest, and then your differences about the
Popes Supremacy, Transubstantiation, and all the rest will speedily be
ended. If you say, the advice is good in this, but not in other cases, I
must request you not to expect alwaies, to be believed upon your
word, but to shew us some reason, why any one thing, namely the
Churches infallibility, is fit to prove it selfe; and any other thing, by
name the Popes Supremacy, or Transubstantiation is not as fit? Or if for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7615:109"/>
shame you will at length confesse, that the Churches infallibility is not
fit to decide this difference, whether the Church be infallible, then
you must confesse it is not fit to decide all: Vnlesse you will say, it may
be fit to decide all, and yet not fit to decide this, or pretend that this
is not comprehended under all. Besides if you grant that your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
infallibilitie cannot possibly be well grounded upon, or decided
by it selfe, then having professed before, that <hi>there is no possible meanes
besides this, for us to agree hereupon,</hi> I hope you will giue mee leaue to
conclude, that it is impossible upon good ground for us to agree that
the Roman Church is infallible. For certainly light it selfe, is not more
cleere then the evidence of this syllogisme;</p>
               <p>If there be no other meanes to make men agree upon your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
infallibility, but only this, and this be no meanes, then it is
simply impossible for men upon good grounds to agree that your
Church is infallible:</p>
               <p>But there is (as you haue granted) no other possible meanes to
make men agree hereupon, but only a submissive acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Infallibility, And this is apparently no meanes;</p>
               <p>Therefore it is simply impossible for men upon good grounds to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that your Church is infallible.</p>
               <p>90 Lastly to the place of S. <hi>Austine, wherein we are advis'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the way of Catholique discipline, which from Christ himselfe by the
Apostles hath come down even to us, and from us shall descend to all posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
I answer, That the way which S. <hi>Austine</hi> spake of, &amp; the way which
you commend, being divers waies, &amp; in many things cleane contrary,
we cannot possibly follow them both; and therefore for you to apply
the same words to them is a vaine equivocation. Shew us any way, &amp;
doe not say, but proue it <hi>to haue come from Christ &amp; his Apostles down
to us;</hi> and we are ready to follow it. Neither doe wee expect demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
hereof, but such reasons as may make this more probable then
the contrary. But if you bring in things into your now Catholique
Discipline, which Chistians in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time held abominable, (as the
picturing of God,) &amp; which you must confesse to haue come into the
Church seven hundred yeares after Christ: if you will bring in things,
as you haue done the halfe Communion, with a <hi>non obstante, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Christs Institution, and the practise of the Primitive Church
were to the contrary:</hi> If you will doe such things as these, and yet would
haue us believe, that your whole Religion came from Christ and his
Apostles, this we conceive a request too unreasonable for modest men
to make, or for wise men to grant.</p>

not, what points are necessary to be explicitely believed; but what points
may be lawfully <hi>disbelieved,</hi> or rejected after sufficient Proposition that they
are divine Truths. You say, the Creed containes all points necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
Be it so. But doth it likewise containe all points not to be disbelieved?
Certainly it doth not. For how many truths are there in holy Scripture not
contained in the Creed, which we are not obliged distinctly, and particularly
to know and believe, but are bound under paine of damnation not to reject, as soone as we come
to know that they are found in holy Scripture? And we having already shewed, that whatsoever
is proposed by Gods Church as a point of faith, is infallibly a truth revealed by God; it followeth
that whosoever denieth any such point, opposeth Gods sacred testimony whether that point be
contained in the Creed, or no. In vaine then was your care imployed to prove that all points of
faith necessary to be <hi>explicitely</hi> believed, are contained in the Creed. Neither was that the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
which <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> demanded. His demand was (and it was most reasonable) that
you would once give us a list of all fundamentals, the deniall whereof destroyes Salvation;
whereas the deniall of other points not fundamentall, may stand with salvation, although both
these kinds of points be equally proposed as revealed by God. For if they be not equally proposed,
the difference will arise from diversity of the <hi>Proposall,</hi> and not of the <hi>Matter</hi> fundamentall, or
not fundamentall. This Catalogue only, can shew how farre Protestants may disagree without
breach of Vnity in faith; and upon this many other matters depend, according to the ground of
Protestants. But you will never adventure to publish such a Catalogue. I say more: You cannot
assigne any one point so <hi>great,</hi> or fundamentall, that the deniall thereof will make a man an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique,
if it be not sufficiently propounded, as a divine Truth: Nor can you assigne any one
point so <hi>small,</hi> that it can without heresie be rejected, if once it be sufficiently represented as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by God.</p>
               <p>2. Nay, this your instance in the Creed, is not only impertinent but directly against you. For
all points in the Creed are not of their own nature fundamentall, as I shewed<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 3. n. 3.</note> before: And
yet it is damnable to deny any one point contained in the Creed. So that it is cleere, that to make
an errour damnable, it is not necessary that the matter be of it selfe fundamentall.</p>
               <p>3 Moreover you cannot ground any certainty upon the Creed it selfe, unlesse first you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
that the authority of the Church is universally infallible, and consequently that it is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to oppose her declarations, whether they concerne matters great, or small, contayned, or not
contained in the Creed. This is cleere. Because we must receiue the Creed it self upon the credit
of the Church, without which we could not know that there was any such thing as that which
we call the <hi>Apostles Creed:</hi> and yet the arguments whereby you endeavour to prove, that the
Creed containes all fundamentall points, are grounded upon supposition, that the <hi>Creed</hi> was
made <hi>either by the Apostles themselves, or by the</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 216.</note> 
                  <hi>Church of their times from them:</hi> which
thing we could not certainly know, if the succeeding and still continued Church, may erre in her
Traditions: neither can we be assured, whether all fundamentall Articles which you say were
out of the Scriptures, <hi>summed, and contracted into the Apostles Creed,</hi> were faithfully summed, and
contracted, and not one pretermitted, altered, or mistaken, unlesse we undoubtedly know that
the Apostles composed the Creed; and <hi>that</hi> they intended to contract all fundamentall points of
faith into it; or at least <hi>that the Church of their times</hi> (for it seemeth you doubt whether indeed it
were composed by the Apostles themselves) did understand the Apostles aright; and <hi>that the
Church of their times,</hi> did intend that the Creed should containe all fundamentall points. For if
the Church may erre in points not fundamentall, may she not also erre in the particulers which I
have specified? Can you shew it to be a fundamentall point of faith, that the Apostles intended to
comprize all points of faith necessary to Salvation in the Creed? Your self say no more then that it
is <hi>very</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>probable;</hi> which is farre from reaching to a fundamentall point of faith. Your proha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is grounded upon <hi>the Iudgment of Antiquity, and even of the Roman Doctours,</hi> as you say in
the same place. But if the Catholique Church may erre, what certainty can you expect from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
or Doctours? Scripture is <hi>your</hi> totall Rule of faith. Cite therefore some Text of Scripture,
to prove that the Apostles, or <hi>the Church of their times</hi> composed the Creed, and composed it
with a purpose that it should containe all fundamentall points of faith. Which being impossible
to be done, you must for the Creed it self rely upon the infallibility of the Church.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover, the Creed consisteth not so much in the words, as in their sense and meaning.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7615:110"/>
All such as pretend to the name of Christians, recite the Creed, and yet many have erred funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
as well against the Articles of the Creed, as other points of faith. It is then very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to say, the Creed containes all fundamentall points, without specifying, both in what sense
the Articles of the Creed be <hi>true,</hi> and also in what <hi>true</hi> sense, they be <hi>fundamentall.</hi> For, both
these taskes, you are to performe, who teach that all truth is not fundamentall: and you doe but
delude the ignorant, when you say, that the Creed, <hi>taken in a Catholique</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 216.</note> 
                  <hi>sense,</hi> comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all points fundamentall; because with you, all <hi>Catholique sense</hi> is not fundamentall: for so it
were necessary to salvation that all Christians should know the whole Scripture, wherein every
least point hath a <hi>Catholique sense.</hi> Or if by Catholique sense, you understand that sense which is
so universally to be knowne, and believed by all, that whosoever failes therein cannot be saved,
you trifle and say no more then this: <hi>All points of the Creed in a sense necessary to salvation, are
necessary to salvation.</hi> Or: <hi>All points fundamentall, are fundamentall.</hi> After this manner it were
an easie thing to make many trve Prognostications, by saying it will certainly raine, when it
raineth. You say the Creed<note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 216.</note> was opened and explained, <hi>in some parts</hi> in the Creeds of <hi>Nice,</hi>
&amp;c. but how shall we understand the other <hi>parts,</hi> not explained in those Creeds?</p>
               <p>5. For what Article in the Creed is more fundamentall, or may seem more cleere, then that,
wherein we believe IESVS CHRIST to be the Mediatour, Redeemer, and Saviour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and the founder, and foundation of a <hi>Catholique Church</hi> expressed in the Creed? And yet
about this Article, how many different doctrines are there, not only of old Heretiques, as <hi>Arius,
Nestorius, Eutiches, &amp;c.</hi> but also of Protestants, partly against Catholiques, and partly against
one another? For the said maine Article of Christ's being the <hi>only</hi> Saviour of the world &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to different senses of disagreeing Sects, doth involve these, and many other such questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
That Faith in IESVS CHRIST doth justifie alone; That Sacraments have no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficency
in Iustification; That Baptisme doth not availe Infants for salvation, unlesse they have an
Act of faith; That there is no Sacerdotall Absolution from sinnes; That good works proceeding
from Gods grace are not meritorious; That there can be no Satisfaction for the temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
due to sinne after the guilt, or offence is pardoned; No Purgatory; No prayers for the
dead; No Sacrifice of the Masse; No Invocation; No Mediation, or intercession of Saints; No
inherent Iustice: No supreme Pastor, yea no Bishop by divine Ordinance; No Reall presence; no
Transubstantiation, with diverse others. And why? Because (forsooth) these Doctrines derogate
from the Titles of Mediator, Redeemer, Advocate, Foundation, &amp;c. Yea, and are against the truth
of our Saviours humane nature, if we believe diverse Protestants, writing against Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
Let then any judicious man consider, whether <hi>Doctour Potter,</hi> or others doe really satisfie,
when they send men to the Creed for a perfect Catalogue, to distinguish points fundamentall,
from those which they say are not fundamentall. If he will speak indeed to some purpose, let him
say: This Article is understood in this sense; and in this sense it is fundamentall. That other is to
be understood in such a meaning; yet according to that meaning, it is not so fundamentall, but
that men may disagree, and denie it without damnation, But it were no policie for any Protestant
to deale so plainly.</p>
               <p>6. But to what end should we use many arguments? Even your selfe are forced to limit your
owne Doctrine, and come to say, that the <hi>Creed</hi> is a perfect Catalogue of fundamentall points,
<hi>taken as it was further opened and explained in some parts (by occasion of emergent Heresies) in
the other Catholique Creeds of Nice, Constantinople,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Pag. 216.</note> 
                  <hi>Ephesus, Chalcedon, and Athanasius.</hi> But
this explication, or restriction overthroweth you assertion: For as the Apostles Creed was not to
us a sufficient Catalogue, till it was explained by the first Councell, nor then till it was declared
by another, &amp;c. so now also, as new Heresies may arise, it will need particular explanation against
such emergent errors; and so it is not yet, nor ever will be of it self alone, a particular Catalogue,
sufficient to distinguish betwixt fundamentall, and not fundamentall points.</p>
               <p>7. I come to the second part: <hi>That the Creed doth not containe all maine and principall points
of faith.</hi> And to the end we may not strive about things either granted by us both, or no thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the point in question, I must premise these observations.</p>
               <p>8. First: That it cannot be denied, but that the Creed is most full and complete, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for which the holy Apostles, inspir'd by God, meant that it should serve, and in that manner
as they did intend it, which was, not to comprehend all particular points of faith, but such gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
heads, as were most befitting, and requisite for preaching the faith of Christ to Iewes, and
Gentiles, and might be briefly, and compendiously set down, and easily learned, and remembred.
And therefore, in respect of Gentiles, the Creed doth mention God, as Creator of all things; and
and for both Iewes and Gentiles, the Trinity, the Messias, and Saviour, his birth, life, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and glory, from whom they were to hope remission of sinnes, and life everlasting, and
by whose sacred Name they were to be distinguished from all other professions, by being called
Christians. According to which purpose <hi>S. Thomas of Aquine</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">2. 2, q. 1. Art. 8.</note> doth distinguish all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Creed into these generall heads: That some belong to the Majesty of the <hi>God head;</hi>
others to the Mystery of our Saviour Christs <hi>Humane nature:</hi> Which two generall objects of faith,
the holy Ghost doth expresse, and conjoyne, <hi>Ioan. 17. Haec est vita aeterna &amp;c. This is life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
that they know thee true GOD, and whom thou hast sent IESVS CHRIST.</hi> But it
was not their meaning to give us as it were a course of Divinity, or a Catechisme, or a particular
expression of all points of Faith, leaving those things to be performed, as occasion should require,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7615:110"/>
by their own word or writing, for their time, and afterwards for their Successours in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church. Our question then is not, whether the Creed be perfect, as farre as the end for
which it was composed, did require; For we beleive and are ready to give our lives for this: but
only we denie, that the Apostles did intend to comprise therein all particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oints of beliefe,
necessary to salvation, as even by <hi>D. Potters</hi> owne<note n="k" place="margin">Pag. 235, 215.</note> confession, it doth not comprehend <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda,</hi>
or things belonging to practise, as <hi>Sacraments, Commandements,</hi> the acts of <hi>Hope,</hi> and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Charity, which we are obliged not only to practise, but also to <hi>believe</hi> by divine infallible
faith. Will he therefore inferre that the Creed is not perfect, because it containes not all those
necessary, and fundamentall Objects of faith? He will answer, No: because the Apostles intended
only to expresse <hi>credenda,</hi> things to be believed, not practised. Let him therefore give us leave to
say, that the Creed is perfect, because it wanteth none of those Objects of beliefe which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be set downe, as we explicated before.</p>
               <p>9. The second observation is, that to satisfie our question what points in particular be fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
it will not be sufficient to alleage the Creed, unlesse it containes all such points either
expressely and immediatly; or else in such manner, that by evident, and necessary consequence they
may be deduced from Articles both cleerely, and particularly contained therein. For if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
be <hi>doubtfull,</hi> we shall not be <hi>sure,</hi> that such Conclusions be fundamentall: or if the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
themselves which are said to be fundamentall, be not distinctly, and particularly expressed,
they will not serve us to know, and distinguish all points fundamentall, from those which they
call, not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall. We doe not deny, but that all points of faith, both fundamentall &amp; not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
may be said to be contained in the Creed, in some sense; as for example, implicitely, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
or in such involved manner. For when we explicitely believe the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> we doe
implicitely believe whatsoever she proposeth as belonging to faith: Or else by way of <hi>reductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that
is, when we are once instructed in the beliefe of particular points of faith, not expressed, nor by
necessary consequence deducible from the Creed; we may afterward, by some analogy, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
and resemblance, reduce it to one, or moe of those Articles which are explicitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Symbole. Thus <hi>S. Thomas</hi> the Cherubim among Divines teacheth<note n="l" place="margin">2, 2. q. 1. art. 8. ad 6:</note> that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
existence of our Blessed Saviours body in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as likewise all his other <hi>miracles,</hi>
are reduced to Gods <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> expressed in the Creed. And <hi>Doctor Potter</hi> saith: <hi>The Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Pag. 231.</note> 
                  <hi>being a seale of that holy Vnion which we have with Christ our head, by his spirit and
Faith, and with the Saints his members by Charity, is evidently included in the communion of
Saints.</hi> But this reductive way, is farre from being sufficient to inferre out of the Articles of <hi>Gods
Omnipotency,</hi> or of the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> that our Saviours body is in the Eucharist, and
much lesse whether it be only in figure, or else in reality; by Transubstantiation, or Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
&amp;c. and least of all, whether or no these points be fundamentall. And you hyperbolize, in
saying, the Eucharist <hi>is evidently included in the Communion of Saints,</hi> as if there could not have
been, or was not a Communion of Saints, before the Blessed Sacrament was instituted. Yet it is
true, that after we know, and believe, there is such a Sacrament, wee may referre it to some of
those heads expressed in the Creed, and yet so, as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> referres it to one Article, and <hi>D.
Potter</hi> to another; and in respect of different analogies or effects, it may be referred to severall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
The like I say of other points of faith, which may in some sort be reduced to the Creed,
but nothing to <hi>D. Potters</hi> purpose: But contrarily it sheweth, that your affirming such and such
points to be fundamentall or not fundamentall, is meerely arbitrary, to serve your turne, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and your occasions may require. Which was an old custome amongst Heretiques, as wee

                  <hi>S. Augustine; Pelagius and Celessius, desiring fraudulently to avoide the the hatefull
name of Heresies, affirmed that the question of Originall sinne may be disputed without danger of
faith.</hi> But this holy Father affirmes that it belongs to the foundation of Faith. <hi>We may</hi> (saith he)
<hi>endure a disputant who erres in other questions not yet diligently examined, not yet diligently esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by the whole authority of the Church; their errour may be borne with: but it must not passe
so farre as to attempt to shake the foundation of the church.</hi> We see <hi>S. Augustine</hi> places the being
of a point fundamentall or not fundamentall, in that it hath beene <hi>examined,</hi> and <hi>established</hi> by
the Church, although the point of which he speaketh, namely Originall Sinne, be not contained
in the Creed.</p>
               <p>10. Out of that which hath beene said, I inferre, that <hi>Dostor Potters</hi> paines in alleaging Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Doctors, the ancient Fathers, and the Councell of Trent, to prove that the Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
all points of faith, was needlesse; since we grant it in manner aforesaid. But <hi>Doctor Potter,</hi>
cannot in his conscience believe, that Catholique Divines, or the Councell of Trent and the holy
Fathers did intend, that all points in particular which we are obliged to believe, are contained
explicitely in the Creed; he knowing well enough, that all Catholiques hold themselves obliged,
to believe all those points which the said Councell defines to be believed under an Anathema, and
that all Christians believe the commandements, Sacraments &amp;c. which are not expressed in the
Creed.</p>
               <p>11. Neither must this seeme strange. For who is ignorant, that Summaries, Epitomes, and
the like briefe Abstracts, are not intended to specifie all particulars of that Science, or Subject to
which they belong. For as the Creed is said to containe all points of <hi>Faith;</hi> so the Decalogue
comprehends all Articles, (as I may terme them) which concerne <hi>Charity,</hi> and good life: and yet
this cannot be so understood, as if we were disobliged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> performance of any duty, or the eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7615:111"/>
of any vice, unlesse it be expressed in the ten Commandements. For, (to omit the precepts of
receaving Sacraments, which belong to practise, or manners, and yet are not contained in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue)
there are many sinnes, even against the law of nature, and light of reason, which are
not contained in the tenne Commandements, except only by similitude, analogy, reduction, or
some such way. For example, we find not expressed in the Decalogue, either divers sinnes, as
Gluttony, Drunkennesse, Pride, Sloth, Covetousnesse in desiring either things superfluous, or
with too much greedinesse; or diuers of our chiefe obligations, as Obedience to Princes, and all
Superiours, not only Ecclesiasticall but also Civill, whose lawes <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Calvin;</hi>
and some other Protestants doe dangerously affirme not to oblige <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n conscience, and yet these
men thinke they know the ten Commandements: as likewise divers Protestants defend Vsury,
to be lawfull; and the many Treatises of <hi>Civilians, Canonists,</hi> and <hi>Casuists,</hi> are witnesses, that
divers sinnes against the light of reason, and Law of nature, are not distinctly expressed in the ten
Commandements; although when by other diligences they are found to be unlawfull, they may
be reduced to some of the Commandements, and yet not so evidently, and particularly, but that
divers doe it in divers manners.</p>
               <p>12. My third Observation is: That our present question being, whether or no the Creed
containe so fully all fundamentall points of faith, that whosoever doe not agree in all, and every
one of those fundamentall Articles, cannot have the same substance of faith, nor hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
if I can produce one, or more points, not contained in the Creed, in vvhich if two doe not
agree, both of them cannot expect to be saved, I shall have performed as much as I intend; and
<hi>D. Potter</hi> must seeke our some other Catalogue for points fundamentall, then the Creed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it materiall to the said purpose, whether such fundamentall points rest only in knowledge,
and speculation, or beliefe, or else be farther referred to work and practise. For the <hi>habit,</hi> or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Faith,</hi> which inclineth, and enableth us to believe both speculative, and practicall verities,
is of one and the selfe same nature, and essence. For example, by the same <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby I spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatively
believe there is a God, I likewise believe, that he is to be adored, served, and loved;
which belong to practise. The reason is, because the <hi>Formall Object,</hi> or motive, for which I yeild
assent to those different sorts of materiall objects, is the sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in both, to wit, the revelation, or
word of God. Where, by the way I note, that if the <hi>Vnity,</hi> or <hi>Distinction,</hi> and nature of faith,
were to be taken from the diversity of things revealed, by one faith I should believe speculative ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and by another such as tend to practise, which I doubt whether <hi>D. Potter</hi> himselfe will
admit.</p>
               <p>13 Hence it followeth, that whosoever denieth any one main practicall revealed truth, is no
lesse an Heretique, then if he should deny a Point resting in belief alone. So that when <hi>D. Potter,</hi>
(to avoid our argument, that all fundamentall points are not contained in the Creed, because in it
there is no mention of the Sacraments, which yet are points of so main importance, that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
make the due administration of them, to be necessary and essentiall to constitute a Church)
answereth, that the <hi>Sacraments are to be</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Pap. 235.</note> 
                  <hi>reckoned, rather among the</hi> Agenda <hi>of the Church,
then the</hi> Credenda; <hi>they are rather divine rites and ceremonies, then Doctrines,</hi> he either grants
what we affirme, or in effect saies, Of two kinds of revealed truths, which are necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
the Creed containes one sort only, <hi>ergo,</hi> it containes all kind of revealed truths necessary
to be believed. Our question is not, <hi>de nomine</hi> but <hi>re;</hi> not what be called points of faith,
or of practise, but what points indeed be necessarily to be believed, whether they be termed <hi>Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
or <hi>Credenda:</hi> especially the chiefest part of Christian perfection consisting more in Action,
then in barren Speculation; in good works, then bare belief; in doing, then knowing. And there
are no lesse contentions concerning practicall; then speculative truths: as Sacraments, obtaining
remission of sinne, Invocation of Saints, Prayers for dead, Adoration of Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and many other: all which doe so much the more import, as on them, beside righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> belief,
doth also depend our practise, and the ordering of our life. Though <hi>D. Potter</hi> could therefore give
us (as he will never be able to doe) a minute, and exact Catalogue of all truths to be believed;
that would not make me able enough to know, whether or no I have faith sufficient for salvation;
till he also did bring in a particular List, of all believed truths, which tend to practise, declaring
which of them be fundamentall, which not; that so every man might know, whether he be not
in some <hi>Damnable</hi> Errour, for some Article of faith, which farther might give influence into <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi>
works.</p>
               <p>14 These Observations being premised, I come to prove, that the Creed doth not contain
all points of Faith necessary to be known and believed. And, to omit that in generall it doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
tell us, what points be fundamentall, or not fundamentall, which in the way of Protestants, is
most necessary to be known; in particular, there is no mention of the greatest evills, from which
mans calamity proceeded, I mean, the sinne of the Angels, of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of Originall sinne in
us: nor of the greatest good from which we expect all good, to wit, the necessity of <hi>Grace</hi> for
all works tending to piety. Nay, there is no mention of Angels, good, or bad. The meaning
of that most generall head (<hi>Oporter accedentem &amp;c. It behoves</hi>

believe that he is, and is a remunerator,</hi>) is questioned, by the deniall of Merit, which makes God
a Giver, but not a Rewarder. It is not expressed whether the Article of <hi>Remission of sinnes</hi> be
understood by faith alone, or else may admit the efficiency of Sacraments. There is no mention
of Ecclesiasticall, Apostolicall, <hi>Divine Traditions,</hi> one way or other; or of holy Scriptures in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7615:111"/>
generall, and much lesse of every book in particular; nor of the Name, Nature, Number, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
Matter, Forme, Minister, Intention, Necessity of Sacraments, and yet the due Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sacraments, is with Protestants an essentiall Note of the Church. There is nothing for
Baptisme of Children, nor against Rebaptization. There is no mention in favour, or against the
Sacrifice of the Masse, of Power in the Church to institute Rites, Holy daies, &amp;c. and to inflict
Excommunication, or other Censures: of Priesthood, Bishops, and the whole Ecclesiasticall Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
which are very fundamentall points; of <hi>S. Peters</hi> Primacy, which to <hi>Calvin</hi> seemeth a
fundamentall errour; nor of the possibility, or impossibility to keep Gods commandements; of
the procession of the holy Ghost from the Father and the Sonne; of Purgatory, or Prayer for the
dead, in any sense: And yet <hi>D. Potter</hi> doth not deny, but that <hi>Aerius</hi> was esteemed an Heretique,
for denying<note n="r" place="margin">Pag. 35<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> all sort of Commemoration for the dead. Nothing of the Churches Visibility or
Invisibility, Fallibility or Infallibility; nor of other points controverted betwixt Protestants
themseves, and between Protestants and Catholiques, which to <hi>D. Potter</hi> seem so hainous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
that they cannot without damnation joyne with us in profession thereof. There is no
mention of the Cessation of the Old Law, which yet is a very main point of faith. And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might be also added.</p>
               <p>15. But what need we labour to specify particulars? There are as many important points of
faith not expressed in the Creed, as since the worlds begining, now, and for all future times, there
have been, are and may be innumerable, grosse, damnable Heresies, whose contrary truths are
not contained in the Creed. For, every fundamentall Error must have a contrary fundamentall
truth; because of two contradictory propositions in the same degree, the one is false, the other
must be true. As for example, if it be a damnable error to deny the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Trinity, or the Godhead
of our Saviour, the <hi>belief</hi> of them must be a truth necessary to Salvation; or rather, if we will
speak properly, the <hi>Error</hi> is damnable, because the opposite <hi>Truth</hi> is necessary, as death is fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
because life is sweet; and according to Philosophy, the Privation is measured by the Forme
to which it is repugnant. If therefore the Creed contain in particular all fundamentall points of
faith, it must explicitely, or by cleer consequence, comprehend all truths opposite to innumerable
Heresies of all ages past, present, and to come, which no man in his wits will affirme it to doe.</p>
               <p>16 And here I cannot omit to signify how you<note n="s" place="margin">Pag. 255.</note> applaud the saying of D. <hi>Vsher. That in
those propositions which without all controversy are universally received in the whole Christian
world, so much truth is contained, as being joyned with holy Obedience, may be sufficient to bring a
man to everlasting salvation, neither have we cause to doubt, but that as many as walk according
to this Rule (neither overthrowing that which they have builded, by superinducing any damnable
heresies thereupon, nor otherwise vitiating their holy faith, with a lewd and wicked conversation)
peace shall be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</hi> Now D <hi>Potter</hi> knowes, that the Mystery
of the B. Trinity is not universally received in the whole Christian world, as appeares in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Heretiques, in <hi>Polony, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Transilvania,</hi> and therefore according to this Rule of
D. <hi>Vsher,</hi> approved by D. <hi>Potter,</hi> the deniall of the B. Trinity, shall not exclude Salvation.</p>
               <p>17 Let me note by the way, that you might easily have espied a foul contradiction in the
said words of D. <hi>Vsher,</hi> by you recited, and so much applauded. For he supposeth, that a man agrees
with other Churches in belief, which joyned with holy Obedience may bring him to everlasting
salvation, and yet, that he may <hi>superinduce damnable heresies.</hi> For how can he <hi>superinduce dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
heresies,</hi> who is supposed to believe all <hi>Truths</hi> necessary to salvation? Can there be any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
heresy, unlesse it contradict some necessary truth, which cannot happen in one who is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to believe all necessary <hi>Truths?</hi> Besides if one believing all fundamentall Articles in the
Creed, may <hi>superinduce damnable heresies;</hi> it followeth that the fundamentall truths contrary to
those damnable heresies, are not contained in the Creed.</p>
               <p>18 According to this Modell of D. <hi>Potters</hi> foundation, consisting in the agreement of scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
point of faith; what a strange Church would he make of men concurring in some one of few
Articles of belief, who yet for the rest should be holding conceits plainly contradictory: so patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a Religion of men, who agree only in the Article, that Christ is our Saviour, but for the
rest, are like to the parts of a Chimaera; having the head of a man, the neck of a horse, the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of an Oxe, the foot of a Lion &amp;c. I wrong them not herein. For in good Philosophy there
is greater repugnancy between assent and dissent, affirmation and negation, <hi>est est, non non,</hi> (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when all these contradictories pretend to rely upon one and the selfe same <hi>Motive,</hi> the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Truth of Almighty God) then between the integrall parts, as head, neck, &amp;c. of a man,
horse, lion, &amp;c. And thus Protestants are farre more bold to disagree even in matters of faith, then
Catholique Divines in questions meerely Philosophicall, or not determined by the Church. And
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e thus they stand only upon <hi>fundamentall</hi> Articles, they doe by their own confession destroy
the Church, which is the <hi>house of God.</hi> For the <hi>foundation</hi> alone of a house, is not a house, nor
can they in such an imaginary Church any more expect Salvation, then the foundation alone of a
house is fit to afford a man habitation.</p>
               <p>19 Moreover, it is most evident that Protestants by this Chaos rather then Church, doe giue
unavoidable occasion of desperation to poore soules. Let some one who is desirous to save his
soule repaire to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> who maintaines these grounds, to know upon whom he may rely, in a
matter of so great consequence; I suppose the Doctors answer will be: Vpon the truely Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

                  <hi>which our Lord hath made unto his Church for his assistance, are intended not

he erre in a hundred things of lesse moment. But how shall I know whether hee hold all funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall

be, and which be not fundamentall? Read my Answer to a late Popish Pamphlet intituled
<hi>Charity Mistaken &amp;c.</hi> there you shall finde, that fundamentall doctrines are such <hi>Catholique Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
as principally and essentially pertain</hi>

                  <hi>to the Faith, such as properly constitute a Church,
and are necessary (in ordinary course) to be distinctly believed by every Christian that will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
They are those grand, and capitall doctrines which make up our Faith in Christ; that is, that
common faith which is alike precious in all, being one and the same in the highest Apostle, and the
meanest believer, which the Apostle else-where cals the first principles of the oracles of God, &amp; the
forme of sound words.</hi> But how shall I apply these generall definitions, or descriptions, or (to say
the truth) these only varied words, and phrases (for I understand the word, <hi>fundamentall,</hi> as well
as the words, <hi>principall, essentiall grand, and capitall doctrines, &amp;c.</hi>) to the particular Articles of
the Creed, in such sort, as that I may be able precisely, exactly, particularly, to distinguish funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Articles from points of lesse moment? You labour to tell us <hi>what</hi> fundamentall points
be, but not <hi>which</hi> they be: and yet unlesse you doe this, your Doctrine serues only, either to make
men despaire, or else to haue recourse to those whom you call Papists, and which giue one certain
Rule, that all points defined by Christs visible Church belong to the foundation of Faith, in such
sense, as that to deny any one cannot stand with salvation. And seeing your selfe acknowledges
that these men doe not erre in points fundamentall, I cannot but hold it most safe for me to joyn
with them, for the securing of my soule, and the avoiding of desperation, into which this your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
must cast all them who understand, and belieue it. For the whole discourse, and inferences
which here I haue made, are either your own direct Assertions, or evident consequences cleerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from them.</p>
               <p>20 But now let us answer some few Objections of D. <hi>Potters,</hi> against that which wee haue
said before, to avoid our argument. That the Scripture is not so much as mentioned in the Creed,
he saith: <hi>The Creed is an abstract of such</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 234.</note> 
                  <hi>necessary Doctrines as are delivered in Scripture,</hi> or
collected out of it; and therefore needs not expresse the authority of that which it supposes.</p>
               <p>21 This answer makes for us. For by giving a reason why it was needlesse that Scripture
should be expressed in the Creed, you grant as much as we desire, namely that the Apostles judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it <hi>needlesse</hi> to expresse all necessary points of faith in their Creed. Neither doth the Creed sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
or depend on Scripture, in such sort as that we can by any probable consequence, infer from
the Articles of the Creed, that there is any Canonicall Scripture at all; and much lesse that such
Books in particular be Canonicall. Yea the Creed might haue been the same although holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
had never been written; and, which is more, the Creed even in priority of time, was before
all the Scripture of the new Testament, except the Gospell of <hi>S. Mathew.</hi> And so according to
this reason of his, the Scripture should not mention Articles contained in the Creed. And I note
in a word, how little connexion <hi>D. Potters</hi> arguments haue, while he tells us, that <hi>the Creed</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 234.</note>

needs not expresse the authority of that which it supposes;</hi> it doth not follow: The Articles of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7615:112"/>
the Creed are delivered in Scripture: therefore the Creed supposeth Scripture. For two distinct
writings may well deliver the same truths, and yet one of them not suppose the other, unlesse D.
<hi>Potter</hi> be of opinion that two Doctors cannot, <hi>at one time,</hi> speak the same truth.</p>
               <p>22 And notwithstanding, that D. <hi>Potter</hi> hath now told us, it was <hi>needlesse</hi> that the Creed
should expresse Scripture, whose <hi>Authority it supposes,</hi> he comes at length to say, that the <hi>Nicene
Fathers in their Creed confessing that the holy Ghost spake by the Prophets, doth thereby sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avow the divine Authority of all Canonicall Scripture.</hi> But I would ask him, whether the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>
Creed be not also an Abstract of Doctrines delivered in Scripture, as he said of the Apostles
Creed, and thence did infer, that it was needlesse to expresse Scripture, <hi>whose authority it suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?</hi>
Besides, we doe not only belieue in generall, that Canonicall Scripture is of divine authority
but we are also bound under pain of damnation to belieue, that such and such particular Books<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not mentioned in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, are Canonicall. And lastly D. <hi>Potter</hi> in this Answer grants
as much as we desire, which is, that all points of faith are not contained in the Apostles Creed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as it is <hi>explained</hi> by other Creeds. For these words (<hi>who spake by the Prophets</hi>) are no waies

                  <hi>back nothing,</hi> with your glosse (<hi>needfull for our salvation</hi>) is no
proofe, unlesse you still beg the question, and doe suppose, that whatsoever the Apostles revealed
to the Church, is contained in the Creed. And I wonder you doe not reflect that those words
were by S, <hi>Paul</hi> particularly directed to Pastors, and Governours of the Church, as is cleere by
the other words; <hi>He called the Ancients of the Church.</hi> And afterward: <hi>Take heed to your selues,
and to the whole flock wherein the holy Ghost hath placed you Bishops, to rule the Church.</hi> And
your selfe say, <hi>that more knowledge is</hi>

                  <hi>necessary in Bishops, and Priests, to whom is committed
the government of the Church, and the care of soules, then in vulgar Laicks.</hi> Doe you think that the
Apostles taught Christians nothing but their Creed? Said they nothing of the Sacraments, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
Duties of Hope, Charity, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>25 Vpon the same affected ambiguity is grounded your other objection: <hi>To say the whole
faith of those times</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 225<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 223.</note> 
                  <hi>is not contained in the Apostles Creed, is all one, as if a man should say,
this is not the Apostles Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a part of it:</hi> For the faith of the Apostles is not all one with that
which we commonly call their Creed. Did not, I pray you, S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> belieue their
writings to be Canonicall Scripture? and yet their writings are not mentioned in the Creed. It is
therefore more then cleere, that the Faith of the Apostles is of larger extent, then the Apostles
Creed.</p>

                  </gap> the same quality? Why
our Saviours descent to Hell, and Buriall expressed, and not his Circumcision, his Manifestation to
the three Kings, working of Miracles, &amp;c. Why did they not expresse Scriptures, Sacraments, and
all fundamentall points of Faith tending to practise, as well as those which rest in beliefe? Their
intention was, particularly to deliver such Articles as were fittest for those times, concerning the
Deity, Trinity, and Messias (as heretofore I haue declared) leaving many things to be taught by
the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> which in the Creed we all professe to belieue. Neither doth it follow, as
you infer, <hi>That as well, nay better, they might have given no Article, but that (of the Church) &amp;
sent us to the Church for all the rest. For in setting down others besides that, and not all, they make
us believe we haue all, when</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Pag. 223<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>we haue not all.</hi> For by this kind of arguing, what may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced?
One might, quite contrary to your inference, say: If the Apostles Creed contain all points
necessary to salvation, what need we any Church to teach us? and consequently what need of the
Article concerning the <hi>Church?</hi> What need we the Creeds of <hi>Nice, Constantinople, &amp;c.</hi> Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are your Catechismes, wherein besides the Articles of the Creed, you adde divers other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
These would be poore consequences, and so is yours. But shall I tell you newes? For so
you are pleased to esteem it. We grant your inference, thus far: That our Saviour Christ referred
us to his Church, by her to be taught, and by her alone. For, she was before the Creed, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
And she to discharge this imposed office of instructing us, hath delivered us the Creed, but
not it alone, as if nothing else were to be believed. We haue besides it, holy Scripture, we haue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written,
Divine, Apostolicall, Ecclesiasticall Traditions. It were a childish argument: The Creed
containes not all things which are necessary to be believed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not profitable. Or; The
Church alone is sufficient to teach us by some convenient meanes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> she must teach us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all meanes, without Creeds, without Councels, without Scripture &amp;c. If the Apostles had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7615:113"/>
no Article, but that of the Catholique Church, she must have taught us the other Articles in
particular, by Creeds, or other meanes, as in fact we have even the Apostles Creed from the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church. If you will <hi>believe you have all in the Creed, when you have not all,</hi> it is
not the Apostles, or the Church, that makes you so believe, but it is your owne errour, whereby
you will needs believe, that the Creed must contain <hi>all.</hi> For neither the Apostles, nor the Church,
nor the Creed it selfe tell you any such matter; and what necessity is there, that one meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
must involve whatsoever is contained in all the rest? Wee are not to recite the Creed
with anticipated perswasion, that it must contain what we imagin it ought, for better maintaining
some opinions of our own; but we ought to say, and belieue that it containes what we finde in
it; of which one Article is to belieue the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> surely to be taught by her, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
that we need other instruction beside the Creed: and in particular we may learn of her,
what points be contained in the Creed, what otherwise; and so we shall not be deceaved, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
we haue all in the Creed, when we have not all: and you may in the same manner say: <hi>As
well, nay better, the Apostles might haue given us no Articles</hi> at all, as haue left out Articles ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to practise. For in setting down one sort of Articles, and not the others, <hi>they make us belieue
we haue all, when we haue not all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>27 To our argument, that Baptisme is not contained in the Creed, D. <hi>Potter,</hi> besides his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that Sacraments belong rather to practise then faith, (which I haue already confuted, and
which indeed maketh against himselfe, and serveth only to shew that the Apostles intended not to
comprize all points in the Creed which we are bound to belieue) adds, that the <hi>Creed of</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 237.</note> 
                  <hi>Nice
expressed Baptisme by name, confesse one Baptisme for the remission of sinnes.</hi> Which answer is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against himselfe, and manifestly proues that Baptisme is an Article of faith, and yet is not
contained in the Apostles Creed, neither explicitely, nor by any necessary consequence from other
Articles expressed therein. If to make it an Article of faith be sufficient that it is contained in the
Nicene Councell; he will finde that Protestants maintain many errours against faith, as being
repugnant to definitions of Generall Councels: as in particular, that the very Councell of <hi>Nice</hi>
(which saith M. <hi>Whitgift,</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">In his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. page 330.</note> 
                  <hi>is of all wise and learned men reverenced, esteemed and imbraced,
next unto the Scriptures themselues</hi>) decreed that, <hi>to those who were chosen to the Ministry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married,
it was not lawfull to take any wife afterward,</hi> is affirmed by Protestants. And your grand
Reformer <hi>Luther (lib. de Conciliis part prima</hi>) saith, that he understand not the Holy Ghost in
that Councell. For in one Canon it saith that those who haue gelded themselues are not fit to
be made Priests, in another it forbids them to haue wiues. <hi>Hath</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Holy Ghost nothing
to doe in Councells, but to binde, and load his Ministers with impossible, dangerous, and unnecessary
lawes?</hi> I forbeare to shew that this very Article <hi>I confesse one Baptisme for the Remission of sinnes,</hi>
will be understood by Protestants in a far different sense from Catholiques, yea Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselues doe not agree, how Baptisme forgiues sinnes, nor what grace it conferres. Only
concerning the Vnity of Baptisme against rebaptization of such as were once baptized (which I
noted as a point not contained in the Apostles Creed) I cannot omit an excellent place of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
where speaking of the Donatists he hath these words. <hi>They are so bold as</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Lib. de He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. in 69.</note> 
                  <hi>to rebaptize
Catholiques, wherein they shew themselues to be the greater Heretiques, since it hath pleased the
universall Catholique Church not to make Baptisme void even in the very Heretiques themselues.</hi>
In which few words this holy Father delivereth against the Donatists these points which doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
make against Protestants: That to make an Heresie, or an Heretique, known for such, it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
to oppose the definition of Gods Church: That a proposition may be Hereticall though it
be not repugnant to any Texts of Scripture. For S. <hi>Augustine</hi> teacheth that the doctrine of rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization,
is hereticall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet acknowledgeth it cannot be convinced for such out of Scripture.
And that neither the Heresie of rebaptization of those who were baptized by Heretiques, nor the
contrary Catholique truth being expressed in the Apostles Creed, it followeth that it doth not
contain all points of faith necessary to salvation. And so we must conclude that to belieue the
<hi>Creed</hi> is not sufficient for Vnitie of faith, and Spirit in the same Church, unlesse there be also a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
agreement both in <hi>beliefe</hi> of other points of faith, and in <hi>externall profession,</hi> and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

assertion, delivered in the 207. p. of his book.
<hi>The Creed of the Apostles (as it is explained in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

summary or Catalogue of Fundamentalls, by the
best learned Romanists and by Antiquity.</hi>

               <p>2 By <hi>Fundamentalls</hi> he understands <hi>not the Fundamentall rules of
good life and action,</hi> (though every one of these is to be believed to
come from God, &amp; therefore vertually includes an Article of Faith;)
but the Fundamentall <hi>doctrines of Faith;</hi> such, as though they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon our lives, as every essentiall doctrine of Christianity hath,
yet we are commanded to believe them, and not to doe them. The as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of our understandings is required to them, but no obedience
from our wills.</p>
               <p>3 But these speculative Doctrines again he distinguishes out of
<hi>Aquinas, Occham,</hi> and <hi>Canus</hi> and others, into two kinds: of the first are
those which are the <hi>obiects of Faith, in, and for themselves,</hi> which by
their own nature and Gods prime intention, are essentiall parts of that
Gospell: such as the teachers in the Church, cannot without Mortall
sinne omit to teach the learners: such as are intrinsecall to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
between God and man; and not only plainly revealed by God,
and so <hi>certain</hi> truths, but also commanded to be preacht to all men,
and to be believed distinctly by all, and so <hi>necessary truths.</hi> Of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
sort are <hi>Accidentall, Circumstantiall, Occasionall</hi> objects of faith;
millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s whereof there are in holy Scripture; such as are to be believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
not for themselves, but because they are joyned with others, that are
necessary to be believed, and delivered by the same Authority which
delivered these. Such as we are not bound to know to bee divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
(for without any fault we may be ignorant hereof, nay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the contrary;) such as we are not bound to examine, whether or
no they be divine Revelations: such as Pastors are not bound to teach
their Flock, nor their Flock bound to know and remember: no nor
the Pastors themselves to know them or believe them, or not to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them absolutely and alwaies; but then only when they doe see,
and know them to be delivered in Scripture, as divine Revelations.</p>
               <p>4 I say when they doe so, and not only when they may doe. For
to lay an obligation upon us of believing, or not disbelieving any Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
sufficient Revelation on Gods part, is not sufficient: For then see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the expresse Verities of Scripture are either to all men, or at least
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7615:114"/>
to all learned men sufficiently revealed by God, it should be a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sinne, in any learned man actually to disbelieve any one particular
Historicall verity contained in Scripture, or to believe the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it, though he knew it not to be there contained. For though
he did not, yet he might have known it; it being plainly revealed by
God, and this revelation being extant in such a Book, wherein he
might have found it recorded, if with diligence he had perused it. To
make therefore any points necessary to be believed, it is requisite, that
either we actually know them to be divine Revelations: and these
though they be not Articles of faith, nor necessary to be believed, in
and for themselves, yet indirectly, and by accident, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
they are so: The necessity of believing them, being inforced
upon us, by a necessity of believing this Essentiall, and Fundamentall
article of Faith, <hi>That all Divine Revelations are true,</hi> which to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
or not to believe, is for any Christian not only impious, but
impossible. Or else it is requisite that they be, First actually revealed
by God. Secondly, commanded under pain of damnation, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
known (I mean known to be divine Revelations,) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
to be believed. And of this latter sort of speculative divine
Verities, D. <hi>Potter</hi> affirmed, <hi>that the Apostles Creed was a sufficient sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary:</hi>
yet he affirmed it, not as his own opinion, but as the doctrine
of the <hi>ancient Fathers, and your own Doctors.</hi> And besides, he affirmed
it not as absolutely certain, but very probable.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>In brief, all that he saies is this: It is</hi> very probable, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the judgement of the Roman Doctors, and the Ancient Fathers,
the Apostles Creed is to be esteemed a sufficient summary of all those do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which being meerely <hi>Credenda,</hi> and not <hi>Agenda,</hi> all men are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
under pain of Damnation, bound particularly to believe.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>Now</hi> this assertion (<hi>you say</hi>) is neither pertinent to the question
in hand, nor in it selfe true. <hi>Your Reasons to prove it</hi> impertinent, <hi>put
into forme and divested of impertinencies are these.</hi> 1. Because the
question was not, what points were necessary to be explicitly believed,
but what points were necessary not to be disbelieved after sufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall.
And therefore to give a Catalogue of points, necessary to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
believed is impertinent.</p>
               <p>7 Secondly, because errours may be damnable, though the contrary
truths be not of themselves fundamentall; as that Pontius Pilate was our
Saviours Iudge, is not in it selfe a Fundamentall truth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et to believe the
contrary were a damnable errour. And therefore to give a Catalogue of
Truths in themselves fundamentall, is no pertinent satisfaction to this
demand, what errors are damnable?</p>
               <p>8 Thirdly, because if the Church be not Vniversally infallible, wee
cannot ground any certainty upon the Creed, which we must receive upon
the Credit of the Church: and if the Church be Vniversally infallible, it is
damnable to oppose her declaration in any thing, though not contained in
the Creed.</p>
               <p>9 Fourthly, Because not to believe the Articles of the Creed in the
true sense is damnable, therefore it is frivolous to say the Creed containes
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7615:114"/>
all Fundamentalls, without specifying in what sense the Articles of it are
Fundamentall.</p>
               <p>10 Fiftly, because the Apostles Creed (as D. Potter himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
was not a sufficient Catalogue, till it was explained by the first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;
nor then untill it was declared in the second &amp;c. by occasion of emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Heresies: Therefore now also as new Heresies may arise, it will need
particular explanation, and so is not yet, nor ever will be a compleat
Catalogue of Fundamentalls.</p>
               <p>11 Now to the first of these objections I say: Frist, that your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between points necessary to be believed, and necessary not to
be disbelieved, is more subtill then sound, a distinction without a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference:
There being no point necessary to be believed, which is not
necessary not to be disbelieved: Nor no point to any man, at any time,
in any circumstances necessary not to be disbelieved, but it is to the
same man, at the same time, in the same circumstances, necessary to be
believed. Yet that which (I believe) you would have said, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
true, that many points which are not necessary to be believed
absolutely, are yet necessary to be believed upon a supposition, that
they are known to be revealed by God: that is, become then necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed, when they are known to be Divine Revelations. But
then I must needs say, you doe very strangely, in saying, that <hi>the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
was, what points might lawfully be disbelieved, after sufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that they are divine Revelations.</hi> You affirme, that none may,
and so does <hi>D. Potter,</hi> and with him all Protestants, and all Christians.
And how then is this the question? Who ever said or thought, that of
Divine Revelations, known to be so, some might safely and lawfully
be rejected, and disbelieved, under pretence that they are not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall?
Which of us ever taught, that it was not damnable, either to
deny, or so much as doubt of the Truth of any thing, whereof we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know, or believe that God hath revealed it? What Protestant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
taught that it was not damnable, either to give God the lye, or to
call his Veracity into question? Yet you say, <hi>The demand of Charity
mistaken was, &amp; it was most reasonable, that a list of Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>talls, should
be given, the denyall whereof destroies Salvation, whereas the deniall of
other points may stand with Salvation, although both kinds be equally
proposed, as revealed by God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12 Let the Reader peruse <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> &amp; he shall find that this
qualification, <hi>although both kinds of points be equally proposed as revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by God,</hi> is your addition, and no part of the demand. And if it had,
it had been most unreasonable, seeing he and you know well enough,
that (though we doe not presently without examination, fall down
and worship all your Churches proposals, as divine Revelations) yet,
we make no such distinction of known divine Revelations, as if some
only of them were necessary to be believed, and the rest might safely
be rejected. So that to demand a particular minute Catalogue of all
points that may not be disbelieved after sufficient Proposition, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to demaund a Catalogue of all points that are or may be, in as
much as none may be disbelieved, after sufficient Proposition, that it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7615:115"/>
is a divine Revelation. At least it is to desire us, First, to transcribe into
this catalogue, every Text of the whole Bible. Secondly, to set down
distinctly, those innumerous millions of negative and positive conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
which may be evidently deduced from it: For these we say,
God hath revealed. And indeed you are not ashamed in plain tearmes
to require this of us. For having first told us, <hi>that the demand was,
what points were necessary not to be disbelieved, after sufficient propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they are Divine Truths:</hi> you come to say, <hi>Certainly the Creed
containes not all these.</hi> And this you prove by asking, <hi>how many Truths
are thero in holy Scripture, not contained in the Creed, which we are not
bound to know and believe, but are bound under pain of damnation not to
reject, as soon as we come to know that they are found in holy Scripture?</hi>
So that in requiring a particular Catalogue of all points, not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed,
after sufficient Proposall, you require us to set you down all
points contained in Scripture, or evidently deducible from it. And
yet this you are pleas'd to call a <hi>reasonable,</hi> nay, <hi>a most reasonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:</hi>
whereas having ingaged your selfe to give a Catalogue of
your Fundamentalls, you conceive your ingagement very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
by saying, <hi>all is Fundamentall which the Church proposes,</hi> without
going about, to give us an endlesse Inventory of her Proposalls. And
therefore from us, in stead of a perfect particular of Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all sorts, (of which with a lesse hyperbole then S. <hi>Iohn</hi> useth, we
might say, <hi>If they were to be written, the world would not hold the books
that must be written;</hi>) me thinkes you should accept of this generall, All
Divine Revelations are true, and to be believed.</p>
               <p>13 The very truth is, the main Question in this businesse is not,
<hi>what divine Revelations are necessary to be believed, or not rejected when
they are sufficiently proposed:</hi> for all without exception, all without
question are so; But <hi>what Revelations are simply and absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be proposed to the beliefe of Christians, so that that Society, which
does propose, and indeed believe them, hath for matter of Faith, the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of a true Church; that which does not, has not.</hi> Now to this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though not to yours, <hi>D. Potter's</hi> assertion (if it be true) is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very pertinent. And though not a full and totall satisfaction to it,
yet very effectuall, and of great moment towards it. For the main
question being, what points are necessary to Salvation: and points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, being of two sorts, some of <hi>simple belief,</hi> some of
<hi>Practise and obedience,</hi> he that gives you a sufficient summary, of the
first sort of necessary points, hath brought you halfe way towards
your journies end. And therefore that which he does, is no more to
be slighted, as vain and impertinent, then an Architects work is to be
thought impertinent towards the making of a house, because he does
it not all himselfe. Sure I am, if his assertion be true, as I believe it is,
a corollary may presently be deduced from it, which if it were imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
cannot in all reason, but doe infinite service, both to the truth of
Christ, and the peace of Christendome. For seeing falsehood and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
could not long stand against the power of truth, were they not
supported by tyranny and worldly advantages, he that could assert
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7615:115"/>
Christians to that liberty which Christ and his Apostles left them,
must needs doe Truth a most Heroicall service. And seeing the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of the differences among Christians, is one of the greatest
maintainers of the Schisme of Christendome, he that could demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
that only these points of Beliefe, are simply necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein Christians generally agree, should he not lay a very faire
and firme foundation of the peace of Christendome? Now the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary
which I conceive would produce these good effects, and which
flowes naturally from D. <hi>Potters</hi> Assertion, is this, <hi>That what Man or
Church soever beleeves the Creed, and all the evident consequences of it
sincerely and heartily, cannot possibly (if also he beleeve the Scripture) be
in any Errour of simple beleife which is offensiue to God; nor therefore
deserve for any such Errour to be deprived of his life, or to be cut off from
the Churches Communion, and the hope of Salvation.</hi> And the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this againe would be this (which highly concernes the Church
of Rome to think of,) <hi>That whatsoever Man or Church does for any
errour of simple beleife, depriue any man so qualified as aboue, either of
his temporall life, or liuelyhood or liberty, or of the Churches Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and hope of salvation, is for the first uniust, cruell, and tyrannous:
Schismaticall, presumptuous, and uncharitable for the second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13 Neither yet is this (as you pretend) to take away the necessity
of beleeving those verities of Scripture, which are not contained in the
Creed, when once we come to know that they are written in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but rather to lay a necessity upon men of beleeving all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Scripture, when once they know them to be there written. For
he that beleeves not all knowne Divine Revelations to be true, how
does he believe in God? Vnlesse you will say, that the same man, at the
same time may not believe God, and yet believe in him. The greater
difficulty is, how it will not take away the necessity of beleeving Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the word of God? But that it will not neither. For though
the Creed be granted a sufficient summary of <hi>Articles of meere Faith,</hi>
yet no man pretends that it containes the <hi>Rules of obedience,</hi> but for
them, all men are referred to Scripture. Besides, he that pretends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God, obligeth himselfe to beleeve it necessary to obey that
which reason assures him to be the Will of God. Now reason will
assure him that beleeves the Creed, that it is the Will of God he should
beleeve the Scripture: even the very same Reason which moves him
to beleeve the Creed: Vniversall, and never failing Tradition, having
given this Testimony both to Creed and Scripture, that they both
by the works of God were sealed, &amp; testified to be the words of God.
And thus much be spoken in Answere to your first Argument; the
length whereof will be the more excusable, If I oblige my self to say
but little to the Rest.</p>
               <p>14 I come then <hi>to your second.</hi> And in Answer to it, denie flatly,
as a thing destructive of it self, that any Errour can be damnable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be repugnant immediatly or mediatly, directly or indirectly, of
it self or by accident, to some Truth for the matter of it fundamentall.
And to your example of <hi>Pontius Pilat's being Iudge of Christ,</hi> I say the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7615:116"/>
deniall of it in him that knowes it to be revealed by God, is manifestly
destructive of this fundamentall truth, that <hi>all Divine Revelations are
true.</hi> Neither will you find any errour so much as by accident dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
but the rejecting of it will be necessarily laid upon us, by a reall
beleif of all Fundamentals, and simply necessary Truths. And I desire
you would reconcile with this, that which you have said § 15. <hi>Every
Fundamentall Errour must have a contrary Fundamentall Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
of two Contradictory propositions, in the same degree, the one is
false, the other must be true, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15 <hi>To the Third</hi> I Answer; That the certainty I have of the Creed,
That it was from the Apostles, and containes the principles of
Faith, I ground it not upon Scripture, and yet not upon the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of any present, much lesse of your Church, but upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Ancient Church, and written Tradition, which (as D.
<hi>Potter</hi> hath proved) gave this constant Testimony unto it. Besides I
tell you, it is guilty of the same fault which D. <hi>Potter's</hi> Assertion is
here accused of: having perhaps some colour toward the proving it
false, but none at all to shew it impertinent.</p>
               <p>16 <hi>To the Fourth,</hi> I Answer plainly thus, That you finde fault with
D. <hi>Potter</hi> for his Vertues: you are offended with him for not usurping
the Authority which he hath not; in a word for not playing the <hi>Pope.</hi>
Certainly if Protestants be faulty in this matter, it is for doing it too
much, and not too little. This presumptuous imposing of the senses of
men upon the words of God, the speciall senses of men upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
words of God, and laying them upon mens consciences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
under the equall penaltie of death, and damnation; this Vaine
conceit that we can speak of the things of God, better then in the
word of God: This Deifying our owne Interpretations, and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
inforcing them upon others; This restraining of the word of
God from that latitude and generality, and the understandings of men
from that liberty, wherein Christ and Apostles left them,<note n="a" place="margin">This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion is no singularity of mine, but the doctrine which I have learn't from Divines of great learning and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Let the Reader be pleased to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth booke of <hi>Acontius de Stratag.

hath been the only fountaine of all the Schismes of the Church, and
that which makes them continue the common incendiary of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,

one. Take away this <hi>Persecuting, Burning, Cursing, Damning</hi> of men
for not subscribing to the <hi>words of men,</hi> as the words of God; Require
of Christians only to believe Christ, and to call no man master but
him only; Let those leave claiming Infallibility that have no title to it,
and let them that in their words disclaime it, disclaime it likewise in
their actions; In a word, take away tyranny, which is the Divels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to support errours, and superstitions, and impieties, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
parts of the world, which could not otherwise long withstand
the power of Truth, I say take away tyranny, and restore Christians
to their just and full liberty of captivating their understanding to
Scripture only, and as Rivers when they have a free passage, runne all
to the Ocean, so it may well be hoped by Gods blessing, that Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

Liberty thus moderated, may quickly reduce Christendome to
Truth and Vnitie. These thoughts of peace (I am perswaded) may
come from the God of peace, and to his blessing I commend them, and
proceed.</p>
               <p>18 <hi>Your fift and last obiection</hi> stands upon a false and dangerous
supposition: That <hi>new Heresies may arise.</hi> For an Heresie being in it
selfe nothing else but a Doctrine Repugnant to some Article of the
Christian Faith, to say that new Heresies may arise, is to say, that new
Articles of Faith may arise: and so some great ones among you stick
not to professe in plaine tearmes, who yet at the same time are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to pretend that your whole Doctrine is Catholique and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique.
So <hi>Salmeron: Non omnibus omnia dedit Deus, ut quaelibetaetas
suis gaudeat veritatibus, quas prior aetas ignoravit. God hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all things to All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that every age hath its proper verities, which the
former age was ignorant of:</hi> Disp. 57. In Ep. ad <hi>Rom:</hi> And againe in the
Margent: <hi>Habet Vnumquod<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> saeculum peculiares revelationes divinas,
Every age hath its peculiar Divine Revelations.</hi> Where that he speaks
of such Revelations as are, or may by the Church be made matters of
Faith, no man can doubt that reads him; an example whereof, he gives
us a little before in these words. <hi>Vnius Augustini doctrina Assumptionis
B. Deiparae cultum in Ecclesiam introduxit. The Doctrine of Augustine
only, hath brought in to the Church the Worship of the Assumption of the
Mother of God. &amp;c.</hi> Others againe mince and palliate the matter with
this pretence, that your Church undertakes not to coyne new Articles
of faith, but only to declare those that want sufficient declaration. But
if sufficient declaration be necessary to make any doctrine an Article
of Faith, then this doctrine which before wanted it, was not before an
Article of faith; and your Church by giving it the Essentiall forme,
and last complement of an Article of faith, makes it, though not a
Truth, yet certainly an Article of faith. But I would faine know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ and his Apostles knew this Doctrine, which you pretend
hath the matter, but wants the forme of an Article of faith, that is, <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
declaration,</hi> whether they knew it to be a necessary Article of the
faith, or no! If they knew it not to be so; then either they taught what
they knew not, which were very strange; or else they taught it not: and
if not, I would gladly be informed, seeing you pretend to no new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
from whom you learn't it? If they knew it, then either they
conceal'd or declar'd it. To say they conceal'd any necessary part of the
Gospell, is to charge them with farre greater sacriledge, then what was
punished in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> It is to charge these glorious Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
and dispensers of the Mysteries of Christ, with want of the
great vertue requisite in a Steward, which is <hi>Fidelity.</hi> It is to charge
them with presumption for denouncing Anathema's, even to Angels,
in case they should teach any other doctrine, then what they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which sure could not merit an Anathema, if they left any
necessary part of the Gospell untaught. It is in a word, in plaine tearmes
to give them the lye, seeing they professe plainly and frequently, that
they taught Christians <hi>the whole doctrine of Christ.</hi> If they did know
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7615:117"/>
and declare it, then was it a full and formall Article of faith; and the
contrary a full and formall Heresie, without any need of further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration:
and then their Successours either continued the declaration
of it, or discontinued: If they did the latter, how are they such faithfull
depositaries of Apostolique Doctrine as you pretend? Or what assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
can you give us, that they might not bring in new and false Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
as well as suffer the old and true ones to be lost? If they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the declaration of it, and deliver it to their Successours, and they
to theirs, and so on perpetually, then continued it still a full and formall
Article of faith, and the repugnant doctrine a full and formall Heresie,
without and before the definition or declaration of a Councell. So
that Councells, as they cannot make that a truth or falshood, which
before was not so: so neither can they make or declare that to be an
Article of Faith, or an Heresie, which before was not so. The supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therefore on which this argument stands, being false and runious,
whatsoever is built upon it, must together with it fall to the ground.
This explication therefore, and restriction of this doctrine, (whereof
you make your advantage) was to my understanding unnecessary.
The Fathers of the Church in after times might have just cause to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, touching the sense of some generall Articles of the
Creed: but to oblige others to receave their declarations under paine
of damnation, what warrant they had I know not. He that can shew,
either that the Church of all Ages was to have this Authority; or that it
continued in the Church for some Ages, and then expired: He that
can shew either of these things let him: for my part I cannot. Yet I
willingly confesse the judgment of a Councell, though not infallible,
is yet so farre directive, and obliging, that without apparent reason to
the contrary, it may be sinne to reject it, at least not to afford it an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
submission for publique peace-sake.</p>
               <p>19 <hi>Ad</hi> § 7. 8. 9. Were I not peradventure more fearefull then I
need to be of the imputation of tergiversation, I might very easily rid
my hands of the remainder of this Chapter: For in the Question there
discussed, you grant (for ought I see) as much as D. <hi>Potter</hi> desires;
and D. <hi>Potter</hi> grants as much as you desire, and therefore that I should
disease my self, or my Reader with a punctuall examination of it, may
seeme superfluous. First, that which you would have, and which your
Arguments wholy drive at, is this, That <hi>the Creed doth not containe all
maine and principall poynts of faith of all sorts, whether they be specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive,
or practicall,</hi> whether they containe matter of simple beleife, or
whether they containe matter of practise and obedience. This D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
grants, <hi>page</hi> 215. 235. And you grant that he grants it, §. 8.
Where your words are, <hi>as even by</hi> D. <hi>Potters owne confession, it (the
Creed) doth not comprehend Agenda, or things belonging to practice, as
Sacraments, Commandements, the Acts of hope, and duties Charity.</hi> And
if you will inferre from hence, that therefore <hi>C. M.</hi> hath no reason to
rest in the Apostles Creed, as a perfect Catalogue of Fundamentalls,
and a full satisfaction to his demande, I haue without any offence of
D. <hi>Potter,</hi> granted as much, if that would content you. But seeing you
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7615:117"/>
goe on, and because his assertion is not (as neither is it pretended to
be,) a totall satisfaction to the demand, casheere it as impertinent, and
nothing towards it, here I have been bold to stop your proceeding, as
unjust and unreasonable. For as if you should request a Friend to lend
you, or demand of a debtor to pay you a hundred pounds, and he
could or should let you have but fifty, this were not fully to satisfy
your demand, yet sure it were not to doe nothing towards it: Or as
this rejoynder of mine, though it be not an answer to all your Bookes,
but only to the First considerable Part of it, and so much of the Second
as is materiall, and falls into the first, yet I hope you will not deal so
unkindly with me, as for this reason, to condemne it of impertinence:
So <hi>D. Potter,</hi> being demanded a Catalogue of Fundamentals of Faith,
and finding them of two kinds, and those of one kind summ'd up to his
hand in the Apostles Creed, and this Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consign'd unto him for
such a summary by very great Authority, if upon these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he hath intreated his Demander to accept of thus much in part of
paiment, of the Apostles Creed, as a sufficient summary of these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of faith, which are <hi>meerely Credenda,</hi> me thinkes he hath little
reason to complain, that he hath not been fairely, and squarely dealt
with. Especially, seeing for full satisfaction, by <hi>D. Potter</hi> and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
he is referr'd to Scripture, which we affirme containes evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all necessary points of Faith and rules of obedience: and seeing <hi>D.
Potter,</hi> in the very place hath subjoyned, though not a Catalogue of
Fundamentalls, which (because to some more is Fundamentall, to
others lesse, to others nothing at all) had been impossible, yet such
a comprehension of them, as may serve every one, that will make a
conscionable use of it, in stead of a Catalogue. For thus he saies, <hi>It
seemes to be fundamentall to the faith, and for the Salvation of every
member of the Church, that he acknowledge and believe all such
points of faith, whereof he may be sufficiently convinced that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Doctrine of Iesus Christ.</hi> This generall rule if I should call
a Catalogue of Fundamentalls, I should have a President for it with
you above exception, I mean your Self; for, <hi>ch.</hi> 3. §. 19. just such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proposition you have called by this name. Yet because it were a
strange figure of speech, I forbear it; only I will be bold to say, that
this Assertion is as good a Catalogue of Fundamentalls, as any you
will bring of your Church proposalls, though you takes as much time
to doe it, as he that undertook to make an Asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>speak.</p>
               <p>20 I come now to shew that you also have requited <hi>D. Potter</hi>
with a mutuall courteous acknowledgement of his assertion, That the
Creed is a sufficient summary of all the necessary Articles of Faith,
which are meerely <hi>Credenda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21 <hi>First then,</hi> §. 8. <hi>you haue these words,</hi> That it cannot be denied
that the Creed is most full and compleat to that purpose, for which the
holy Apostles, inspired by God, meant that it should serve, and in that
manner as they did intend it, which was, not to comprehend all particular
points of faith, but such generall heads as were most befitting and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
for preaching the faith of Christ, to Iewes and Gentiles, and might be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7615:118"/>
briefly, and compendiously set down, and easily learnt and remembred.
<hi>These words I say, being fairely examined, without putting them on
the rack, will amount, to a full acknowledgement of</hi> D. Potters <hi>Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But before I put them to the question, I must crave thus much
right of you, to grant me this most reasonable postulate, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of</hi> repentance from dead workes, <hi>which S.</hi> Paul <hi>saith, was one of
the two only things which he preacht, and the doctrine</hi> of Charity,
without which (<hi>the same S.</hi> Paul <hi>assures us that</hi>) the knowledge of all my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
and all faith is nothing, <hi>were doctrines more necessary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
and therefore more fit to be preacht to Iewes and Gentiles,
then these,</hi> under what judge our Saviour suffered, <hi>that</hi> he was buried,
<hi>and</hi> what time he rose again: <hi>which you have taught us cap.</hi> 3. §. 2. for
their matter and nature in themselves not to be Fundamentall.</p>
               <p>22 And upon this grant, I will aske no leave to conclude, that,
whereas you say, <hi>the Apostles Creed was intended for a comprehension,
of such heads of faith, as were most befitting and requisite, for preaching
the faith of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> You are now, for fear, of too much debasing
those high doctrines of Repentance and Charity, to restrain your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
as <hi>D. Potter</hi> does his, and (though you speak indefinitely)
to say you meant it, only of those heads of faith, which are <hi>meerely
Credenda.</hi> And then the meaning of it, (if it have any,) must be this,
That the Creed is full for the Apostles intent, which was to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all such generall heads of faith, which being points of <hi>simple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi>
were most fit and requisite, to be preached to Iewes &amp; Gentiles,
and might be briefly and compendiously set down, and easily learned
and remembred. Neither I nor you, I believe, can make any other
sense of your words then this. And upon this ground thus I subsume.
But all the points of belief, which were necessary, under pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
for the Apostles to preach, and for those to whom the Gospell
was preached, particularly to know and believe, were most fit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
nay more then so, necessary to be preached to all both Iewes
and Gentiles, and might be briefly and compendiously set down, and
easily learnt and remembred: Therefore the Apostles intent by your
confession was in this Creed, to comprehend all such points. And you
say, <hi>the Creed is most full and compleat, for the purpose which they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
The Major of this Syllogisme is your own. The Minor I should
think needs no proof, yet because all men may not be of my mind, I
will prove it by its parts; and the first part thus,</p>
               <p>There is the same necessity, for the doing of these things, which are
commanded to be done, by the same Authority, under the same
penalty:</p>
               <p>But the same Authority <hi>viz.</hi> Divine, under the same penalty, to
wit, of damnation, commanded the Apostles, to preachall these
Doctrines which we speak of, and those to whom they were
preached, particularly to know and believe them: For we speak
of those only, which were so commanded, to be preached and
believed:</p>
               <p>Therefore all these points were alike necessary to be preaced to all
both Iewes and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:7615:118"/>Now that all these doctrines we speak of, may be briefly and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
set down, and easily learned and remembred, He that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that we spake only of such Doctrines as are necessary to be
taught and learned, will require hereof no farther demonstration. For,
(not to put you in minde of what the Poet saies, <hi>Non sunt longa quibus
nibilest quod demere possis,</hi>) who sees not, that seeing the greatest part
of men are of very mean capacities, that it is necessary that that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay
be learnt easily, which is to be learn't of all? What then can hinder me
from concluding thus,</p>
               <p>All the Articles of simple belief, which are fit and requisite to be
preached, and may easily be remembred, are by your confession
comprized in the Creed:</p>
               <p>But all the necessary Articles of faith are requisite to be preached,
and easy to be remembred;</p>
               <p>Therefore they are all comprized in the Creed?</p>
               <p>Secondly, from grounds granted by you, I argue thus,</p>
               <p>Points of belief in themselves fundamentall, are more requisite to
be preached then those which are not so: (this is evident.)</p>
               <p>But the Apostles have put into their Creed some points that are
not in themselves Fundamentall: (so you confesse, <hi>ubisupra.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Therefore if they have put in all, most requisite to be preached, they
have put in all, that in themselves are fundamentall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and Lastly, from your own words §. 26. thus I conclude my
purpose,</p>
               <p>The Apostles intention was, particularly to deliver in the Creed such
Articles as were fittest for those times, concerning the Deity, Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Messias; (<hi>Thus you, now I subsume,</hi>)</p>
               <p>But all points simply necessary, by vertue of Gods command, to be
preached and believed in particular, were as fit for those times
as these here mentioned;</p>
               <p>Therefore their intention was, to deliver in it particularly all the
necessary points of belief.</p>
               <p>23 And certainly, he that considers the matter advisedly, either
must say that the Apostles were not the Authors of it, or that this was
their designe in composing it, or that they had none at all. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you say, <hi>their intent was, to comprehend in it, such generall heads as
were most befitting and requisite for preaching the faith;</hi> and elsewhere,
<hi>Particularly to deliver such Articles as were fittest for those times;</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wise man may easily see that your desire here was, to escape away
in a cloud of inde finiteremes. For otherwise, in stead of such gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
heads, and such Articles, why did not you say plainly, all such, or
some such? This had been plain dealing, but I fear, crosse to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe:
which yet you have failed of. For that which you have spoken
(though you are loath to speak out,) either signifies nothing at all; or
that which I and <hi>D. Potter</hi> affirme: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apostles Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
all those points of belief, which were by Gods command, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to be preached to all, and believed by all. Neither when I say
so, would I be so mistaken; as if I said, that all points in the Creed are
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7615:119"/>
thus necessary: For Punies in Logick, know that universall affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
are not simply converted. And therefore it may be true, that all
such necessary points, are in the Creed; though it be not true, that all
points in the Creed are thus necessary: which I willingly grant, of the
points by you mentioned. But this rather confirmes, then any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validates
my assertion. For how could it stand with the Apostles wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e,
to put in any points circumstantiall and not necessary, and at the
same time, to leave out any that were essentiall and necessary for that
end, which you say, they proposed to themselves, in making the
Creed, that is, <hi>The preaching of the faith, to Iewes and Gentiles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>24 Neither may you hope, to avoid the pressure of these acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements,
by pretending as you doe §. 10. that you doe indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Creed to contain, all the necessary articles of faith; but
yet so, that they are not either there expressed in it, or de ducible from
it, by evident consequence, but <hi>only by way of implication or Reduction.</hi>
For first, not to tell you, that no proposition, is implied in any other,
which is not deducible from it; nor secondly, that the article of the
Catholique Church, wherein you will have all implyed, implies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to any purpose of yours, unlesse out of meer favour wee will
grant the sense of it to be, that the Church is infallible, and that yours
is the Church: to passe by all this, and require no answer to it, this one
thing I may not omit; that the Apostles intent was (by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession)
particularly to deliver in the Creed, such articles of belief as
were fittest for those times (and all necessary articles I have proved
were such:) now to deliver particularly, and to deliver only implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to be delivered particularly in the Creed, and only to be reducible
to it, I suppose are repugnances hardly reconcileable. And therefore
though we desire you, not to grant, that the Creed containes all points
of Faith of all sorts, any other way then by implication or reduction,
no nor so neither; yet you have granted, and must grant, of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
points of simple belief, those which the Apostles were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in particular to teach all men, and all men in particular to
know and believe, that these are delivered in the Creed, after a more
particular and punctuall manner, then implication or reduction comes
to.</p>
               <p>25 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. It is vain for you to hope, that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of the Ancient &amp; Modern Doctors, alleadged to this purpose
by <hi>D. Potter</hi> in great abundance, will be turn'd off, with this generall
deceitfull Answer, That the Allegation of them was needlesse to
prove, that the Creed containes all points of faith, under pretence that
you grant it in manner aforesaid. For what if you grant it in manner
aforesaid, yet if you grant it not (as indeed you doe but inconstantly)
in the sense which their testimonies require, then for all this their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
may be alleadged to very good purpose. Now let any man
read them, with any tolerable indifference, and he shall find they say
plainly, that all points of faith, necessary to be particularly believed,
are explicitly contained in the Creed; and that your glosse of implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and reduction, had it been confronted with their sentences, would
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7615:119"/>
have been much out of countenance, as having no ground nor colour

professe this, and yet for matter of faith be not a Catholique.</p>
               <p>26 <hi>The words of</hi> Cardinal Richelieu<note n="e" place="margin">Instruction du Chrestien Lecon premie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</note> 
                  <hi>exact this sense, and refuse
your glosse as much as any of the former:</hi> The Apostles Creed is the
Summary and Abridgment of that faith which is necessary for a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
These holy persons being by the Commandement of Iesus Christ to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse
themselves over the world, and in all parts by preaching the Gospell
to plant the faith, esteemed it very necessary to reduce into a short summe
all that which Christians ought to know, to the end that being dispersed
into divers parts of the world, they might preach the same thing in a short
for me, that it might be the easier remembred. For this effect they called
this Abridgment a Symbole, which signifies a mark or signe, which might
serue to distinguish true Christians, which imbraced it from Infidels
which rejected it. <hi>Now I would fain know how the composition of the
Creed could serue for this end, and secure the Preachers of it, that they
should preach the same thing, if there were other necessary Articles not
compriz'd in it. Or how could it be a signe to distinguish true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
from others, if a man might belieue it all, and for want of believing
something else, not be a true Christian?</hi>

                     </gap>. 2. p. 4. in sin.</note> Gregory of Valence <hi>affirmes our Assertion even in
termes:</hi> The Articles of faith contained in the Creed are as it were the first
principles of the Christian faith, in which is contained the summe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall
doctrine, which all men are bound explicitely to belieue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:7615:120"/>29 To these Testimonies of your own Doctors, I should haue
added the concurrent suffrages of the ancient Fathers, but the full and
free acknowledgment of the same <hi>Valentia</hi> in the place aboue quoted
will make this labour unnecessary. <hi>So iudge</hi> (saith hee) <hi>the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
affirming that his Symbole of faith was composed by the Apostles,
that all might haue a short summe of those things which are to be belieued,
and are dispersedly contain'd in Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30 Neither is there any discord between this Assertion of your
Doctors, and their holding themselues oblig'd to belieue all the points
which the Councell of Trent defines. For Protestants &amp; Papists may
both hold, that all points of beliefe necessary to be known &amp; belieued,
are summ'd up in the Creed: and yet both the one &amp; the other think
themselues bound to belieue whatsoever other points, they either
know or belieue to be revealed by God. For the Articles which are
necessary to be known that they are revealed by God, may bee very
few; and yet those which are necessary to be believed, when they are
revealed and known to be so, may be very many.</p>
               <p>31 But <hi>Summaries and Abstracts are not intended to specifie all the
particulars of the science or subiect to which they belong.</hi> Yes if they bee
intended for perfect Summaries, they must not omit any necessary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of that Science whereof they are Summaries; though the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
and Reasons of it they may omit. If this were not so, a man
might set down forty or fifty of the Principall definitions and divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and rules of Logick, and call it a Summary or Abstract of Logick.
But sure, this were no more a Summary, then that were the picture of
a man in little, that wanted any of the parts of a man; or that a totall
summe wherein all the particulars were not cast up. Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed you here intimate that it was intended for a Summary: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
why talk you here of Summaries, and tell us that they need
not contain all the particulars of their science? And of what I pray
may it be a Summary, but of the Fundamentals of Christian faith?
Now you haue already told us, <hi>That it is most full and compleat to that
purpose for which it was intended.</hi> Lay all this together, and I belieue
the product will be; That the Apostles Creed is a perfect Summary
of the Fundamentalls of the Christian faith: and what the duty of a
perfect Summary is, I haue already told you.</p>
               <p>32 Whereas therefore to disproue this Assertion, in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of this Chapter, but especially the fourteenth, you muster up
whole armies of doctrines, which you pretend are necessary, and not
contain'd in the Creed; I answer very briefly thus: That the doctrines
you mention, are either concerning matters of practise, and not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
beliefe; or else they are such doctrines wherein God has not so
plainly revealed himselfe, but that honest and good men, true Lovers
of God and of Truth, those that desire aboue all things to know his
will and doe it, may erre, and yet commit no sinne at all, or only a sinne
of infirmity, and not destructiue of salvation; or lastly, they are such
Doctrines which God hath plainly revealed, and so are necessary to
be belieued when they are known to be divine, but not necessary to be
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7615:120"/>
known &amp; believed, not necessary to be known for divine, that they may
be believed. Now all these sorts of doctrines are impertinent to the
present Question. For D. <hi>Potter</hi> never affirmed either that the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duties of a Christian, or that all Truths piously credible, but not
necessary to be believed, or that all Truths necessary to bee believed
upon the supposall of divine Revelation, were specified in the Creed.
For this he affirmes, only of such speculatiue divine veriries, which
God hath commanded particularly to be preached to all, and believed
by all. Now let the doctrines objected by you be well considered, and
let all those that are reducible to the three former heads be discarded,
and then of all these Instances against D. <hi>Potters</hi> Assertion, there will
not remain so much as one.</p>
               <p>33 First the Questions touching the conditions to bee performed
by us to obtaine remission of sinnes; the Sacraments; the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the possibility of keeping them, the necessity of imploring
the Assistance of Gods Grace and Spirit for the keeping of them: how
farre obedience is due to the Church: Prayer for the Dead: The cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the old Law: are all about <hi>Agenda,</hi> and so cut off upon the first
consideration.</p>
               <p>34 Secondly, the Question touching Fundamentalls, is profitable
but not fundamentall. He that belieues all Fundamentals, cannot bee
damned for any errour in faith, though he belieue more or lesse to bee
fundamental then is so. That also of the procession of the holy Ghost
from the Father and the Sonne: of Purgatory: of the Churches Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:
of the Books of the new Testament which were doubted of by
a considerable part of the Primitiue Church: (untill I see better reason
for the contrary then the bare authority of men,) I shall esteem of the
same condition.</p>
               <p>35 Thirdly, These Doctrines that <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels sinned:
that there are Angels good and bad: that those bookes of Scripture
which were never doubted of by any considerable part of the Church,
are the word of God: that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had no such primacy as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend:
that the Scripture is a perfect rule of faith, &amp; consequently that
no necessary doctrine is unwritten: that there is no one Society or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Christians absolutely infallible: These to my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
are truths plainly revealed by God, and necessary to be believed
by them who know they are so. But not so necessary, that every man
&amp; woman is bound under pain of damnation particularly to know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be divine Revelations, and explicitely to believe them. And for this
reason, these with innumerable other points, are to be referred to the
third sort of doctrines aboue mentioned, which were never pretended
to haue place in the Creed. There remaines one only point of all that
Army you mustred together, reducible to none of these heads, &amp; that
is, that God is, and is a Remunerator, which you say is questioned by
the deniall of merit. But if there were such a necessary indissoluble
coherence between this point and the doctrine of merit, mee thinks
with as much reason, and more charity you might conclude, That we
hold merit, because we hold this point; Then that we deny this point,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7615:121"/>
because we deny merit. Besides, when Protestants deny the doctrine
of Merits, you know right well, for so they haue declared themselues a
thousand times, that they mean nothing else, but with <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>their
well doing extendeth not, is not truly beneficiall to God:</hi> with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>when they haue done all which they are commanded, they haue done
their duty only,</hi> and no curtesie: And lastly, with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> that <hi>all which
they can suffer for God</hi> (and yet suffering is more then doing) <hi>is not
worthy to bee compared to the glory that shall be revealed.</hi> So that you
must either misunderstand their meaning in denying Merit, or you
must discharge their doctrine of this odious consequence, or you must
charge it upon <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe. Nay you must
either grant their deniall of true Merit just &amp; reasonable, or you must
say, that our good actions are really profitable to God: that they are
not debts already due to him, but voluntary and undeserved Favours:
and that they are equall unto and well worthy of eternall glory which
is prepar'd for them. As for the inconvenience which you so much
feare, That the deniall of Merit makes God a Giver only, &amp; not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder,
I tell you, good Sir, you feare where no feare is, and that it is
both most true on the one side, that you in holding good Works me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
of eternall glory make God a rewarder only &amp; not a giver,
contrary to plain Scripture, affirming that <hi>The gift of God is eternall
life;</hi> And that it is most false on the other side, that the doctrine of
Protestants makes God a giver only and not a rewarder: In as much
as their doctrine is, That God giues not Heaven but to those which
doe something for it, and so his gift is also a Reward; but withall that
whatsoever they doe is due unto God before hand, and worth nothing
to God, and worth nothing in respect of Heaven, and so mans work is
no Merit, and Gods reward is still a Gift.</p>
               <p>36 Put the case the Pope, for a reward of your service done him in
writing this Book, had given you the honour and meanes of a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
would you not, not only in humility but in sincerity haue profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that you had not merited such a Reward? And yet the Pope is
neither your Creatour nor Redeemer, nor Preserver, nor perhaps your
very great Benefactour, sure I am, not so great as God Almighty, and
therefore hath no such right and title to your service as God hath in
respect of precedent obligations. Besides, the work you haue done him
hath been really advantagious to him: and lastly, not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable
to the fore-mentioned Reward. And therefore if by
the same work you will pretend that either you haue or hope to haue
deserved immortall happinesse, I beseech you consider well whether
this be not to set a higher value upon a Cardinal's cap, then a Crowne
of immortall glory, and with that Cardinall to prefer a part in <hi>Paris</hi>
before a part in <hi>Paradise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>37 In the next Paragraph you beat the ayre again, and fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with your own shadow. The point you should haue spoken to,
was this, That there are some points of simple beliefe necessary to bee
explicitely believed, which yet are not contained in the Creed. Insteed
hereof you trouble your selfe in vain to demonstrate, That <hi>many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7615:121"/>
points of faith, are not contained in it,</hi> which yet <hi>D. Potter</hi> had
freely granted, and you your selfe take particular notice of his grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. All this paines therefore you have imployed to no purpose:
saving that to some negligent Reader you may seem to have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the very point, because that which you speak to, at the first
hearing, sounds somewhat neere it. But such a one I must intreat to
remember, there be many more points of faith then there be Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Simple belief, necessary to be explicitly believed: And that
though all of the former sort are not contained in the Creed, yet all
of the latter sort may be. As for your distinction, between Heresies
that have been, and Heresies that are, and Heresies that may be, I have
already proved it vaine; and that whatsoever may be an Heresie, that
is so; and whatsoever is so, that alwaies hath been so, ever since the
publication of the Gospell of Christ. The doctrine of your Church
may like a snow-ball increase with rowling, and again if you please
melt away and decrease: But as <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> so his Gospell, <hi>is yesterday
and to day, and the same for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>38 Our Saviour sending his Apostles to preach, gave them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commission then this: <hi>Goe teach all nations, Baptizing them in the
name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghost, teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
all things, whatsoever I have commanded you.</hi> These were the
bounds of their commission. If your Church have any larger, or if she
have a commission at large, to teach what she pleases, and call it the
Gospell of Christ, let her produce her Letters-patents from heaven
for it. But if this be all you have, then must you give me leave to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
it both great sacriledge in you to forbid any thing, be it never
so small or ceremonious, which Christ hath commanded: as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the Communion in both kindes: and as high a degree of
presumption, to enjoyne men to believe, that there are or can be any
other fundamentall Articles of the Gospell of Christ, then what
Christ himselfe commanded his Apostles to teach all men; or any
damnable Heresies, but such as are plainly repugnant to these prime
Verities.</p>
               <p>39 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 16. 17. The saying of the most learned Prelate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
man, the <hi>Arch-Bishop of Armach,</hi> is only related by <hi>D. Potter</hi>
p. 155. and not applauded: though the truth is, both the Man deserves
as much applause as any man, and his saying as much as any saying; it
being as great, and as good a truth, and as necessary for these miserable
times, as possibly can be uttered. For this is most certain, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you will easily grant it, that to reduce Christians to unity of
Communion, there are but two waies that may be conceived proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
The one, by taking away diversity of opinions touching matters
of Religion: The other by shewing that the diversity of opinions,
which is among the severall Sects of Christians, ought to be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to their Vnity in Communion.</p>
               <p>40 Now the former of these is not to be hoped for without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
unlesse that could be done, which is impossible to be performed,
though it be often pretended; that is, unlesse it could be made evident
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7615:122"/>
to all men, that God hath appointed some visible Iudge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
to whose judgement all men are to submit themselves. What
then remaines, but that the other way must be taken, and Christians
must be taught to ser a higher value upon these high points of faith
and obedience wherein they agree, then upon these matters of lesse
moment wherein they differ, and understand that agreement in those,
ought to be more effectuall to joyne them in one Communion, then
their difference in other things of lesse moment to divide them? When
I say, <hi>in one Communion,</hi> I mean, in a common Profession of those arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of faith, wherein all consent: A joynt worship of God, after such
a way as all esteem lawfull; and a mutuall performance of all those
works of charity, which Christians own one to another. And to such
a Communion what better inducement could be thought of, then to
demonstrate that what was universally believed of all Christians, if it
were joyned with a love of truth, and with holy obedience, was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to bring men to heaven? For why should men be more rigid then
God? Why should any errour exclude any man from the Churches
Communion, which will not deprive him of eternall salvation? Now
that Christians doe generally agree in all those points of doctrine,
which are necessary to Salvation, it is apparent, because they agree
with one accord, in believing all those Bookes of the Old and New
Testament, which in the Church were never doubted of to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
word of God. And it is so certain that in all these Bookes, all
necessary doctrines are evidently contained, that of all the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
this is very probable, but of S. <hi>Luke</hi> most apparent, that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of their Bookes they have comprehended the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Gospell of Christ. For what reason can be imagined, that
any of them should leave out any thing which he knew to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and yet (as apparently all of them have done) put in many things
which they knew to be only profitable and not necessary? What wise
and honest man that were now to write the Gospell of Christ, would
doe so great a work of God after such a negligent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ashon? Suppose
<hi>Xaverius</hi> had been to write the Gospell of Christ for the Indians,
think you he would have left out any Fundamentall doctrine of it? If
not, I must beseech you to conceive as well of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> and S.
<hi>Marke,</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as you doe of <hi>Xaverius.</hi> Besides, if
every one of them have not in them all necessary doctrines, how have
they complied with their own designe, which was, as the titles of their
Bookes shew, to write <hi>the Gospell of Christ,</hi> and not a part of it? Or
how have thy not deceived us, in giving them such titles? By the
whole Gospell of Christ, I understand not the whole History of
Christ, but all that makes up the Covenant between God and man.
Now if this be wholly contained in the Gospell of S. <hi>Marke</hi> and S.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> I believe every considering man will bee inclinable to believe
that then without doubt, it is contained, with the advantage of many
other very profitable things, in the larger Gospells of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and
S. <hi>Luke.</hi> And that S. <hi>Markes</hi> Gospell wants no necessary Article of
this Covenant, I presume you will not deny, if you believe <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:7615:122"/>
when he saies, <hi>Mathew to the Hebrewes in their tongue published the
Scripture of the Gospell: When Peter and Paul did preach the Gospell, and
found the Church or a Church at Rome, or of Rome, and after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
Mark the scholler of Peter, delivered to us in writing those
things which had been preached by Peter; and Luke, the follwer of Paul,
compiled in a book the Gospell which was preached by him: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Iohn, residing in Asia, in the Citty of Ephesus, did himselfe also
set forth a Gospell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41 In which words of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> it is remarkable that they are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by him against some Heretiques, that pretended (as you know who
doe now adaies) that <hi>some necessary Doctrines of the Gospell were unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and that <hi>out of the Scriptures, truth</hi> (he must mean sufficient truth,)
<hi>cannot be found by those which know not Tradition.</hi> Against whom to
say, that part of the Gospell which was preached by <hi>Peter</hi> was written
by S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and some other necessary parts of it omitted, had been to
speak impertinently, and rather to confirme then confute their errour.
It is plain therefore, that he must mean, as I pretend, that all the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
doctrine of the Gospell, which was preached by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> was
written by S. <hi>Marke.</hi> Now you will not deny, I presume, that S. <hi>Peter</hi>
preached all, therefore you must not deny that S. <hi>Marke</hi> wrote all.</p>
               <p>42 Our next inquiry let it be touching S. <hi>Iohns</hi> intent in writing
his Gospell, whether it were to deliver so much truth, as being belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and obeyed would certainly bring men to eternall life, or only
part of it, and to leave part unwritten? A great man there is, but much
lesse then the Apostle, who saith, that <hi>writing last, he purposed to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the defects of the other Evangelists, that had wrote before him:</hi> which
(if it were true) would sufficiently justify what I have undertaken, that
at least all the four Evangelists have in them, all the necessary parts of
the Gospell of Christ. Neither will I deny, but S. <hi>Iohns</hi> secondary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
might be to supply the defects of the former three Gospels, in
some things very profitable. But he that pretends, that any necessary
doctrine is in S. <hi>Iohn</hi> which is in none of the other Evangelists, hath
not so well considered them as he should doe, before he pronounce
sentence of so weighty a matter. And for his prime intent in writing
his Gospell, what that was, certainly no Father in the world under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
it better then himselfe. Therefore let us hear him speak: <hi>Many
other signes</hi> (saith he) <hi>also did Iesus in the sight of his Disciples, which
are not written in this Book: But these are written, that you may believe
that Iesus is Christ the sonne of God, and that believing you may have life
in his name.</hi> By (<hi>these are written</hi>) may be understood, either <hi>these
things</hi> are written, or <hi>these signes</hi> are written. Take it which way you
will, this conclusion will certainly follow, That either all that which
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote in his Gospell, or lesse then all, and therefore all much
more was sufficient to make them believe that which being believed
with lively faith, would certainly bring them to eternall life.</p>
               <p>43 This which hath been spoken (I hope) is enough to justify my
undertaking to the full, that it is very probable that every one of
the foure Evangelists has in his book the whole substance, all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7615:123"/>
parts of the Gospell of Christ. But for S. <hi>Luke,</hi> that he hath
written such a perfect Gospell, in my judgement it ought to be with
them that believe him, no manner of question. Consider first the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to his Gospell, where he declares what he intends to write,
in these words, <hi>For as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in
order a declaration of those things, which are most surely believed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, even as they delivered unto us, which from the beginning were
eye-witnesses, and ministers of the word, it seemed good to me also, having
had perfect understanding of things from the first, to write to thee in order,
most excellent Theophilus, that thou mightest know the certainty, of those
things wherein thou hast been instructed.</hi> Adde to this place, the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to his <hi>History of the Acts of the Apostles: The former treatise have I
made, O Theophilus, of all that Iesus began both to doe and teach, untill
the day in which he was taken up.</hi> Weigh well these two places, and
then answer me freely and ingenuously to these demands. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
S. <hi>Luke</hi> does not undertake the very same thing which he saies,
<hi>many had taken in hand?</hi> 2. Whether this were not <hi>to set forth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
a declaration of those things which are most surely believed amongst
Christians?</hi> 3. Whether the whole Gospell of Christ, and every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
doctrine of it, were not surely believed among Christians?
4. Whether they which were <hi>Eye-witnesses and ministers of the word
from the begining, delivered not the whole Gospell of Christ?</hi> 5. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he does not undertake to write in order these things <hi>whereof he
had perfect understanding</hi> from the first? 6. Whether he had not
perfect understanding of the whole Gospell of Christ? 7. Whether
he doth not undertake to write to <hi>Theophilus</hi> of all those things <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he had been instructed?</hi> 8. And whether he had not been instructed
in all the necessary parts of the Gospell of Christ? 9. Whether in the
other Text, <hi>All things which Iesus began to doe and teach,</hi> must not at
least imply, all the Principall and necessary things? 10. Whether
this be not the very interpretation of your Rhemish Doctors, in their
Annotation upon this place? 11. Whether all these Articles of the
Christian faith, without the belief whereof, no man can be saved, be
not the Principall and most necessary things which <hi>Iesus</hi> taught.
12. And lastly, whether many things which S. <hi>Luke</hi> has wrote in his
Gospell, be not lesse principall, and lesse necessary then all and every
one of these? When you have well considered these proposalls, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you will be very apt to think (if S. <hi>Luke</hi> be of credit with you)
That all things necessary to salvation, are certainly contained in his
writings alone. And from hence you will not choose but conclude,
that seeing all the Christians in the world, agree in the belief of what
S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath written, and not only so, but in all other Books of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Scripture, which were never doubted of in and by the Church,
the Learned Arch-Bishop had very just, and certain ground to say,
<hi>That in these Propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which without Controversy are universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the whole Christian world, so much truth is contained, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joyned with holy obedience, may be sufficient to bring a man to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Salvation; and that we have no cause to doubt, but that as many
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7615:123"/>
as walk according to this rule, neither overthrowing that which they
have builded, by superinducing any damnable Heresy thereupon, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
vitiating their holy faith, with a lewd and wicked conversation,
peace shall be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>44 Against this, you object two things. The one, that by this
Rule, <hi>seeing the Doctrine of the Trinity is not received universally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians, the deniall of it shall not exclude Salvation.</hi> The other;
that the <hi>Bishop contradicts himselfe, in supposing a man may belieue all
necessary Truths, and yet superinduce some damnable Heresies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>45 To the first I answere, what I conceive he would, whose words
I here justify, that he hath declared plainly in this very place, that he
meant, not an absolute, but a limited Vniversality, and speaks not of
propositions universally believed by all Professions of Christianity
that are, but only, by all those severall Professions of Christiany, that
have any large spread in <hi>any part of the world.</hi> By which words he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
from the universality here spoken of, the denyers of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity, as being but a handfull of men, in respect of all,
nay in respect of any of these professions which maintain it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was a great fault in you, either willingly to conceal these words,
which evacuate your objection, or else negligently to oversee them.
Especially seeing your friend, to whom you are so much beholding,
<hi>Paulus Veridicus,</hi> in his scurrilous and sophisticall Pamphlet, against
<hi>B. Vshers</hi> Sermon, hath so kindly offered to lead you by the hand to
the observation of them, in these words: <hi>To consider of your Coinopista,
or communitèr Credenda, Articles, as you call them, universally belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all these severall Professions of Cristianity, which have any large
spread in the World: These Articles for example, may be the Vnity of the
Godhead, the Trinity of persons, the immortality of the Soule, &amp;c.</hi> Where
you see that your friend, whom you so much magnify, hath plainly
confessed that, notwithstanding the Bishops words, the denyall of the
doctrine of the Trinity, may exclude Salvation; and therefore in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
and applauding his Answer to the Bishops Sermon, you have
unawares allowed this Answer of mine to your own greatest obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>46 Now for the foule contradiction, which you say the <hi>Doctor</hi>
might easily haue espied in the Bishops saying, he desires your pardon
for his oversight, for <hi>Paulus Veridicus</hi> his sake; who though he set him
selfe to finde faults with the Bishops Sermon, yet it seemes this hee
could not finde, or else questionlesse wee should haue heard of it from
him. And therefore if <hi>D. Potter,</hi> being the Bishops friend, haue not been
more sharp-sighted then his enemies, this he hopes to indifferent jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
will seem no unpardonable offence. Yet this I say, not as if there
were any contradiction at all, much lesse any foul contradiction in the
Bishops words; but as <hi>Antipherons</hi> picture, which he thought he saw
in the ayre before him, was not in the ayre but in his disturb'd phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
so all the contradiction which here you descant upon, is not indeed
in the Bishops saying, but in your imagination. For wherein, I pray,
lies this foule contradiction? <hi>In supposing</hi> (say you) <hi>a man may believe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7615:124"/>
all Truths necessary to salvation, and yet superinduce a damnable Heresie.</hi>
I answer, It is not certain that his words doe suppose this: neither if
they doe, does he contradict himselfe. I say it is not certain that his
words import any such matter. For ordinarily men use to speake and
write so, as here he does, when they intend not to limit or restrain, but
only to repeat and presse &amp; illustrate what they haue said before. And
I wonder, why with your Eagles eyes you did not espy another foule
contradiction in his words as well as this; and say, that he supposes a
man may walk according to the rule of holy obedience, and yet vitiate
his holy faith with a lewd and wicked conversation? Certainly a lewd
conversation is altogether as contradictious to holy obedience, as a
damnable heresie to necessary truth. What then was the reason that
you espied not this foule contradiction in his words, as well as that?
Was it because, according to the spirit and Genius of your Church,
your zeal is greater to that which you conceive true doctrine, then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obedience; and think simple errour a more capitall crime, then sins
committed against knowledge and conscience? Or was it because your
Reason told you, that herein he meant onely to repeat and not to limit
what he said before? And why then had you not so much candour to
conceave, that he might haue the same meaning in the former part of
the disiunction; and intend no more but this, Whosoever walks accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this rule of believing all necessary Truths and holy obedience,
(neither poisoning his faith of those Truths which he holds, with the
mixture of any damnable Heresie, nor vitiating it with a wicked life)
Peace shall be upon him! In which words what man of any ingenuity
will not presently perceive that the words within the parenthesis, are
only a repetition of, and no exception from those that are without?
S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Creed tells us, <hi>The Catholique Faith is this, that we
worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Vnity, neither confounding the
Persons nor dividing the Substance;</hi> and why now doe you not tell him
that he contradicts himselfe, and supposes that we may worship a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Persons, and one God in substance, and yet confound the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or divide the substance; which yet is impossible, because Three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Three, cannot be confounded, and One remaining One cannot
be divided? If a man should say unto you, he that keeps all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God, committing no sinne either against the loue of
God, or the loue of his neighbour, is a perfect man: Or thus, he that will
liue in constant health had need be exact in his diet, neither eating too
much, nor too little: Or thus, hee that will come to London must goe
on straight forward in such a way, and neither turn to the right hand
or to the left; I verily belieue you would not finde any contradiction
in his words, but confesse them as coherent and consonant as any in
your Book. And certainly if you would look upon this saying of the
Bishop with any indifference, you would easily perceive it to be of the
very same kinde, &amp; capable of the very same construction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one of the grounds of your accusation is uncertain. Neither can
you assure us, that the Bishop supposes any such matter as you pretend.
Neither if he did suppose this (as perhaps he did) were this to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7615:124"/>
himselfe. For though there can be no damnable Heresie, unlesse it
contradict some necessary Truth, yet there is no contradiction but the
same man may at once belieue this Heresie and this Truth; because
there is no contradiction that the same man, at the same time, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
contradictions. For, first, whatsoever a man believes true, that he
may and must believe; But there haue been some who have believed
and taught that contradictions might be true, against whom <hi>Aristotle</hi>
disputes in the third of his <hi>Metaphysicks;</hi> Therefore it is not impossible
that a man may belieue Contradictions. Secondly, they which believe
there is no certainty in Reason, must belieue that contradictions may
be true: For otherwise there will be certainty in this Reason; This
contradicts Truth therefore it is false. But there be now divers in the
world who believe there is no certainty in reason, (and whether you
be of their minde or no, I desire to be inform'd;) Therefore there be
divers in the world who believe contradictions may be true. Thirdly,
They which doe captivate their understandings to the beliefe of those
things which to their understanding seem irreconcileable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
may as well belieue reall contradictions: (For the difficulty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
arises not from their being repugnant, but from their seeming
to be so:) But you doe captivate your understandings to the beliefe of
those things which seem to your understandings irreconcileable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions;
Therefore it is as possible and easie for you to believe
those that indeed are so. Fourthly, some men may be confuted in their
errours, and perswaded out of them; but no mans errour can be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
who together with his errour doth not believe and grant some true
principle that contradicts his Errour: for nothing can bee proved to
him who grants nothing, neither can there be (as all men know) any
rationall discourse but out of grounds agreed upon by both parts.
Therfore it is not impossible but absolutely certain, that the same man
at the same time may believe contradictions. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> It is evident, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can you without extream madnesse and uncharitablenesse, deny,
that we belieue the Bible, those Books I mean which we believe Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall:
Otherwise why dispute you with us out of them, as out of a
common Principle? Either therefore you must retract your opinion,
and acknowledge that the same man at the same time may believe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
or else you will run into a greater inconvenience, and be
forc'd to confesse, that no part of our Doctrine contradicts the Bible.
Sixtly, I desire you to vindicate from contradiction these following
Assertions: That there should be Length and nothing long: Breadth, &amp;
nothing broad: Thicknesse, and nothing thick: Whitenesse, &amp; nothing
white: Roundnesse, and nothing round: Weight, and nothing heavy:
Sweetnesse, and nothing sweet: Moisture, and nothing moist: Fluid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and nothing flowing: many Actions, and no Agent: Many Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and no Patient: That is, that there should be a Long, broad, thick,
white, round, heavy, sweet, moist, flowing, active, passive, nothing!
That Bread should be turned into the substance of Christ, and yet not
any thing of the Bread become any thing of Christ; neither the matter,
not the form, not the Accidents of Bread, be made either the matter or
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7615:125"/>
the Forme, or the Accidents of Christ. That Bread should be turned
into nothing, and at the same time with the same action turn'd into
Christ, and yet Christ should not be nothing. That the same thing at
the same time should haue its just dimensions, and just distance of its
parts, one from another, and at the same time not haue it, but all its
parts together in one &amp; the selfe same point. That the body of Christ,
which is much greater, should be contained wholly and in its full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
without any alteration, in that which is lesser, and that not
once only, but as many times over as there are severall points in the
Bread and Wine. That the same thing at the same time should bee
wholly aboue it selfe, and wholly below it selfe, within it selfe, and
without it selfe, on the right hand, and on the left hand, and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it selfe. That the same thing at the same time should moue to and
from it selfe, and lye still: Or that it should be carried from one place
to another through the middle space, and yet not move. That it should
be brought from heaven to earth, and yet not come out of Heaven, nor
be at all in any of the middle space between Heaven and Earth. That
to be one, should be to be undivided from it selfe, and yet that one and
the same thing should be divided from it selfe. That a thing may be, &amp;
yet be no where. That a Finite thing may be in all places at once. That
a Body may be in a place, and haue there its dimensions, &amp; colour, &amp;
all other qualities, and yet that it is not in the power of God to make it
visible, and tangible there, nor capable of doing or suffering any thing.
That there should be no certainty in our senses, and yet that we should
know something certainly, &amp; yet know nothing but by our se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ses. That
that which is, and was long agoe, should now begin to be. That that is
now to be made of nothing, which is not nothing but something. That
the same thing should be before and after it selfe. That it should bee
truly and really in a place, and yet without Locality. Nay, that hee
which is Omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t should not be able to give it Locality in this place,
where it is, as some of you hold: or if he can, as others say he can, that it
should be possible, that the same man, for example You or I, may at
the sametime, be awake at <hi>London,</hi> and not awake but asleep at <hi>Rome:</hi>
There run or walk, here not run or walk, but stand still, sit, or lye along:
There study or write, here doe neither, but dine or sup: There speak,
here be silent. That he may in one place freez for cold, in another
burn with heat. That he may be drunk in one place, and sober in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Valiant in one place, and a Coward in another: A theef in one
place, honest in another. That he may be a Papist and goe to Masse in
<hi>Rome;</hi> A Protestant and goe to Church in <hi>England.</hi> That he may dye
in <hi>Rome,</hi> and liue in <hi>England:</hi> or 'dying in both places may goe to Hell
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Heaven from <hi>England.</hi> That the Body and Soule of
Christ should cease to be where it was, &amp; yet not goe to another place,
nor be destroyed. All these, and many other of the like nature are the
unavoidable, &amp; most of them the acknowledged consequences of your
doctrine of Transubstantiation, as is explained one where or other by
your School-men. Now I beseech you, Sir, to try your skill, &amp; if you
can compose their repugnance, and make peace between them; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7615:125"/>
none but you shall be <hi>Catholique Moderator.</hi> But if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe it, and that after an intelligible manner, then you must give me
leave to believe, that either you doe not believe Transubstantiation,
or else that it is no contradiction, that men should subjugate their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
to the belief of contradictions.</p>
               <p>47 Lastly, I pray tell me whether you have not so much Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in store for the <hi>Bishop of Armach, and D. Potter,</hi> as to think that they
themselves believe this saying, which the one preacht and printed,
the other reprinted, and as you say applauded? If you think they doe,
then certainly you have done unadvisedly, either in charging it with a
foul contradiction, or in saying, it is impossible, that any man should
at once believe contradictions. Indeed that men should not assent to
contradictions, and that it is unreasonable to doe so, I willingly grant:
But to say it is impossible to be done, is against every mans experience,
and almost as unreasonable, as to doe the thing which is said to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
For though perhaps it may be very difficult, for a man in his

if he believe it to be a contradiction, yet for men being cowed and
awed by superstition, to perswade themselves upon slight and triviall
grounds, that these or these, though they seem contradictions, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are not so, and so to believe them: or if the plain repugnance of
them, be veil'd and disguis'd a little, with some empty unintelligible
non-sense distinction; or if it be not exprest but implyed, not direct
but by consequence, so that the parties, to whose faith the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are offerd, are either innocently, or perhaps affectedly ignorant of
the contrariety of them: for men in such cases, easily to swallow and
digest contradictions, he that denies it possible, must be a meer stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the world.</p>
               <p>48 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 18. This Paragraph consists of two immodest untruths,
obtruded upon us without shew, or shadow of Reason: and an evident
sophisme, grounded upon an affected mistake of the sense of the word
<hi>Fundamentall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>49 The first untruth is, that <hi>D. Potter makes a Church, of men agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
scarcely in one point of faith: of men concurring in some one or few
Articles of belief, and in the rest holding conceits plainly contradictory:
Agreeing only in this one Article, that Christ is our Saviour; but for the
rest, like to the parts of a Chimaera &amp;c.</hi> Which I say is a shamelesse ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
not only because <hi>D. Potter</hi> in this point delivers not his own
judgement, but relates the opinion of others, M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and M. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi>
but especially, because even these men (as they are related by <hi>D.
Potter</hi>) to the constituting of the very essence of a Church, in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree, require not only <hi>Faith in Christ Iesus the sonne of God and
Saviour of the World,</hi> but also <hi>submission to his Doctrine in mind and
will.</hi> Now I beseech you Sir, tell me ingenuously, whether the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ may be called without blasphemy, <hi>scarcely one point
of Faith?</hi> or whether it consists only, <hi>of some one or few Articles of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief?</hi>
Or whether there be nothing in it, but only this Article, <hi>That
Christ is our Saviour?</hi> Is it not manifest to all the world, that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7615:126"/>
of all Professions doe agree with one consent, in the belief of all
those Bookes of Scripture, which were not doubted of in the ancient
Church, without danger of damnation? Nay is it not apparent, that
no man at this time, can without hypocrisy, pretend to believe in
Christ, but of necessity he must doe so? Seeing he can have no reason
to believe in Christ, but he must have the same to believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I pray then read over the Scripture once more, or if that be too
much labour, the New Testament only: and then say whether there
be nothing there, but <hi>scarcely one point of Faith? But some one or two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of beleif? Nothing but this Article onely, that Christ is our Saviour?</hi>
Say whether there be not there an infinite number of Divine Verities,
Divine precepts, Divine promises, and those so plainly and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
delivered, that if any sees them not, it cannot be because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
but because he will not! So plainly, that whosoever submits syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
to the doctrine of Christ, in mind and will, cannot possibly but
submit to these in act and performance. And in the rest, which it hath
pleased God, for reasons best known to himselfe, to deliver obscurely
or ambiguously, yet thus farre at least they agree, that the sense of
them intended by God, is certainly true, and that they are without
passion or prejudice to endeavour to find it out: The difference only
is, which is that true sense which God intended. Neither would this
long continue, if the walls of separation, whereby the Divell hopes to
make their Divisions eternall, were pulled down; and errour were not
supported against Truth, by humane advantages. But for the present,
God forbid the matter should be so ill as you make it! For whereas
you looking upon their points of difference and agreement, through I
know not what strange glasses, have made the first innumerable, and
the other scarce a number: the truth is clean contrary; That those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Verities, Speculative and Practicall, wherein they universally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
(which you will have to be but a few, or but one, or scarcely one)
amount to <hi>many millions,</hi> (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> an exact account were taken of them:) And
on the other side, the Ponts in variance, are in comparison but few,
and those not of such a quality, but the Error in them may well consist
with the belief &amp; obedience of the entire Covenant, ratified by Christ
between God and man. Yet I would not be so mistaken, as if I thought
the errours even of some Protestants unconsiderable things, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of no moment. For the truth is, I am very fearfull, that some of
their opinions, either as they are, or as they are apt to be mistaken,
(though not of themselves so damnable, but that good and holy men
may be saved with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet) are too frequent occasions of our remisnes,
and slacknesse, in running the race of Christian Profession, of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Repentance, and conversion to God, of our frequent relapses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sinne, &amp; not seldome of security in sinning; &amp; consequently, though
not certain causes, yet too frequent occasions of many mens damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and such I conceive all these doctrines, which either directly or
obliquely, put men in hope of eternall happinesse, by any other means
saving only the narrow way <hi>of sincere and universall obedience,</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon a true and lively faith. These Errours therefore, I doe not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7615:126"/>
elevate or extenuate: and on condition the ruptures made by them
might be composed, doe heartily wish, that the cement were made
of my deerest blood, and only not to be an Anathema from Christ!
Only this I say, that neither are their points of agreement so few, nor
their differences so many, as you make them; nor so great as to exclude
the opposite Parties from being members of one Church Militant, &amp;
joynt heires of the glory of the Church Triumphant.</p>
               <p>50 Your other palpable untruth is, that <hi>Protestants are farre more
bold to disagree even in matters of faith, then Catholique Divines</hi> (you
mean your own,) <hi>in Questions meerely Philosophicall, or not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Church.</hi> For neither doe they differ at all, in <hi>matters of faith,</hi>
if you take the word in the highest sense, and mean by matters of faith,
such doctrines as are <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to Salvation, to be believed
or not to be disbelieved. And then in those wherein they doe differ,
with what colour or shadow of Argument, can you make good, that
<hi>they are more bold to disagree, then you are in Questions meerely Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall,
or not determined by the Church?</hi> For is there not as great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
between your assent and dissent, your affirmation and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
your <hi>Est Est, Non Non,</hi> as there is between theirs? You fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
your Reason, in those things wich are not determined by your
Church; and they theirs, in things not plainly determined in Scripture.
And wherein then consists their greater, <hi>their farre greater boldnesse?</hi>
And what if they in their contradictory opinions, pretend both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the truth of God, doth this make their contradictions ever a
whit the more repugnant? I had alwaies thought, that all contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
had been equally contradictions, and equally repugnant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the least of them are as farre asunder, as <hi>Est</hi> and <hi>Non Est</hi> can
make them, and the greatest are no farther. But then you in your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
(by name, about Predetermination, the Immaculate Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Popes Infallibility,) upon what other motive doe you rely?
Doe not you cite Scripture, or Tradition, or both, on both sides? And
doe you not pretend, that both these are the infallible Truths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God?</p>
               <p>51 You close up this Section with a fallacy, proving forsooth,
that <hi>we destroy, by our confession, the Church which is the house of God,
because we stand only upon Fundamentall Articles, which cannot make up
the whole fabrick of the faith, no more then the foundation of a house alone
can be a house.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>52 But I hope, Sir, you will not be difficult in granting, that that
is a house which hath all the necessary parts belonging to a house:
Now by Fundamentall Articles, we mean all those which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And you your selfe, in the very leafe after this, take notice that
<hi>D. Potter</hi> does so. Where to this Question: How shall I know in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
which points be, and which be not Fundamentall? You scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilously
bring him in making this ridiculous answer, <hi>Read my Answer
to a late Pamphlet intituled Charity Mistaken &amp;c. There you shall find
that Fundamentall doctrines are such Catholique Verities, as principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and essentially pertain to the faith, such as properly constitute a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7615:127"/>
Church, and are necessary (in ordinary course) to be distinctly believed by
every Christian that will be saved.</hi> All which wordes he us'd, not to
tell you what points be fundamentall, as you dishonestly impose upon
him, but to explain what he meant by the word Fundamentall. May
it please you therefore now at last, to take notice, that by <hi>Fundamentall</hi>
we mean <hi>all and only that which is necessary;</hi> and then I hope you will
grant, that we may safely expect salvation in a Church which hath
all things fundamentall to Salvation! Vnlesse you will say, that more
is necessary, then that which is necessary.</p>
               <p>53 This long discourse, so full of un-ingenious dealing with your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
perhaps would have done reasonably in a Faire or a Comedy,
&amp; I doubt not but you have made your selfe &amp; your courteous Readers
good sport with it. But if <hi>D. Potter</hi> or I, had been by when you wrote
it, we should have stopt your carere at the first starting, &amp; have put you
in mind of these old Schoole Proverbs, <hi>Exfalso supposito sequitur quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet,</hi>
and <hi>Vno absurdo dato, seq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>untur mille.</hi> For whereas you suppose,
first, that to a man desirous to save his soul, and requiring, whose dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he might rely upon? the Doctors answer would be, <hi>Vpon the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Catholique Church:</hi> I suppose upon better reason, because I know
his mind, that he would advise him to call <hi>no man Master on Earth,</hi>
but according to Christs command, to rely upon the direction of
God himselfe. If he should enquire where he should find this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
He would answer him; In his word contained in Scripture. If he
should enquire what assurance he might have, that the Scripture is the
word of God? He would answer him, that the doctrine it selfe is very
fit and worthy to be thought to come from God, <hi>nec vox hominem
sonat,</hi> and that they which wrote and delivered it, confirmed it to be
the word of God, by doing such works as could not be done, but by
power from God himselfe. For assurance of the Truth hereof, he
would advise him to rely upon that, which all wise men, in all matters
of belief rely upon; and that is, the Consent of Ancient Records, and
Vniversall Tradition. And that he might not instruct him as partiall
in this advise, he might farther tell him, that a gentleman that would
be namelesse, that has written a book against him, called <hi>Charity main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Catholiques,</hi> though in many things he differ from him, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with him in this, that <hi>Tradition is such a principle as may be rested
in, and which requires no other proof.</hi> As indeed no wise man doubts
but there was such a man as <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> that there are such
Citties as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> though he have no other assurance
for the one or the other, but only the <hi>speech</hi> of people. This tradition
therefore he would counsell him to rely upon, and to believe that the
book which we call Scripture, was confirmed abundantly by the
workes of God, to be the word of God. Believing it the word of God,
he must of necessity believe it true: and if he believe it true, he must
believe it containes all necessary directions unto eternall happinesse,
because it affirmes it selfe to doe so. Nay he might tell him, that so
farre is the whole book, from wanting any necessary direction to his
eternall Salvation, that one only Author, that hath writ but two little
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7615:127"/>
bookes of it, S. <hi>Luke</hi> by name in the begining of his <hi>Gospell,</hi> and in the
begining of his <hi>Story,</hi> shewes plainly that he alone hath written at least
so much as is necessary. And what they wrote, they wrote by Gods
direction, for the direction of the world, not only for the Learned,
but for all that would doe their true endeavour to know the will of
God, and to doe it; therefore you cannot but conceive, that writing
to all and for all, they wrote so as that in things necessary they might
be understood by all. Besides that, here he should finde, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
has engaged himselfe by promise, that if he would loue him, and
keep his Commandements, and pray earnestly for his spirit, and bee
willing to be directed by it, he should undoubtedly receiue it, even the
<hi>Spirit of Truth which shall lead him into all truth;</hi> that is certainly, into
all necessary Truths, and suffer him to fall into no pernicious errour.
The summe of his whole direction to him briefly would be this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripture to be the word of God, use your true endeavour to
finde the true sense of it, and to liue according to it, and then you may
rest securely that you are in the true way to eternall happinesse. This
is the substance of that Answer which the Doctor would make to any
man in this case; and this is a way so plain, that fooles, unlesse they will,
cannot erre from it. Because not knowing absolutely all truth, nay not
all profitable truth, and not being free from errour; but endeavoring to
know the truth and obey it, and endeavouring to be free from errour,
is by this way made the onely condition of salvation. As for your
supposition, That he would advise such a man to rely upon the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church for the finding out the doctrine of Christ, hee utterly
disclaimes it, and truly very justly: There being no certaine way to
know that any company is a true Church, but only by their professing
the true doctrine of Christ. And therefore as it is impossible I should
know such a company of Philosophers are Peripateticks, or Stoicks,
unlesse I first know what was the doctrine of the Peripateticks, and
Stoicks; so is it impossible that I should certainly know any company
to be the Church of Christ, before I know what is the doctrine of
Christ, the Profession whereof constitutes the visible Church, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
and Obedience the invisible. And therefore whereas you would
have him be directed by the Catholique Church to the doctrine of
Christ; the contrary rather is most certaine and necessary, that by the
foreknowledge of the doctrine of Christ, he must be directed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
assurance, which is, if he meane not to choose at a venture, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to have certaine direction to it. This supposition therefore, being
the hinge whereon your whole discourse turnes, is the <hi>Minerva</hi> of your
owne Brayne; and therefore were it but for this, have we not great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to accuse you of strange immodesty, in saying as you doe, That
<hi>The whole discourse &amp; inferences which here you have made, are either D.
Potters own direct assertions, or evident consequences cleerely deduced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them?</hi> Especially seeing your proceeding in it is so consonant to this
ill beginning, that it is in a manner wholly made up, not of <hi>D. Potters</hi>
assertions, but your owne fictions obtruded on him.</p>
               <p>54 <hi>Ad</hi> § 19. To the next Question, <hi>Cannot Generall Councels erre?</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:7615:128"/>
You pretend he answers § 19. <hi>They may erre damnably.</hi> Let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
see the place, and he shall finde, <hi>damnably</hi> is your addition. To
the third demand, <hi>Must I consult</hi> (about my difficulties) <hi>with every
particular person of the Catholique Church?</hi> You answer for him, (that
which is most false) that <hi>it seemes so by his words; The whole militant
Church, that is, all the members of it cannot possibly erre either in the
whole faith, or any necessary Article of it.</hi> Which is very certaine, for
should it doe so, it should be the Church no longer. But what sense is
there that you should collect out of these words, that every member
of the militant Church must be consulted with? By like reason, if he
had said that all men in the world cannot erre; If he had said that God
in his own person, or his Angels, could not erre in these matters, you
might haue gathered from hence, that he laid a necessity upon men in
doubt, to consult with Angels, or with God in his own person, or with
all men in the world. Is it not evident to all sober men, that to make
any man or men fit to be consulted with, besides the understanding of
the matter, it is absolutely requisite that they may bee spoken with?
And is it not apparently impossible, that any man should speak with
all the members of the Militant Church?. Or if hee had spoken with
them all, know that he had done so? Nay does not D. <hi>Potter</hi> say as
much in plain termes? Nay more, doe not you take notice that hee
does so in the very next words before these, where you say, <hi>he affirmes
that the Catholique Church cannot be told of private injuries:</hi> unlesse
you will perswade us there is a difference between the Catholique
Church, and the whole Militant Church. For whereas you make him
deny this of the Catholique Church united, and affirm it of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Church dispersed into particulars; The truth is, he speaks neither
of united nor dispersed, but affirmes simply (as appeares to your
shame by your own quotations) that <hi>the Catholique Church cannot bee
told of private iniuries:</hi> and then, that the <hi>whole Militant Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
erre.</hi> But then besides, that the united Church cannot be consulted,
and the dispersed may, what a wild imagination is it? and what a
strange injustice was it in you to father it upon him? I beseech you
Sir, to consider seriously how far blinde zeal to your superstition hath
transported you beyond all bounds of honesty and discretion, &amp; made
you carelesse of speaking either truth or sense, so you speak against <hi>D.
Potter!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>55 Again, you make him say, <hi>The Prelates of Gods Church meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a lawfull Councell may erre damnably:</hi> and from this collect, <hi>It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
then for your necessary instruction you must repaire to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
member of the Vniversall Church, spread over the face of the
earth.</hi> And this is also <hi>Pergulapictoris, veri nihil, omnia ficta.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
false, (not for the matter of it, but) that <hi>D. Potter</hi> saies it; And
the consequence as far from it, as Gades from Gange; and as coherent
as a rope of sand. A generall Councell may erre; therefore you must
travell all the world over, and consult with every particular Christian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
As if there were nothing else to be consulted with: nay, as if according
to the doctrine of Protestants, (for so you must say,) there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7615:128"/>
to be consulted with, but only a Generall Councell, or all the
world! Haue you never heard that Protestants say, That men for their
direction must consult with Scripture? Nay, doth not D. <hi>Potter</hi> say it
often in this very Book which you are confuting? Nay more, in this
very page out of which you take this peece of your <hi>Cento, A Generall
Councell may erre damnably?</hi> are there not these plain words, <hi>In sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Truth, the Scripture?</hi> With what conscience then or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
can you impose upon him this unreasonable consequence, &amp; yet
pretend that your whole discourse, is either his own direct assertion,
or evident consequences, cleerely deduc'd from them? You adde,
that yet he teaches (as if he contradicted himselfe) <hi>that the promises of
God made to the Church for his assistance, are not intended to particular
persons, but only to the Catholique Church:</hi> which sure agrees very well
with any thing said by D. <hi>Potter.</hi> If it be repugnant to what you said
for him falsely, what is that to him?</p>
               <p>56 Neither yet is this <hi>to drive any man to desperation:</hi> unlesse it be
such a one, as hath such a strong affection to this word, <hi>Church,</hi> that he
will not goe to heaven, <hi>unlesse he hath a Church to lead him thither.</hi> For
what though a Councell may erre, and the whole Church cannot be
consulted with, yet this is not to send you on the Fooles <hi>Pilgrimage
for faith,</hi> and bid you goe and <hi>conferre with every Christian soul, man
and woman, by Sea and by Land, close prisoner, or at liberty,</hi> as you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the matter: But to tell you very briefly, that Vniversall Tradition
directs you to the word of God, and the word of God directs you to
Heaven. And therefore here is no cause of desperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no cause for you
to be so vain, and tragicall, as here you would seeeme. <hi>Yet upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall</hi>
(you say) <hi>of this miraculous pilgrimage for faith, before I have the
faith of Miracles, how shall I proceed at our meeting? Or how shall I know
the man on whom I may securely rely?</hi> And hereunto, you frame this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
for the Doctor; <hi>Procure to know whether he believe all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
points of faith:</hi> Whereas in all the Doctors book, there is no
such answer to any such question, or any like it. Neither doe you as
your custome is, note any page where it may be found; which makes
mee suspect, that sure you have some priuate licence to use Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
(as you call them) at your pleasure, and make them answer any
thing to anything.</p>
               <p>57 Wherein I am yet more confirmed by the answer you put in
his mouth to your next demand, <hi>How shall I know whether he hold all
Fundamentall points or no?</hi> For whereas hereunto D. <hi>Potter</hi> hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
one Answer fully satisfactory to it, which is, <hi>If he truly believe the
undoubted bookes of Canonicall Script<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re, he cannot but believe all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls;</hi>
and another which is but somethings towards a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of it, That <hi>the Creed containes all the fundamentalls of simple Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</hi>
you take no notice of the former, and pervert the latter, and make
him say, <hi>The Creed containes all fundamentalls of faith.</hi> Whereas you
know, and within sixe or seven lines after this confesse, that he never
pretended it to contain <hi>all simply,</hi> but <hi>all of one sort,</hi> all <hi>necessary
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7615:129"/>
points of simple belief.</hi> Which assertion because he modestly delivers
as very probable (being willing to conclude rather lesse then more
then his reasons require,) hereupon you take occasion to aske: <hi>Shall I
hazard my soul on probabilities, or even wagers!</hi> As if whatsoever is
but probable, though in the highest degree of probability, were as
likely to be false as true! Or because it is but Morally, not Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
certain that there was such a Woman as Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> such a
man as H. the 8. that is in the highest degree probable, therefore it
were an even wager there were none such! By this reason, seeing the
truth of your whole Religion depends finally upon <hi>Prudentiall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
which you doe but pretend to be very credible, it will be <hi>an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
wager that your Religion is false.</hi> And by the same reason, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infinitely greater, seeing it is impossible for any man (according
to the grounds of your Religion) to know himselfe, much lesse ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be a true Pope, or a true Priest; nay to have a Morall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, because these things are obnoxious to innumerable secret and
undiscernable nullities, it will be an even wager, nay (if we proportion
things indifferently,) a hundred to one, that every Consecration and
Absolution of yours is void, &amp; that whensoever you adore the Host,
you and your Assistants commit Idolatry: That there is a nullity in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Decree that a Pope shall make, or any Decree of a Councell which
he shall confirme: Particularly it will be at least an even wager, that all
the Decrees of the Councell of Trent are void, because it is at most
but very probable that the Pope which confirmed them was true
Pope. If you mistake these inferences, then confesse you have injur'd
<hi>D. Potter</hi> in this also, that you have confounded and made all one, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities,
and even wagers. Whereas every ordinary Gamester can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
you, that though it be a thousand to one that such a thing will
happen, yet it is not sure, but very probable.</p>
               <p>58 To make the measure of your injustice yet fuller, you demand,
<hi>If the Creed containes only points of simple belief, how shall you know
what points of belief are necessary which direct our practise? D. Potter</hi>
would have answered you in our Saviours words, <hi>search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
But you have a great minde it seemes to be a despairing, and
therefore having propos'd your Question, will not suffer him to give
you Answer, but shut your eares and tell him, <hi>still he chalkes out new
paths for desperation.</hi>

               <p>59 In the rest of your interlude, I cannot but commend one thing
in you, that you keep a <hi>decorum,</hi> and observe very well the Rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you by the great Master of your Art,
<q>
                     <l>—Servetur adimum</l>
                     <l>Qualis ab incepto processerat &amp; sibi constet:</l>
                  </q>
One vein of
scurrility and dishonesty runs clean through it, from the begining to
the end. Your next demand then is, <hi>Are all the Articles of the Creed for
their nature and matter Fundamentall?</hi> and the Answer, <hi>I cannot say so.</hi>
Which Answer (though it be true) <hi>D. Potter</hi> no where gives it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath he occasion, but you make it for him, to bring in another
question; and that is, <hi>How then shall I know, which in particular be, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7615:129"/>
which be not Fundamentall? D. Potter</hi> would have answered, It is a
vain question: believe all, and you shall be sure to believe all that is
Fundamentall.</p>
               <p>60 <hi>But what saies now his prevaricating Proxy? What does he
make him say? This which followes:</hi> Read my answer to a late Popish
Pamphlet, intituled Charity Mistaken: There you shall finde, that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
doctrines, are such Catholique verities, as principally and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially
pertain to the faith, such as properly constitute a Church, and
are necessary in ordinary course, to be distinctly believed by every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
that will be saved. They are those Grand and Capitall Doctrines which
make up our Faith, that is, the common faith, which is alike pretious in
all; being one and the same, in the highest Apostle, and the meanest belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which the Apostle elsewhere calls the first Principles of the Oracles
of God, and the forme of sound words.</p>
               <p>61 But in earnest, Good Sir, doth the Doctor in these places by
you quoted, make to this question this same sottish answer? Or doe
you think that against an Heretique nothing is unlawfull? Certainly if
he doth answer thus, I will make bold to say he is a very foole. But if
he does not, (as indeed he does not) then:—But I forbeare you, and
beseech the Reader to consult the places of D. <hi>Potters</hi> book; and there
he shall find, that in the former halfe of these (as you call them) varied
words and phrases, he declared only what he meant by the word
<hi>Fundamentall,</hi> which was needfull to prevent mistakes, and cavilling
about the meaning of the word, which is metaphoricall, and therefore
ambiguous; and that the latter halfe of them, are severall places of
Scripture imployed by <hi>D. Potter,</hi> to shew that his distinction of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
and not Fundamentall hath expresse ground in it. Nay of
these two places, very pertinent unto two very good purposes, you
have exceeding fairely patcht together a most ridiculous answer,
to a question that <hi>D. Potter</hi> never dream't of. <hi>But the words,</hi> you
will say, <hi>are in D. Potters Book, though in divers places, and to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</hi>
Very true: And so the words of <hi>Ausonius</hi> his obscene <hi>Fescenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
are taken out of <hi>Virgil,</hi> yet <hi>Virgil</hi> surely was not the Author of
this Poem. Besides, in <hi>D. Potters</hi> book, there are these words, <hi>Dread
Soveraigne, amongst the many excellent vertues which have made your
Majesties person so deare unto God, &amp;c.</hi> And why now may you not
say as well, that in these he made Answer to your former question,
what points of the Creed were, and what were not Fundamentalls?</p>
               <p>62 But <hi>unlesse this question may be answered, his doctrine you say
serves only, either to make men despaire, or else to have recourse to these
whom we call Papists.</hi> It seemes a little thing will make you despaire, if
you be so sullen as to doe so, because men will not trouble themselves
to satisfy your curious questions. And I pray be not offended with
me for so esteeming it, because as before I told you, if you will believe
all the points of the Creed, you cannot choose but believe all the
points of it that are fundamentall, though you be ignorant which are
so, and which are not so. Now I believe your desire to know which
are Fundamentalls, proceeds only from a desire to be assur'd that you
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7615:130"/>
doe believe them; which seeing you may be assured of, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which they be, what can it be but curiosity to desire to know it?
Neither may you think to mend your selfe herein one whit by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recourse to them whom we call Papists; for they are as farre to
seek as wee in this point, which of the Articles of the Creed are, for
their nature and matter, fundamentall, and which are not. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
you will scarce meet with any amongst their Doctors, so adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous,
as to tell you for a certain, whether or no the conception of
Christ by the Holy Ghost, his being born of a Virgin, his Buriall,
his descent into Hell, and the Communion of Saints, be points of their
own nature and matter fundamentall. Such I mean, as without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and explicite knowledge of them no man can be saved.</p>
               <p>63 But you will say, <hi>at least they give this certain rule, that all
points defined by Christs visible Church, belong to the foundation of
faith, in such sense, as to deny any such, cannot stand with Salvation.</hi> So
also Protestants give you this more certain rule, That whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
heartily those books of Scripture, which all the Christian
Churches in the world acknowledge to be Canonicall, and submits
himselfe indeed to this, as to the rule of his belief, must of necessity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all things fundamentall, and if he live according to his faith, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail of Salvation. But besides, what certainty have you, that that
rule of Papists is so certain? By the visible Church it is plain, they
mean only their own: and why their own only should be the Visible
Church, I doe not understand: and as little, why all points defined
by this Church should belong to the foundation of faith. These things
you had need see well and substantially proved, before you rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, otherwise you expose your selfe to danger of imbracing
damnable errors instead of Fundamentall truth's. But you will say D.
<hi>Potter himselfe acknowledges, that we doe not erre in Fundamentalls.</hi> If
he did so, yet me thinkes you have no reason to rest upon his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
with any security, whom you condemne of errour in many
other matters. Perhaps excesse of Charity to your persons, may
make him censure your errors more favourably then he should doe.
But the truth is, and so I have often told you, though the Doctor hope
that your errors are not so unpardonably destructive, but that some
men, who ignorantly hold them may be saved, yet <hi>in themselves,</hi> he
professes and proclaimes them <hi>damnable,</hi> and such as he feares, will be
certainly destructive to such as you are, that is, to all those, <hi>who have
eyes to see and will not see them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>64 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 20. 21. 22. 23. In the Remainder of this Chapter, you
promise to answer D. <hi>Potters</hi> Arguments, against that which you said
before. But presently forgetting your selfe, in stead of answering his
Arguments, you fall a confuting his Answers to your own. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
objected by you which here you vindicate, were two. 1. <hi>The
Scripture is not so much as mentioned in the Creed, therefore the Creed
containes not all things necessary to be believed. 2. Baptisme is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Creed, therefore not all things necessary.</hi> To both which
Arguments my Answer shortly is this, that they prove something, but
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7615:130"/>
it is that which no man here denies. For D. <hi>Potter</hi> (as you have also
confessed) never said, not undertook to shew, that the Apostles inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to comprize in the Creed, all points absolutely, which we are
bound to believe, or after sufficient proposall, not to disbelieve; which
yet here and every where you are obtruding upon him: But only that
they purposed to comprize in it, all such doctrines purely speculative,
all such matters of simple belief, as are in ordinary course, necessary
to be distinctly and explicitly believed by all men. Neither of these
objections doe any way infringe or impeach the truth of this Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Not the first, because according to your own doctrine, all men
are not bound to know explicitely what books of Scripture are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.
Nor the second, because Baptisme is not a matter of Faith, but
practise: not so much to be believed, as to be given, and received. And
against these Answers, whether you have brought any considerable
new matter, let the indifferent Reader judge. As for the other things,
which D. <hi>Potter</hi> rather glanceth at, then buil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s upon, in answering
these objections, as the Creed's being collected out of Scripture, and
supposing the Authority of it, which <hi>Gregory of Valentia</hi> in the place
above cited, seemes to me to confesse, to have been the Iudgement of
the Ancient Fathers: and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed's intimating the authority of
Canonicall Scripture, and making mention of Baptisme: These things
were said <hi>ex abundanti;</hi> and therefore I conceive it superfluous to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
your exceptions against them. Prove that D. <hi>Potter</hi> did affirme
that the Creed containes all things necessary to be believed of all
sorts, and then these objections will be pertinent, and deserve an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
Or produce some point of simple belief, necessary to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
believed, which is not contained either in termes, or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in the Creed, and then I will either answer your Reasons, or
confesse I cannot. But all this while you doe but trifle, and are so farre
from hitting the marke, that you rove quite beside the But.</p>
               <p>65 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 23. 24. 25. <hi>D. Potter</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emands, <hi>How it can be necessary
for any Christian to have more in his Creed then the Apostles had, and the
Church of their times?</hi> You Answer <hi>That he trifles, not distinguishing
between the Apostles belief, and that abridgement of some Articles of
faith, which we call the Apostles Creed.</hi> I reply, that it is you which
trifle, affectedly confounding (what D. <hi>Potter</hi> hath plainly distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed)
the Apostles belief of the whole Religion of Christ, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
both what we are to doe, and what we are to believe, with
their belief of that part of it, which containes not duties of obedience,
but only the necessary Articles of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ple <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith. Now though the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Beleife be, in the former sense, a larger thing then that which
we call the Apostles Creed: yet in the latter sense of the word, the
Creed (I say) is a full comprehension of their belief, which you your
selfe have formerly confessed, though somewhat fearfully, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly:
and here again unwillingnesse to speak the truth, makes you
speak that which is hardly sense, and call it <hi>an abridgement of some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith.</hi> For I demand, these <hi>some Articles</hi> which you speak
of, which are they? Those that are out of the Creed, or those that are
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7615:131"/>
in it? Those that are in it, it comprehends at large, and therefore it is
not an abridgement of them: Those that are out of it, it comprehends
not at all, and therefore it is not an abridgement of them. If you
would call it now an abridgement of the Faith, this would be sense,
and signify thus much, That all the necessary Articles of the Christian
faith are compriz'd in it. For this is the proper duty of abridgements,
to leave out nothing necessary, and to take in nothing unnecessary.</p>
               <p>66 Moreover, in answer to this demand you tell us, that <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
beggs the Question, supposing that the Apostles believed no more then
is contained in their Creed.</hi> I Answer, He supposes no such matter; but
only that they knew no more necessary Articles of simple belief, then
what are contained in their Creed. So that here you abuse D. <hi>Potter</hi>
and your Reader, by taking sophistically without limitation, that
which is delivered with limitation.</p>
               <p>67 <hi>But this demand of</hi> D. Potters, <hi>was equivalent to a Negation,
and intended for one:</hi> How can it be necessary for any Christian, to have
more in his Creed, then the Apostles had? <hi>All one with this,</hi> It cannot
be necessary &amp;c. <hi>And this negation of his, he inforces with many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which he proposes by way of interrogation, thus.</hi> May the
Church of after Ages make the narrow way to heaven, narrower then our
Saviour left it? Shall it bee a fault to straiten and encumber the Kings
high way with publique nuisances; and is it lawfull by adding new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to the faith, to retrench any thing from the Latitude of the King of
Heavens high way to eternall happinesse? The yoake of Christ, which he
said was easy, may it be justly made heavier by the Governors of the
Church in after Ages? The Apostles professe they revealed to the Church
the whole Counsell of God, keeping back nothing needfull for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What tyranny then to impose any new unnecessary matters on the
faith of Christians, especially (as the late Popes have done) under the
high commanding forme, <hi>Qui non crediderit, damnabitur?</hi> If this may
be done, why then did our Savlour reprehend the Pharises so sharpely, for
binding heavy burdens, and laying them on mens shoulders? And why
did he teach them, that in vain they worshipped God, teaching for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
mens Traditions? And why did the Apostles call it tempting of
God, to lay those things upon the necks of Christians, that were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary?</p>
               <p>68 All which interrogations seeme to me to containe so many
plain and convincing Arguments of the premised Assertion; to all
which (one excepted,) according to the advise of the best Masters of
Rhetorique in such Cases, you have answered very discreetly; by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
O. But when you write againe, I pray take notice of them: and if
you can devise no faire, and satisfying answer to them, then be so inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
as to grant the Conclusion, That no more can be necessary for
Christians to beleeve now, then was in the Apostles time. A conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of great importance, for the decision of many Controversies, &amp; the
disburdening of the faith of Christ from many incumbrances.</p>
               <p>69 As for that one, which you thought you could fasten upon,
grounded on the 20. Act. 27. let me tell you plainly, that by your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7615:131"/>
this, you have shewed plainly that it was wisely done of you
to decline the rest. You tell D. <hi>Potter,</hi> That <hi>needfull for salvation</hi> is
his glosse, which perhaps you intended for a peice of an Answer. But
good Sir, consult the place, and you shall find, that there S. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
saies that he kept back <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>not any thing that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable:</hi>
and I hope you will make no difficulty to grant, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is needfull for salvation, is very profitable.</p>
               <p>70 But then you say, <hi>This is no proofe unlesse he beg the Question,
and suppose, that whatsoever the Apostles revealed to the Church is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Creed.</hi> I Answer, it is not D. <hi>Potter</hi> that beggs the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but you that mistake it: which is not here in this particular place,
Whether all points of simple Beleife necessary for the salvation of the
Primitive Christians, were contained in the Apostles Symbole? (for
that and the proofes, of it follow after, in the next, §. p. 223. of D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Booke:) but, whether any thing can be necessary for Christians to
beleeve now, which was not so from the beginning? D. <hi>Potter</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the negative; and to make good his opinion, thus he argues,
S. <hi>Paul</hi> declared to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> the whole Counsell of God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Salvation; Therefore that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not declare,
can be no part of the Counsell of God, and therefore not necessary.
And againe: S. <hi>Paul</hi> kept back nothing from the <hi>Ephesians</hi> that was
profitable; Therefore he taught them all things necessary to salvation.
Consider this I pray a little better, and then I hope you will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that here was no <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> in D. <hi>Potter,</hi> but rather <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
Elenchi,</hi> in you.</p>
               <p>71 Neither is it materiall, that these words were particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Pastours of the Church: For (to say nothing
that the point here issuable, is not, Whom he taught, whether Priests or
Laymen? But how much he taught, and whether all things necessary?)
it appeares plainly out of the Text, and I wonder you should read it
so negligently as not to observe it, that though he speaks now to the
Pastors, yet he speaks of what he taught not only them, but also the
Laity as well as them. <hi>I have kept back nothing</hi> (saies S. <hi>Paul) that was
profitable, but have shewed, and have taught you publikely, and from house
to house; Testifying</hi> (I pray observe) <hi>both to the Iewes, and also to the
Greeks, Repentance towards God, &amp; Faith towards our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
And a little after, <hi>I know that yee all, among whom I have gone Preaching
the Kingdome of God, shall see my face no more. Wherefore I take you to
record this day, that I am innocent from the blood of all men; for I have
kept nothing back, but have shewed you all the Counsell of God.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<hi>Remember that by the space of three yeares I ceased not to warne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one night and day with teares.</hi> Certainly though he did all these
things to the Pastours among the rest, nay above the rest, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
controversie, they whom he taught publikely, and from house to
house: The <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> to whom he testified, (1.) preach'd Faith
and Repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Those all, amongst whom he went preaching the
kingdome of Cod: Those, Every one, whom for three yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he warned, were not Bishops and Pastors only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:7615:132"/>72 Neither is this to say, that the Apostles taught Christians no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their Creed, nothing of the Sacraments, Comandements, &amp;c.
for that is not here the point to be proved: but only, that they taught
them all things necessary, so that nothing can be necessary which they
did not teach them. But how much of this they put into their Creed,
whether <hi>all the necessary points of simple beleife,</hi> as we pretend, or only
as you say, <hi>I know not what,</hi> is another Question, and which comes
now to be farther examined. D. <hi>Potter,</hi> in confirmation of it, besides
the authorities which you formerly shifted of, with so egregious ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversation,
urges fiue severall Arguments.</p>
               <p>73 The sense of the first is this, <hi>If all the necessary points of simple
beliefe be not compriz'd in the Creed, it can no way deserue the name of the
Apostles Creed, as not being their Creed in any sense, but onely a part of it.</hi>
To this you answer § 2 5. <hi>Vpon the same affected ambignity, &amp;c.</hi> Answ.
It is very true that their whole faith was of a larger extent, but that
was not the Question: But whether all the points of simple beliefe
which they taught as necessary to be explicitely believed, be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it? And if thus much at least of Christian Religion bee not
comprized in it, I again desire you to inform me how it could be call'd
the Apostles Creed!</p>
               <p>74 Foure other Reasons D. <hi>Potter</hi> urges to the same purpose,
grounded upon the practise of the Ancient Church; The last whereof
you answer in the second part of your Book. But to the rest, drawne
from the ancient Churches appointing her Infants to be instructed (for
matters of simple beliefe,) only in the Creed: From her admitting Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens
unto Baptisme: and of Strangers to her Communion upon
their only profession of the Creed, you haue not, for ought I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
thought fit to make any kind of answer.</p>
               <p>75 The difficulties of the 27. and last § of this Chapter, haue been
satisfied. So that there remaines unexamined onely the 26. <hi>Section,</hi>
wherein you exceed your selfe in sophistry: Especially in that trick of
Cavillers, which is to answer objections by other objections; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way to make controversies endlesse! D. <hi>Potter</hi> desires to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
<hi>Why amongst many things of equall necessity to be believed, the
Apostles should distinctly set down some in the Creed, and bee altogether
silent of others?</hi> In stead of resolving him in this difficulty, you put an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to him, and that is, <hi>Why are some points not Fundamentall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in it, rather then other of the same quality?</hi> Which demand is so
far from satisfying the former doubt, that it makes it more intricate.
For upon this ground it may be demanded, How was it possible that
the Apostles should leave out any Articles simply necessary, and put in
others not necessary, especially if their intention were (as you say it
was) to deliver in it such Articles as were fittest for those times? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
(which were wondrous strange) unnecessary Articles were fitter
for those times, then necessary. But now to your Question, the Answer
is obvious: These unnecessary things might be put in, because they
were circumstances of the necessary, <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> of Christs Passion,
The third day of the Resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; neither doth the adding of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7615:132"/>
the Creed ever a whit the lesse portable, the lesse fit to be understood,
and remembred. And for the contrary reasons, other unnecessary
things might bee left out. Besides, who sees not that the addition of
some unnecessary circumstances is a thing that can hardly be avoided
without affectation! And therefore not so great a fault, nor deserving
such a censure, as the omission of any thing essentiall to the work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
and necessary to the end proposed in it.</p>
               <p>76 You demand again (as it is no hard matter to multiply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,)
<hi>why our Saviours descent to Hell, and Buriall was expressed, and
not his circumcision, his manifestation to the three Kings, and working of
Miracles?</hi> I answer: His Resurrection, Ascension, and sitting at the
right hand of God, are very great Miracles, and they are expressed.
Besides, S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> assures us, <hi>That the Miracles which Christ did, were done
and written not for themselves that they might be believed,</hi> but for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, that <hi>we might believe that Iesus was the Christ, and believing
haue eternall life.</hi> He therefore that belieues this may be saved, though
he haue no explicite and distinct faith of any Miracle that our Saviour
did. His Circumcision &amp; Manifestation to the Wise men (for I know
not upon what grounds you call them <hi>Kings</hi>) are neither things sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
necessary to be known, nor haue any neer relation to those that are
so. As for his Descent into Hell, it may (for ought you know) be put in
as a thing necessary of it selfe to be known. If you ask why more then
his Circumcision, I refer you to the Apostles for an answer, who put
that in, and left this out of their Creed: and yet sure, were not so <hi>forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
after the receiving of the holy Ghost, as to leaue out any prime &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
foundation of the faith,</hi> which are the very words of your own
<hi>Gordonius Huntlaeus, Cont. 2. c. 10. num.</hi> 10. Likewise his Buriall was
put in perhaps as necessary of it selfe to be known. But though it were
not, yet hath it manifestly so neer relation to these that are necessary,
(his Passion &amp; Resurrection, being the Consequent of the one, and the
Antecedent of the other,) that it is no marvell if for their sakes it was
put in. For though I verily belieue that there is no necessary point of
this nature, but what is in the Creed, yet I doe not affirme, because I
cannot prove it, that there is nothing in the Creed but what is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
You demand thirdly, <hi>Why did they not expresse Scriptures, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and all Fundamentall points of faith tending to practise, as well as
those which rest in Beliefe?</hi> I answer; Because their purpose was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
in it only those necessary points which rest in beliefe: which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
because of practicall points there is not in it so much as one.</p>
               <p>77 D. <hi>Potter</hi> subjoynes to what is said aboue, <hi>That as well, nay
better they might have given no Article but that of the Church, and sent
us to the Church for all the rest: For in setting down others besides that,
and not all, they make us beleeve we have all, when we have not all.</hi> This
consequence you deny: and neither give reason against it, nor satisfie
his reason for it, which yet in my judgment is good and concluding.
The Proposition to be proved is this, That if your Doctrine were trve,
this short Creed, <hi>I beleeve the Roman Church to be infallible,</hi> would
have been better, that is, more effectuall to keep the beleevers of it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7615:133"/>
from Heresie, and in the true faith, then this Creed which now we have.
A proposition so evident, that I cannot see how either you, or any of
your Religion, or indeed any sensible man can from his heart deny it.
Yet because you make shew of doing so, or else, which I rather hope,
doe not rightly apprehend the force of the Reason, I will endeavour
briefly to adde some light and strength to it, by comparing the effects
of these severall supposed Creeds.</p>
               <p>78 The former Creed therefore would certainly produce these
effects in the beleevers of it: An impossibility of being in any formall
Heresie: A necessity of being prepared in mind to come out of all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rourin
faith, or materiall Heresie; which certainly you will not denie,
or if you doe, you pull downe the only pillar of your Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and denie that which is in effect the only thing you labour to
prove through your whole Book.</p>
               <p>79 The latter Creed which now we have, is so un-effectuall for
these good purposes, that you your self tell us of innumerable, grosse,
damnable Heresies, that have been, are, and may be, whose contrary
Truths are neither explicitly, nor by consequence comprehended in
this Creed: So that no man by the beleife of this Creed without the
former, can be possibly guarded from falling into them, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obstinate in them. Nay, so far is this Creed from guarding them
from these mischiefes, that it is more likely to ensnare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into them,
by seeming and yet not being a full comprehension of all necessary
points of faith: which is apt (as experience shewes,) to mis-guide men
into this pernitious errour, That believing the Creed, they believe all
necessary points of faith, whereas indeed they doe not so. Now upon
these grounds I thus conclude: That Creed which hath great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
and no danger, would certainly be better then that which hath
great danger, and wants many of these great commodities; But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
short Creed propos'd by me, <hi>I believe the Roman Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi>
(if your doctrine be true,) is of the former condition, and the
latter, that is, the Apostles Creed, is of the latter, Therefore the former
(if your doctrine be true) would without controversie be better then
the latter.</p>
               <p>80 But (say you) by this kind of arguing, one might inferre quite
contrary. <hi>If the Apostles Creed contain all points necessary to Salvation,
what need have wee of any Church to teach us? And consequently what
need of the Article of the Church?</hi> To which I answer: that having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
your inference and D. <hi>Potter</hi> together, I cannot discover any
shadow of resemblance between them, nor any shew of Reason, why
the perfection of the Apostles Creed, should exclude a necessity of
some body to deliver it. Much lesse why the whole Creed's contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things necessary should make the beliefe of a part of it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
As well (for ought I understand) you might avouch this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to be as good as D. <hi>Potters:</hi> The Apostles Creed contains all
things necessary, therefore there is no need to believe in God. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does it follow so well as D. <hi>Potters</hi> argument followes, That if the
Apostles Creed containes all things necessary, that all other Creeds
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7615:133"/>
and Catechismes, wherein are added divers other Particulars, are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.
For these other Particulars may be the duties of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
they may be profitable points of Doctrine, they may be good
expositions of the Apostles Creed, and so not superfluous, and yet for
all this the Creed may still contain all points of belief that are simply
necessary. These therefore are poor consequences, but no more like
<hi>D. Potters</hi> then an apple is like an oister.</p>
               <p>81 But this consequence after you have sufficiently slighted and
disgraced it, at length you promise <hi>us newes, and pretend to grant it.</hi>
But what is that which you mean to grant? That the Apostles did put
no Article in their Creed but only that of the Church? Or that, if they
had done so, they had done better then now they have done? This is
D. <hi>Potters</hi> inference out of your Doctrine; and truly if you should
grant this, this were newes indeed? Yes, say you <hi>I will grant it, but
only thus farre, that Christ hath referred us only to his Church.</hi> Yea, but
this is clean another thing, and no newes at all, that you should grant
that, which you would fain have granted to you. So that your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with us is just as if a man should profer me a curtesy, and pretend
that he would oblige himselfe by a note under his hand, to give me
twenty pound, and in stead of it write, that I owe him forty, and
desire me to subscribe to it and be thankfull. Of such favours as these
it is very safe to be liberall.</p>
               <p>82 You tell us afterward (but how it comes in I know not) that
<hi>it were a childish argument, The Creed containes not all things necessary;
Ergo, It is not Profitable!</hi> Or, <hi>the Church alone is sufficient to teach us
by some convenient meanes: Ergo, She must teach us without meanes.</hi>
These indeed are childish arguments, but for ought I see, you alone
are the father of them: for in D. <hi>Potters</hi> book, I can neither meet with
them, nor any like them. He indeed tels you, that if (by an impossible
supposition) your Doctrine were true, another and a farre shorter
Creed would have been more expedient: even this alone, <hi>I believe
the Roman Church to be infallible.</hi> But why you should conclude, he
makes this Creed unprofitable, because he saies another that might be
conceived upon this false supposition, would be more profitable:
or, that he laies a necessity upon the Church, of teaching without
meanes: or, of not teaching this very Creed which now is taught;
these things are so subtill that I cannot apprehend them. To my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
by those words, <hi>And sent us to the Church for all the rest,</hi>
he does rather manifestly imply, that the rest might be very well, not
only profitable but necessary, and that the Church was to teach this
by Creeds, or Catechismes, or Councells, or any other meanes which
she should make choice of, for being Infallible she could not choose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse.</p>
               <p>83 Whereas therefore you say, <hi>If the Apostles had exprest no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
but that of the Catholique Church, she must haue taught us the other
Articles in particular by Creeds, or other meanes:</hi> This is very true, but
no way repugnant to the truth of this which followes, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
(if your doctrine be true) had done better service to the Church;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7615:134"/>
though they had never made this Creed of theirs which now we haue,
if insteed thereof, they had commanded in plain termes that for mens
perpetuall direction in the faith, this short Creed should be taught all
men, <hi>I believe the Roman Church shall be for ever infallible.</hi> Yet you
must not so mistake me, as if I meant, that they had done better not to
haue taught the Church the substance of Christian Religion; For then
the Church not having learnt it of them, could not haue taught it us.
This therefore I doe not say: but supposing they had written these
Scriptures as they haue written, wherein all the Articles of their Creed
are plainly delivered, and preached that Doctrine which they did
preach, and done all otherthings as they have done, besides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
their Symbole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I say, if your doctrine were true, they had done
a work infinitely more beneficiall to the Church of Christ, if they had
never compos'd their Symbole, which is but an imperfect compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the necessary points of simple beliefe, and no distinctiue
mark (as a Symbole should be) between those that are good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and those that are not so; But insteed thereof, had delivered this
one Proposition, which would haue been certainly effectuall for all the
aforesaid good intents and purposes, <hi>The Roman Church shall be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
infallible in all things, which she proposes as matters of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>84 Whereas you say, <hi>If we will belieue we haue all in the Creed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we haue not all, it is not the Apostles fault but our own:</hi> I tell you plainly,
if it be a fault, I know not whose it should be but theirs. For sure it can
be no fault in me to follow such Guides whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oever they lead me;
Now I say, they haue led me into this perswasion, because they haue
given me great reason to belieue it, and none to the contrary. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they haue given me to belieue it, is, because it is apparent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
they did propose to themselues in composing it, some good end or
ends: As <hi>that Christians might haue a forme, by which</hi> (for matter of
faith) <hi>they might professe themselues Catholiques,</hi> So <hi>Putean</hi> out of <hi>Th.
Aquinas: That the faithfull might know, what the Christian people is to
believe explicitely,</hi> So <hi>Vincent Filiucius: That being separated into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts of the world, they might preach the same thing:</hi> And <hi>that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
might serve as a mark to distinguish true Christians from Infidels,</hi> So
Cardinall <hi>Richlieu.</hi> Now for all these and for any other good intent,
I say, it will be plainly uneffectuall, unlesse it contain at least all points
of simple beliefe, which are in ordinary course, necessary to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
known by all men. So that if it be fault in me to belieue this, it
must be my fault to belieue the Apostles, wise and good men: which I
cannot doe if I belieue not this. And therefore what <hi>Richardus de san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto
Victore</hi> sayes of God himselfe, I make no scruple at all to apply to
the Apostles, and to say, <hi>Si error est quod credo, à vobis deceptus sum:</hi> If
it be an errour which I belieue, it is you, and my reverend esteem of
you and your actions that hath led me into it. For as for your suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>That we are led into this perswasion, out of a hope that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
maintain by it some opinions of our own,</hi> It is plainly uncharitable. I
know no opinion I haue, which I would not as willingly forsake as
keep, if I could see sufficient reason to enduce me to believe, that it is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7615:134"/>
the will of God I should forsake it. Neither doe I know any opinion
I hold against the Church of Rome, but I haue more evident grounds
then this whereupon to build it. For let but these Truths bee granted:
That the authority of the Scripture is independent on your Church, &amp;
dependent only in respect of us upon universall Tradition; That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the only Rule of faith: That all things necessary to salvation are
plainly delivered in Scripture: Let I say these most certain and divine
Truths be laid for foundations, and let our superstructions bee conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and coherent to them; and I am confident Peace would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored,
and Truth maintained against you, though the Apostles Creed
were not in the world.</p>

               </p>
               <p>2. For better Methode, we will handle these points in order. First we will set downe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and essence, or as I may call it, the <hi>Quality</hi> of <hi>Schisme.</hi> In the second place, the greatnesse
and grievousnesse, or (so to tearme it) the <hi>Quantity</hi> thereof. For the Nature, or Quality will tell
us who may without injury be iudged Schismatiques: and by the greatnesse, or quantity, such as
finde themselves guilty thereof, will remaine acquainted with the true state of their soule, and
and whether they may conceive any hope of salvation or no. And because Schisme will be found
to be a division from the Church, which could not happen, unlesse there were alwaies a visible
Church; we will, Thirdly prove, or rather take it as a point to be granted by all Christians, that in
all ages there hath beene such a Visible Congregation of Faithfull People. Fourthly, we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
that <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and the rest, did separate themselves from <hi>the</hi> Communion of
that alwaies visible Church of Christ, and therefore were guilty of <hi>Schisme.</hi> And fifthly we will
make it evident, that the visible true Church of Christ, out of which <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers
departed, was no other but the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and consequently that both they, and all others
who persist in the same division, are Schismatiques by reason of their separation from the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 For the first point touching the <hi>Nature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Point.</note> or <hi>Quality</hi> of Schisme: As the naturall perfection
of man consists in his being the <hi>Image</hi> of God his Creator, by the powers of his soule; so his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
perfection is placed in <hi>fimilitude</hi> with God,<note place="margin">The nature of Schisme.</note> as his last End and Felicity; and by having
the said spirituall faculties, his <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> linked to him. His Vnderstanding is united
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7615:135"/>
to God by <hi>Faith;</hi> his Will, by <hi>Charity.</hi> The former relies upon his infallible <hi>Truth:</hi> The latter
carrieth us to his infinite <hi>Goodnesse. Faith</hi> hath a deadly opposite, <hi>Heresie.</hi> Contrary to the Vnion,
or Vnity of <hi>Charity,</hi> is Separation and <hi>Division.</hi> Charity is twofold. As it respects God, his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Vice is <hi>Hatred</hi> against God: as it uniteth us to our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> his contrary is <hi>Seperation</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of affections and will, from our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> Our Neighbour may be considered, either as
one private person hath a single relation to another, or as all concur to make one Company or
Congregation, which we call the Church; and this is the most principall reference and Vnion of
one man with another: because the chiefest Vnity is that of the <hi>Whole,</hi> to which the particular
Vnity of <hi>Parts</hi> is subordinate. This Vnity, or Onenesse (if so I may call it) is effected by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
uniting all the members of the Church in one <hi>Mysticall Body;</hi> contrary to which, <hi>is Schisme,</hi>
from the Greeke word signifying <hi>Scissure,</hi> or <hi>Division.</hi> Wherefore vpon the whole matter, wee
find that <hi>Schisme,</hi> as the Angellicall Doctor <hi>S. Thomas</hi> defines it, is; <hi>A voluntary separation</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">2. 2. q. 39. art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in corp. &amp; ad 3.</note> 
                  <hi>from the Vnity of that Charity, whereby all the members of the Church are united.</hi> From hence
he deduceth, that <hi>Schisme</hi> is a speciall and particular vice, distinct from <hi>Heresy,</hi> because they are
opposite to two different Vertues: Heresy, to Faith: Schisme, to Charity. To which purpose hee
fitly alleageth <hi>S. Hierome</hi> upon these words, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.) <hi>A man that is an Heretique after the first and
second admonition avoide,</hi> saying: <hi>I conceive that there is this difference betwixt Schisme and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
that Heresy involves some perverse assertion: Schisme for Episcopall dissention doth seperate
men from the Church.</hi> The same doctrine is delivered by S. <hi>Austine</hi> in these words: <hi>Heretiques</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 1. de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>id. &amp; Symb. cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and Schismatiques call their Congregations, Churches: but Heretiques corrupt the Faith by
believing of God false things: but Schismatiques by wicked divisions breake from fraternall Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
although they believe what we believe. Therefore the Heretique belongs not to the Church,
because she loves God: nor the Schismatique, because she loves her Neighbour.</hi> And in another
place he saith. <hi>It is wont to be demanded</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Quest. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangel. ex Mat. q. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>How Schismatiques be distinguished from Heretiques:
and this difference is found, that not a divers faith, but the divided Society of Communion doth
make Schismatiques.</hi> It is then evident that Schisme is different from Heresie. Neverthelesse (saith
<hi>S. Thomas</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> as he who is deprived of faith must needs want Charity: so every Heretique is a
Schismatique, but not conversively every Schismatique is an Heretique; though because want of
Charity disposes and makes way to the destruction of faith (according to those words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>Which</hi> (a good conscience) <hi>some casting off, have suffered shipwrack in their faith</hi>) Schisme
speedily degenerates to Heresy, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> after the rebearsed words teacheth, saying: <hi>Though
Schisme in the beginning may in some sort be understood different from Heresy; yet there is no
Schisme which doth not faigne some heresy to it selfe, that so it may seeme to have departed from
the Church upon good reason.</hi> Neverthelesse when Schisme proceeds originally from Heresy, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
as being in that case the predominant quality in these two peccant humours, giveth the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of an <hi>Heretique;</hi> as on the other side we are wont, especially in the beginning, or for a
while, to call <hi>Schismatiques,</hi> those men who first began with only <hi>Schisme,</hi> though in processe of
time they fell into some <hi>Heresy,</hi> and by that meanes are indeed both Schismatiques and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</p>
               <p>4. The reason why both Heresy and Schisme are repugnant to the being of a good <hi>Catholique,</hi>
is Because the <hi>Catholique,</hi> or Vniversall Church signifies <hi>One</hi> Congregation, or Company of
faithfull people, and therefore implies not only <hi>Faith,</hi> to make them <hi>Faithfull</hi> believers, but also
<hi>Communion,</hi> or <hi>Common Vnion,</hi> to make them <hi>One</hi> in Charity, which excludes Seperation, and
<hi>Division:</hi> and therefore in the Apostles Creed, <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> is immediatly joyned to the
<hi>Catholique Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. From this definition of Schisme may be inferred, that the guilt thereof is contracted, not
only by division from the Vniversall Church; but also, by a Separation from a particular Church
or Diocesse which agrees with the Vniversall. In this manner <hi>Meletius</hi> was a Schismatique, but
not an Heretique, because as we read in <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Heres. 68.</note> he was <hi>of the right Faith: for his faith
was not altered at any time from the holy Catholique Church &amp;c. He made a Sect, but departed
not from Faith.</hi> Yet because he made to himselfe a particular Congregation against <hi>S. Peter</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> his lawfull superiour, and by that meanes brought in a division in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church, he was a Schismatique. And it is well worth the noting, that the <hi>Meletians</hi> buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
new Churches put this title upon them, <hi>The Church of Martyrs:</hi> and upon the antient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of those vvho succeeded <hi>Peter,</hi> was inscribed, <hi>The Catholique Church.</hi> For so it is. A new
Sect must have a new name, which though it be never so gay and specious, <hi>as the Church of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs:
the Reformed Church &amp;c.</hi> yet the Novelty sheweth that it is not the Catholique, nor a true
Church. And that Schisme may be committed by division from a particular Church, wee read in
<hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Lib. 1. cont. Parmen.</note> these remarkeable words, (which doe well declare who bee

<hi>Caecilianus went not out from Majorinus thy Grand-Father</hi> (he meanes his next predeces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>7. In the judgement of the holy Fathers, Schisme is a most grievous offence. S. <hi>Chrisostome</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Hom. 11. in ep. ad Epk.</note> compares these Schismaticall dividers of Christs <hi>mysticall</hi> body, to those who sacrilegiously

we shall be punished no lesse then they who tore his</hi> (naturall) <hi>body. For that was done
to the gaine of the whole world, although not with that intention: but this hath no profit at all, but
there ariseth from it most great harme. These things are spoken, not only to those who beare office,
but also to those who are governed by them.</hi> Behold how neither a morall good life (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit

Let there those men who are pleased untruely to call us Idolaters, reflect upon themselves, and
consider, that this holy Father judgeth Schismatiques (as they are) to be worse then Idolaters,
which they absurdly call us. And this he proveth by the example of <hi>Core,</hi> and <hi>Dathan, Abiron</hi> and

this reward, because it is not only said, Happy are they who suffer persecution, but there is added,
for Iustice. But where there is not sound faith, there cannot be justice. Neither can Schismatiques
promise to themselves any part of this reward, because likewise where there is no Charity, there
cannot be justice. And in another place, yet more effectually he saith:

that it might turne to the condemnation of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall a man have recourse for the affaires of his soule, if upon earth there be no visible
Church of Christ? Besides, to imagine a company of men believing one thing in their heart, and
with their mouth professing the contrary, (as they must be supposed to doe; for if they had profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
what they believed, they would have become visible) is to dream of a damned crew of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
Sycophants, but not to conceive a right notion of the Church of Christ our Lord. And

preaching of the word, and administration of Sacraments (which cannot but make a Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)

                  <hi>I was alone. Ergo</hi> (say I, by your good leave) you were at least a <hi>Schismatique,</hi> divided
from the Ancient, Church, and a member of no new Church. For no sole man can constitute a
Church; and though he could; yet such a Church could not be, that glorious company, of whose
number, greatnesse, and amplitude, so much hath been spoken both in the old Testament, and in
the New.</p>
               <p>13 <hi>D. Potter</hi> endeavours to avoid this evident Argument by divers evasions; but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation,
thereof I will (with Gods holy assistance) take occasion, even out of his own Answers
and grounds, to bring unanswerable reasons to convince them of <hi>Schisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14 His chief Answer is: That they have not left the Church, but her <hi>Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15 I reply. This answer may be given either by those furious people, who teach that those
abuses, and corruptions in the Church were so enormous, that they could not stand with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or being of a true Church of Christ: Or else by those other more calme Protestants, who
affirme, that those errors did not destroy the <hi>being,</hi> but only deforme the <hi>beauty</hi> of the Church.
Against both these sorts of men. I may fitly use that unanswerable Dilemma, which S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
brings against the <hi>Donatists</hi> in these concluding words: <hi>Tell me whether the</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Lib. 2. cont. Epist. Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. c. 7.</note>

<hi>Schisme:</hi> but all men touched with any spark of zeal to vindicate the wisedome, and Goodnesse
of our Saviour from blasphemous injurie, cannot choose but believe and proclaim them to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
Arch-heretiques. Neverthelesse, if they will needs haue the honour of Singularity, and
desire to be both <hi>formall Heretiques,</hi> and <hi>properly Schismatiques,</hi> I will tell them, that while they
dream of an invisible Church of men, which agree with them in Faith, they will upon due refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
find themselves to be Schismatiques, from those corporeall Angels, or invisible men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because
<hi>they</hi> held externall Communion with the visible Church of those times, the outward Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of which visible Church <hi>these</hi> modern hot-spurs forsaking, were thereby divided from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Communion of their hidden Brethren, and so are Separatists from the externall <hi>Communion</hi>
of them, with whom they agree in <hi>faith,</hi> which is Schisme in the most formall, and proper signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
thereof. Moreover according to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> these boysterous Creatures are properly Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques.
For, the reason why he thinks himselfe, and such as he is, to be cleared from Schisme, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their division from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is because (according to his Divinity) the
property of<note n="h" place="margin">Pag. 76.</note> 
                  <hi>Schisme, is (witnesse the Donatists and Luciferians) to cut off from the Body of
Christ, and the hope of Salvation, the Church from which it separates:</hi> But those Protestants of
whom we now speak, <hi>cut off from the Body of Christ, and the hope of Salvation,</hi> the Church from
which they separated themselues; and they doe it directly as the Donatists (in whom you exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify)
did, by affirming that the true Church had perished: and therefore they cannot bee cleared
from <hi>Schisme,</hi> if you may be their Iudge. Consider, I pray you, how many prime Protestants both
domesticall and forraign, you haue at one blow struck off from hope of Salvation, and condemned
to the lowest pit, for the grievous sinne of <hi>Schisme.</hi> And withall it imports you to consider, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you also involve your selfe, and other moderate Protestants in the selfe, same crime and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

which he shall finde alleaged in the next number. And this may suffice for confutation of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Answer, as it might haue relation to the rigid Calvinists.</p>
               <p>17 For Confutation of these Protestants, who hold that the Church of Christ had alwaies a
being, and cannot erre in points fundamentall, and yet teach, that she may erre in matters of lesse
moment, wherein if they forsake her, they would be accounted not to leave the Church, but onely
her corruptions; I must say, that they change the state of our present Question, not distinguishing
between <hi>internall</hi> Faith, and <hi>externall Communion,</hi> nor between <hi>Schisme,</hi> and <hi>Heresie.</hi> This I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
out of D. <hi>Potter</hi> himselfe; who in expresse words teacheth, that the promises which <hi>our
Lord hath made</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Pag. 151.</note> 
                  <hi>unto his Church for his assistance, are intended not to any particular Persons or
Churches, but only to the Church Catholique: and they are to be extended not to every parcel, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity
of truth, but only to points of Faith, or fundamentall.</hi> And afterwards speaking of the
<hi>Vniversall Church,</hi> he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th: <hi>It's comfort</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Pag. 155.</note> 
                  <hi>enough for the Church, that the Lord in mercy will
secure her from all capital dangers, and conserue her on earth against all enemies; but shee may not
hope to triumph over all sinne and errour, till she be in heaven.</hi> Out of which words I observe, that,
according to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> the selfe same Church, which is the Vniversall Church, remaining the
universall true Church of Christ, may fall into errors and corruptions: from whence it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that it is impossible to leave the <hi>Externall communion</hi> of the Church so corrupted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>externall</hi> communion with the Catholique Church; since the Church Catholique, and the
Church so corrupted is the selfe same one Church, or company of men. And the contrary imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
talkes in a dream, as if the errours and infections of the Catholique Church were not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in her, but were separate from her, like to <hi>Accidents,</hi> without any <hi>Subject,</hi> or rather indeed, as
if they were not <hi>Accidents,</hi> but <hi>Hypostases,</hi> or <hi>Persons</hi> subsisting by themselues. For men cannot
be said to liue, in, or out of the Communion of any dead creature, but with Persons, endued with
life and reason; and much lesse can men be said to live in the Communion of Accidents, as errors
and corruptions are, and therefore it is an absurd thing to affirm, that Protestants divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from the corruptions of the Church, but not from the Church her selfe, seeing the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Church were inherent in the Church. All this is made more cleer, if we consider, that
when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared, there were not two distinct visible true Catholique Churches, holding
contrary Doctrines, and divided in externall Communion; one of the which two Churches did
<hi>triumph over all errour,</hi> and corruption in doctrine and practise; but the other was stained with
both. For to faign this diversity of two Churches cannot stand with record of histories, which are
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7615:137"/>
silent of any such matter. It is against D. <hi>Potters</hi> own grounds, that the Church may erre in points
not fundamentall, which were not true, if you will imagine a certain visible Catholique Church
free from errour even in points not fundamentall. It contradicteth the words in which he said, the
Church <hi>may not hope to triumph over all errour, till she be in heaven,</hi> It evacuateth the brag of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
that <hi>Luther</hi> reformed the whole Church: and lastly it maketh <hi>Luther</hi> a Schismatique, for
leaving the Communion of all visible Churches, seeing (upon this supposition) there was a visible
Church of Christ free from all corruption, which therefore could not be forsaken without just im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of <hi>Schisme.</hi> We must therefore truly affirme, that since there was but one visible Church
of Christ, which was truly Catholique, and yet was (according to Protestants) stained with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
when <hi>Luther</hi> left the externall Communion of that corrupted Church, he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Communion of the Catholique Church, no more then it is possible to keep company
with <hi>D. Christopher Potter,</hi> and not keep company with the Provost of Queenes Colledge in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
if D. <hi>Potter</hi> and the Provost be one, and the selfe same man: For so one should be, and not
be with him at the same time. This very argument drawne from the Vnity of God's Church, S.

she was not with Cornelius; But if she were with Cornelius, who succeeded Fabianus, by lawfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
Novatianus is not in the Church.</hi> I purposely here speak only of <hi>externall Communion</hi>
with the Catholique Church. For in this point there is great difference between <hi>internall acts</hi> of
our understanding, and will; and of <hi>externall deeds.</hi> Our Vnderstanding and Will, are faculties
(as Philosophers speak) abstractive, and able to distinguish, and as it were, to part things, though
in themselves they be really conjoyned. But reall externall deeds doe take things in grosse as they
find them, not separating things which in reality are joyned together. Thus, one may consider and
loue a sinner as he is a man, friend, benefactor, or the like; and at the same time not consider him,
nor loue him as he is a sinner; because these are acts of our Vnderstanding and will, which may
respect their objects under some one formality, or consideration, without reference to other things
contained in the selfe same objects. But if one should strike, or kill a sinfull man, he will not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
by alleaging, that he killed him, not as a man, but as a sinner; because the selfe same person
being a man, and the sinner, the <hi>externall</hi> act of murder fell joyntly upon the man, and the sinner.
And for the same reason one cannot avoid the company of a sinner, and at the same time be really
present with that man who is a sinner. And this is our case: and in this our Adversaries are egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously,
&amp; many of them affectedly, mistaken. For one may in some points belieue as the Church
believeth, and disagree from her in other. One may loue the truth which she holds, and detest her
(pretended) corruptions. But it is impossible that a man should really separate himselfe from her
externall Communion, as she is corrupted, and be really within the same externall Communion
as she is sound; because she is the selfe same Church which is supposed to be sound in some things,
and to erre in others. Now, our question for the present doth concern only this point of <hi>externall
Communion:</hi> because <hi>Schisme,</hi> as it is distinguished from <hi>Heresie,</hi> is committed when one divides
himselfe from the <hi>Externall Communion</hi> of that Church with which he agrees in <hi>Faith;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Heresie doth necessarily imply a difference in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> and beliefe: and therefore to say,
that they left not the visible Church, but her errours, can only excuse them from <hi>Heresie</hi> (which
sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll be tried in the next Chapter) but not from <hi>Schisme,</hi> as long as they are really divided from
the <hi>Externall Communion</hi> of the selfe same visible Church, which, notwithstanding those errours
wherein they doe in judgement dissent from her, doth still remain the true Catholique Church of
Christ; and therefore while they forsake the corrupted Church, they forsake the Catholique
Church. Thus then it remaineth cleer, that their chiefest Answer changeth the very state of the
Question; confoundeth internall acts of the Vnderstanding with <hi>externall Deeds;</hi> doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between <hi>Schisme</hi> and <hi>Heresie;</hi> and leaues this demonstrated against them: That they
divided themselues from the Communion of the visible Catholique Church, because they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that she needed Reformation. But whether this pretence of Reformation will acquit them of
<hi>Schisme,</hi> I referre to the unpartiall judges, heretofore<note n="n" place="margin">Numb. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> alleaged; as to <hi>S. Irenaeus</hi> who plainly
saith: <hi>They cannot make any so important REFORMATION, as the Evill of the Schisme is
pernicious.</hi> To <hi>S. Denis</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> saying: <hi>Certainly all things should be endured rather then to
consent to the division of the Church of God: those Martyrs being no lesse glorious that expose
themselues to hinder the dismembring of the Church, then those that suffer rather then they will
offer sacrifice to Idols.</hi> To S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who tells us: That not to heare the Church, <hi>is a more
grievous thing then if he were striken with the sword, consumed with flames, exposed to wild beasts.</hi>
And to conclude all in few words, he giveth this generall prescription: <hi>There is no just necessity to
divide unity,</hi> And D. <hi>Potter</hi> may remember his own words: <hi>There neither was</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Pag. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>nor can be any
just cause to depart from the Church of Christ; no more then from Christ himselfe.</hi> But I haue
shewed that <hi>Luther,</hi> and the rest departed from the Church of Christ (if Christ had any Church
upon earth:) Therefore there could be no just cause (of <hi>Reformation,</hi> or what else soever) to doe
as they did; and therefore they must be contented to be held for <hi>Schismatiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18 Moreover; I demand whether those corruptions which moved them to forsake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the visible Church, were in manners, or doctrine? Corruption in manners yeelds no
sufficient cause to leave the Church, otherwise men must goe not only out of the Church, but out
of the world, as the Apostle<note n="t" place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 10.</note> saith. Our blessed Saviour foretold that there would bee in the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7615:138"/>
Church cares with choice corne, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inners with just men. If then Protestants wax zealous,
with the <hi>Servants</hi> to pluck up the weeds, let them first harken to the wisdome of the <hi>Master: Let
both grow up.</hi> And they ought to imitate them, who as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>tolerate for the good of</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ep. 162.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnity, that which they detest for the good of equity.</hi> And to whom the more frequent, &amp; foule
such scandals are; by so much the more is the merit of their perseverance in the Communion of the
Church, and the Martyrdome of their patience, as the same Saint calls it. If they were offended
with the life of some Ecclesiasticall persons, must they therefore deny obedience to their Pastors,
and finally break with Gods Church? The Pastour of Pastours teacheth us another lesson: <hi>Vpon
the Chaire of Moyses</hi>
                  <note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>haue sitten the Scribes and Pharisees. All things threfore whatsoever
they shall say to you, obserue yee, and doe yee: but according to their works doe yee not.</hi> Must people
except against lawes, and revolt from Magistrats, because some are negligent, or corrupt in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the same lawes, and performance of their office? If they intended Reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
they used a strange means for the achieving of such an end, by denying the necessity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
laughing at aufferity of pennance, condemning the vowes of Chastity, poverty, obedience,
breaking fasts, &amp;c. And no lesse unfit were the <hi>Men,</hi> then the <hi>Meanes.</hi> I loue not recrimination.
But it is well known to how great crimes, <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zwinglius, Beza,</hi> and other of the prime
Reformers were notoriously obnoxious; as might bee easily demonstrated by the onely transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of what others haue delivered upon that subject; whereby it would appeare, that they were
very farre from being any such Apostolicall men as God is wont to use in so great a work. And
whereas they were wont, especially in the beginning of their revolt, malitiously to exaggerate the
faults of some Clergy men, <hi>Erasmus</hi> said well (<hi>Epist ad fratres inferior is Germaniae,) Let the riot,
lust, ambition, avarice of Priests and what soever other crimes be gathered together, Heresie a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>one
doth exceed all this filthy lake of vices.</hi> Besides, nothing at all was omitted by the sacred Councell
of <hi>Trent</hi> which might tend to reformation of manners. And finally the vices of others are not
hurtfull to any but such as imitate, and consent to them; according to the saying of S. <hi>Augustine:
We conserve innocency, not by knowing the ill deeds of men, but by not yeelding consent to such
as we know, and by not judging rashly of such faults as we know not.</hi> If you answer; that, not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in manners, but the approbation of them, doth yeeld sufficient cause to leaue the Church;
I reply with S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the Church doth (as the pretended Reformers ought to haue done)
tolerate or beare with scandals and corruptions, but neither doth, nor can approue them. <hi>The
Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>being placed</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Ep. 116.</note> 
                  <hi>betwixt much chaffe and cockle, doth beare with many things;
but doth not approue, nor dissemble, nor act those things which are against faith, and good life.</hi> But
because to approue corruption in manners as lawfull, were an errour against Faith, it belongs
to corruption in doctrine, which was the second part of my demand.</p>
               <p>19 Now then, that corruptions in doctrine (I still speak upon the untrue
supposition of our
Adversaries) could not afford any sufficient cause, or colourable necessity to depart from that visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, which was extant when <hi>Luther</hi> rose, I demonstrate out of D. <hi>Potters</hi> own confession;
that the Catholique Church neither hath, nor can erre in points <hi>fundamentall,</hi> as wee shewed out
of his own expresse words, which he also of set purpose delivereth in divers other places; and all
they are obliged to maintain the same, who teach that Christ had alwaies a visible Church upon
earth: because any one <hi>fundamentall</hi> error overthrowes the <hi>being</hi> of a true Church. Now (as
Schoolmen speak) it is, <hi>implicatio in terminis</hi> (a contradiction so plain, that one word destroyeth
the other, as if one should say, a living dead man) to affirm, that the Church doth not erre in points
necessary to salvation, or damnably; &amp; yet that it is damnable to remain in her Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she teacheth errors which are confessed not to be damnable. For if the error be not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
nor against any fundamentall Article of Faith, the beliefe thereof cannot bee damnable. But
D. <hi>Potter</hi> teacheth, that the Catholique Church <hi>cannot,</hi> and that the <hi>Roman Church hath not</hi> erred
against any fundamentall Article of Faith: Therefore, it cannot bee damnable to remaine in her
Communion; and so the pretended corruptions in her doctrine could not induce any obligation
to depart from her Communion, nor could excuse them from Schisme, who upon pretence of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
in point of conscience, forsook her. And D. <hi>Potter</hi> will never bee able to salve a manifest
contradiction in these his words: <hi>To depart from the Church</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>of Rome in some Doctrine, and
practises, there might be necessary cause, though she wanted nothing necessary to salvation.</hi> For if,
notwithstanding these Doctrines and practises, <hi>shee wanted nothing necessary to salvation;</hi> how
could it be <hi>necessary to salvation</hi> to forsake her? And therefore wee must still conclude that to
forsake her, was properly an act of <hi>Schisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20 From the selfe same ground of the infallibility of the Church in all fundamentall points,
I argue after this manner. The visible Church cannot be forsaken, without damnation, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that it is damnable to remain in her Communion, by reason of corruption in doctrine; as
long as, for the truth of her Faith and beliefe, she performeth the duty which she dweth to God,
and her Neighbour: As long as she performeth what our Saviour exacts at her hands: as long as
she doth, as much as lies in her power to doe. But (even according to D. <hi>Potters</hi> Assertions) the
Church performeth all these things, as long as she erreth not in points fundamentall, although
she were supposed to erre in other points not fundamentall: Therefore, the Communion of the
visible Church cannot be forsaken without damnation, upon pretence that it is damnable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in her Communion, by reason of corruption in doctrine. The <hi>Major,</hi> or first Proposition of
it selfe is evident. The <hi>Minor,</hi> or second Proposition do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>comfort enough for the Church, that the Lord
in mercy will secure her from all capitall dangers &amp;c. but she may not hope to triumph over all
sinne and errour, till she be in heaven.</hi> For it is evident, that the Church (for as much as concernes
the truth of her doctrines and beliefe) owes no more duty to God and her Neighbour; neither
doth our Saviour exact more at her hands, nor is it in her power to doe more then God doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
her to doe; which assistance is promised only for points fundamentall; and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>equently as
long as she teacheth no fundamentall error, her communion cannot without damnation be forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
And we may fitly apply against <hi>D. Potter</hi> a Concionatory declamation which he makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, where he saith:<note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 221.</note> 
                  <hi>May the Church of after Ages make the narrow way to heaven, narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then our Saviour left it &amp;c?</hi> since he himselfe obligeth men under pain of damnation to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Church, by reason of errours against which our Saviour thought it needlesse to promise
his assistance, and for which he neither demeth his grace in this life, or glory in the next. Will <hi>D.
Potter</hi> oblige the Church to doe more then she <hi>may</hi> even hope for? or to performe on earth that
which is proper to heaven alone?</p>
               <p>21 And as from your own doctrine concerning the infallibility of the Church in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
points, we have proved that it was a grievous sinne to forsake her: so doe we take a strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the fallibility of any who dare pretend to reforme the Church, which any man in
his wits will believe to be indued with at least as much infallibility as private men can challeng; &amp;
<hi>D. Potter</hi> expresly affirmeth that Christs promises of his assistance <hi>are not intended</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 151.</note> 
                  <hi>to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

                  </gap>t to flit from one erring company to another, without any new <hi>hope</hi> of triumphing over errours,
and without necessity, or utility to forsake that Communion of which <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>There is</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Ep. cont. Parmen. lib, 2, 2 cap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>no just necessity to divide Vnity.</hi> Which will appear to be much more evident if we consider that
though the Church had maintained some false doctrines, yet to leave her Communion to remedy
the old, were but to adde a new increase of errors, arising from the innumerable disagreements of
Sectaries, which must needs bring with it a mighty masse of falshoods, because the truth is but one,
and indivisible. And this reason is yet stronger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we still remember, that even according to <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
the visible Church hath a blessing not to erre in points fundamentall, in which any private <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former</hi>
may faile: and therefore they could not pretend any necessity to forsake that Church, out of
whose communion they were exposed to danger of falling into many more, and even into damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
errors. Remember I pray you, what your selfe affirmes (<hi>pag.</hi> 69.) where speaking of our
Church and yours, you say: <hi>All the difference is from the weeds, which remain there, and here are
taken away; Yet neither here perfectly, nor every where alike.</hi> Behold a fair confession of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
still remaining in your Church, which you can only excuse by saying they are not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
as likewise those in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are confessed to be not fundamentall. What man of
judgement will be a Protestant, since that Church is confessedly a corrupt one?</p>
               <p>22 I still proceed to impugne you expresly upon your own grounds. You say, <hi>that it is comfort
enough for the Church, that the Lord in mercy will secure her from all capitall dangers: but she may
not hope to triumph over all sinne, and errour till she be in heaven.</hi> Now if it be comfort <hi>enough</hi> to
be secured from all capitall dangers, which can arise only from error in fundamentall points: why
were not your first reformers content with <hi>enough,</hi> but would needs dismember the Church, out
of a pernitious greedinesse of more then <hi>enough?</hi> For, this <hi>enough,</hi> which according to you is attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by not erring in points fundamentall, was enjoyed before <hi>Luthers</hi> reformation, unlesse you
will now against your selfe affirme, that long before <hi>Luther</hi> there was no Church free from error
in fundamentall points. Moreover if (as you say) no Church may hope <hi>to triumph over all errour
till she be in heaven;</hi> You must either grant, that errors not fundamentall cannot yeeld sufficient
cause to forsake the Church, or else you must affirme that all community may, and ought to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken,
&amp; so there will be no end of Schismes: or rather indeed there can be no such thing as Schis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
because according to you, all communities are subject to errors not fundamentall, for which if
they may be lawfully forsaken, it followeth cleerely that it is not Schisme to forsake them. Lastly,
since it is not lawfull to leave the Communion of the Church for abuses in life and manners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such miseries cannot be avoided in this world of temptation: and since according to your
Assertion no <hi>Church may hope to triumph over all sinne and error;</hi> You must grant that as she
ought not to be left by reason of sinne; so neither by reason of errors not fundamentall; because
both <hi>sinne,</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> are (according to you) impossible to be avoided till she be in heaven.</p>
               <p>23 Furthermore, I aske whether it be the <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are <hi>certainly</hi> obliged not to forsake her. Our blessed Saviour hath declared his will, that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
a private offender seaventy seaven times, that is, without limitation of quantity of time, or
quality of trespasses; and why then dare you alleadge his command, that you must not pardon his
Church for errors, acknowledged to be not fundamentall? What excuse can you faine to your
selves; who for points not necessary to salvation, have been occasions, causes, and authors of so
many mischiefes, as could not but unavoidably accompany so huge a breach, in kingdomes, in
commonwealths, in private persons, in publique Magistrates, in body, in soul, in goods, in life,
in Church, in the state, by Schismes, by rebellions, by war, by famine, by plague, by bloudshed,
by all sorts of imaginable calamities upon the whole face of the earth, wherein as in a map of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
the heavinesse of your crime appeares, under which the world doth pant?</p>
               <p>24 To say for your excuse, that you left not the Church, but her errors, doth not extenuate,
but aggravate your sinne. For by this devise, you sow seeds of endles Schismes, and put into the
mouth of all Separatists, a ready answere how to avoid the note of <hi>Schisme</hi> from your Protestant
Church of England, or from any other Church whatsoever. They will, I say, answer, as you doe
prompt, that your Church may be forsaken, if she fall into errors, though they be not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
and further that no Church must hope to be free from such errors; which two grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once laid, it will not be hard to infer the consequence, that she may be forsaken.</p>
               <p>25 From some other words of <hi>D. Potter</hi> I likewise prove, that for Errors not fundamentall,
the Church ought not to be forsaken, <hi>There neither was</hi> (saith he) <hi>nor can be</hi>

to depart from the Church of Christ, no more then from Christ himselfe. To depart from a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church, and namely from the Church of Rome, in some doctrines and practises, there might be
just and necessary cause, though the Church of Rome wanted nothing necessary to salvation.</hi> Marke
his doctrine, that there <hi>can be no iust cause to depart from the Church of Christ:</hi> and yet he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that the Church of Christ, may erre in points not fundamentall; Therefore (say I) we cannot
forsake the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for points not fundamentall, for then we might also forsake the
Church of Christ, which your selfe deny: and I pray you consider, whether you doe not plainly
contradict your selfe, while in the words aboue recited, you say there can be no <hi>iust cause to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi>
the Catholique Church; and yet that there may be necessary cause to depart from the Church
of Rome, since you grant that the Church of Christ may erre in points not fundamentall: and that
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath erred only in such points; as by and by we shall see more in particular.
And thus much be said to disprove their chiefest Answer, that they left not the Church, but her
<hi>corruptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>26 <hi>Another evasion</hi> D. Potter <hi>bringeth, to avoid the imputation of</hi> Schisme, <hi>and it is, because
they still acknowledge the Church of Rome to be a</hi> Member of the body of Christ, <hi>and not</hi> cut off
from the hope of salvation. And this (<hi>saith he</hi>) cleeres us from<note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 76.</note> the imputation of Schisme, whose
property it is, to cut off from the Body of Christ, and the hope of salvation, the Church from which
it separates.</p>
               <p>27 This is an Answere which perhaps you may get some one to approve, if first you can put
him out of his wits. For what prodigious doctrines are these? Those Protestants who believe that
the Church erred in points necessary to salvation, and for that cause left her, cannot be excused
from damnable <hi>Schisme:</hi> But others who believed that she had no damnable errors, did very well,
yea were obliged to forsake her: and (which is more miraculous, or rather monstrous) they did
well to forsake her formally and precisely, <hi>because</hi> they <hi>iudged.</hi> that she retained all meanes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation, I say, <hi>because</hi> they so <hi>iudged,</hi> For the very reason for which he acquitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and condemneth those others as Schismatiques, is because he holdeth that the Church
which both of them forsooke, is not cut off from the <hi>Body of Christ, and the hope of Salvations</hi>
whereas those other Zelots deny her to be a member of Christs body, or capable of salvation,
wherein alone they disagree from <hi>D. Potter:</hi> for in the effect of separation they agree, only they
doe it upon a different motive or reason. were it not a strange excuse, if a man would think to
cloak his rebellion, by alledging that he held the person against whom he rebelled to be his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Soveraign? And yet D. <hi>Potter</hi> thinks himselfe free from Schisme, because he forsook the Church
of Rome, but yet so, as that still he held her to be the true Church, and to have all necessary
meanes to Salvation. But I will no further urge this most solemne foppery, and doe much more
willingly put all Catholiques in mind, what an unspeakeable comfort it is, that our Adversaries
are forced to confesse, that they cannot cleere themselves from <hi>Schisme,</hi> otherwise then by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that they doe not, nor cannot <hi>cut off from the hope of Salvation</hi> our Church. Which
is as much as if they should in plain termes say: They must be damned, unlesse we may be saved.
Moreover this evasion doth indeed condemne your zealous brethren of <hi>Heresy,</hi> for denying the
Churches perpetuity, but doth not cleere your selfe from <hi>Schisme,</hi> which consists in being divided
from that true Church, with which a man agreeth in all points of faith, as you must professe your
selfe to agree with the Church of Rome in all fundamentall Articles. For otherwise you should
cut her off from the hope of salvation, and so condemne your selfe of <hi>Schisme.</hi> And lastly even
according to this your own definition of <hi>Schisme,</hi> you cannot cleere your selfe from that crime,
unlesse you be content to acknowledge a manifest contradiction in your own Assertions. For if you
doe not cut us off <hi>from the Body of Christ, and the hope of Salvation;</hi> how come you to say in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, that you judge a <hi>reconciliation</hi> with us <hi>to be</hi>

                  <hi>we dare not flatter them</hi> (say
you) <hi>with so easy a censure,</hi> of hope of salvation? If then it be (as you say) a property of <hi>Schisme,</hi>
to cut off from the hope of Salvation, the Church from which it separates: how will you cleere
your selfe from <hi>Schisme,</hi> who dare not flatter us with so easy a censure? and who affirme that a
reconciliation with us is <hi>damnable?</hi> But the truth is, there is no constancy in your Assertions, by
reason of difficulties which presse you on all sides. For, you are loath to affirme cleerely, that we
may be saved, least such a grant might be occasion (as in all reason it ought to be) of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Protestants to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: And on the other side, if your affirme, that our Church
erred in points fundamentall, or necessary to salvation, you knew not how, not where, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
what company of men, to find a perpetuall visible Church of Christ, before <hi>Luther:</hi> And
therefore your best shift is to say, and unsay, as your occasion command. I doe not examine your
Assertion, that it is the property of Schisme, <hi>to cut off from the Body of Christ, and the hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
the Church from which it separates:</hi> wherein you are mightily mistaken, as appears by
your own example of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who were most formall and proper <hi>Heretiques,</hi> and not
<hi>Schismatiques,</hi> as <hi>Schisme</hi> is a vice distinct from <hi>Heresy.</hi> Besides, although the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and
<hi>Luciferians</hi> (whom you also alledge) had been meere Schismatiques, yet it were against all
good Logick, from a particular to inferre a generall Rule, to determine what is the property of
<hi>Schisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28 A third device I find in <hi>D. Potter</hi> to cleere his brethren from <hi>Schisme. There is</hi> (saith he)
<hi>great difference between</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> a <hi>Schisme from them, and a Reformation of our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29 This I confesse is a quaint subtilty, by which all Schisme, &amp; Sinne may be as well excused.
For what divell incarnate could meerely pretend a separtion, and not rather some other motive
of vertue, truth, profit, or pleasure? But now since their pretended <hi>Reformation</hi> consisted, as they
ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e out, in forsaking the corruptions of the Church: the <hi>Reformation</hi> of themselves, and their
<hi>division</hi> from us, falls out to be one, and the selfe same thing. Nay we see, that although they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
disagree in the particulars of their reformation, yet they symbolize, and consent in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
point of forsaking our pretended corruptions: An evident signe, that the thing, upon which
their thoughts first pitched, was not any particular Modell, or Idea of Religion, but a setled reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to forsake the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore this Metaphysicall speculation, that they
intended only to reforme themselves, cannot possible excuse them from <hi>Schisme,</hi> unlesse first they
be able to prove, that they were obliged to depart from us. Yet for as much as concernes the fact
it selfe; it is cleere, that <hi>Luthers</hi> revolt did not proceed from any zeale of reformation. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
which put him upon so wretched, and unfortunate a work, were Covetousnesse, Ambition,
Lust, Pride, Envy, and grudging that the promulgation of Indulgences, was not committed to
himself, or such as he desired. He himself taketh God to witnesse, that he <hi>fell into these troubles
casually, and</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Casu non vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate in has turbas incidi Deum ipsum testor.</note> 
                  <hi>against his will</hi> (not upon any intention of Reformation) not so much as <hi>drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

<hi>when he knew not what</hi>

                  <hi>the matter meant. For</hi> (saith he) <hi>I scarcely understood</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Sleid. lib. 13. fol. 177.</note> 
                  <hi>then
what the name of Indulgences meant.</hi> In so much as afterwards <hi>Luther</hi> did much mistake of his
owne undertaken course, oftentimes (saith he) <hi>wishing</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Luth. in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loq. mensal.</note> 
                  <hi>that I had never begunne that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
And <hi>Fox</hi> saith: <hi>It is apparent that</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Act. mon. pag. 404.</note> 
                  <hi>Luther promised Cardinall Caietan to keep silence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
also his adversaries would doe the like. M. Cowper</hi> reporteth further, that <hi>Luther by his letter
submitted</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Cowp. in his Chronicle.</note> 
                  <hi>himself to the Pope, so that he might not be compelled to recant.</hi> With much more,
which may be seen in<note n="w" place="margin">Tract 2. cap. 2, Sect. 11. subd. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Brereley.</hi> But this is sufficient to shew, that <hi>Luther</hi> was farre enough,
from intending any Reformation. And if he judged a <hi>Reformation</hi> to be necessary, what a huge
wickednesse was it in him, to promise <hi>silence if his adversaries would doe the like?</hi> Or to submit
<hi>himself to the Pope, so that he might not be compelled to recant?</hi> Or if the Reformation were not
indeed <hi>intended</hi> by him, nor judged to be <hi>necessary,</hi> how can he be excused fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> damnable <hi>Schisme?</hi>
And this is the true manner of <hi>Luthers</hi> revolt, taken from his owne acknowledgments, and the
words of the more ancient Protestants themselves, whereby D. <hi>Potters</hi> faltring, and mincing the
matter, is cleerely discovered, and confuted. Vpon what motives our Country was divided from the
Roman Church by king <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, and how the Schisme was continued by Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
I have no heare to rip up. The world knoweth, it was not upon any zeale of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30 <hi>But you will prove your former evasion by a couple of similitudes:</hi> If a Monastery<note n="x" place="margin">Pag. 81. 82<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>
should reforme it selfe, and should reduce into practise, ancient good discipline, when others would
not; in this case could it is reason bee charged with Schisme from others, or with Apostacy from its
rule and order? Or as in a society of men universally infected with some disease, they that should
free themselves from the common disease, could not be therefore said to separate from the society:
so neither can the reformed Churches be truely accused for making a Schisme from the Church, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all they did, was to reforme themselves.</p>
               <p>31 I was very glad to find you in a Monastery, but sorry when I perceived that you were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
wayes how to forsake your Vocation, and to maintaine the lawfulnesse of Schisme from
the Church, and Apostasie from a Religious Order. Yet before you make your finall resolution,
heare a word of advise. Put case; That a Monastery did confessedly observe their substantiall
vowes, and all principall Statutes, or Constitutions of the Order, though with some neglect of
lesser Monasticall Observances: And that a Reformation were undertaken, not by authority of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7615:140"/>
lawfull Superiours, but by some One, or very few in comparison of the rest: And those few knowne
to be led, not with any spirit of Reformation, but by some other sinister intention: And that the
Statutes of the house were even by those busie fellowes confessed, to have been time out of mind
understood, and practised as now they were: And further that the pretended Reformers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that themselves as soone as they were gone out of their Monastery, must not hope to be
free from those or the like errors and corruptions, for which they left their Brethren: And (which
is more) that they might fall into more enormous crimes then they <hi>did,</hi> or <hi>could</hi> doe in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
which we suppose to be <hi>secured</hi> from all substantiall corruptions, for the avoyding of
which they have an infallible assistance. Put (I say) together all these my <hi>And's,</hi> and then come
with your <hi>If's, If a Monastery should reforme it self, &amp;c.</hi> and tell me, if you could excuse such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
from Schisme, Sedition, Rebellion, Apostasie, &amp;c? what would you say of such Reformers
in your Colledge? or tumultuous persons in a kingdome? Remember now your owne Tenets, and
then reflect how fit a similitude you have picked out, to prove your self a <hi>Schismatique.</hi> You teach
that the Church may erre in points not fundamentall, but that for all fundamentall points she is
<hi>secured</hi> from error: You teach that no particular person, or Church hath any promise of assistance
in points fundamentall. You, and the whole world can witnesse that when <hi>Luther</hi> began, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but only <hi>One,</hi> opposed himself <hi>to All,</hi> as well subjects, as superiours; and that even then, when
he himself confessed that he had no intention of Reformation: You cannot be ignorant but that
many chief learned Protestants are forced to confesse the Antiquity of our doctrine and practice,
and doe in severall, and many Controversies, acknowledge that the Ancient Fathers stood on our
Side: Consider I say these points, and see whether your similitude doe not condemne your Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors
of <hi>Schisme</hi> from God's visible <hi>Church,</hi> yea and of <hi>Apostasie</hi> also from their Religious <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
if they were vowed Regulars, as <hi>Luther,</hi> and divers of them were.</p>
               <p>32 From the Monastery you are f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed into an Hospitall <hi>of persons vniversally infected with
some disease,</hi> where you find to be true what I supposed, that after your departure from your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
you might fall into greater inconveniences, and more <hi>infectious diseases,</hi> then those for
which you left <hi>them.</hi> But you are also upon the point to abandon these miserable needy persons, in
whose behalf for Charities sake, let me set before you these considerations. If the disease neither
<hi>were,</hi> nor <hi>could</hi> be mortall, because in that Company of men God had placed a Tree of life: If go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thence, the sick man might by curious tasting the Tree of Knowledge eate poyson under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of bettering his health: If he could not hope thereby to avoid other diseases like those for
which he had quitted the company of the first infected men: If by his departure innumerable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
were to ensue; could such a man without sencelesnesse be excused by saying, that he sought <hi>to
free himself from the common disease,</hi> but not forsooth <hi>to separate from the society?</hi> Now your self
compare the Church to a man deformed with<note n="y" place="margin">Pag. 154.</note> 
                  <hi>superfluous fingers and toes,</hi> but yet who hath
not <hi>lost</hi> any <hi>vitall part:</hi> you acknowledge that out of her society no man is secured from damnable
errour, and the world can beare witnesse what unspeakable mischiefs and calamities ensued <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

now I have shewed them to deserve, who in the manner aforesaid should <hi>separate from</hi> persons
<hi>universally</hi> infected with some disease.</p>
               <p>33 But alas, to what passe hath Heresy brought men, who terme themselves Christians, and
yet blush not to compare the beloved Spouse of our Lord, the one Dove, the pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hase of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
most precious blood, the holy Catholique Church, I mean that visible Church of Christ
which <hi>Luther</hi> found spread over the whole world; to a Monastery so disordered that it must be
forsaken; to the <hi>Gyant in Gath much deformed with superfluous fingers and toes;</hi> to a <hi>society of men
universally infected with some disease!</hi> And yet all these comparisons, and much worse, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
injurious, nor undeserved, if once it be granted, or can be proved, that the visible Church of
Christ may erre in any one point of Faith, although not fundamentall.</p>
               <p>34 Before I part from these similitudes, one thing I must observe against the evasion of D.
<hi>Potter,</hi> that they left not the <hi>Church,</hi> but her Corruptions. For as those Reformers of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
or those other who left the company of men universally infected with some disease, would
deny themselves to be <hi>Schismatiques,</hi> or any way blame-worthy, but could not deny, but that they
left the said Communities: So <hi>Luther</hi> and the rest cannot so much as pretend, not to have left the
visible Church, which according to them was infected with many diseases, but can only pretend
that they did not sinne in leaving her. And you speak very strangly when you say: <hi>In a society of
men universally infected with some disease, they that should free themselves from the Common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
could not be therefore said to separate from the Society.</hi> For if they doe not separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Society of the infected persons; how doe they free themselves and depart from the
common disease? Doe they at the same time remain <hi>in the company,</hi> and yet depart <hi>from</hi> those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
creatures? We must then say, that they <hi>separate</hi> themselves from the persons, though it be by
occasion of the disease: Or if you say, they free their owne persons from the common disease, yet
so, that they remain still in the Company infected, subject to the Superiours and Governours
thereof, eating and drinking and keeping publique Assemblies with them; you cannot but know,
that <hi>Luther</hi> and your Reformers the first pretended free persons from the supposed common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Roman Church, did not so: for they endeavoured to force the Society whereof they
were parts, to be healed and reformed as they were: and if it refused, they did, when they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
drive the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, even their Superiours both spirituall and temporall, as is notorious. Or if they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7615:140"/>
had no: power to expell that supposed infected Community, or Church of that place, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from them corporally, whom mentally they had forsaken before. So that you cannot deny,
but <hi>Luther</hi> forsook the externall Communion, and company of the Catholique Church, for
which as your self<note n="z" place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> confesse, <hi>There neither was nor can be any just cause, no more then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from Christ himself.</hi> We doe therefore infer, that <hi>Luther</hi> and the rest who for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church which they found upon earth, were truely, and <hi>properly Schismatiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35 Moreover, it is evident that there was a division between <hi>Luther</hi> and that Church which
was Visible when he arose: but that Church cannot be said to have divided her self from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whose time she was, and in comparison of whom she was a <hi>Whole,</hi> and he but a <hi>part:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must say, that he divided himself and went out of her; which is to be a <hi>Schismatique,</hi> or
<hi>Heretique,</hi> or both. By this argument, <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> proveth, that not <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> but <hi>Par

Since it manifestly appeareth that these things were acted in this manner, it is cleare that you are
beyres both of the deliverers up</hi> (of the holy Bible to be burned) <hi>and also of Schismatiques.</hi> The
whole argument of this holy Father makes directly both against <hi>Luther,</hi> and all those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the division which he begun; and proves, That, <hi>going out,</hi> convinceth those who goe out to
be Schismatiques; but not those from whom they depart: That to forsake the Chaire of Peter is
<hi>Schisme;</hi> yea, that it is <hi>Schisme</hi> to erect a Chaire which had no origen, or as it were predecessou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before it self: That to continue in a division begun by others, is to be <hi>Heires of Schismatiques;</hi> and
lastly; that to depart from the Communion of a particular Church (as that of <hi>S. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sufficient to make a man incur the guilt of <hi>Schisme,</hi> and consequently, that although Protestants,
who deny the Pope to be supreme Head of the Church, doe think by that <hi>Heresy</hi> to cleere <hi>Luther</hi>

               <p>36 But it is not the Heresy of Protestants, or any other Sectaries, that can deprive <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
and his Successours, of the authority which Christ our Lord conferred upon them over his whole
militant Church: which is a point confessed by learned Protestants to be of great Antiquity, and
for which the judgement of divers most ancient holy Fathers is reproved by them, as may be seen
at large in <hi>Brerely</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Tract. 1. Sect. 3. subd. 10.</note> exactly citing the places of such chiefe Protestants. And we must say with
<hi>S. Cyprian: Heresies</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Ep. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>have sprung, and Schismes been bred from no other cause then for that
the Priest of God is not obeyed, nor one Priest and Iudge is considered to be for the time in the Church
of God.</hi> Which words doe plainely condemne <hi>Luther,</hi> whether he will understand them as spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the <hi>Vniversall,</hi> or of every <hi>particular</hi> Church. For he withdrew himselfe both from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of the Pope, and of all particular Bishops, and Churches. And no lesse cleere is the said
<hi>Optatus Milevitanus,</hi> saying: <hi>Thou caust not deny</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 2, Cont<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Parm.</note> 
                  <hi>but that thou knowest, that in the City of
Rome, there was first an Episcopall Chaire placed for Peter, wherein Peter the head of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stles
sate, whereof also he was called Cephas; in which one Chaire, Vn was to be kept by all, least
the other Apostles might attribute to themselves, each one his particular chaire; and that he should
be a Schismatique and sinner, who against that one single Chaire should erect another.</hi> Many other
Authorities of Fathers might be alleaged to this purpose, which I omit; my intention being not
to handle particular controversies.</p>
               <p>37 Now, the arguments which hitherto I have brought, prove that <hi>Luther,</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were Schismatiques, without examining (for as much as belongs to this point) whether or
no the Church can erre in any one thing great or small, because it is universally true, that there
can be no just cause to forsake the Communion of the Visible Church of Christ, according to
<hi>S. Augustine,</hi> saying: <hi>It is not possible</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Ep. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>that any may have just cause to separate their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from the Communion of the whole world, and call themselves the Church of Christ, as if they
had separated themselves from the Communion of all Nations upon just cause.</hi> But since indeed the
Church cannot erre in any one point of doctrine, nor can approve any corruption in manners; they
cannot with any colour avoid the just imputation of <hi>eminent</hi> Schisme, according to the verdict of
the same holy Father in these words: <hi>The most manifest</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">De Bapt. lib. 5. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>sacriledge of Schisme is eminent when
there was no cause of separation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>38 Lastly, I prove that Protestants cannot avoid the note of Schisme, at least by reason of
their mutuall separation from one another. For most certain it is that there is very great difference,
for the outward face of a Church, and profession of a different faith, between the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the
rigid <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> of England. So that if <hi>Luther</hi> were in the right, those other
Protestants who invented Doctrines far different from his, and divided themselues from him,
must be reputed <hi>Schismatiques:</hi> and the like argument may proportionably be applyed to their
further divisions, &amp; subdivisions. Which reason I yet urge more strongly out of D. <hi>Potter,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> who
affirmes, that to him and to such as are convicted in conscience of the errors of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
a reconciliation is <hi>impossible,</hi> and <hi>damnable:</hi> And yet he teacheth, that their difference from the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> is not in fundamentall points. Now, since among Protestants there is such diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of beliefe, that one denieth what the other affirmeth, they must be convicted in conscience
that one part is in errour (at least not fundamentall,) and, if D. <hi>Potter</hi> will speak consequently,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7615:141"/>
that a reconciliation between them is <hi>impossible</hi> &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable: &amp; what greater division, or <hi>Schisme</hi> can
there be, then when one part must judge a reconciliation with the other to be <hi>impossible,</hi> &amp; <hi>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>39 Out of all which premisses, this <hi>Conclusion</hi> followes: That, <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; his followers were
<hi>Schismatiques;</hi> from the universall visible Church; from the Pope Christs Vicar on earth, &amp; Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
to S. <hi>Peter;</hi> from the particular Diocesse in which they received Baptisme; from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
or Nation to which they belonged; from the Bishop under whom they lived; many of them
from the Religious Order in which they were professed; from one another; And lastly from a
mans selfe (as much as is possible) because the selfe same Protestant to day <hi>is convicted in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
that his yesterday's Opinion was an error (as D. <hi>Potter</hi> knows a man in the world who from
a Puritan was turned to a moderate Protestant) with whom therefore a reconciliation, according
to D. <hi>Potters</hi> grounds, is both <hi>impossible,</hi> and <hi>damnable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>40 It seemes D. <hi>Potters</hi> last refuge to excuse himselfe and his Brethren from Schisme, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they proceeded according to their conscience, dictating an obligation under damnation to
forsake the errours maintained by the Church of Rome. His words are: <hi>Although we confesse the</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Pag. 81.</note> 
                  <hi>Church of Rome to be (in some sense) a true Church, and her errors to some men not damnable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
yet for us who are convinced in conscience, that she erres in many things, a necessity lies upon us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
under pain of damnation, to forsake her in those errors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41 I answer: It is very strange, that you judge us extreamly Vncharitable, in saying, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
cannot be saved; while your selfe avouch the same of all learned Catholiques, whom igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
cannot excuse. If this your pretence of conscience may serue, what Schismatique in the
Church, what popular seditious brain in a kingdome, may not alledge the dictamen of conscience
to free themselves from <hi>Schisme,</hi> or <hi>Sedition?</hi> No man wishes them to doe any thing against their
conscience, but we say, that they may, and ought to rectifie, and depose such a conscience, which is
<hi>easie</hi> for them to doe, even according to your own affirmation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that wee Catholiques want no
meanes necessary to salvation. Easie to doe? Nay not to doe so, to any man in his right wits must
seem <hi>impossible.</hi> For how can these two apprehensions stand together: In the Roman Church I
enjoy all meanes necessary to salvation, and yet I cannot hope to be saved in that Church? or, who
can conjoyn in one brain (not crack't) these assertions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After due examination I judge the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
errors not to be in themselues fundamentall, or damnable; and yet I judge that according to
true reason, it is damnable to hold them? I say <hi>according to true reason.</hi> For if you grant your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to be <hi>erroneous,</hi> in judging that you cannot be saved in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, by reason of her
errours; there is no other remedy, but that you must rectifie your erring conscience, by your other
judgement, that her errours are not fundamentall, nor damnable. And this is no more Charity,
then you daily afford to such other Protestants as you term Brethren, whom you cannot deny to
be in some errors, (unlesse you will hold, That of contradictory propositions both may be true)
and yet you doe not judge it damnable to liue in their Communion, because you hold their errors
not to be fundamentall. You ought to know, that according to the Doctrine of all Divines, there
is great difference between a speculatiue perswasion, and a practicall dictamen of conscience; and
therefore although they had in speculation conceived the visible Church to erre in some doctrines,
of themselves not damnable; yet with that speculatiue judgement they might, and ought to haue
entertained this practicall dictamen, that for points not substantiall to faith, they neither were
bound, nor lawfully could break the bond of Charity, by breaking unity in Gods Church. You say
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And you would think him a mad man who to be rid of such stuffe, would set his house on fire,
that so he might walk in the light, as you teach that <hi>Luther</hi> was obliged to forsake the house of
God, for an unnecessary light, not without a combustion formidable to the whole Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> world;
rather then beare with some errours, which did not destroy the foundation of faith. And as fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

others who entred in at the breach first made by <hi>Luther,</hi> they might, and ought to haue guided

                  <hi>moment, and both most profitable to be learned, and necessary to
be remembred, and which we ought again and again to illustrate, and inculcate with weighty heapes
of examples, that almost all Catholiques may know, that they ought to receiue the Doctors with the
Church, and not forsake the faith of the Church with the Doctors:</hi> And much lesse should they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the faith of the Church to follow <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and such other Novelists. Moreover
though your first Reformers had conceived their own opinions to be <hi>true;</hi> yet they might, and
ought to haue doubted, whether they were <hi>certain:</hi> because your selfe affirm, that infallibility was
not promised to any particular Persons, or Churches. And since in cases of <hi>uncertainties,</hi> we are
not to leave our Superiour, nor cast off his obedience, or publiquely oppose his decrees; your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
might easily haue found a safe way to satisfie their zealous conscience, without a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
breach: especially if with this their <hi>uncertainty,</hi> we call to mind the peaceable possession, &amp;
and prescription which by the confession of your own Brethren, the Church, and Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
did for many ages enjoy. I wish you would examine the works of your Brethren, by the words
your selfe sets down to free <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> from <hi>Schisme:</hi> every syllable of which words convinceth
<hi>Luther,</hi> and his Copartners to be guilty of that crime, and sheweth in what manner they might
with great ease, and quietnesse haue rectified their consciences about the pretended errours of the
Church. <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> (say you) <hi>was a peaceable</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Pag. 124.</note>

opinion. He believed his own opinion to be true, but believed not, that it was necessary, and
therefore did not proceed rashly and peremptorily to censure others, but left them to their liberty.</hi>
Did your Reformers imitate this manner of proceeding? Did they <hi>censure no man, much lesse any
Church? S. Cyprian believed his own Opinion to be true, but believed not that it was necessary, and
THEREFORE did not proceed rashly, and peremptorily to censure others.</hi> You belieue the
points wherein <hi>Luther</hi> differs from us, not to be fundamentall, or <hi>necessary;</hi> and why doe you not
thence infer the like THEREFORE, he should not haue <hi>proceeded to censure others?</hi> In a
word, since their disagreement from us concerned only points which were not fundamentall, they
should haue believed that they might haue been deceived, as well as the whole visible Church,
which you say may erre in such points; and therefore their doctrines being not certainly <hi>true,</hi> and
certainly <hi>not necessary,</hi> they could not giue sufficient cause to depart from the Communion of the
Church.</p>
               <p>42 In other places you write so much, as may serve us to proue, that <hi>Luther,</hi> and his followers
ought to haue deposed, and rectified their consciences: As for example, when you say: <hi>When the

                  <hi>hath declared her selfe in any matter of opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of Rites, her declaration obliges all
her children to peace, and externall obedience. Nor is it fit, or lawfull for any private man to oppose
his judgement to the publique;</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> and his fellows did) <hi>He may offer his opinion to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of, so he doe it with evidence, or great probability of Scripture, or reason, and very modestly,
still containing himself within the dutifull respect which he oweth: but if he will factiously advance
his own conceits</hi> (his own conceits? &amp; yet grounded upon evidence of Scripture) <hi>&amp; despise the
Church so far as to cut of her Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion; he may be justly branded &amp; condemned for a Schismatique,
yea &amp; an Heretique also in some degree, &amp; in foro exteriori, though his opinion were true, &amp; much
more if it be false.</hi> Could any man, even for a Fee, haue spoken more home to condemn your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
of <hi>Schisme,</hi> or Heresy? Could they haue stronger Motives to oppose the doctrine of the
Church, and leave her Communion, then evidence of Scripture? And yet, according to your own
words, they should haue answered, &amp; rectified their conscience, by your doctrine, that though their
opinion <hi>were true,</hi> and grounded upon evidence of <hi>Scripture, or reason;</hi> yet it was not lawfull for
any <hi>private man to oppose his iudgement to the publique,</hi> which obligeth all Christians <hi>to peace &amp;
externall obedience:</hi> and if they cast off the Communion of the Church for maintaining their own
<hi>Conceits, they may be branded for Schismatiques, and Heretiques in some degree, &amp; in foro exteriori,</hi>
that is, all other Christians ought so <hi>to esteem</hi> of them, (and why then are we accounted unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for judging so of you?) and they also are obliged to <hi>behaue</hi> themselves <hi>in the face of all
Christian Churches,</hi> as if indeed they were not Reformers, but <hi>Schismatiques,</hi> and <hi>Heretiques,</hi> or
as Pagans, &amp; Publicans. I thank you for your ingenuous confession, in recompence whereof, I will
doe a deed of Charity, by putting you in mind, into what labyrinths you are brought, by teaching
that the Church may erre in some points of faith, &amp; yet that it is not lawful for any man to oppose
his judgement, or leave her Communion, though he haue evidence of Scripture against her. Will
you have such a man dissemble against his conscience, or externally deny a truth, known to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in holy Scripture? How much more coherently doe Catholiques proceed, who believe the
universall infallibility of the Church, and from thence are assured, that there can be no evidence of
Scripture; or reason, against her definitions, nor any just cause to forsake her Communion?
M. Hooker, esteemed by many Protestants an incomparable man, yeelds as much as we haue

                  <hi>good Cotholique Bishops, were of the same opinion with the Donatists, that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of Heretiques was ineffectuall; and with the Novatians, that the Church ought not to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
some grievous sinners. These errours therefore (if they had gone no further) were not in
themselves Hereticall, especially in the proper, and most heavy, or bitter sense of that
word; neither was it in the Churches intention (or in her power) to make them such by
her declaration. Her intention was, to silence all disputes, and to settle peace and unitie
in her government: to which all wise and peaceable men submitted, whatsoever their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was. And those factious people, for their unreasonable and uncharitable opposition,
were very justly branded for Schismatiques. For us, the</hi> Mistaker <hi>will never proue that
we oppose any declaration of the Catholique Church &amp;c. and therefore hee doth uniustlie
charge us either with Schisme, or Heresie.</hi> These wordes manifestly condemne your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers;
who opposed the visible Church in many of her declarations, Doctrines, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
imposed upon them, for silencing all disputes, <hi>and setling peace and Vnity in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and therefore they still remaining obstinately disobedient, are justly <hi>charged with Schisme,
and Heresie.</hi> And it is to be observed, that you grant the <hi>Donatists</hi> to haue been <hi>very justly bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for Schismatiques,</hi> although their opposition against the Church, did concern (as you hold)
a point not fundamentall to the Faith, and which according to S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> cannot be proved
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7615:142"/>
out of Scripture alone; and therefore either doth evidently convince that the Church is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
infallible, even in points not fundamentall; or else that it is <hi>Schisme,</hi> to oppose her declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in those very things wherein she may erre; and consequently that <hi>Luther,</hi> and his fellowes
were <hi>Schismatiques,</hi> by opposing the visible Church, for points not fundamentall, though it were
(untruely) supposed that she erred in such points. But by the way, how come you on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
to hold the determination of a Generall Councell (of <hi>Nice</hi>) to be the declaration of the
Catholique Church, seeing you teach, That Generall Councels may erre even fundamentally?
And doe you now say, with us, that to oppose the declaration of the Church, is sufficient that one
may be branded with <hi>Heresie,</hi> which is a point so often impugned by you?</p>
               <p>43 It is therefore most evident, that no pretended scruple of <hi>conscience</hi> could excuse <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>

he had forsaken the visible Church of Christ; and I beseech all Protestants for the loue

what will become of <hi>Luther</hi> who against his conscience, persisted in his division from the <hi>Roman</hi>

               <p>44 Some are said to flatter themselves with another pernicious conceit, that they (forsooth)
are not guilty of sinne; Because they were not the <hi>first Authors,</hi> but only are the <hi>continuers</hi> of the

               <p>45 But it is hard to believe, that any man of judgment, can think this excuse will subsist, when
he shall come to give up his finall accompt. For according to this reason, no Schisme will be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,

against the main principle of Christianity, that it is not lawfull for any Christian, to live out of

or retaines his neighbours goods, the greater injustice he commits. Constancy in evill doth not
extenuate, but aggravate the same, which by extension of time, receiveth increase of strength, and
addition of greater malice. If these mens conceits were true, the Church might come to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divided by wicked Schismes, and yet after some space of time, none could be accused of Schisme,
nor be obliged to returne to the visible Church of Christ: and so there should remaine no <hi>One</hi> true
visible Church. Let therefore these men who pretend to honour, reverence, and believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and practise of the visible Church, and to condemne their forefathers who forsooke her,
and say they would not have done so, if they had lived in the daies of their Fathers, and yet follow
their example in remaining divided from her Communion; consider, how truly these words of
our Saviour fall upon them. <hi>Woe be to you, because you build</hi>

               <p>46 And thus having demonstrated that <hi>Luther,</hi> his Associates, and all that continue in the
Schisme by them begun, are guilty of <hi>Schisme,</hi> by departing from the visible true Church of Christ;
it remaineth that we examine what in particular was that Visible true Church, from which they
departed,<note place="margin">5. Point. Luther and the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Roman Church.</note> that so they may know to what Church in particular they ought to returne: and then we
shall have performed what was proposed to be handled in the fift Point.</p>
               <p>47 That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (I speak not for the present, of the particular Diocesse of
<hi>Rome,</hi> but of all visible Churches dispersed throughout the whole world, agreeing in Faith
with the Chaire of <hi>Peter,</hi> whether that Sea were supposed to be in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place:) That (I say) the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in this sense, was the visible Catholique Church
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7615:143"/>
out of which <hi>Luther</hi> departed, is proved by your own confession, who assigne for notes of the
Church, the true Preaching of Gods word, and due administration of Sacraments, both which
for the substance you cannot deny to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, since you confesse that she wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
fundamentall, or necessary to salvation; and for that very cause you think to cleare your
selfe from Schisme, <hi>whose property,</hi> as you say, <hi>is to cut off from the</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Pag. 76.</note> 
                  <hi>Body of Christ and the
hope of Salvation, the Church from which it separates.</hi> Now that <hi>Luther</hi> and his fellowes were
born and baptized in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and that she was the Church out of which they departed,
is notoriously known: and therefore you cannot cut her off <hi>from the Body of Christ, and hope of
Salvation,</hi> unlesse you will acknowledge your selfe to deserve the just imputation of <hi>Schisme.</hi>
Neither can you deny her to be truly Catholique by reason of (pretended) corruptions, not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.
For your selfe avouch, and endeavour to prove, that the true Catholique Church may
erre in such points. Moreover, I hope you will not so much as goe about to prove, that when
<hi>Luther</hi> rose, there was any other true visible Church, <hi>disagreeing</hi> from the <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>agreeing</hi>
with Protestants in their particular doctrines: and you cannot deny but that England in those
daies agreed with <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Nations with England: And therefore either Christ had no
visible Church upon Earth, or else you must grant that it was the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> A truth so
manifest, that those Protestants who affirme the Roman Church to have lost the nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a true Church, doe by inevitable consequence grant, that for divers ages Christ had no visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church on earth: from which error, because <hi>D. Potter</hi> disclaimeth, he must of necessity
maintaine, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is free from fundamentall, and damnable error, and that <hi>she
is not cut off from the Body of Christ, and the Hope of Salvation: And if</hi> (saith he) <hi>any Zelots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

                  <note n="h" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>to heavier censures, their zeale may be excused, but their Charity
and wisdome cannot be justified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48 And to touch particulars which perhaps some may object. No man is ignorant that the
Grecians, even the Schismaticall Grecians, doe in most points agree with <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques,
and disagree from the Protestant Reformation. They teach Transubstantiation (which point <hi>D.
Potter</hi> also<note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 225.</note> confesseth;) Invocation of Saints and Angels; veneration of Reliques, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;

All the seaven Sacraments; Prayer, Sacrifice, Almes for the dead; Monachisme; That Priests

Catholique Writer, hath published a large Volume, the Argument and Title whereof is: <hi>Of
the agreement of the Roman, and Greek Church in the seven Sacraments.</hi> As for the Heresy of the
Grecians, that the Holy Ghost proceeds not from the Some, I suppose that Protestants dissvow
them in that error, as we doe.</p>
               <p>49 <hi>D. Potter</hi> will not (I think) so much wrong his reputation, as to tell us, that the
<hi>Waldenses, Wiccliffe, Husse,</hi> or the like were Protestants, because in some things they disagreed
from Catholiques. For he well knowes that the example of such men is subject to these manifest
exceptions, They were not of all Ages, not in all Countries, But confined to certain places, and
were interrupted in Time, against the notion and nature of the word <hi>Catholique.</hi> They had no
Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy, nor Succession of Bishops, Priests, and Pastors. They differed among
themselues, and from Protestants also. They agreed in divers things with us against Protestants.
They held doctrines manifestly absurd and damnable heresies.</p>
               <p>50 The <hi>Waldenses</hi> began not before the year 1218, so farre were they from Vniversality of
all Ages. For their doctrine: first, they denied all Iudgements which extended to the drawing of
bloud, and the Sabbath, for which cause they were called In-sabbatists. Secondly, they taught
that Lay men, and women might consecrate the Sacrament, and preach (no doubt but by this
meanes to make their Master, <hi>Waldo,</hi> a meere lay man, capable of such functions.) Thirdly, that
Clergy men ought to have no possessions, or proprieties. Fourthly, that there should be no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Parishes, nor Churches, for a walled Church they reputed as a barne. Fiftly, that men
ought not to take an oath in any case. Sixtly, that those persons sinned mortally, who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
without hope of issue. Seaventhly, they held all things done above the girdle, by kissing,
touching, words, compression of the breasts, &amp;c. to be done in Charity, and not against Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.
Eightly, that neither Priest, nor civill Magistrate, being guilty of mortall sinne did enjoy
their dignity, or were to be obeyed. Ninthly, they condemned Princes, and Iudges. Tenthly,
they affirmed singing in the Church to be an hellish clamor. Eleaventhly, they taught that men
might dissemble their Religion, &amp; so accordingly they went to Catholique Churches, dissembling
their faith, and made Offertories, confessions, and communions after a dissembling manner.
<hi>Waldo</hi> was so <hi>unlearned,</hi> that (saith<note n="m" place="margin">Act. Mon. Pag. 628.</note> Fox) he gave rewards to certain learned men to translate
the holy Scripture for him, and being thus holpen did (as the same <hi>Fox</hi> there reporteth) <hi>confer

or Priest be in deadly sinne, he doth not indeed either giue Orders, Consecrate, or Baptize. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
That Ecclesiasticall Ministers ought not to haue any temporall possessions, nor propriety
in any thing, but should beg; and yet he himselfe brake into heresie because he had been deprived
by the Archbishop of Canterbury of a certain Benefice; as all Schismes, and heresies beginne upon
passion, which they seek to cover with the cloak of Reformation. Thirdly he condemned lawfull
Oathes, like the Anabaptists. Fourthly, he taught that all things came to passe by absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Fiftly, he defended human merits as the wicked <hi>Pelagians</hi> did, namely, as proceeding from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
forces, without the necessary help of God's grace. Sixtly, that no man is a Civill Magistrate,
while he is in mortall sinne; and that the people may at their pleasure correct Princes, when they
offend: by which doctrine he proues himselfe both an Heretique, and a Traytour.</p>
               <p>53 As for <hi>Husse,</hi> his chiefest Doctrines were: That Lay people must receive in <hi>both kinders</hi>
and, That Civill Lords, Prelates and Bishops loose all right, and authority, while they are in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
sinne, For other things he wholy agreed with Catholiques against Protestants; and the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi>
his followers being demanded, in what points they disagreed from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
propounded only these: <hi>The necessity of Communion under both kinds;</hi> That <hi>all Civill Dominion
was forbidden to the Clergy;</hi> That <hi>Preaching of the word, was free for all men,</hi> and in all <hi>places;</hi>
That <hi>open Crimes were in no wise to be permitted for avoiding of greater evill.</hi> By these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
it is apparant, that <hi>Husse</hi> agreed with Protestants against us, in one only point of <hi>both kindes,</hi>

indifferent: and the same is the opinion of some other Protestants. All which considered, it is
cleer that Protestants cannot challenge the <hi>Waldenses, Wickliffe,</hi> and <hi>Husse</hi> for members of their
Church: and although they could, yet that would advantage them little towards the finding out
a perpetuall visible Church of theirs; for the reasons aboue<note n="t" place="margin">Numb. 49.</note> specified.</p>
               <p>54 If D <hi>Potter</hi> would goe so farre off, as to fetch the <hi>Muscovites, Armenians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Georgians. Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians,</hi>

And it is most certaine that they have nothing to doe with the doctrine of the Protestants.</p>
               <p>55 It being therefore granted that Christ had a visible Church in all ages, and that there can
be none assigned but the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it followes that she is the true Cath. Church; and that
those pretended Corruptions for which they forsook her, are indeed divine truths, delivered by the
visible Catholique Church of Christ: And, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers departed from her, and
consequently are guilty of <hi>Schisme,</hi> by dividing themselves from the <hi>Communion of the Roman
Church.</hi> Which is cleerly convinced out of D. <hi>Potter</hi> himself, although the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were
but a particular Church. For he saith: <hi>Whosoever professes</hi>

                  <hi>himself to forsake the Communion
of any one member of the body of Christ, must confesse himself consequently to forsake the whole.</hi>
Since therefore in the same place he expressely acknowledges the <hi>Church of Rome to be a member
of the body of Christ,</hi> and that it is cleere they have forsaken her; it evidently followes, that they
haue forsaken the <hi>whole,</hi> and therefore are most properly <hi>Schismatiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>56 And lastly, since the crime of <hi>Schisme</hi> is so grievous, that according to the doctrine of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fathers rehearsed aboue, no multitude of good works, no morall honesty of life, no cruel death
endured even for the profession of some Article of faith can excuse any one who is guilty of that
sinne from damnation, I leaue it to be considered, whether it be not true Charity to speak as wee

               <head type="sub">The separation of Protestants from the Roman Church, being upon
iust and necessary causes, is not any way guilty of Schisme.</head>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>D</hi> § 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. In the seaven first Sections of
this Chapter, there be many things said and many
things supposed by you which are untrue, &amp; deserue
a censure. As,</p>
               <p>2 First, <hi>That Schisme could not be a Division from
the Church, or that a Division from the Church could not happen, unlesse
there alwaies had been and should be a visible Church.</hi> Which Assertion
is a manifest falshood; For although there never had been any Church
Visible or Invisible before this age, nor should be ever after, yet this
could not hinder, but that a Schisme might now be, and be a Division
from the present visible Church. As though in <hi>France</hi> there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had been untill now a lawfull Monarch, nor after him ever should
be, yet this hinders not, but that now there might be a Rebellion, and
that Rebellion might be an Insurrection against Soveraigne authority.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>That it is a point to be granted by all Christians, that in all ages there
hath been a visible Congregation of faithfull people.</hi> Which Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
howsoever you understand it, is not absolutely certain. But if you
mean by <hi>Faithfull,</hi> (as it is plain you doe) <hi>free from all errour in faith,</hi>
then you know all Protestants with one consent affirm it to bee false;
and therefore without proof to take it for granted is to beg the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>That supposing Luther and they which did first separate from the
Roman Church were guilty of Schisme, it is certainly consequent, that all
who persist in this division must be so likewise.</hi> Which is not so certaine
as you pretend. For they which alter without necessary cause the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
government of any state Civill or Ecclesiasticall, doe commit a
great fault; whereof notwithanding they may be innocent who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
this alteration, and to the utmost of their power oppose a change
though to the former state, when continuance of time hath once setled
the present. Thus haue I known some of your own Church, condemn
the Low-countrey men who first revolted from the King of Spain, of
the sin of Rebellion, yet absolve them from it who now being of your
Religion there, are yet faithfull maintainers of the common liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the pretences of the K. of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:7615:144"/>5 Fourthly, <hi>That all those which a Christian is to esteeme neighbours
doe concurre to make one company, which is the Church.</hi> Which is false;
for a Christian is to esteeme those his neighbours, who are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the true Church.</p>
               <p>6 Fiftly, <hi>That all the members of the Visible Church, are by charity
united into one Mysticall body.</hi> Which is manifestly untrue; for many
of them have no Charity.</p>
               <p>7 Sixtly, <hi>That the Catholique Church, signifies one company of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
people,</hi> which is repugnant to your own grounds. For you require,
not true faith, but only the Profession of it, to make men members of
the visible Church.</p>
               <p>8 Seaventhly, <hi>That every Heretique is a Schismatique.</hi> Which
you must acknowledge false in those, who though they deny, or doubt
of some point professed by your Church, and so are Heretiques; yet
continue still in the Communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>9 Eightly, <hi>That all the members of the Catholique Church, must of
necessity be united in externall Communion.</hi> Which though it were
much to be desired it were so, yet certainly cannot be perpetually true.
For a man unjustly excommunicated, is not in the Churches commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
yet he is still a member of the Church: and divers times it hath
happened, as in the case of <hi>Chrisostome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that particular
men, and particular Churches, have upon an overvalued difference, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
renounced Communion mutually, or one of them separated
from the other, and yet both have continued members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church. These things are in those <hi>seven Sections,</hi> either said or
supposed by you untruly, without all shewe, or pretence of proofe.
The rest is an impertinent common place, wherein Protestants and the
cause in hand, are absolutely unconcern'd. And therefore I passe to the
<hi>eighth Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 8. Wherein you obtrude upon us, a double Fallacie;
One, in supposing and taking for granted, that whatsoever is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by <hi>three Fathers,</hi> must be true; whereas your selves make no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of condemning many things of falsehood, which yet are maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by more then thrice three Fathers. Another, in pretending their
words to be spoken absolutely, which by them are limited and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to some particular cases. For whereas you say S. <hi>Austine.</hi> c. 62. l. 2.
<hi>cont. Parm.</hi> infers out of the former premises, <hi>That there is no necessity
to divide Vnity:</hi> to let passe your want of diligence, in quoting the 62.
chapter of that Booke, which hath but 23. in it: to passe by also, that
these words which are indeed in the 11. Chapt. are not inferred out
of any such premises as you pretend, this I say is evident, that he saies
not absolutely, that there never is, or can be any necessity to divide
Vnity (which only were for your purpose,) but only in such a speciall
cale, as he there sets down: That is, <hi>When good men tolerate bad men,
which can doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no spirituall hurt, to the intent they may not be sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from those, who are spiritually good: Then</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to divide Vnity.</hi> Which very words doe cleerely give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that it may fall out (as it doth in our case,) that we cannot keep
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7615:145"/>
Vnity with bad men, without spirituall hurt, <hi>i. e.</hi> without partaking
with them in their impieties, and that then there is a necessity to divide
Unity from them: I mean, to break off conjunction with them in their
impieties. Which that it was <hi>S. Austines</hi> mind, it is most evident out
of the 21. c. of the same book: where to <hi>Parmenian</hi> demanding, <hi>how
can a man remain pure, being joyned with those that are corrupted?</hi> He
answers, <hi>Very true, this is not possible, if he be ioyned with them, that
is, if he commit any evill with them, or favour them which doe commit
it. But if he doe neither of these, he is not ioyned with them.</hi> And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after, <hi>these two things retained, will keep such men pure and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
that is, neither doing ill, nor approving it.</hi> And therefore seeing
you impose upon all men of your Communion, a necessity of <hi>doing</hi> or
at least <hi>approving</hi> many things unlawfull, certainly there lies upon us
an unavoidable necessity of dividing unity, either with you, or with
God; and whether of these is rather to be done, be ye judges.</p>
               <p>11 <hi>Irenaeus</hi> also saies not simply (which only would doe you ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,)
there cannot possibly be any so important Reformation, as to
justify a separation from them who will not reforme: But only,
<hi>they cannot make any corruption so great, as is the pernitiousnesse of a
Schisme:</hi> Now, <hi>They,</hi> here, is a relative, and hath an antecedent expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> which if you had been pleased to take notice of, you
would easily have seene, that what <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saies, falls heavy upon the
Church of Rome, but toucheth Protestants nothing at all. For the
men he speaks of, are such as <hi>Propter modicas &amp; quaslibet causas, for
trifling or small causes, divide the body of Christ; such as speak of peace
and make warre; such as straine at gnatts, &amp; swallow Camels. And these</hi>
faith he, <hi>can make no reformation of any such importance, as to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
the danger of a division.</hi> Now seeing the causes of our separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Church of Rome, are (as we pretend, and are ready to
justify,) because we will not be partakers with her in Superstition, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
Impiety, and most cruell Tyranny, both upon the bodies
and soules of men. Who can say, that the causes of our separation,
may be justly esteemed <hi>Modicae &amp; quaelibet causae?</hi> On the other side,
seeing the Bishop of Rome, who was contemporary to <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> did
as much (as in him lay) cut off from the Churches unity, many great
Churches, for not conforming to him in an indifferent matter, upon a
difference, <hi>Non de Catholico dogm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not about any Catholique doctrine, but only a Ceremony, or rather
about the time of observing it;</hi> so <hi>Petavius</hi> values it: which was just all
one, as if the Church of France should excommunicate those of their
own Religion in England, for not keeping Christmas upon the same
day with them:<note place="margin">Eusch. hist. l. 5 c. 24.</note> And seeing he was reprehended sharpely and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for it, by most of the Bishops of the world, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies, and
(as Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> though mincing the matter,<note place="margin">Perron. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plic. 3. l. 2. c.</note> yet confesseth) by
this very <hi>Ierenaeus</hi> himselfe in particular admonished, that for so small
a cause (<hi>propter tam modicam causam,</hi>) he should not have cut off so
many Provinces from the body of the Church: and lastly, seeing the
Ecclesiasticall story of those times, mentions no other notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7615:145"/>
of any such Schismaticall presumption, but this of <hi>Victor:</hi> certainly
we have great inducement to imagine, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in this place by you
quoted, had a speciall aime at the Bishop and Church of Rome. Once,
this I am sure of, that the place fits him, and many of his successors, as
well as if it had been made purposely for them. And this also, that he
which finds fault with them <hi>who separate upon small causes,</hi> implies
cleerely, that he conceived, there might be such causes as were great
and sufficient: And that then a Reformation was to be made, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any danger of division that might insue upon it.</p>
               <p>12 Lastly, S. <hi>Denis</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> saies indeed and very well,
<hi>that all things should be rather indured, then we should consent to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of the Church:</hi> I would adde, Rather then consent to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of the division, if it might be remedied. But then, I am to tell
you, that he saies not All things should rather <hi>be done,</hi> but only, All
things should rather <hi>be indured or suffered:</hi> wherein he speaks not of
the evill of sinne, but of Pain and Misery: Not of tolerating either
Error or Sinne in others (though that may be lawfull,) much lesse of
joyning with others for quietnesse sake, (which only were to your
purpose) in the profession of Errour and practise of sinne: but of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
any affliction, nay even martyrdome in our own persons, rather
then consent to the division of the Church. <hi>Omnia incommoda,</hi> so
your own <hi>Christophorson,</hi> enforced by the circumstances of the place,
translates <hi>Dionysius</hi> his words, All <hi>miseries should rather be endured,
then we should consent to the Churches division.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 9. In the next Paragraph you affirme two things, but
prove neither, unlesse a vehement Asseveration, may passe for a weake
proofe. You tell us first, <hi>that the Doctrine of the totall deficiency of
the visible Church, which is maintained by divers chiefe Protestants, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
in it vast absurdity, or rather sacrilegious Blasphemy.</hi> But neither
doe the Protestants alleaged by you, maintain the deficiency of the
Visible Church, but only of the Churches visibility, or of the Church
as it is Visible, which so acute a man as you, now that you are minded
of it, I hope will easily distinguish: Neither doe they hold, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church hath failed totally and from its essence, but only from its
purity: and that it fell into many corruptions, but yet not to nothing.
And yet if they had held, that there was not only no pure visible
Church, but none at all: surely they had said more then they could ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify,
but yet you doe not shew, neither can I discover any such <hi>Vast
absurdity or Sacrilegious Blasphemy</hi> in this Assertion. You say second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the <hi>Reason which cast them upon this wicked Doctrine, was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
voluntary necessity, because they were resolved not to acknowledge
the Roman to be the true Church, and were convinced by all manner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that for diverse ages before Luther there was no other.</hi> But this
is not to dispute but to divine, and take upon you the property of
God which is to know the hearts of men. For why I pray, might not
the Reason hereof rather be, because they were convinced by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of evidence, as Scripture, Reason, Antiquity, that all the visible
Churches in the world, but aboue all the Roman, had degenerated
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7615:146"/>
from the purity of the Gospell of Christ, and thereupon did conclude
there was no visible Church, meaning by <hi>no Church, none free from
corruption,</hi> and conformable in all things to the doctrine of Christ.</p>
               <p>14 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 10. Neither is there any repugnance (but in words only)
between these (as you are pleased to stile them) <hi>exterminating Spirits,</hi>
and those other, whom out of Curtesy you intitle, in your 10. §. <hi>more
moderate Protestants.</hi> For these affirming the Perpetuall Visibility of
the Church, yet neither deny, nor doubt of her being subject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
and grievous corruptions, and those of such a nature, as were
they not mitigated by invincible, or at least a very probable ignorance,
none subject to them could be saved. And they on the other side, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Churches Visibility, yet plainly affirme, that they conceive
very good hope of the Salvation of many, of their ignorant and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Fore-fathers. Thus declaring plainly, though in words they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the Visibility of the true Church, yet their meaning was not to
deny the perpetuity, but the perpetuall purity and incorruption of the
Visible Church.</p>
               <p>15 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 11. Let us proceed therefore to your 11. Sect. where
though <hi>D. Potter</hi> and other Protestants granting the Churches perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Visibility, make it needlesse for you to prove it, yet you will
needs be doing that which is needlesse. But you doe it so coldly and
negligently, that it is very happy for you, that <hi>D. Potter</hi> did grant it.</p>
               <p>16 For <hi>what if the Prophets spake more obscurely of Christ, then of
the Church? What if they had foreseen, that greater contentions would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
about the Church then Christ?</hi> Which yet, he that is not a meere
stranger in the story of the Church, must needs know to be untrue, and
therefore not to be fore-seene by the Prophets. What <hi>if we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
received the Church from the Scriptures?</hi> Does it follow from
any, or all these things, that the Church of Christ must be alwaies Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible?</p>
               <p>17 Besides, what Protestant ever granted (that which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
upon so confidently,) that <hi>every man for all the affaires of his soule
must have recourse to some congregation?</hi> If some one Christian lived
alone among Pagans in some country, remote from Christendome,
shall we conceive it impossible for this man to be saved, because he
cannot have recourse to any congregation, for the affaires of his soule?
Will it not be sufficient, for such a ones Salvation, to know the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ, and live according to it? Such fancies as these, you
doe very wisely to take for granted, because you know well, tis hard
to prove them.</p>
               <p>18 Let it <hi>be as unlawfull as you please, to deny and dissemble matters
of faith. Let them that doe so, not be a Church, but a damned Crew of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants:</hi>
What is this to the Visibility of the Church? May not the
Church be Invisible, and yet these that are of it professe their faith?
No, say you: Their profession will make them visible. Very true, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in the places where, and in the times when they live, and to those
persons, unto whom they have necessary occasion, to make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
But not visible to all, or any great, or considerable part of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7615:146"/>
world while they live, much lesse conspicuous to all Ages after them.
Now it is a Church thus illustriously and conspicuously visible that
you require: by whose splendour, all men may be directed &amp; drawn to
repaire to her, for the affaires of their soules: Neither is it the Visibility
of the Church absolutely, but this degree of it, which the most rigid
Protestants deny: which is plaine enough out of the places of <hi>Napper,</hi>
cited by you in your 9. Part. of this chapt. Where his words are, <hi>God
hath withdrawne his visible Church from open Assemblies, to the hearts
of particular godly men.</hi> And this Church which had not open Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
he calls <hi>The latent and Invisible Church.</hi> Now I hope Papists in
England will be very apt to grant, men may be so farre Latent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
as not to professe their faith in open Assemblies, nor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
it to all the world, &amp; yet not deny, nor dissemble it; nor deserve
to be esteemed a <hi>damned crew of dissembling Sycophants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19 But <hi>preaching of the word, and administration of the Sacraments,
cannot but make a Church visible: and these are inseparable notes of the
Church.</hi> I answer, they are so far inseparable, that wheresoever they are,
there a Church is: But not so, but that in some cases there may bee a
Church, where these notes are not. Againe, these notes will make the
Church visible: But to whom? certainly not to all men, nor to most me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
But to them only to whom the word is preached, and the Sacraments
are administred. They make the Church visible to whom themselves
are visible, but not to others. As where your Sacraments are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
and your doctrine preached, it is visible, that there is a Popish
Church. But this may perhaps be visible to them only, who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at these performances, and to others as secret, as if they had never
beene performed.</p>
               <p>20 But <hi>S. Austine saith, it is an impudent, abominable, detestable
speech, and so forth, to say the Church hath perished.</hi> I answer; 1. All
that <hi>S. Austine</hi> sayes, is not true. 2. Though this were true, it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to your purpose, unlesse you will conceive it all one not to be, &amp;
not to be conspicuously visible. 3. This very speech that the Church
perished, might be false and impudent in the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and yet not so
in the Protestants. For there is no incongruity, that what hath lived
500. yeares, may perish in 1600. But <hi>S. Austin denyed not only the Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
perishing,</hi> but <hi>the possibility of it: and not only of it's falling</hi> to nothing,
<hi>but of it's falling into corruption.</hi> I answer: though no such thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
out of those places, yet I believe heare of disputation against
the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and a desire to over-confute them, transported him so
farre, as to urge against them more then was necessary, and perhaps
more then was true. But were he now revived, &amp; did but confront the
doctrine of after-ages, with that, his owne experience would enforce
him to change his opinion. As concerning the last speech of <hi>S. Austine,</hi>
I cannot but wonder very much, why he should thinke it absurd for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to say, <hi>There are sheepe which he knowes not, but God knowes:</hi> and
no lesse at you, for obtruding this sentence upon us as pertinent proofe
of the Churches visibility.</p>
               <p>21 Neither doe I see, <hi>how the Truth of any present Church depends
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7615:147"/>
the Perpetuall Visibility, nay nor upon the perpetuity</hi> of that which is
past or future. For what sense is there, that it should not be in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God Almighty, to restore to a flourishing estate, a Church which
oppression hath made Invisible? to repaire that which is ruined; to
reforme that which was corrupted, or to reviue that which was dead?
Nay what Reason is there, but that by ordinary meanes this may be
done, so long as the Scriptures by Divine Providence are preserved
in their integrity and Authority? As a Common-wealth though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so farre collapsed and overrunne with disorders, is yet in possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of being reduc'd unto its Originall state, so long as the Ancient
Lawes, and Fundamentall Constitutions are extant, and remain invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate,
from whence men may be directed how to make such a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
<hi>But S. Austine urges this uery Argument against the Donatists,
and therefore it is good.</hi> I answer, that I doubt much of the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and my Reason is, because you your selves acknowledge, that
even generall Councels (and therefore much more particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors)
though infallible in their determinations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are yet in their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Arguments, where upon they ground them, subject to like
Passions and Errours with other men.</p>
               <p>22 Lastly, whereas you say, <hi>That all Divines define Schisme a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
from the true Church,</hi> and from thence collect, That <hi>there must
be a known Church from which it is possible for men to depart:</hi> I might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
justly question your Antecedent, and desire you to consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Schisme be not rather, or at least be not as well a division of the
Church, as from it? A separation not of a part from the whole, but of
some parts from the other. And if you liked not this definition, I might
desire you to inform me in those many Schismes, which haue hapned
in the Church of Rome, which of the parts was the Church, &amp; which
was divided from it. But to let this passe, certainly your consequence
is most unreasonable. For though whensoever there is a Schisme, it
must necessarily suppose a Church existent there, yet sure wee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
a Schisme, that is, declare what the word signifies (for Defining is
no more) though at this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there were neither Schisme nor Church
in the world. Vnlesse you will say, that we cannot tell what a Rose is,
or what the word Rose signifies, but only in the Summer when wee
haue Roses: or that in the world to come, when men shall not marry,
it is impossible to know, what it is to marry: or that the Plague is not a
disease, but only when some body is infected: or that Adultery is not a
sin, unlesse there be Adulterers: or that before <hi>Adam</hi> had a Child, hee
knew not, &amp; God could not haue told him, what it was to be a Father.
Certainly S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, you haue forgot your Metaphysicks, which you so much
glory in, if you know not, that the connexions of essentiall predicates
with their subjects, are eternall, &amp; depend not at all upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the actuall exis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the thing defined. This Definition therefore of Schisme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not the existence of a Church, even when it is defined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much lesse
the perpetuall continuance of it, and least of all the continuance of it in
perpetuall visibility and purity, which is the only thing that we deny, &amp;
you are to proue. By this time, you perceive I hope, that I had reason
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7615:147"/>
to say, that it was well for you, that D. <hi>Potter</hi> granted the Churches
Perpetuall Visibility: for, for ought I can perceive, this Concession of
his, is the best stake in your hedge, the best piller upon which this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
stands; which yet is the only ground-work of your whole Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation.</p>
               <p>23 <hi>Ad</hi> § 12. 47. 48. 49. 50. 51. 52. 53. 54. 55. The remainder of
this Chapter, to convince <hi>Luther</hi> and all that follow him to be Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques,
affords us Arguments of two sorts: The first drawn from
the nature of the thing: the second from D. <hi>Potters</hi> words &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments.
So that the former if they be good, must bee good against
all Protestants: the latter only against D. <hi>Potter.</hi> I will examine them
all, &amp; doubt not to make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> appeare even to your selfe, if you haue any
indifference, that there is not any sound &amp; concluding reason amongst
them, but that they are all poore and miserable Sophismes.</p>
               <p>24 First then to proue us Schismatiques, you urge from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Schisme this only Argument.</p>
               <p>Whosoever leaue the externall Communion of the visible Church,
are Schismatiques: But Luther and his followers left the externall
Communion of the visible Church of Christ: Therefore they are
Schismatiques.</p>
               <p>The Major of this Syllogisme you leaue naked without proofe;
and conceiue it, as it should seem, able enough to shift for it selfe. The
Minor or second Proposition of this Argument, you prove by two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The first is this.</p>
               <p>They which forsook the externall Communion of all visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
must needs forsake the externall Communion of the true visible
Church of Christ: But Luther and his followers forsook the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Communion of all visible Churches: Therefore they forsook the
externall Communion of the true visible Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> of this Syllogisme you take for granted (as you haue
reason:) The <hi>Minor</hi> you prosecute with great pomp of words, &amp; proue
with plenty of Reasons, built upon the Confessions of D. <hi>Potter, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Calvin,</hi> and other Protestants; and this you doe in the 12 § of
this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The second Argument to prove the Assumption of your first Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme,
stands thus.</p>
               <p>The Roman Church, when Luther and his followers made the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
was the true visible Church of Christ: But Luther and his
followers forsook the externall Communion of the Roman Church:
Therefore they forsook the externall Communion of the true visible
Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>The Assumption of this Syllogisme needs no proof: The Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which needs it very much, you endeavour to confirme by these
Reasons.</p>
               <p>1 The Roman Church had the notes of the Church assigned by
Protestants, 1. The true preaching of the Word, and due administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sacraments: Therefore she was the true Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Antecedent is proved:</hi> Because D. Potter confesses shee wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7615:148"/>
Fundamentall or necessary to salvation: Therefore for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the matter she had these notes.</p>
               <p>2 Either the Roman Church was the true visible Church, or
Protestants can name and proue some other disagreeing from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and agreeing with Protestants, in their particular Doctrine: or
else they must say, there was no visible Church: But they will not say
there was no Church: They cannot name and proue any other disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
from the Roman, and agreeing with Protestants in their
particular Doctrines; because this cannot be the Greek Church, nor
that of the Waldenses, Wicklifites, Hussites, nor that of the Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
Armenians, Georgians, Aethiopians, which you confirme by
severall Arguments: Therefore they must grant, that the Roman
Church was the true visible Church.</p>
               <p>And this is the businesse of your 47. 48. 49. 50. 51, 52. 53. 54. and 55.
Sections of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>25 Now to all this, I answer very briefly thus: That you have
played the unwise builder, and erected a stately structure upon a false
foundation. For whereas you take for granted as an undoubted Truth,
<hi>That whosoever leave the externall communion of the visible Church, are
Schismaticall,</hi> I tell you Sir, you presume too much upon us, and
would have us grant, that which is the main point in Question. For
either you suppose the externall Communion of the Church corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that there was a necessity for them, that would communicate
with this Church, to communicate in her corruptions: Or you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
her Communion uncorrupted. If the former, and yet will take
for granted, that all are Schismatiques, that leave her Communion
though it bee corrupted, you beg the Question in your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
If the latter, you beg the Question in your supposition, for
Protestants, you know, are Peremptory and Vnanimous in the Deniall
of both these things: Both that the Communion of the Visible
Church, was then uncorrupted; And that they are truly Schismatiques,
who leave the Communion of the Visible Church, if corrupted; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if the case be so (and <hi>Luthers</hi> was so) that they must either leave
her Communion, or of necessity Communicate with her in her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
You will say perhaps, <hi>that you have already proved it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that the Church, or her Communion should be corrupted.</hi> And
therefore that they are Schismatiques, who leave the externall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Visible Church, because she cannot be corrupted. And
that <hi>hereafter you will prove, that corruptions in the Churches communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though the belief and profession of them be made the condition of her
communion, cannot justify a separation from it:</hi> And therefore that they
are Schismatiques, who leave the Churches communion though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
I Answer, that I have examined your proofes of the former, &amp;
found that a veine of Sophistry runs cleane through them: And for
the latter, it is so plain and palpable a falsehood, that I cannot but be
confident, whatsoever you bring in proofe of it, will like the Apples
of Sodom, fall to Ashes upon the first touch. And this is my first and
main exception against your former discourse: that accusing Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7615:148"/>
of a very great and horrible crime, you have proved your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
only with a fallacy.</p>
               <p>26 Another is, that although it were granted Schisme, to leave
the externall Communion of the visible Church in what state or case
so ever it be, and that <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; his followers were Schismatiques, for
leaving the externall Communion of all visible Churches: yet you
faile exceedingly of cleering the other necessary point undertaken by
you, <hi>That the Roman Church was then the Visible Church.</hi> For neither
doe <hi>Protestants</hi> (as you mistake) <hi>make the true preaching of the word, and
due administration of the Sacraments, the notes of the visible Church,</hi> but
only of a visible Church: now these you know are very different
things, the former signifying <hi>the Church Catholique,</hi> or the whole
Church: the Latter a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> or a part of the Catholique.
And therefore suppose out of curtesy, we should grant, what by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
you can never evince, that your Church had these notes, yet
would it by no meanes follow, that your Church were <hi>the Visible
Church,</hi> but only <hi>a Visible Church:</hi> not the whole Catholique, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a part of it. But then besides, where doth <hi>D. Potter</hi> acknowledge
any such matter as you pretend? Where doth he say, that you had for
the substance <hi>the true Preaching of the word,</hi> or <hi>due Administration of
the Sacraments?</hi> Or where does he say, that (from which you collect
this) <hi>you wanted nothing Fundamentall, or necessary to Salvation?</hi> He
saies indeed, that though your <hi>Errors were in themselves damnable,
and full of great impiety, yet he hopes, that those amongst you, who were
invincibly ignorant of the truth, might by Gods great mercy, have their
errors pardoned, and their soules saved:</hi> And this is all he saies, and
this you confesse to be all he saies,<note place="margin">See c. 1. §. 3.</note> in diverse places of your book:
which is no more, then you your selfe doe, and must affirme of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants:
and yet I believe, you will not suffer us to inferre from hence,
that you grant Protestants to have, for the substance, the true preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word, and due administration of the Sacraments, and want
nothing fundamentall, or necessary to salvation. And if we should
draw this consequence from your concession, certainly we should doe
you injury, in regard many things may in themselves, and in ordinary
course be necessary to salvation, to those that have meanes to attain
them, as your Church generally hath: which yet, by accident, to these
which were by some impregnable impediment, debarred of these
meanes, may by Gods mercy be made unnecessary.</p>
               <p>27 Lastly, whereas <hi>you say, that Protestants must either grant that
your Church then was the visible Church, or name some other, disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from yours &amp; agreeing with Protestants in their particular doctrine,
or acknowledge there was no visible Church.</hi> It is all one as if (to use <hi>S.
Pauls</hi> similitude) the head should say to the foot, either you must grant
that I am the whole body, or name some other member that is so, or
confesse that there is no body. To which the foot might answer; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
there is a body: and yet, that no member beside you is this
body: nor yet that you are it, but only a part of it. And in like manner
say we. We acknowledge a Church there was, corrupted indeed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7615:149"/>
but yet such a one as we hope by Gods gratious acceptance,
was still a Church. We pretend not to name any one Society that was
this Church, and yet we see no reason, that can inforce us to confesse
that yours was the Church, but only a part of it, and that one of the
worst then extant in the World. In vain therefore have you troubled
your selfe in proving, that we <hi>cannot pretend, that either the Greekes,
Waldenses, Wickliffites, Hussites, Muscovites, Armenians, Georgians,
Abyssines, were then the Visible Church.</hi> For all this dicourse proceeds
from a false and vain supposition, and beggs another point in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between us, which is, that <hi>some Church of one denomination and one
Communion</hi> (as the Roman, the Greeke &amp;c.) <hi>must be alwaies,</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
to all other Communions, <hi>the whole visible Church.</hi> And
though perhaps some weak Protestant having this false principle
setled in him, that there was to be alwaies some Visible Church of
one denomination, pure from all error in doctrine, might be wrought
upon, and prevailed with by it, to forsake the Church of Protestants:
yet why it should induce him to goe to yours, rather then the Greeke
Church, or any other, which pretends to perpetuall succession as well
as yours, that I doe not understand; Vnlesse it be for the reason which
<hi>Aeneas Syluius</hi> gave, why more held the Pope above a Councell, then
a Councell above the Pope: which was because <hi>Popes did give Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
and Archbishopricks, but Councells gave none,</hi> and therefore su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Forma Pauperis,</hi> were not like to have their cause very well
maintained. For put the case, I should grant of meere favour, that
there must be alwaies some Church of one Denomination and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
free from all errors in doctrine, and that Protestants had not
alwaies such a Church: it would follow indeed from thence, that I
must not be a Protestant: But that I must be a Papist, certainly it
would follow by no better consequence then this; If you will leave
England, you must of necessity goe to Rome. And yet with this
wretched fallacy, have I been sometimes abused my selfe, and known
many other poore soules seduced, not only from their own Church,
and Religion, but unto yours. I beseech God to open the eyes of all
that love the truth, that they may not alwaies be held captive, under
such miserable delusions.</p>
               <p>28 We see then, how unsuccessefull you have been in making
good your accusation, with reasons drawn from the nature of the
thing, and which may be urged in common against all Protestants.
Let us come now to the Arguments of the other kinde, which you
build upon <hi>D. Potters</hi> own words, out of which you promise unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
reasons to convince Protestants of Schisme.</p>
               <p>29 But let the understanding Reader, take with him but three or
foure short remembrances, and I dare say he shall find them upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
not only answerable, but already answered. The memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums
I would commend to him, are these.</p>
               <p>30 That not every separation, but only a causelesse separation
from the externall Communion of any Church, is the Sinne of
Schisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:7615:149"/>31 That imposing upon men under pain of Excommunication a
necessity of professing known errours, and practising known corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is a sufficient and necessary cause of separation: and that this is
the cause which Protestants alleage to justifie their separation from
the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>32 That to leave the Church, and to leave the externall Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a Church, at least as D. <hi>Potter</hi> understands the words, is not the
same thing: That being done by ceasing to be a member of it, by ceasing
to haue those requisites which constitute a man a member of it, as faith
and obedience: This by refusing to communicate with any Church in
her Liturgies and publike worship of God. This little Armour if it be
rightly placed, I am perswaded, will repell all those Batteries which
you threaten shall be so furious.</p>
               <p>33 <hi>Ad</hi> § 13. 14. 15. The first is a sentence of S. <hi>Austine</hi> against
<hi>Donatus,</hi> applied to <hi>Luther</hi> thus. <hi>If the Church perished, what Church
brought forth Donatus, (you say Luther?) If she could not perish, what
madnesse moved the sect of Donatus to separate, upon pretence to avoid
the Communion of bad men?</hi> Whereunto, one faire answer (to let passe
many others) is obvious out of the second observation: That this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
though it were Gospell, as it is not, is impertinently applied to
<hi>Luther</hi> and Lutherans. Whose pretence of separation (be it true or be
it false,) was not (as that of the Donatists,) only to avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of bad men: but to free themselves from a necessity (which
but by separating was unavoidable,) of joyning with bad men in their
impieties. And your not substituting <hi>Luther</hi> in stead of <hi>Donatus</hi> in the
latter part of the Dilemma as well as in the former, would make a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious
man conjecture that you your selfe took notice of this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of disparitie between <hi>Donatus</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>34 <hi>Ad</hi> § 16. Your second onset drives only at those Protestants,
who <hi>hold the true Church was invisible for many ages.</hi> Which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(if by the <hi>true Church</hi> be understood, the <hi>pure Church,</hi> as you
doe understand it) is a certain truth, and it is easier for you to declaime
(as you doe) then to dispute against it. But <hi>these men you say must bee
Heretiques because they separated from the Communion of the visible
Church: and therefore also from the Communion of that which they say
was invisible: In as much as the invisible Church communicated with
the visible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35 Ans. I might very justly desire some proofe of that which so
confidently you take for granted: That, there were no persecuted and
oppressed maintainers of the Truth in the daies of our Fore-fathers,
but only such as dissembled their opinions, &amp; lived in your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
And truly if I should say there were many of this condition, I
suppose I could make my Affirmative much more probable, then you
can make your Negatiue. We read in Scripture, that <hi>Elias</hi> conceived
<hi>There was none left besides himselfe in the whole kingdome of Israell,</hi>
who had not revolted from God: and yet God himselfe assures us that
he was deceived. And if such a man, a Prophet, and one of the greatest,
erred in his judgement touching his own time, and his own countrey,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7615:150"/>
why may not you, who are certainly but a man, and subject to the
same passions as <hi>Elias</hi> was, mistake in thinking, that in former ages, in
some countrey or other, there were not alwaies some good Christians,
which did not so much as externally bow their knees to your <hi>Baal?</hi>
But this answer I am content you shall take no notice of, and thinke it
sufficient to tell you, that if it bee true, that this supposed invisible
Church did hypocritically communicate with the visible Church, in
her corruptions, then Protestants had cause, nay necessity, to forsake
their Communion also, for otherwise they must haue joyn'd with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the practise of impieties: and seeing they had such cause to separate,
they presume their separation cannot be schismaticall.</p>
               <p>36 Yes, you reply, <hi>to forsake the externall Communion of them
with whom they agree in faith, is the most formall &amp; proper sin of Schisme.</hi>
Ans. Very true, but I would fain know <hi>wherein.</hi> I would gladly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
whether I bee bound for feare of Schisme, to communicate
with those that believe as I doe, only in lawfull things, or absolutely in
every thing: whether I am to joyn with them in superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and not only in a common profession of the faith wherein we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
but in a common dissimulation or abjuration of it. This is that
which you would haue them do, or else, forsooth, they must be Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques.
But hereafter I pray remember, that there is no necessity of
communicating even with true Beleevers in wicked actions. Nay, that
there is a necessity herein to separate from them. And then I dare say,
even you being their judge, the reasonablenesse of their cause to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
shall, according to my first observation, justifie their separation
from being schismaticall.</p>
               <p>37 <hi>Arg:</hi> But the property of Schisme according to D. <hi>Potter</hi> is to cut
off from the hope of salvation, the Church from which it separates: And
these Protestants haue this property, Therefore they are Schismatiques.</p>
               <p>38 Ans. I deny the Syllogisme, it is no better then this:
<q>
                     <l>One Symptome of the Plague is a Feaver,</l>
                     <l>But such a man hath a Feaver,</l>
                     <l>Therefore he hath the Plague.</l>
                  </q>
The true conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which issues out of these Premisses, should be this.
Therefore he hath one Symptome of the plague. And so likewise in
the former, therefore they haue one property or one quality of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques.
And as in the former instance, The man that hath one signe
of the plague, may by reason of the absence of other requisites, not
haue the plague: So these Protestants may haue something of Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
and yet not be Schismatiques. A Tyrant sentencing a man to
death for his pleasure, and a just judge that condemnes a malefactor,
doe both sentence a man to death, and so for the matter doe both the
same thing: yet the one does wickedly, the other justly. What's the
reason? because the one hath cause, the other hath not. In like manner
Schismatiques, either alwaies or generally denounce damnation to
them from whom they separate. The same doe these Protestants, &amp;
yet are not Schismatiques. The Reason: because Schismatiques doe
it, and doe it without cause, and Protestants haue cause for what they
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7615:150"/>
doe. The impieties of your Church, being, generally speaking, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
unlesse where they are excus'd by ignorance, and expiated at
least by a generall repentance. In fine, though perhaps it may be true,
that all Schismatiques doe so: yet universall affirmatiues are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and therefore it followes not by any good Logick, that all
that doe so, when there is just cause for it, must be Schismatiques. The
cause in this matter of separation is all in all, and that for ought I see,
you never think of. But <hi>if these rigid Protestants haue iust cause to cut
off your Church from the hope of salvation: How can the milder sort allow
hope of salvation to the Members of this Church?</hi> Ans. Distinguish the
quality of the Persons censur'd, and this seeming repugance of their
censures will vanish into nothing. For your Church may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
either in regard of those, in whom, either negligence, or pride, or
worldly feare, or hopes, or some other voluntary sinne, is the cause of
their ignorance, which I feare is the case of the generality of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you: or in regard of those who owe their Errours from Truth,
to want of capacity, or default of instruction; either in respect of those
that might know the truth and will not, or of those who would know
the truth but (all things considered) cannot: In respect of those that
haue eyes to see, and will not see, or those that would gladly see, but
want eyes, or light. Consider the former sort of men, (which your
more rigid censurers seem especially to reflect upon,) and the heaviest
sentence will not be too heavy. Consider the latter, and the mildest
will not be too milde. So that here is no difference but in words only,
neither are you flattered by the one; nor uncharitably censur'd by the
other.</p>
               <p>39 <hi>Your next blow is directed against the milder sort of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
who you say involve themselves in the sinne of Schisme by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
with those (as you call them) exterminating Spirits, whom you
conceiue your selfe to have proved Schismatiques: <hi>And now load them
further with the crime of Heresie. For, say you,</hi> if you held your selves
obliged under pain of damnation, to forsake the Communion of the Roman
Church by reason of her Errours, which yet you confesse were not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall:
shall it not be much more damnable, to liue in confraternity with
these, who defend an Errour of the fayling of the Church, which in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists
you confesse to haue been properly Hereticall?</p>
               <p>40 Answ: You mistake in thinking that Protestants hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obliged not to communicate with you, onely or principally by
reason of your Errours and Corruption. For the true reason accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my third observation, is not so much because you <hi>maintaine</hi>
Errours and Corruptions, as because you <hi>impose</hi> them: and will allow
your Communion to none but to those that will hold them with you;
and haue so ordered your Communion, that either we must commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with you in these things, or nothing. And for this very reason,
though it were granted, that these Protestants held this doctrine which
you impute to them; And though this Errour were as damnable and
as much against the Creed as you pretend: Yet after all this, this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity
between you and them, might make it more lawfull for us to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7615:151"/>
communicate with them then you: because what they hold, they hold
to themselues, and refuse not (as you doe) to communicate with them
that hold the contrary.</p>
               <p>41 Thus we may answer your Argument, though both your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Suppositions were granted. But then for a second answer, I am to
tell you that there is no necessity of granting either of them. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe these Protestants hold the fayling of the Church from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but only from its visibility: which if you conceive all one, then
must you conceive that the starres fayle every day, and the Sunne every
night. Neither is it certain that the doctrine of the Churches fayling
is repugnant to the Creed. For as the truth of the Article of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes, depends not upon the actuall remission of any mans
sinnes, but upon Gods readinesse and resolution to forgive the sins of
all that believe and repent; so that, although unbeleef or impenitence
should be universall, and <hi>the Faithfull should</hi> absolutely <hi>fayle from the
children of men,</hi> and <hi>the sonne of man should finde no faith on the earth,</hi>
yet should the Article still continue true, that God would forgive the
sinnes of all that repent: In like manner, it is not certain that the truth
of the Article of the Catholique Church depends upon the actuall
existence of a Catholique Church, but rather upon the right, that the
Church of Christ, or rather (to speak properly) the Gospell of Christ
hath to be universally believed. And therefore the Article may bee
true, though there were no Church in the world. In regard, this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
it remaines still true that there ought to be a Church, &amp;
this Church ought to be Catholique. For as, of these two Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
There is a Church in <hi>America,</hi> and, There should bee a Church in
<hi>America,</hi> The truth of the latter depends not upon the truth of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
so neither does it in these two: There is a Church diffused all the
world over, and, There should be a Church diffused all the world
over.</p>
               <p>42 Thirdly, if you understand by Errours <hi>not fundamentall,</hi> such
as are <hi>not damnable,</hi> it is not true, as I haue often told you, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
your errours not fundamentall.</p>
               <p>43 Lastly, for your desire that I should here apply an authority of
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> alleaged in your next number, I would haue done so very
willingly, but indeed I know not how to doe it: for in my apprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it hath no more to doe with your present businesse of proving it
unlawfull, to communicate with these men, who hold the Church was
not alwaies visible, then <hi>In nova fert animus.</hi> Besides, I am here again
to remember you, that S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words, were they never so pertinent
yet are by neither of the parts litigant esteemed any <hi>rule of faith.</hi> And
therefore the urging of them and such like authorities, serves onely to
make Books great, and Controversies endlesse.</p>
               <p>44 Ad § 17. <hi>The next Section in three long leaues delivers us this
short sense.</hi> That those Protestants which say they have not left the
Churches externall Communion, but only her corruptions pretend to doe
that which is impossible. Because these corruptions were inherent in the
Churches externall Communion: and therefore he that forsakes them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but forsake this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:7615:151"/>
45 Ans. But who are they that pretend, they forsooke the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
corruptions, and not her externall communion? Some there be
that say, they have not left the Church, that is, not ceased to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church, but only left her corruptions: some, that they
have not left the communion, but the corruptions of it; meaning the
internall communion of it, and conjunction with it by faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
which disagree from the former only in the manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for he that is in the Church, is in this kinde of communion with
it: and he that is not in this internall communion, is not in the Church.
Some perhaps, that they left not your externall communion in all
things; meaning, that they left it not voluntarily being not <hi>fugitivi</hi> but
<hi>fugati,</hi> as being willing to joyne with you in any act of piety;<note place="margin">Casaubon. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ep. ad Card. Perron.</note> but were
by you necessitated and constrained to doe so, because you would not
suffer them to doe well with you, unlesse they would doe ill with you.
Now to doe ill that you may doe well, is against the will of God,
which to every good man is a high degree of necessity. But for such
Protestants, as pretend that <hi>de facto, they forsook your corruptions only
and not your externall communion,</hi> that is, such as pretend to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with you in your confessions and Liturgies, and participation
of Sacraments, I cannot but doubt very much, that neither you nor I
have ever met with any of this condition. And if perhaps you were
led into error, by thinking that to leave the Church, and to leave the
externall communion of it, was all one in sense &amp; signification, I hope
by this time you are disabus'd, and beginne to understand, that as a
man may leave any fashion or custome of a Colledge, and yet remain
still a member of the Colledge; so a man may possibly leave some opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
or practise of a Church formerly common to himselfe &amp; others,
and continue still a member of that Church: Provided that what he
forsakes be not one of those things wherein the essence of the Church
consists. Whereas peradventure this practise may be so involved with
the externall communion of this Church, that it may be simply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
for him to leave this practise, and not to leave the Churches
externall communion.</p>
               <p>46 <hi>You will reply perhaps,</hi> That the difficulty lies as well against
those who pretend to forsake the Churches corruptions &amp; not the Church:
as against those who say, they forsook the Churches corruptions, and not
her externall communion. And that the reason is still the same: because
these supposed corruptions, were inherent in the whole Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by like reason with the former, could not be forsaken, but if the whole
Church were forsaken.</p>
               <p>47 Ans. A pretty Sophisme, and very fit to perswade men that
it is impossible for them, to forsake any error they hold, or any vice
they are subject to, either peculiar to themselves, or in common with
others: Because forsooth, they cannot forsake themselves, and Vices
and Errors are things inherent in themselves. The deceit lies, in not
distinguishing between a Locall and a Morall forsaking of any thing.
For as it were an absurdity, fit for the maintainers of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to defend, that a man may Locally and properly depart from the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7615:152"/>
Accidents of a subject, and not from the subject it selfe: So is it also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
reason to deny, that a man may (by an usuall phrase of speech)
forsake any custome, or quality, good or bad, either proper to himself,
or common to himselfe with any company, and yet never truly or
properly forsake either his company or himselfe. Thus if all the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its
in the Society, were given to write Sophistically, yet you might
leave this ill custome, and yet not leave your Society. If all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of a City, were addicted to any vanity, they might either, all, or
some of them forsake it, and yet not forsake the city. If all the parts of
a mans body were dirty or filthy, nothing hinders but that all or
some of them might clense themselves, and yet continue parts of the
body. And what reason then in the world is there, if the whole Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church were overcome with tares and weeds of superstitions, and
corruptions, but that some members of it might reforme themselves,
and yet continue still true members of the body of the Church, and
not be made no members, but the better by their Reformation? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is so obvious &amp; sensible a Truth, that this thing is possible, that
no man in his wits, will be perswaded out of it, with all the Quirks and
Metaphysicks in the World. Neither is this to say, <hi>that a man may
keep company with Christopher Potter, and not keep company with the
Provost of Q. Colledge: Nor that a man can avoid the company of a sinner,
and at the same time, be really present with the man who is the sinner:</hi>
which we leave to those Protestants of your invention, who are so
foolish, as to pretend, that a man, may really separate himselfe from
the Churches externall communion, as she is corrupted, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that Churches externall Communion, which in this externall
Communion is corrupted. But we that say only the whole Church
being corrupted, some parts of it might and did reforme themselves,
and yet might and did continue parts of the Church, though separated
from the externall communion of the other parts, which would not
reforme, need not trouble our selves to reconcile any such repugnance.
For the case put by you, of keeping D. <hi>Potters</hi> company, and leaving
the company of the <hi>Provost of Queens Colledge;</hi> &amp; of leaving a sinners
company, and not the mans: are nothing at all like ours. But if you
would speak to the point, you must shew, that <hi>D. Potter</hi> cannot leave
being <hi>Provost of Q. Colledge,</hi> without ceasing to be himselfe: or, that a
sinner cannot leave his sinne, without ceasing to be a man: or that he
that is part of any society, cannot renounce any Vice of that society,
but he must relinquish the society. If you would shew any of these
things, then indeed (I dare promise) you should find us apt enough to
believe, that the particular parts of the visible Church, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
themselves, but they must of necessity become no parts of it.
But untill we see this done, you must pardon us, if we choose to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
sense rather then Sophistry.</p>
               <p>48 In this Paragraph you bring in the sentence of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
whereto you refer'd us in the former: but why in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversy of faith,
doe you cite any thing, which is confessed on all hands, not to be a rule
of faith? Besides, in my apprehension, this sentence of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7615:152"/>
this place, and to this purpose, meerely impertinent. S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
words are, <hi>The Church</hi> (he speaks of the particular Church, or Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of Rome) <hi>being one, cannot be within and without: If she be with
Novatianus, she was not with Cornelius: But if she were with Cornelius
who succeeded Fabianus by lawfull Ordination, Novatianus is not in the
Church.</hi> And now having related the words, I am only to remember
the Reader, that your businesse was to prove it <hi>impossible, For a man to
forsake the Churches corruptions and not the Church,</hi> and then to request
him to tell me whether, as I said, <hi>In nova fert animus,</hi> had not been as
much to the purpose?</p>
               <p>49 Toward the conclusion of this Section, you <hi>number up your
Victories, and tell us, That out of your discourse it remaineth cleere, that
this our chiefest Answer changeth the very state of the Question: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth
internall Acts of the under standing, with externoll deeds: doth
not distinguish between Schisme and Heresy, and leaves this demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against us, that they (Protestants) divided themselves from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Visible Catholique Church, because they conceived that she
needed Reformation.</hi> To which Triumphs, if any reply be needfull,
then briefly thus: We doe not change the state of the Question, but
you mistake it. For the Question was not whether they might forsake
the corruptions of the Church, and continue in her externall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which we confesse impossible, because these corruptions were
in her communion. But the Question was, whether they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the corruptions of the Church, and not the Church, but continue
still the Members of it. And to this Question, there is not in your
whole discourse one pertinent syllable.</p>
               <p>50 We <hi>doe not confound internall Acts of understanding with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
deeds,</hi> but acknowledge (as you would have us) that <hi>we cannot</hi>
(as matters now stand) <hi>separate from your corruptions, but we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from your Externall communion.</hi> For you have so ordered things,
that whosoever will Communicate with you at all, must communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with you, in your corruptions. But it is you that will not perceive
the difference, between, being a part of the Church, and being in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Communion with all the other parts of it: taking for granted,
that which is certainly false, that no two men or Churches, divided
in externall communion, can be both true parts of the Catholique
Church.</p>
               <p>51 We are not <hi>to learn the difference between Schisme &amp; Heresy,</hi> for
Heresy we conceive, an obstinate defence of any Errour, against any
necessary Article of the Christian faith: And Schisme, a causelesse se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of one part of the Church from another. But this we say,
That if we convince you of errors and corruptions, professed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in your Communion, then we cannot be Schismatiques, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to joyne with you in the profession of these Errors, and the
practise of these corruptions. And therefore you must free your selves
from Error, or us from Schisme.</p>
               <p>52 Lastly, whereas you say, <hi>That you have demonstrated against
us, that Protestants divided themselves from the externall communion
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7615:153"/>
of the Visible Church,</hi> adde, <hi>which externall communion was corrupted,</hi>
and we shall confesse the accusation, and glory in it. But this is not that
<hi>Quod erat demonstrandum,</hi> but that we divided our selves from the
Church, that is, made ourselves out-lawes from it, and no members
of it. And moreover, in the Reason of your separation from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
communion of your Church you are mistaken: for it was not so
much because she, your Church, as because your Churches externall
communion was corrupted, and needed Reformation.</p>
               <p>53 <hi>That a pretence of Reformation will acquit no man from
Schisme,</hi> we grant very willingly, and therefore say, that it concernes
every man who separates from any Churches communion, even as
much as his Salvation is worth, to looke most carefully to it, that the
cause of his separation be just and necessary: For unlesse it be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it can very hardly be sufficient. But whether a true Reformation
of our selves from Errors, superstitions and impieties, will not justify
our separation in these things; our separation, I say, from them who
will not reforme themselves, and as much as in them lies, hinder others
from doing so: This is the point you should have spoken to, but have
not. As for the sentences of the Fathers to which you referre us, for
the determination of this Question, I suppose by what I have said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
the Reader understands, by alleaging them you have gain'd lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
credit to your cause or person. And that, if they were competent
Iudges of this controversy, their sentence is against you much rather
then for you.</p>
               <p>54 Lastly, <hi>whereas you desire D. Potter to remember his own words:
There neither was nor can be any just cause to depart from the Church of
Christ, no more then from Christ himselfe, and pretend that you have
shewed that Luther did so:</hi> The Doctor remembers his words very
well, and hath no reason to be ashamed of them. Only he desires you
to remember that hereafter you doe not confound, as hitherto you
have done, departing from the Church (<hi>i. e.</hi> ceasing to be a member of
it,) with departing from the Churches externall communion; and then
he is perswaded it will appeare to you, that against <hi>Luther</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
you have said many things, but shewed nothing.</p>
               <p>55 But <hi>the Church Vniversall, remaining the Church Vniversall,
according to D. Potter may fall into error: And from hence it cleerely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that it is impossible to leave the externall communion of the Church
so corrupted, and retain externall communion with the Catholique
Church.</hi> Ans. The reason of this consequence which you say is so
cleere, truly I cannot possibly discern; But the conclusion inferr'd, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
is evident of it selfe, and therefore without proofe I grant it.
I meane, that it is impossible to leave the externall communion of the
Catholique Church corrupted, and to retain externall communion
with the Catholique Church. But what use you can make of it, I doe
not understand: Vnlesse you will pretend, that to say a man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Churches corruptions, and not the Church, is all one as to
say, he may forsake the Churches externall Communion and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it. If you mean so, sure you mistake the meaning of Protestants
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7615:153"/>
when they say, They forsook not the Church but her corruptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For in saying so, they neither affirme, nor deny that they forsooke the
externall communion of the Church, nor speake at all of it: But they
mean only, that they ceased not to be still members of the Church,
though they ceased to believe and practise some things which the
whole Church formerly did believe and practise. And as for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Communion of the Visible Church, we have without scruple
formerly granted, that Protestants did forsake it, that is, renounce the
practise of some observances, in which the whole visible Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did communicate. But this we say they did without Schisme,
because they had cause to do so, and no man can have cause to be a
Schismatique.</p>
               <p>56 But your Argument you conceive, will bee more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing,
<hi>if we consider that when Luther appeared, there were not two
distinct Visible true Churches, one Pure, the other Corrupted, but one
Church only.</hi> Ans. The ground of this is no way certain, nor here suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proved. For, whereas you say, Histories are silent of any such
matter; I answer, there is no necessity, that you or I should have read
all Histories, that may be extant of this matter; nor that all should be
extant that were written, much lesse extant uncorrupted: especially
considering your Church, which had lately all power in her hands,
hath been so pernitiously industrious, in corrupting the monuments
of Antiquity that made against her; nor that all Records should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
which were written; nor that all should be recorded which was
done. Neither secondly, to suppose a Visible Church before <hi>Luther,</hi>
which did not erre, is it to contradict this ground of <hi>D. Potters,</hi> that
the Church may erre. Vnlesse you will have us believe, that <hi>May be,</hi>
and <hi>Must be</hi> is all one, and that all which may be true, is true: which
rule if it were true, then sure all men would be honest, because all men
may be so, and you would not make so bad Arguments, unlesse you
will pretend you cannot make better. Nor thirdly, is it to contradict
these words, <hi>The Church may not hope to triumph over all error, till she
be in Heaven:</hi> For to triumph over error, is to be secure from it, to be
out of danger of it, not to be obnoxious to it. Now a Church may
be free from error, and yet not secure from it, and consequently in
this sense, not triumph over it. Fourthly, whereas you say, <hi>it evacuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the bragge of Protestants, that Luther reformed the whole Church;</hi>
perhaps (though I know not who they be that say so;) by a frequent
synecdoche, they may mean by the whole, the greatest, and most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
part of it, the lustre whereof did much obscure the other,
though it were not wholly invisible. Besides, if their bragge be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated,
(as you call it) let it be so, I see no harme will come of it. Lastly
whereas you say, that supposing a visible pure Church, <hi>Luther</hi> must
be a Schismatique, who separated from all visible Churches: I tell
you, if you will suppose a visible Church extant before and when
<hi>Luther</hi> arose, conformable to him in all points of Doctrine, necessary
and profitable, then <hi>Luther</hi> separated not from this Church, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
himselfe to it: Not indeed in place, wich was not necessary,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:7615:154"/>
not in externall communion which was impossible, but by the Vnion
of faith and charity. Vpon these grounds I say, that the ground of
this Argument is no way made certaine, yet because it is not manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, I am content to let it passe. And for ought I see, it is very safe
for me to doe so: for you build nothing upon it, which I may not faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grant. For what doe you conclude from hence, but that seeing
there was no Visible Church but corrupted, <hi>Luther</hi> forsaking the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
communion of the corrupted Church, could not but forsake
the externall communion of the Catholique Church? Well, let this
also be granted, what will come of it? What, that <hi>Luther</hi> must be a
Schismatique? By no meanes: For not every separation, but only a
causeles separation from the communion of the Church we maintain
to be Schismaticall. Hereunto may be added, that though the whole
Church were corrupted, yet properly speaking, it is not true, that
<hi>Luther</hi> &amp; his Followers forsook the whole corrupted Church, or the
externall communion of it: But only that he forsook that Part of it
which was corrupted, and still would be so, and forsook not, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reformed another Part, which Part they themselves were, and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you will not goe about to perswade us, that they forsook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or their own communion. And if you urge that they joyned
themselves to no other part, therefore they separated from the whole:
I say it followes not, in as much as themselves were a part of it, and
still continued so: and therefore could no more separate from the
whole then from themselves. Thus though there were no part of the
people of Rome, to whom the <hi>Plebeians</hi> joyned themselves, when they
made their Secession into the Aventine Hill, yet they divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the <hi>Patricians</hi> only, and not from the whole people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
themselves were a part of this people, and they divided not from
themselves.</p>
               <p>57 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 18. In the 18. §. you prove that which no man denies,
that <hi>corruption in manners yeelds no sufficient cause to leave the Church:</hi>
yet sure it yeelds sufficient cause to cast them out of the Church, that
are after the Churches publique admonition obstinate in notorious
impieties. Neither doth the cutting off such men from the Church,
lay any necessity upon us, either to goe out of the world, or out of the
Church, but rather puts these men out of the Church into the world,
where we may converse with them freely, without scandall to the
Church. <hi>Our Blessed Saviour foretold,</hi> you say, <hi>that there should be in the
Church tares with choice corne.</hi> Look again I pray, and you shall see,
that the field he speaks of, is not the Church, but <hi>the world:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither doe You obey our Saviours command, <hi>Let both grow up
till the harvest,</hi> who teach it to be lawfull to roote these tares (such are
Heretiques) out of the world: neither doe Protestants disobey it, if
they eject manifest Heresies and notorious sinners out of the Church.</p>
               <p>58 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 19. in the 19. you are so curteous as to suppose <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in your doctrine,</hi> and yet undertake to prove that, <hi>neither could
they afford us any sufficient cause, or colourable necessity to depart from
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7615:154"/>
them.</hi> Your reason is, <hi>because damnable errors there were none in your
Church, by D. Potters confession, neither can it be damnable in respect of
errour, to remain in any Churches communion, whose errors are not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
For if the error be not damnable, the belief thereof cannot. Ans. D.
Potter</hi> confesseth no such matter: but only that <hi>he hopes that your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
though in themselves sufficiently damnable, yet by accident did not
damne all that held them:</hi> such he meanes and saies, as were excusably
ignorant of the Truth, and amongst the number of their unknown
sinnes, repented daily of their unknown errors. The truth is, he thinks
as ill of your errors and their desert, as you doe of ours: only he is not
so peremptory and presumptuous in judging your persons, as you are
in judging ours, but leaves them to stand or fall to their own Master,
who is infinitely mercifull, and therefore will not damne them for
meere errors, who desire to find the truth and cannot: and withall infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
just, and therefore (is it to be feared) will not pardon them, who
might easily have come to the knowledge of the truth, and either
through Pride, or obstinacy, or negligence would not.</p>
               <p>59 To your minor also, I answer almost in your own words, §. 42.
of this Chap. I thank you for your curteous supposall, that your
Church may erre, and in recompence thereof, will doe you a charity,
by putting you in mind, into what Labyrinths you cast your selfe, by
supposing that the Church may erre in some of her Proposalls, and yet
denying it lawfull for any man though he know this, which you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to oppose her judgement, or leave her communion. Will you
have such a man dissemble against his conscience, or externally deny
that which he knowes true? No, that you will not, for them that doe
so, you your selfe have pronounced <hi>A. damned Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w of dissembling
Sycophants.</hi> Or would you have him continue in your Communion,
and yet professe your Church to erre? This you your selves have
made to him impossible. Or would you have him beleeve those things
true, which together with him you have supposed to be Errors? This
in such a one, as is assur'd or perswaded of that, which you here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that your Church doth erre, (and such only we say, are obliged
to forsake your communion,) is, as Schoolemen speak, <hi>Implicatio in
terminis,</hi> a contradiction so plain, that one word destroieth another;
as if one should say, a living dead man. For it is to require that they
which believe some part of your Doctrine false, should withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it all true. Seeing therefore, for any man to believe your Church
in error, and professe the contrary, is damnable Hypocrisie; to believe
it and not believe it, a manifest repugnancy; and thirdly, to professe it
and to continue in your Communion (as matters now stand) a plain
impossibility; what remaines, but that whosoever is supposed to have
just reason to disbelieve any doctrine of your Church, must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
forsake her Communion? Vnlesse you would remit so farre from
your present rigour, as to allow them your Churches communion,
who publiquely professe that they doe not believe every article of her
established Doctrine. Indeed, if you would doe so, you might with
some coherence suppose your Church in error, and yet finde fault
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7615:155"/>
with men for abandoning her communion, because they might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in it, and suppose her in error. But to suppose your Church in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and to excommunicate all those that believe your own suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then to complain that they continue not in your communion,
is the most ridiculous incongruity that can be imagined. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though your corruptions in doctrine, in themselves (which yet is
false) did not, yet your obliging us, to professe your doctrine uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
against knowledge and conscience, may induce an obligation to
depart from your communion. As if there were any society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that held there were no Antipodes; notwithstanding this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
I might communicate with them. But if I could not doe so, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
professing my selfe of their beleefe in this matter, then I suppose I
should be excus'd from Schisme, if I should forsake their communion,
rather then professe my selfe to believe that which I doe not believe.
Neither is there any contradiction, or shadow of contradiction, that it
may be necessary for my Salvation to depart from this Churches
communion: And that this Church (though erring in this matter)
wants nothing necessary to Salvation. And yet this is that manifest
contradiction, which <hi>D. Potter</hi> (you say) will never be able to salve,
<hi>viz. That there might be necessary cause to depart from the Church of
Rome in some Doctrines and practices, though she wanted nothing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>60 And your Reason wherewith you prove, that there is in these
words such a plain contradiction, is very notable. <hi>For</hi> (say you) <hi>if she
wanted nothing necessary to Salvation, how could it be necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to forsake her?</hi> Truly Sir, if this be a good manner of proving, it
is a very ready way to prove any thing; for what is there that may not
be proved, if it be proofe enough to aske how it can be otherwise?
Me thinkes if you would convince, <hi>D. Potter's</hi> words of manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
you should shew, that he affirmes and denies the same of
the same. From which fault me thinkes he should be very innocent,
who saies only, that that may be damnable to one, which is not so to
another: and that may be necessary for one, which is not necessary for
another. And this is all that <hi>D. Potter</hi> saies here: <hi>viz.</hi> That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a falsehood to him that believes it, may be not damnable:
and yet damnable to him that believes the contrary. Or that, not to
professe a falsehood in him that knowes it to be so, is necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
and yet not so, in him that by error conceives it to be a truth.
The words by you cited, and charged with unsalvable contradiction
are in the 75. pag. But in the progresse of the same particular discourse,
in the next page but one, he gives such evident reason of them, (which
can hardly be done to prove implicancy true) that whereas you say,
<hi>he will never be able to salve them from contradiction,</hi> I believe any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
reader, having considered the place, will be very apt to
think, that you (whatsoever you pretend) were very able to have done
this curtesy for him, if your will had been answerable to your ability.
I will set down the words, and leave the Reader to condemne or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
them. <hi>To forsake the errors of that Church, and not to joyne with
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7615:155"/>
her in those practices which we account erroneous, wee are enforced by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.
For though in the issue they are not damnable to them which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
as they professe, yet for us to professe &amp; avow by oath (as the Church
of Rome enioynes) what we belieue not, were without question damnable.
And they with their errours, by the grace of God might goe to Heaven,
when we for our hypocrisie and dissimulation</hi> (he might haue added, and
Perjury) <hi>should certainly be condemned to Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>61 <hi>Ad § 20. But a Church not erring in Fundamentalls, though er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in other matters, doth what our Saviour exacts at her hands, doth as
much as lies in her power to doe: Therefore the Communion of such a
Church is not upon pretence of Errour to be forsaken.</hi> The consequence
is manifest. The Antecedent is proved, because <hi>God, by D. Potters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 151. 155.</note> 
                  <hi>hath promised his assistance no further, nor is it in her power to doe
more then God doth assist her to doe.</hi> Ans. The promise of Divine
Assistance is two fold: Absolute, or Conditionall. That there shall be
by Divine providence preseru'd in the world to the worlds end, such a
company of Christians, who hold all things precisely and indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
necessary to salvation, and nothing inevitably destructive of it:
This and no more the Doctor affirmes that God hath promised abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.
Yet he neither doubts nor denies, but that a farther assistance is
conditionally promised us, even such an assistance as shall lead us, if we
be not wanting to it and our selves, into all not only necessary, but very
profitable truth, and guard us from all not only destructive, but also
hurtfull Errours. This, I say, he neither denies nor questions. And
should he haue done so, hee might haue been confuted by evident and
expresse Text of Scripture. When therefore you say, That <hi>a Church
not erring in Fundamentalls, doth as much as by Gods assistance lies in
her power to doe;</hi> This is manifestly untrue. For Gods assistance is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ready to promote her farther. It is ready, I say, but on condition
the Church does implore it: on condition, that when it is offered in
the divine directions of Scripture and reason, the Church be not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
to follow it. If therefore there be any Church, which retaining
the foundation, builds <hi>hay and stubble</hi> upon it: which believing what is
precisely necessary, erres shamefully and dangerously in other things
very profitable: This by no meanes argues defect of divine assistance
in God, but neglect of this assistance in the Church. Neither is there
any reason, why such a Church should please her selfe too much, for
retaining Fundamentall truths, while shee remaines so regardlesse of
others. For though the simple defect of some truths profitable onely
and not simply necessary, may consist with salvation; Yet who is there
that can giue her sufficient assurance, that the neglect of such truths is
not damnable? Besides, who is there that can put her in sufficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that these Errours about profitable matters may not according
to the usuall fecunditie of errour, bring forth others of a higher quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
such as are pernicious and pestilent, and undermine by secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
the very foundations of Religion and piety? Lastly, who
can say that she hath sufficiently discharged her duty to God and man
by avoiding only Fundamentall Heresies, if in the mean time shee bee
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7615:156"/>
negligent of others, which though they doe not plainly destroy salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet obscure and hinder, and only not block up the way to it?
Which though of themselves and immediatly they damne no man,
yet are causes and occasions that many men run the race of Christian
piety more remisly then they should, many defer their repentance, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
goe on securely in their sinnes, &amp; so at length are damn'd by means
and occasion of these Errours, though not for them. Such Errours as
these (though those of the Roman Church be much worse, even <hi>in
themselves damnable, and by accident only pardonable</hi>) yet I say such Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
as these, if any Church should tolerate, dissemble and suffer them
to raign, and neglect to reforme them, and not permit them to be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet peaceably, opposed and impugned; will any wise man say, that
she hath sufficiently discharged her duty to God and man? That shee
hath with due fidelity dispensed the Gospell of Christ? That shee hath
done what she could, and what she ought? What shall we say then, if
these errours be taught by her, and commanded to be taught? What if
she thunder out her curses against those that will not belieue them?
What if she rave and rage against them, and persecute them with fire &amp;
sword, and all kinds of most exquisite torments? Truly I doe much
feare, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such a Church (though it hold no errour absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with salvation,) the candlestick of God, either is already
removed, or will be very shortly, and because she is negligent of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
truths, that she will lose those that are Necessary, and because she
will not be led into all truths, that in short time shee shall bee led into
none. And although this should not happen, yet what mortall man can
secure us, that not only a probable unaffected ignorance, nor onely a
meere neglect of profitable truths, but also a retchlesse supine negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
manifest contempt, Dissimulation, Opposition, Oppression of
them, may consist with salvation? I truly for my part, though I hope
very well of all such as seeking all truth, finde that which is necessary;
who endeavouring to free themselves from all Errours, any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the purity of Christianity, yet fayle of performance &amp; remain
in some: yet if I did not finde in my selfe a loue and desire of all profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
truth; If I did not put away idlenesse, and prejudice, and worldly
affections, and so examine to the bottome all my opinions of divine
matters, being prepar'd in minde to follow God, and God only which
way soever he shall lead me; If I did not hope, that I either doe, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to doe these things, certainly I should haue little hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
salvation.</p>
               <p>62 <hi>But to oblige any man under pain of damnation to forsake a Church
by reason of such errours, against which Christ thought it superfluous to
promise his assistance, and for which he neither denies his grace here, nor
his glory hereafter, what is it but to make the narrow way to heaven, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
then Christ left it?</hi> Ans. It is not: For Christ himselfe hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
us hereunto: He hath forbad us under pain of damnation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
what we belieue not, &amp; consequently under the same penalty, to
leaue that Communion, in which we cannot remain without this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
profession of those things, which we are convinc'd to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7615:156"/>
But then besides, it is here falsely supposed, (as hath been
shewed already) that Christ hath not promised assistance to those that
seeke it, but only in matters simply necessary. Neither is there any
reason, why any Church, even in this world, should despair of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over all errors pernitious or noxious; provided she humbly and
earnestly implore divine assistance, depend wholy upon it, and be not
wanting to it. Though a <hi>Triumph over all sinne and error,</hi> that is, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
that she neither doth nor can erre, be rather to be desired then
hoped for on earth, being a felicity reserved for heaven.</p>
               <p>63 <hi>Ad §. 21. But at least the Roman Church is as infallible as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and Protestants as fallible as the Roman Church: therefore to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Roman Church for errors, what is it but to flit from one erring So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
to another?</hi> Ans. The inconsequence of this Argument is too
apparent: Protestants may erre as well as the Church of Rome, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did so! Boyes in the Schooles know, that <hi>a Posse ad Esse,</hi> the
Argument followes not. He is equally fallible who believes twise two
to be foure, as he that believes them to be twenty: yet in this, he is not
equally deceived, and he may be certain that he is not so. One Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
is no more infallible then another, and yet he is more secure that
his work is right and streight who hath made it by the levell, then he
which hath made it by guesse and by chance. So he that forsakes the
errors of the Church of Rome, and therefore renounceth her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that he may renounce the profession of her errors, though he
knowes himselfe fallible, as well as those whom he hath forsaken, yet
he may be certain (as certain as the nature of the thing will beare) that
he is not herein deceived: because he may see the Doctrine forsaken
by him repugnant to Scripture, and the doctrine embraced by him
consonant to it. At least, this he may know, that the doctrine which
he hath chosen to him seemes true, and the contrary which he hath
forsaken, seemes false: And therefore without remorse of conscience,
he may professe that, but this he cannot.</p>
               <p>64 But <hi>we are to remember, that according to D. Potter the visible
Church hath a blessing not to erre in Fundamentalls, in which any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Reformer may faile, therefore there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was no necessity of forsaking the
Church, out of whose communion they were exposed to danger of falling
into many more, and even into damnable errors.</hi> Ans. The visible
Church is free indeed from all errors absolutely destructive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable,
but not from all errour which in it selfe is damnable: not
from all which will actually bring damnation upon them, that keep
themselves in them, by their own voluntary and avoidable fault.
From such errors which are thus damnable D. <hi>Potter</hi> doth no where
say, that the visible Church hath any priviledge or exemption. Nay
you your selfe teach, that he plainly teacheth the contrary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
will allow him to be no more charitable to Papists, then Papists
are to Protestants: and yet upon this affected mistake your discourse is
founded in almost forty places of your Book. Besides, any private
man who truly believes the Scripture, and seriously endeavours to
know the will of God, and to doe it, is as secure as the visible Church,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7615:157"/>
more secure then your Church from the danger of erring in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls:
for it is impossible, that any man so qualified should fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any error which to him will prove damnable. For God requires
no more of any man to his Salvation, but his true endeavour to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Lastly, abiding in your Churches Communion is so farre from
securing me or any man from damnable error, that if I should abide in
it, I am certain I could not be saved. For abide in it I cannot, without
professing to believe your entire doctrine true: professe this I cannot,
but I must lye perpetually, and exulcerate my conscience. And though
your errors were not in themselves damnable, yet to resist the known
Truth, and to continue in the profession of known errors and false.
hoods, is certainly a capitall sinne, and of great affinity with the sinne
which shall never be forgiven.</p>
               <p>95 But <hi>neither is the Church of Protestants perfectly free from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and corruptions: so the Doctor confesses p. 69. which he can only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
by saying, they are not fundamentall, as likewise those in the Roman
Church, are confessed not to be fundamentall. And what man of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be a Protestant, since that Church is confessedly a corrupted one?</hi>
Ans. And yet you your selfe make large discourses in this very Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to perswade Protestants to continue in the Church of Rome,
though supposed to have some corruptions. And why I pray, may
not a man of judgement continue in the Communion of a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
corrupted, as well as in a Church supposed to be corrupted?
Especially when this Church supposed to be corrupted, requires the
beliefe and profession of her supposed corruptions, as the condition
of her Communion: which this Church confessedly corrupted, doth
not. What man of judgement will think it any disparagement, to his
judgement to preferre the better, though not simply the best, before
that which is starke naught? To preferre indifferent good health, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a diseased and corrupted state of Body? To preferre a field not
perfectly weeded, before a field that is quite over-runne with weeds
and thornes? And therefore though Protestants have some Errors,
yet seeing they are neither so great as yours, nor impos'd with such
tyranny, nor maintained with such obstinacy; he that conceives it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disparagement to his judgement, to change your Communion for
theirs, though confessed to have some corruptions, it may well be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
that he hath but little judgement. For, as for your pretence that
yours are confessed not to be fundamentall, it is an affected mistake, as
already I have often told you.</p>
               <p>66 <hi>Ad §. 22. But D. Potter saies it is comfort enough for the Church,
that the Lord in mercy will secure her from all capitall dangers: but she
may not hope to triumph over all sinne and error, till she be in heaven. Now
if it be comfort enough, to be secur'd from all capitall dangers, which can
arise only from error in fundamentall points, Why were not our first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
content with enough, but would needs dismember the Church, out
of apernitious greedinesse of more then enough?</hi> Ans. I have already
shewed sufficiently, how capitall danger may arise from errors,
though not fundamentall. I adde now, that what may be enough for
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7615:157"/>
men in ignorance, may be to knowing men not enough: according to
that of the Gospell, <hi>to whom much is given, of him much shall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</hi>
That the same error may be not capitall to those who want
meanes of finding the truth, and capitall to others who have meanes,
and neglect to use them: That to continue in the profession of error
discovered to be so, may be damnable, though the error be not so.
These I presume are reasons enough, and enough why the first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
might think; and justly, that not enough for themselves, which
yet to some of their Predecessors they hope
might be enough. This very Argument was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

               <p>67 But <hi>if (as the Doctor saies) no Church
may hope to triumph over all error ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> she be in
heaven, then we must either grant, that errors not
fundamentall cannot yeeld sufficient cause to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Church, or you must affirme that all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
may and ought to be forsaken.</hi> Answ.
The Doctor does not say, that no Church may
hope to be free from all error, either perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or any way noxious: But that <hi>no Church
may hope to be secure from all error simply,</hi> for
this were indeed truly totriumph over all. But
then we say not, that the communion of any
Church is to be forsaken for errors unfunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
unlesse it exact withall either a dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
of the being noxious; or a Profession
of them against the dictate of conscience, if they
be meere errors. This if the Church does (as
certainly yours doth,) then her communion is
to be forsaken, rather then the sinne of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy
to be committed. Whereas to forsake the
Churches of Protestants for such errors, there
is no necessity, because they erre to themselves, &amp; doe not under pain
of Excommunication exact the profession of their errors.</p>
               <p>68 But <hi>the Church may not be left by reason of sinne, therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by reason of errors not fundamentall: in as much as both sinne and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
are impossible to be avoided till she be in heaven.</hi> Ans. The reason of
the consequence does not appear to mee: But I answer to the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
Neither for sinne nor errors, ought a Church to be forsaken, if
she does not impose and injoyne them: but if she doe, (as the Roman
does,) then we must forsake men rather then God; leave the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
communion rather then commit sinne, or professe known errors,
to be divine truths. For the Prophet <hi>EZechiel</hi> hath assured us, that to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7615:158"/>
say, <hi>the Lord hath said so, when the Lord hath not said so,</hi> is a great sinne,
and a high presumption, be the matter never so small.</p>
               <p>69 <hi>Ad §.</hi> 23. But <hi>neither the Quality nor the number of your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
errors, could warrant our forsaking of it. Not the Quality, because
we suppose them not Fundamentall. Not the number, because the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is strong enough to support them.</hi> Ans. Here againe you vainely
suppose, that we conceive your errors in themselves not damnable:
Though we hope they are not absolutely unpardonable: but to say
they are pardonable, is indeed to suppose them damnable. Secondly,
though the errors of your Church did not warrant our departure,
yet your Tyrannous imposition of them, would be our sufficient justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
For this laies necessity on us, either to forsake your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or to professe what we know to be false.</p>
               <p>70 Our <hi>Blessed Saviour hath declared his will, that we forgive a
private offender seventy seven times, that is, without limitation of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of time, or quality of Trespasses; and thou how dare we alleage his
command, that we must not pardon his Church for errors acknowledged
to be not fundamentall?</hi> Ans. He that commands us to pardon our
Brother sinning against us so often, will not allow us for his sake to
sinne with him, so much as once. He will have us doe any thing but
sinne, rather then offend any man. But his will is also, that we offend
all the World, rather then sinne in the least matter. And therefore
though his will were, and it were in our power (which yet is false) to
pardon the errors of an erring Church; yet certainly it is not his will,
that we should erre with the Church, or if we doe not, that we should
against conscience professe the errors of it.</p>
               <p>71 <hi>Ad §.</hi> 24. But <hi>Schismatiques from the Church of England or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Church, with this very Answer, that they forsake not the Church
but the errors of it, may cast off from themselves the imputation of
Schisme.</hi> Ans. True, they may make the same Answer, and the same
defence as we doe, as a murtherer can cry not guilty, as well as an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
person, but not so truly nor so justly. The question is, not what
may be pretended, but what can bee proved by Schismatiques. They
may object errors to other Churches, as well as we doe to yours, but
that they prove their accusation so strongly as we can, that appeares
not. To the Priests and elders of the Iewes, imposing that sacred si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>they must obey God rather then men.</hi> The three Children to the
King of Babylon, gave in effect the same answer. Give me now any
factious Hypocrite, who makes religion the pretence and cloke of his
Rebellion, and who sees not that such a one may answer for himselfe,
in those very formall words, which the holy Apostles and Martyrs
made use of. And yet I presume no Christian will deny, but this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was good, in the mouth of the Apostles and Martyrs, though it
were obnoxious to be abused, by Traitors and Rebels. Certainly
therefore, it is no good consequence to say, Schismatiques may make
use of this Answer, therefore all that doe make use of it are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.
But moreover, it is to be observed, that the chiefe part of our
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7615:158"/>
defence, that you deny your communion to all that deny or doubt of
any part of your doctrine, cannot with any colour be imployed against
Protestants: who grant their Communion to all who hold with them,
not all things, but things necessary, that is, such as are in Scripture
plainly delivered.</p>
               <p>72 <hi>But the forsaking the Roman Church opens a way to innumerable
Sects and Schismes, and therefore it must not be forsaken.</hi> Ans. We
must not doe evill to avoid evill: neither are all courses presently law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
by which inconveniences may be avoided. If all men would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves to the chiefe Mufty of the Turkes, it is apparent, there
would be no divisions; yet unity is not to be purchased at so deare a
rate. It were a thing much to be desired, that there were no divisions:
yet difference of opinions touching points controverted, is rather
to be chosen, then unanimous concord in damned errors: As it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for men to goe to heaven by diverse waies, or rather by divers
paths of the same way, then in the same path to goe on peaceably to
hell. <hi>Amica Pax, magis amica Veritas!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>73 But there <hi>can be no iust cause to forsake the Church, so the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
grants: who notwithstanding teacheth that the Church may erre in
points not fundamentall; therefore neither is the Roman Church to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
for such errors.</hi> Ans. There can be no just cause to forsake the
Church absolutely and simply in all things, that is, to cease being a
member of the Church: This I grant, if it will doe you any service.
But that there can be no just cause to forsake the Church in some
things, or (to speak more properly) to forsake some opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
which some true Church retaines and defends; this I deny, and
you mistake the Doctor if you think he affirmes it.</p>
               <p>74 <hi>Ad §</hi> 26. 27. What <hi>prodigious doctrines</hi> (say you) <hi>are these?
Those Protestants who belieue that your Church erred in points necessary
to salvation, and for that cause left her, cannot be excused from damnable
Schisme: But others, &amp;c.</hi> Prodigious doctrines indeed! But who I
pray are they that teach them? Where does D. <hi>Potter</hi> accuse those
Protestants of <hi>damnable Schisme,</hi> who left your Church because they
hold it erroneous in necessary points? What Protestant is there that
holds not that you taught things contrary to the plaine precepts of
Christ; both Ceremoniall, in mutilating the Communion; and Morall,
in points of superstition &amp; Idolatry, and most bloody tyranny? which
is without question to erre in necessary matters. Neither does <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
accuse any man of Schisme for holding so: if he should, he should
call himselfe a Schismatique. Only he saies, such (if there be any such)
as affirm, that ignorant soules among you, who had no means to know
the truth, cannot possibly be saved, that their wisdome and charity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be justified. Now you your selfe haue plainly affirmed, That <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Protestants dying with contrition may bee saved;</hi> and yet would
be unwilling to be thought to say, that Protestants erre in no points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation. For that may be in it selfe, and in ordinary course,
where there are meanes of knowledge, necessary, which to a man invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
ignorant, will proue not necessary. Again, where doth <hi>D. Potter</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:7615:159"/>
suppose (as you make him) that there were other Protestants, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that your Church had no errours? Or, where does hee say
they did well to forsake her, upon this ridiculous reason, because they
judged that she retained all means necessary to salvation? Doe you
think us so stupid, as that wee cannot distinguish between that which
D. <hi>Potter</hi> sayes, and that which you make him say? He vindicates Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
from Schisme two waies: The one is, because they had just and
great and necessary cause to separate, which Schismatiques never haue;
because they that haue it are no Schismatiques: For schisme is alwaies
a causelesse separation. The other is, because they did not joyn with
their separation, an uncharitable damning of all those from whom they
did divide themselves, as the manner of Schismatiques is. Now that
which he intends for a circumstance of our separation, you make him,
make the cause of it, and the motiue to it. And whereas he saies, <hi>though
we separate from you in some things, yet we acknowledge your Church a
member of the body of Christ, and therefore are not Schismatiques:</hi> You
make him say most absurdly, <hi>we did well to forsake you, because we iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you a member of the body of Christ.</hi> Iust as if a brother should leaue
his Brothers company in some ill courses, and should say to him, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I forsake you, yet I leave you not absolutely, for I acknowledge you
still to be my brother, and shall use you as a brother: And you perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his speech, should pretend that he had said, I leaue your company
in these ill courses, and I doe well to doe so, because you are my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
so making that the cause of his leaving him, which indeed is the
cause that he left him no farther.</p>
               <p>75 But you say, <hi>The very reason for which hee acquitteth himselfe
from Schisme, is because he holds that the Church which they forsook, is
not cut off from the Body of Christ.</hi> Ans. This is true: But can you not
perceive a difference between justifying his separation from Schisme
by this reason, and making this the reason of his separation? If a man
denying obedience in some unlawfull matter to his lawfull Soveraign,
should say to him, herein I disobey you, but yet I am no Rebell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I acknowledge you my Soveraign Lord, and am ready to obey
you in all things lawfull, should not he be an egregious sycophant,
that should accuse him as if he had said, I doe well to disobey you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I acknowledge you my lawfull Soveraign? Certainly hee that
joynes this acknowledgment with his necessitated disobedience, does
well; but he that makes this consideration the reason of his disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
doth ill. Vrge therefore this (as you call it) most solemn foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as far as you please: For every understanding Reader will easily
perceiue that this is no foppery of D. <hi>Potters,</hi> but a calumny of yours;
from which he is as far, as he is from holding yours to bee the true
Church: whereas it is a sign of a great deal of Charity in him, that he
allowes you to be a Part of it.</p>
               <p>76 And <hi>whereas you pretend to finde such unspeakable comfort here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in, that we cannot cleare our selues from Schisme, otherwise then by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that they doe not, nor cannot cut off your Church from the
hope of salvation:</hi> I beseech you to take care that this false comfort cost
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7615:159"/>
you not too deare. For why this good opinion of God Almighty,
that he will not damne men for errour, who were without their owne
fault ignorant of the truth, should be any consolation to them, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the key of knowledge, will neither use it themselves, nor permit
others to use it; who haue eyes to see and will not see, who haue cares
to heare and will not heare! this I assure you passeth my capacity to
apprehend. Neither <hi>is this to make our salvation depend on yours,</hi> but
only ours and yours not desperatly inconsistent. Nor to say wee <hi>must
be damn'd unlesse you may be saved;</hi> but that we assure our selues, if our
lives be answerable, we shall be saved by our knowledge. And that wee
hope (and I tell you again <hi>Spes est reiincertae nomen,</hi>) that some of you
may possibly bee the rather saved by occasion of their unaffected
Ignorance.</p>
               <p>77 For our Brethren whom you say <hi>we condemn of heresie for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Churches perpetuity,</hi> we know none that doe so: unlesse you
conceive a corrupted Church to be none at all; and if you doe, then
for ought I know, in your account we must be all Heretiques; for all of
us acknowledge that the Church might be corrupted even with errors
in themselves damnable, and not only might, but hath been.</p>
               <p>78 <hi>But Schisme consists in being divided from that true Church,
with which a man agreeth in all points of faith: Now we must professe you
agree with the Church of Rome in all Fundamentall Articles; Therefore
we are Schismatiques.</hi> Ans. Either in your Major, by <hi>all points of faith,</hi>
you mean <hi>all fundamentall points only,</hi> or <hi>all simply and absolutely.</hi> If the
former, I deny your Major: for I may without all schisme divide from
that Church which erres in any point of faith Fundamentall or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
if she require the profession of this Errour among the conditions
of her Communion. Now this is our case. If the latter, I deny the
syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme,
as having manifestly foure termes, and being cosen German
to this,
<q>
                     <l>He that obeys God in all things, is innocent;</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Titius</hi> obeys God in some things;</l>
                     <l>Therefore he is innocent.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>79 <hi>But they who judge a reconciliation with the Church of Rome to be
damnable, they that say there might be iust and necessary cause to depart
from it, and that they of that Church which haue understanding &amp; means
to discover their Errour, and neglect to use them, are not to bee flattered
with hope of salvation; they doe cut off that Church from the body of Christ
and the hope of salvation, and so are Schismatiques: But D. Potter doth the
former; therefore is a Schismatique.</hi> Ans. No, he doth not: not cut off
that whole Church from the hope of salvation, not those members of
it who were invincibly, or excusably ignorant of the truth; but those
only who having understanding and meanes to discover their errour,
neglect to use them. Now these are not the whole Church; &amp; therefore
he that, supposing their impenitence, cuts these off from hope of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
cannot be justly said to cut off that whole Church from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ, and the hope of salvation.</p>
               <p>80 <hi>Ad §</hi> 28. 29. Whereas D. <hi>Potter saies, There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a Schisme from them, and a Reformation of our selves: this</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:7615:160"/>
you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay <hi>is a quaint subtilty by which all Schisme and sinne may be as well
excused.</hi> It seems then in your judgement, that theeves and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and murtherers, and traytors may say with as much probability
as Protestants, that they did no hurt to others, but only reforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
But then me thinks it is very strange, that all Protestants should
agree with one consent in this defence of themselves from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Schisme: and that to this day, never any Theefe or Murtherer
should haue been heard of to make use of this Apologie! And then for
Schismatiques I would know, whether <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of Rome, who
excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> for not conforming to his
Church in keeping Easter; whether <hi>Novatian</hi> that divided from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>
upon pretence that himselfe was elected Bishop of Rome, when
indeed he was not; whether <hi>Felicissimus</hi> and his Crew, that went out
of the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and set up altar against altar, because ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fallen in persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they might not be restored to the peace of the
Church presently, upon the intercession of the Confessours; whether
the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who divided from, and damned all the world, because all
the world would not excommunicate them who were accused onely
and not convicted to haue been Traditors of the sacred Books; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they which for the slips &amp; infirmity of others, which they might
and ought to tolerate, or upon some difference in matters of Order &amp;
Ceremony, or for some errour in doctrine, neither pernitious nor hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to faith or piety, separate themselves from others, or others from
themselves; or lastly, whether they that put themselves out of the
Churches unity and obedience, because their opinions are not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there, but reprehended and confuted, or because being of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conversation, they are impatient of their Churches censure: I
would know I say, whether all, or any of these, may with any face or
without extreme impudency, put in this plea of Protestants, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with as much likelihood as they, that they did not separate from
others, but only reforme themselves? But suppose they were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
as to say so in their own defence falsely, doth it follow by any
good Logick, that therefore this Apology is not to be imployed by
Protestants, who may say so truly? <hi>We make</hi> (say they) <hi>no Schisme
from you, but only a reformation of our selves: This,</hi> you reply, <hi>is no
good justification, because it may be pretended by any Schismatique.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true, any Schismatique that can speak may say the same words, (as
any Rebell that makes conscience the cloake of his impious disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
may say with S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn, we must obey God rather then
men;</hi>) But then the question is, whether any Schismatique may say so
truly? And to this question you say just nothing: but conclude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this defence may be abused by some, it must be used by none.
As if you should haue said, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did ill to make such an
answer as they made, because impious Hypocrites might make use of
the same to palliate their disobedience and Rebellion against the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
commands of lawfull Authority.</p>
               <p>81 <hi>But seeing their pretended Reformation consisted in forsaking the
Churches corruptions, their Reformation of themselves, and their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>division
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7615:160"/>
from you, falls out to be one and the same thing.</hi>) Iust as if two
men having been a long while companions in drunkenesse, one of them
should turne sober; this Reformation of himselfe, and disertion of
his companion, in this ill custome, would be one and the same thing,
and yet there is no necessity that he should leave his love to him at all,
or his society in other things. So Protestants forsaking their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
corruptions, which were common to them with you, could not
choose but withall forsake you in the practice of these corruptions:
yet this they might, and would have done without breach of Charity
towards you; and without a renunciation of your company in any act
of piety and devotion, confessedly lawfull. And therefore though
both these were by accident joyned together, yet this hinders not but
that the end they aimed at, was not a separation from you, but a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of themselves.</p>
               <p>82 Neither <hi>doth their disagreement in the particulars of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
(which yet when you measure it without partiality, you
will find to be farre short of infinite) <hi>nor their symbolizing in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of forsaking your corruptions,</hi> prove any thing to the contrary,
or any way advantage your designe or make for your purpose. For it
is not any signe at all, much lesse an evident signe, that they had no set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
designe, but only to forsake the Church of Rome: for nothing but
malice can deny, that their intent at least was, to reduce Religion to
that originall purity from which it was fallen. The declination from
which, some conceiving to have begunne (though secretly) in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
times, (<hi>the mystery of iniquity being then in worke;</hi>) and after their
departure to have shewed it selfe more openly: others again believing,
that the Church continued pure for some Ages after the Apostles, &amp;
then declined: And consequently some aiming at an exact conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the Apostolique times: Others thinking they should doe God
and men good service, could they reduce the Church to the condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fourth &amp; fifth ages: Some taking their direction in this work
of Reformation, only from Scripture; others from the writings of
Fathers, and the Decrees of Councells of the first five Ages: certainly
it is no great marveile, that there was, as you say, disagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, in the particulars of their Reformation; nay morally
speaking, it was impossible it should be otherwise. Yet let me tell you,
the difference between them (especially in comparison of your
Church and Religion,) is not the difference between good and bad,
but between good and better: And they did best that followed Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
interpreted by Catholique written Tradition: which rule the
reformers of the Church of England, proposed to themselves to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>83 Ad § 30. 31. 32. <hi>To this effect</hi> D. Potter, <hi>p. 81. 82. of his
book, speaks thus.</hi> If a Monastery should reforme it selfe, and should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
into practice ancient good discipline, when others would not: In this
case could it be charged with Schisme from others, or with Apostacy
from its rule and order? So in a society of men universally infected with
some disease; they that should free themselves from it, could they be
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7615:161"/>
therefore said to separate from the society? <hi>He presumes they could not,
and from hence concludes,</hi> that neither can the Reformed Churches be
truly accused for making a Schisme, (that is separating from the Church,
and making themselves no members of it) if all they did was (as indeed it
was) to reforme themselves. <hi>Which cases I believe any understanding
man will plainly see to have in them an exact parity of Reason, and
that therefore the Argument drawn from them is pressing and un-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.
And it may well be suspected, that you were partly of this
mind, otherwise you would not have so presum'd upon the simplicity
of your Reader as, pretending to answer it, to put another of your own
making in place of it, and then to answer that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>84 This you doe §. 31. 32. of this Chapter, in these words, <hi>I was
very glad to find you in a Monastery, &amp;c.</hi> Where I beseech the Reader
to observe these things to detect the cunning of your tergiversation:
First, That you have no Reason to say, <hi>That you found D. Potter in a
Monastery:</hi> and as little, <hi>that you find him inventing waies how to forsake
his vocation, and to maintaine the lawfulnesse of Schisme from the
Church, and Apostacy from a Religious Order.</hi> Certainly the innocent
case put by the Doctor, of a Monastery reforming it selfe, hath not
deserved such grievous accusations. Vnlesse Reformation with you be
all one with Apostacy: and to forsake sinne and disorder, be to forsake
ones vocation. And surely if it be so, your vocations are not very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and your Religious orders not very religious. Secondly, that
you quite pervert and change <hi>D. Potters</hi> cases, and in stead of the case,
of a <hi>whole Monastery reforming it selfe, when other Monasteries of
their Order would not;</hi> and of <hi>some men freeing themselves from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
disease of their society, when others would not:</hi> you substitute two
others, which you thinke you can better deale with; of <hi>some particular
Monkes, upon pretence of the neglect of lesser monasticall observances,
going out of their Monastery, which Monastery yet did confessedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their substantiall Vowes, and all Principall Statutes: And of a
diseased Person, quitting the company of those that were infected with the
same disease: though in their company, there was no danger from his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
it being impossible that should be mortall: and out of it, no hope of
escaping others like that for which he forsook the first infected Company.</hi>
I appeale now to any indifferent judge, whether these cases be the
same or neere the same with D. <hi>Potters?</hi> Whether this be faire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
dealing, in stead of his two instances, which plainly shewed
it possible in other societies, and consequently in that of the Church,
to leave the faults of a society, and not leave being of it, to foist in two
others, clean crosse to the Doctors purpose, of men under colour of
faults, abandoning the society wherein they lived? I know not what
others may think of this dealing, but to me, this declining D. <hi>Potters</hi>
cases and conveying others into their place, is a great assurance, that
as they were put by him, you could say nothing to them.</p>
               <p>85 But that no suspicion of tergiversation may be fastned upon
me, I am content to deale with you a little, at your own weapons. Put
the case then, though not just as you would have it, yet with as much

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avour to you, as in reason you can expect, That a Monastery did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
her substantiall vowes, and all Principall statutes, but yet did ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
practise, and also enjoyne the violation of some lesser, yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
observances, and had done so time out of mind. And that some
inferiour Monkes more conscientious then the rest, discovering this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
should first with all earnestnesse sollicite their Superiours for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and orderly reformation of these, though small and veniall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
yet corruptions: But finding they hop'd and labour'd in
vain to effect this, should reforme these faults in themselves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to joyne in the practice of them, with the rest of their Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and persisting resolutely in such a refusall, should by their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
be cast out of their Monastery, and being not to be re-admitted
without a promise of remitting from their stiffenesse in these things,
and of condescending to others in the practice of their small faults,
should choose rather to continue exiles, then to re-enter upon such
conditions: I would know whether you would condemne such men
of Apostacy from the Order? Without doubt if you should, you
would finde the streame of your Casuists against you, and besides,
involve S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the same condemnation, who plainly tels, that <hi>we
may not doe the least evill, that we may doe the greatest good.</hi> Put case
again, you should be part of a Society universally infected with some
disease, and discovering a certain remedy for this disease, should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the whole company to make use of it, but finde the greatest part
of them so farre in love with their disease, that they were resolved to
keepe it and besides, should make a decree, that whosoever would
leave it, should leave their company. Suppose now that your selfe
and some few others, should notwithstanding their injunction to the
contrary, free your selves from this disease, and thereupon they
should absolutely forsake and reject you: I would know in this case
who deserves to be condemned, whether you of uncharitable deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your company, or they of a tyrannicall peevishnesse? And if in
these cases you will (as I verily believe you will,) acquit the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
and condemne the superiors, absolve the minor part and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the major, then can you with no reason condemne Prote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tants,
for choosing rather to be ejected from the communion of the Roman
Church, then with her to persist (as of necessity they were to doe, if
they would continue in her communion) in the profession of Errors,
though not destructive of salvation, yet hindering edification, and in
the Practice, or at least approbation of many, (suppose not mortall)
but veniall corruptions.</p>
               <p>86 Thirdly, that you censure too partially the corrupt estate of
your <hi>Church, in comparing it to a Monastery, which did confessedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their substantiall vowes, and all Principall Statutes of their order,
and moreover was secured by an infallible assistance, for the avoiding of
all substantiall corruptions:</hi> for of your Church we confesse no such
matter, but say plainly, That she not only might fall into substantiall
corruptions, but did so; that she did not only generally violate, but of
all the members of her communion, either in act or approbation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7615:162"/>
and exact the violation of many substantiall lawes of Christ,
both Ceremoniall and Morall, which though we hope it was pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
in them, who had not meanes to know their errour, yet of its
own nature, and to them who did or might have known their errour,
was certainly damnable. And that it was not the <hi>tything of Mint, and
Annise, and Cummin,</hi> the neglect whereof we impute unto you, but <hi>the
neglect of judgement, justice, and the weightier matters of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>87 Fourthly, I am to represent unto you, that you use Protestants
very strangely, in comparing them to a company, who all were <hi>known
to be led to their pretended reformation, not with an intent of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but with some other sinister intention;</hi> which is impossible to be
known of you, and therefore to judge so, is against Christian Charity,
and common equity: and to such <hi>a Company as acknowledge that
themselves, as soone as they were gone out from the Monastery that defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to reforme, must not hope to be free from those or the like Errors, and
Corruptions for which they left their Brethren:</hi> seeing this very hope
and nothing else, moved them to leave your Communion: and this
speech of yours, so farre as it concernes the same errors, plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies
itselfe. For how can they possibly fall into the same errors by
forsaking your Communion, which that they may forsake they doe
forsake your Communion? And then for other errors of the like nature
and quality, or more enormous then yours, though they deny it not
possible, but by their negligence and wickednesse they may fall into
them, yet they are so farre from acknowledging that they have no
hope to avoid this mischiefe, that they proclaime to all the world,
that it is most prone and easy to doe so, to all those that feare God
and love the truth; and hardly possible for them to doe otherwise,
without supine negligence and extream impiety.</p>
               <p>88 To fit the reddition of your perverted Simile, to the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, you tell <hi>us that we teach that for all fundamentall points, the
Church is secured from errour.</hi> I Answer, Fundamentall errors may
signify, either such as are repugnant to Gods command, and so in
their own nature damnable, though to those which out of invincible
ignorance practise them, not unpardonable: or such as are not only
meritoriously, but remedilessely pernitious and destructive of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We hope that yours and the Greeke &amp; other Churches before
the Reformation, had not so farre apostated from Christ, as to be
guilty of errors of the latter sort. We say that not only the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church, but every Particular true Church, so long as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
a Church, is secur'd from Fundamentall errors of this kind, but
secur'd not absolutely by any promise of divine assistance, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not ordinarily irresistible, but temper'd to the nature of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
may be neglected, and therefore withdrawn: but by the Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of any errour in this sense fundamentall to the essence and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Church. So that to speak properly, not any set known com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of men is secur'd, that, though they neglect the meanes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
error, yet certainly they shall not erre, which were necessary
for the constitution of an infallible guide of faith: But rather they
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7615:162"/>
which know what is meant by a Church, are secur'd or rather certain
that a Church remaining a Church, cannot fall into fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
because when it does so, it is no longer a Church. As they are
certain that men cannot become unreasonable creatures, because when
they doe so, they are no longer men. But for fundamentall errors of
the former sort, which yet I hope will warrant our departure from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Communion infected with them, and requiring the Profession of
them, from such fundamentall errors, we doe not teach so much as
that the Church Catholique, much lesse, (which only were for your
purpose,) that your Church hath any protection or security, but
know for a certain, that many errors of this nature, had prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you; and that a vain presumption of an absolute divine assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
(which yet is promised but upon conditions,) made both your
present errors incurable, and exposed you to the imminent danger of
more &amp; greater. This therefore is either to abuse what we say, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
falsely upon us what we say not. And to this you presently adde
another manifest falsehood, <hi>viz.</hi> that we say, <hi>that no particular person
or Church, hath any promise of assistance in points fundamentall.</hi> Whereas
crosse to this in diameter, there is no Protestant but holds, and must
hold, that there is no particular Church, no nor person, but hath
promise of divine assistance to lead them into all necessary truth; if
they seeke it as they should, by the meanes which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And should we say otherwise, we should contrary plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which assures us plainly, that <hi>every one that seeketh findeth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that asketh receiveth:</hi> and that <hi>if we being evill, can give good
gifts to our children, much more shall our heavenly Father, give his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to them that aske it:</hi> and that <hi>if any man want wisdome</hi> (especially
spirituall wisdome) <hi>he is to aske of God, who giveth to all men, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth
not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>89 You obtrude upon us thirdly, <hi>That when Luther began, he
being but one, opposed himselfe to all, as well Subjects as Superiors.</hi> Ans.
If he did so in the cause of God, it was heroically done of him. This
had been without hyperbolizing, <hi>Mundus contra Athanasium,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius
contra Mundum:</hi> neither is it impossible, that <hi>the whole
world should so farre lye in wickednesse</hi> (as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes) that it may
be lawfull and noble for one man to oppose the world. But yet were
we put to our oathes, we should surely not testify any such thing for
you; for how can we say properly and without streining, that <hi>he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himselfe to All,</hi> unlesse we could say also, that All opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to him? And how can we say so, seeing the world can witnesse,
that so many thousands, nay millions followed his standard as soone
as it was advanced?</p>
               <p>90 But, <hi>none that lived immediatly before him thought or spake as
he did.</hi> This is first nothing to the purpose. The Church was then
corrupted, and sure it was no dishonour to him to beginne the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
In the Christian warfare, every man ought to strive to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.
Secondly, it is more then you can justify. For though no man
before him lifted up his voice like a trumpet, as <hi>Luther</hi> did, yet
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7615:163"/>
who can assure us, but that many before him, both thought and spake
in lower voice of petitions and remonstrances, in many points, as he
did?</p>
               <p>91 Fourthly and lastly, whereas you say that <hi>many chiefe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Protestants, are forced to confesse the Antiquity of your Doctrine and
Practise:</hi> I Answer, of many Doctrines and Practises of yours, this is
not true, not pretended to be true by those that have dealt in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
Search your storehouse M. <hi>Brerely,</hi> who hath travailed as
farre in this Northwest discovery, as it was possible for humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
and when you have done so, I pray informe me, what confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Protestants have you, for the Antiquity of the Doctrine of
the Communion in one kinde: the lawfulnesse and expedience of the
Latine service: For the present use of Indulgences: For the Popes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Temporalties over Princes: For the picturing of the Trinity: For
the lawfulnesse of the worship of Pictures: For your Beades and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and Ladies Psalter; and in a word, for your whole worship of the
B. Virgin: For your oblations by way of consumption, &amp; therefore in
the quality of Sacrifices to the Virgin Mary &amp; other Saints: For your
saying of <hi>Pater-nosters,</hi> &amp; Creeds to the honour of Saints, and of <hi>Ave-Maries</hi>
to the honour of other Saints besides the Blessed Virgin: For
infallibility of the Bishop or Church of Rome: For your prohibiting
the Scripture to be read publikely in the Church, in such languages as
all may understand: For your Doctrine of the Blessed Virgins immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
from actuall sinne; and for your doctrine and worship of her
immaculate conception: For the necessity of Auricular Confession:
For the necessity of the Priests Intention to obtain benefit by any of
your Sacraments: And lastly (not to trouble my selfe with finding out
more) for this very doctrine of Licentiousnesse, That though a man
live and dye without the practise of Christian vertues, and with the
habits of many damnable sinnes unmortified, yet if he in the last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life, have any sorrow for his sinnes, and joyne confession with
it, certainly he shall be saved? Secondly, they that confesse some of
your doctrines to have been the Doctrine of the Fathers, may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
being abused by may words and phrases of the Fathers,
which have the Roman sound, when they are farre from the sense.
Some of them I am sure are so, I will name <hi>Goulartius,</hi> who in his
Commentaries on S. <hi>Cyprian's 35. Ep.</hi> grants that the sentence <hi>Heresies
haue sprung, &amp;c.</hi> quoted by you §. 36. of this Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was meant of
<hi>Cornelius:</hi> whereas it will be very plain to any attentive reader, that
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaks there of himselfe. Thirdly, though some Protestants
confesse some of your doctrine to be Ancient, yet this is nothing, so
long as it is evident, even by the confession of all sides, that many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
I instance in that of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the communicating
of Infants, were more ancient. Not any antiquity therefore, unlesse it
be absolute and primitive, is a certain signe of true Doctrine. For if the
Church were obnoxious to corruption (as we pretend it was,) who
can possibly warrant us that part of this corruption, might not get in
and prevaile in the 5. or 4. or 3. or 2. age? Especially seeing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Apostles
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7615:163"/>
assure us that the <hi>mystery of iniquity was working,</hi> though
more secretly eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their times. If any man aske how could it become
universall in so short a time? Let him tell me how the Error of the
Millenaries, and the communicating of Infants, became so soone uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall,
and then he shall acknowledge, what was done in some, was
possible in others. Lastly, to cry quittance with you: As there are
Protestants who confesse the antiquity, but alwaies post-na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique,
of some points of your Doctrine: so there want not Papists
who acknowledge as freely, the novelty of many of them, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of ours. A collection of whose testimony, we have (without
thankes to you) in your <hi>Indices expurgatorij:</hi> The divine Providence,
blessedly abusing for the readier manifestation of the Truth this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
intended by you for the subversion and suppression of it. Here is
no place to stand upon particulars: onely one generall ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of that great <hi>Erasmus,</hi> may not be pass'd over in silence. <hi>Non de
sunt magni Theologi, qui non verentur affirmare, nihil esse in Luthero,
quin per probatos authores defendi possit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Erasm. Ep. lib. 15. Ep. ad Gode schal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum. Ros.</note> There want not great Divines,
which stick not to affirme, that there is nothing in Luther, which may
not be defended by good and allowed authors. Whereas therefore
you close up this Simile with, <hi>consider these points, and see whether your
similitude doe not condemne your Progenitors of Schisme from Gods visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church:</hi> I assure you, I have well considered them, and doe plainly
see that this is not <hi>D. Potters</hi> similitude, but your owne; and besides,
that it is wholly made up of mistakes and falsehoods, and is at no hand
a sufficient proofe of this great Accusation.</p>
               <p>92 Let us come now to the second similitude of your making, in
the entrance whereunto you tell us, that from the <hi>Monastery D. Potter
is fled to an Hospitall of persons Vniversally infected with some disease,
where he findes to be true, what you supposed, that after his departure from
his Brethren, he might fall into greater inconveniences, and more infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diseases then those for which he left them.</hi> Thus you. But to deale
truly with you, I finde nothing of all this, nor how it is consequent
from any thing said by you, or done by D. <hi>Potter.</hi> But this I finde, that
you haue composed this your similitude as you did the former, of a
heap of vaine suppositions, pretended to be grounded on our confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
As first, that <hi>your diseases which we for sook, neither were nor could
be mortall:</hi> whereas we assure our selves, and are ready to justifie, that
they are and were mortall in themselves, and would haue been so to us,
if when light came to us we had loved darknesse more then light. And
D. <hi>Potter</hi> though he hope your Church wanted no necessary vitall
part, that is, that some in your Church by ignorance might bee saved;
yet he nothing doubts but that it is full of ulcers without, and diseases
within, and is so far from extenuating your errours as to make them
only like the superfluous fingers of the gyant of Gath. Secondly,
<hi>that we had no hope to avoid other diseases like those for which wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
your company, nor to be secure out of it from damnable errors:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the hope hereof was the only motive our departure; and we assure
our selves that the meanes to be secured from damnable errour, is not
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7615:164"/>
to be secure as you are, but carefully to use those means of avoiding it,
to which God hath promised, and will never fayle to giue a blessing.
Thirdly, that <hi>those innumerable mischiefes which followed upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of Protestants, were caused by it as by a proper cause:</hi> whereas
their doctrine was no otherwise the occasion of them, then the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Christ of the division of the world. The only fountaine of all
these mischiefes, being indeed no other then your powring out a flood
of persecutions against Protestants, only because they would not sin &amp;
be damn'd with you for company. Vnlesse wee may adde the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of some Protestants, who not enduring to be torne in peeces like
sheep by a company of wolves without resistance, chose rather to dye
like souldiers then Martyrs.</p>
               <p>93 But you proceed, and falling into a fit of admiration, cry out &amp;
say thus, <hi>To what passe hath Heresie brought men, who blush not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the beloved Spouse of the Lord, the only Doue, &amp;c. to a Monastery that
must be forsaken; to the gyant in Gath with superfluous fingers!</hi> but this
<hi>Spouse of Christ,</hi> this <hi>onely Doue,</hi> this <hi>purchase of our Saviours blood,</hi> this
<hi>Catholique Church,</hi> which you thus almost deifie, what is it but a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of men, whereof every particular, and by consequence, the whole
company is or may be guilty of many sinnes daily committed against
knowledge &amp; conscience? Now I would faine understand why one
errour in faith, especially if not fundamentall, should not consist with
the holinesse of this Spouse, this Dove, this Church, as well as many
and great sinnes committed against knowledge and conscience? If
this be not to strain at gnats and swallow camels, I would fain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what it is! And hereby the way I desire you to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as it were with one stroke of a sponge you doe not wipe out all
that you haue said, to proue Protestants Schismatiques for separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from your Church, though supposed to bee in some errours not
fundamentall! <hi>For if any such errour may make her deserue to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to a Monastery so disordered that it must be forsaken;</hi> then if you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
(as here you doe) your Church in such errours, your Church
is so disordered that it must, and therefore without question may be
forsaken, I mean in those her disorders and corruptions, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>94 And yet you haue not done with those similitudes, <hi>But must
observe</hi> (you say) <hi>one thing, and that is, that as these Reformers of the
Monastery, and others who left the diseased company, could not deny but
that they left the said communities: So Luther and the rest cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
not to haue left the visible Church. And that D. Potter speaks very
strangely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saies, In a society of men vniversally infected with some
disease, they that should free themselves from the common disease, could
not be therefore said to separate from the society. For if they doe not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselues from the society of the infected persons, how doe they free
themselues from the common disease?</hi> To which I answer: That indeed
if you speak of the Reformers of a Monastery and of the Deserors of
the diseased company, as you put the cases, that is, of those which left
these communities, then is it as true as Gospell, that they cannot deny
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7615:164"/>
but that they left the said communities. But it appeares not to me how
it will ensue hereupon: that <hi>Luther</hi> and the rest cannot pretend not to
haue left the visible Church. For to my apprehension this Argument
is very weak,</p>
               <p>They which left some communities cannot truly deny but that
they left them; Therefore <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but that they left the visible Church.</p>
               <p>Where me thinks you prove little, but take for granted that which is
one of the greatest Questions amongst us, that is, That the Company
which <hi>Luther</hi> left, was the whole Visible Church: whereas you know
we say, it was but a part of it, and that corrupted, and obstinate in her
corruptions. Indeed that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers left off the Practice
of those Corruptions wherein the whole Visible Church did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
formerly, (which I meant when I acknowledg'd aboue that they
forsook the externall Communion of the Visible Church,) or that
they left that part of the Visible church in her corruptions which
would not be reformed: These things, if you desire, I shall be willing to
grant; and that by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the whole for the part, he might
be said to forsake the Visible Church, that is, a part of it, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part. But that properly speaking, he forsook the whole Visible
Church, I hope you will excuse me if I grant not this, untill you bring
better proofe of it, then your former similitude. And my Reason is
his, because he and his Followers were a part of this Church, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to be so by their Reformation. Now he and his followers cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
forsook not themselves, Therefore not every part of the Church,
therefore not the whole Church. But then if you speak of D. <hi>Potters</hi>
cases, according as he put them, and answer not your owne Arguments,
when you make shew of answering his: me thinks it should not be so
unreasonable as you make it, for the Persons he speaks of to deny
that they left the communities whereof they were Members. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
That the Monkes of S. <hi>Benets</hi> Order make one Body, whereof
their severall Monasteries are severall members, I presume it will be
easily granted. Suppose now that all these Monasteries being quite
out of Order, some 20. or 30. of them should reforme themselves,
the rest persisting still in their irregular couses: were it such a mon.
strous impudence as you make it, for these Monasteries, which we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
reformed, to deny that they forsook their Order or Community
whereof they were parts? In my Opinion it is no such matter. Let the
world judge. Againe, whereas the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> saies, <hi>that in a Society of men
Vniversally infected with some disease, they that should free themselues
from the common disease, could not therefore be said to separate from
the Society:</hi> It is very strange to me that you should say, he speaks very
strangely. Truly S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I am extreamly deceaved if his words be not plain
English, and plain sense, and containe such a manifest Truth as cannot
be denyed with modesty, nor gone about to be proved without vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For whatsoever is proved must be proved by something more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
Now what can be more evident then this; That if some whole
Families were taken with Agues, if the Father of this Family should
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7615:165"/>
free himselfe from his, that he should not therefore deservedly be
thought to abandon and desert his Family? But (say you) if they doe
not separate themselves from the Society of the wicked persons, how
doe they free themselves from the common disease? Doe they at the
same time remaine in the company and yet depart from those infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
creatures? Me thinks a Writer of Controversies should not be
ignorant how this may be done without any such difficulty! But if you
doe not know, I'le tell you. There is no necessity they should leaue the
company of these infected persons at all: much lesse, that they should
at once depart from it and remaine with it, which I confesse were very
difficult. But if they will free themselues from their disease, let them
stay where they are, and take physick. Or if you would be better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
how this strange thing may be done, learne from your selfe, <hi>They
may free their own persons from the common disease, yet so that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
still in the company infected, eating and drinking with them, &amp;c.</hi>
Which are your own words within foure or fiue lines after this: plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewing that your mistaking D. <hi>Potters</hi> meaning, &amp; your wondring
at his words as at some strange monsters, was all this while affected,
and that you are conscious to your selfe of perverting his Argument
that you may seem to say something, when indeed you say nothing.
Whereas therefore you adde, <hi>we must then say that they separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from the persons, though it be by occasion of the disease,</hi> I assure you
good Sir, you must not doe so at any hand; for then you alter &amp; spoile
D. <hi>Potters</hi> case quite, and fight not with his reason but your own sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
For the instance of <hi>a man freeing himselfe from the disease of his
company, and not leaving his company,</hi> is very fit to proue, by the parity
of reason, that it is very possible, a man may leaue the corruptions of
a Church, and not leaue the Church, that is, not cease to be a member
of it: But yours <hi>of a man leaving his company by occasion of their disease,</hi>
hath no analogy at all with this businesse.</p>
               <p>95 But <hi>Luther &amp; his followers did not continue in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of those
from whose diseases they pretend to free themselves.</hi> Very true, neither
was it said they did so. There is no necessity that that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to another thing should agree with it in all things: it is sufficient
if it agree in that wherein it is compared. A man freeing himselfe from
the common disease of a society, and yet continuing a part of it, is here
compared to <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers, freeing themselues from the
corruptions of the visible Church, &amp; continuing a part of the Church.
As for accompanying the other parts of it in all things, it was neither
necessary, nor, without destroying our supposition of their forsaking
the corruptions of the Church, possible. Not necessary; for they may
be parts of the Church which doe not joyne with other parts of it in
all observances. Nor possible, for had he accompanied them in all
things, he had not freed himselfe from the common corruptions.</p>
               <p>96 But they <hi>indeavoured to force the society whereof they were parts
to be healed and reformed as they were; and if it refused, they did, when
they had power driue them away, even their superiours both Spirituall and
Temporall as is notorious.</hi> The proofes hereof are wanting and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7615:165"/>
I might deferre my answer untill they were produced; yet take this
before hand: If they did so, then herein, in my opinion, they did amisse;
for I haue learnt from the ancient Fathers of the Church, that <hi>nothing
is more against Religion then to force Religion,</hi> &amp; of S. <hi>Paul, the weapons
of the Christian warfare are not carnall.</hi> And great reason: For humane
violence may make men counterfeit, but cannot make them believe, &amp;
is therefore fit for nothing but to breed forme without, &amp; Atheisme
within. Besides, if this meanes of bringing men to embrace any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were generally used (as if it may be justly used in any place by those
that haue power, and think they haue truth, certainly they cannot with
reason deny but that it may bee used in every place, by those that haue
power as well as they, and think they haue truth as wel as they,) what
could follow but the maintenance perhaps of truth, but perhaps onely
of the profession of it in one place, &amp; the oppression of it in a hundred?
What will follow from it but the preservation peradventure of unity,
but peradventure only of uniformity in particular States &amp; Churches;
but the immortalizing the greater and more lamentable divisions of
Christendome and the world? And therefore what can follow from
it, but perhaps in the judgement of carnall policie, the temporall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and tranquillity of temporall States and Kingdomes, but the infinit
prejudice, if not the desolation of the kingdome of Christ? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it well becomes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who haue their portions in this life, who serve
no higher State then that of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> nor this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any further then they may serue themselves by it; who thinke of
no other happinesse but the preservation of their own fortunes and
tranquillity in this world; who think of no other meanes to preserve
States, but humane power and Machiavillian policie; and belieue no
other Creed but this, <hi>Regi aut Civitati imperium habenti nihil iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,
quod utile!</hi> Such men as these it may become to maintaine by
worldly power and violence their State instrument, Religion. For if all
be vain and false, (as in their judgement it is) the present whatsoever, is
better then any, because it is already setled: and alteration of it may
draw with it change of States, and the change of State the subversion
of their fortune. But they that are indeed servants and lovers of Christ,
of truth, of the Church, and of man-kinde, ought with all courage to
oppose themselves against it, as a common enemy of all these. They
that know there is a King of Kings and Lord of Lords, by whose will
and pleasure Kings and Kingdomes stand and fall, they know, that to
no King or state any thing can be profitable which is unjust; and that
nothing can be more evidently unjust, then to force weak men by the
profession of a religion which they believe not, to loose their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
happinesse, out of a vain and needlesse feare, least they may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
disturb their temporall quietnesse. There is no danger to any state
from any mans opinion; unlesse it be such an opinion by which disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to authority, or impiety is taught or licenc'd, which sort, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
may justly be punished as well as other faults; or unlesse this san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary
doctrine bee joyn'd with it, that it is lawfull for him by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
violence to enforce others to it. Therefore if Protestants did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7615:166"/>
violence to other mens consciences and compell them to embrace
their Reformation, I excuse them not: much lesse if they did so to the
sacred Persons of Kings, and those that were in authority over them,
who ought to be so secur'd from violence, that even their unjust and
tyrannous violence, though it may be avoided (according to that of our
Saviour, <hi>When they persecute you in one Citty fly into another,</hi>) yet may
it not be resisted by opposing violence against it. Protestants therefore
that were guilty of this crime are not to be excused, and blessed had
they been had they chosen rather to be Martyrs then murderers, and
to dye for their religion rather then to fight for it. But of all the men
in the world you are the most unfit to accuse them hereof, against who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the soules of the Martyrs from under the Altar cry much lowder then
against all their other Persecutors together: Who for these many ages
together haue daily sacrificed <hi>Hecatombes</hi> of innocent Christians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Heretiques, to your blind zeal and furious superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Who teach plainly, that you may propagate your Religion when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
you haue power by deposing of Kings and invasion of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
&amp; think when you kill the adversaries of it, you doe God good
service. But for their departing corporally from them, whom mentally
they had forsaken: For their forsaking the externall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of that part of the unreformed part of the Church, in their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
&amp; impieties: thus much of your accusation we embrace &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in it; And say though some Protestants might offend in the manner
or the degree of their separation, yet certainly their separation it selfe
was not Schismaticall, but innocent, and not only so, but just and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
And as for your obtruding upon D. <hi>Potter</hi> that he should say,
<hi>There neither was nor could be iust cause to doe so, no more then to depart
from Christ himselfe.</hi> I haue shewed divers times already, that you sdeal
very injuriously with him, confounding together, <hi>Departing from the
Church,</hi> and <hi>Departing from some generall opinions and practises,</hi> which
did not constitute but vitiate, not make the Church but marre it. For
though he saies, that which is most true, that <hi>there can be no iust cause
to depart from the Church,</hi> that is, to cease being a member of the
Church, <hi>no more then to depart from Christ himself,</hi> in as much as these
are not divers but the same thing, yet he no where denies, but there
might be iust and necessary cause to depart from some opinions and
practises of your Church, nay of the Catholique Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you doe vainly to infer, that <hi>Luther and his followers for so doing,
were Schismatiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>97 <hi>Ad</hi> § 35. I answer in a word, that neither are <hi>Optatus</hi> his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
rules of Faith, and therefore not fit to determine Controversies of
Faith: And then that <hi>Majorinus</hi> might well be a Schismatique for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from <hi>Ca cilianus,</hi> and the Chayre of <hi>Cyprian</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> without
cause, and yet <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers who departed from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Bishop of Rome, and the Bishop of their own Diocesse
be none, because they had just and necessary cause of their departure.
For otherwise they must haue continued in the profession of known
Errours and the practise of manifest corruptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:7615:166"/>
98 <hi>Ad</hi> § 36. In the next Section you tell us, that <hi>Christ our Lord
gaue S. Peter &amp; his successors authority over his whole Militant Church.</hi>
And for proof hereof <hi>you first referre us to Brerely, citing exactly the
places of such cheefe Protestants as haue confessed the antiquity of this
point.</hi> Where first you fall into the Fallacy which is called <hi>Ignoratio
elenchi,</hi> or mistaking the Question; for being to proue this point
true, you onely prove it ancient. Which, to what purpose is it, when
both the parties litigant are agreed that many errors were held by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the ancient Doctors, much more ancient then any of those who
are pretended to be confessed by Protestants to haue held with you in
this matter: and when those whom you haue to doe with, and whom
it is vain to dispute against but out of Principles received by them, are
all peremptory, that though novelty be a certain note of falshood, yet
no antiquity lesse then Apostolicall is a certain note of truth? Yet this
I say not as if I did acknowledge what you pretend, that Protestants
did confesse the Fathers against them in this point. For the point here
issuable is not, whether S. <hi>Peter</hi> were head of the Church? Nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Bishop of Rome had any priority in the Church? Nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had authority over it given him by the Church? But whether
by Divine right, and by Christs appointment he were Head of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church? Now having perused <hi>Brerely,</hi> I cannot find any one
Protestant confessing any one Father to haue concurred in opinion
with you in this point. And the Reader hath reason to suspect, that you
also out of all the Fathers could not finde any one authority pertinent
to this purpose: for otherwise you were much to blame, citing so few,
to make choice of such as are impertinent. For let the understanding
Reader peruse the 55. <hi>Epist.</hi> of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> with any ordinary attention,
out of which you take your first place, and I am confident hee shall
finde that he meanes nothing else by the words quoted by you, But
that in one particular Church at one time there ought to bee but one
Bishop, and that he should be obeyed in all things lawfull: The non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance
whereof was one of the most ordinary causes of heresies
against the Faith, and Schisme from the Communion of the Church
Vniversall. He shall finde secondly, and that by many convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that though he write to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of Rome, yet hee
speaks not of him, but of himselfe then Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> against
whom a faction of Schismatiques had then set up another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here your ingenuitie is to bee commended aboue many of your
side: For whereas they ordinarily abuse this place to prove, that in the
whole Church there ought to be but one Priest and one Iudge; you
seem somewhat diffident hereof, and thereupon say, <hi>that these words
plainly condemne Luther, whether he will understand them as spoken of
the Vniversall or of every particular Church.</hi> But whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<hi>Luther</hi> is another Question. The question here is, whether they
plainly proue the Popes Supremacy over al other Bishops? which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they are as far from proving, as from proving the supremacy of
any other Bishop: seeing it is evident they were intended not of one
Bishop over the whole Catholique Church, but of one Bishop in one
particular Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:7615:167"/>
99 And no lesse impertinent is your saying out of <hi>Optatus,</hi> if it be
well lookt into, though at the first sight it may seem otherwise; because
<hi>Optatus</hi> his scene happened to be <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> was <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi>
The truth is the Donatists had set up at <hi>Rome</hi> a Bishop of their
faction: not with intent to make him Bishop of the whole Church but of
that Church in particular. Now <hi>Optatus</hi> going upon S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> aboue
mentioned ground of <hi>one Bishop in one Church,</hi> proves them Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques
for so doing, and he proves it by this Argument: S. <hi>Peter</hi> was
first Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither did the Apostles attribute to themselves
each one his particular Chaire, (understand <hi>in that Citty,</hi> for in other
places others I hope had Chaires besides S. <hi>Peter</hi>) and therefore he is
a Schismatique, who against that one single Chaire erects another (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
as before, <hi>in that place</hi>) making another Bishop of that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
besides him who was lawfully elected to it.</p>
               <p>100 But <hi>yet by the way he stiles S. Peter head of the Apostles, and
saies that from thence he was called Cephas.</hi> Ans. Perhaps he was abused
into this opinion, by thinking <hi>Cephas</hi> derived from the greeke word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a head: whereas it is a Syriack word and signifies a stone. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
S. <hi>Peter</hi> might be head of the Apostles, that is, first in order
and honour among them, and not have supreme Authority over
them. And indeed that S. <hi>Peter</hi> should have authority overall the
Apostles, and yet exercise no one act of Authority over any one of
them, and that they should shew to him no signe of subjection, me
thinkes is as strange, as that a King of England for twenty five yeares
should doe no Act of Regality, nor receive any one acknowledgement
of it. As strange me thinks it is, that you so many ages after, should
know this so certainly, as you pretend to doe, and that the Apostles
(after that those words were spoken in their hearing, by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
S. <hi>Peter</hi> is pretended to have been made their head,) should still be
so ignorant of it, as to question <hi>which of them should be the greatest?</hi>
yet more strange, that our Saviour should not bring them out of their
error, by telling them S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the man, but rather confirme it
by saying, <hi>the Kings of the Gentiles exercise authority over them, but it
should not be so among them.</hi> No lesse a wonder was it that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
should so farre forget S. <hi>Peter</hi> and himselfe, as that first mentioning
him often, he should doe it without any title of Honour. Secondly,
speaking of the severall degrees of men in the Church, he should not
give S. <hi>Peter</hi> the highest, but place him in equipage with the rest of the
Apostles, and say, <hi>God hath appointed</hi> (not <hi>first Peter, then the rest</hi> of
the Apostles, but) <hi>first Apostles, secondly Prophets.</hi> Certainly if the
Apostles were <hi>all first,</hi> to me it is very probable, that no one of them
was before the rest. For by <hi>First,</hi> all men understand either that
which is before all, or that before which is nothing. Now in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sense, the Apostles could not be all first, for then every one of
them must have been before every one of the rest. And therefore they
must be <hi>First</hi> in the other sense. And therefore No man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not S. <hi>Peter,</hi> must be before any of them. Thirdly and Lastly, that
speaking of himselfe in particular, and perhaps comparing himselfe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7615:167"/>
with S. <hi>Peter</hi> in particular, rather then any other, he should say in plain
termes, <hi>I am in nothing inferior to the very chiefest Apostles.</hi> But besides
all this, Though we should grant against all these probabilities and
many more, that <hi>Optatus</hi> meant that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was head of the Apostles,
not in our but in your sense, and that S. <hi>Peter</hi> indeed was so; yet still
you are very farre from shewing, that in the judgement of <hi>Optatus,</hi> the
Bishop of Rome, was to be at all, much lesse by divine right, successor to
S. <hi>Peter</hi> in this his Headship &amp; Authority. For what inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruity is there,
if we say, that he might succeed S. <hi>Peter</hi> in that part of his care, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of that particular Church, (as sure he did even while S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was living,) and yet that neither he nor any man was to succeed
him in his Apostleship, nor in his government of the Church Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall?
Especially seeing S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, by laying
the foundations of the Church, were to be the <hi>Foundations of it,</hi> and
accordingly are so called in Scripture. And therefore as in a building it
is incongruous that foundations should succeed foundations: So it may
be in the Church, that any other Apostle should succeed the first.</p>
               <p>101 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 37. The next Paragraph I might well passe over, as
having no Argument in it. For there is nothing in it but two sayings
of S. <hi>Austine,</hi> which I have great reason to esteeme no Argument, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
you will promise me, to grant whatsoever I shall prove by two
sayings of S. <hi>Austine.</hi> But moreover, the second of these sentences
seemes to me, to imply the contradiction of the first. For to say, <hi>That
the Sacriledge of Schisme is eminent, when there is no cause of separation,</hi>
implyes to my understanding, that there may be a cause of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now in the first, he saies plainly <hi>That this is impossible.</hi> Neither
doth any reconciliation of his wordes occurre to me, but only this,
that in the former he speaks upon supposition, that the Publique ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, where in men are to communicate is unpolluted, and no
unlawfull thing practised in their communion, which was so true of
their communion, that the Donatists who separated did not deny it.
And to make this Answer no improbable evasion, it is observable out
of S. <hi>Austine</hi> and <hi>Optatus,</hi> that though the Donatists, at the beginning
of their Separation, pretended no cause for it, but only that the men
from whom they separated, were defiled with the contagion of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
yet afterwards, to make the continuance of it more justifiable,
they did invent and spread abroad this calumny against Catholiques,
that they set pictures upon their Altars: which when S. <hi>Austine</hi> comes
to Answer, he does not deny the possibility of the thing, for that
had been to deny the Catholique Church to be made up of men, all
which had free will to evill, and therefore might possibly agree in doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and had he denyed this, the Action of after Ages had been his
refutation: Neither does he say, (as you would have done,) that it
was true, they placed pictures there, and moreover worshipped them,
but yet not for their own sakes, but for theirs who were represented
by them: Neither does he say, (as you doe in this Chapter) that
though this were granted a Corruption, yet were they not to separate
for it. What then does he? certainly nothing else, but abhorre the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:7615:168"/>
thing, and deny the imputation: Which way of answering, does not
I confesse plainly shew, but yet it somewhat intimates that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to answer; and that if he could not have denyed this, he
could not have denyed the Donatists separation from them to have
been just. If this Answer, to this little Argument seem not sufficient, I
adde moreover, that if it be applyed to <hi>Luthers</hi> separation, it hath the
common fault of all your Allegations out of Fathers, impertinence.
For it is one thing to separate from the Communion of the whole
world, another to separate from all the Communions in the world:
One thing to divide from them who are united among themselves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to diuide from them who are divided among themselves. Now
the Donatists separated from the whole World of Christians, united
in one Communion, professing the same Faith, serving God after the
same manner, which was a very great Argument, that they could not
have just cause to leave them: according to that of <hi>Tertullian, Varias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
debuerat error Ecclesiarum, quod autem apud multos unumest, non est
Erratum sed Traditum.</hi> But <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers did not so. The
world, I mean of Christians and Catholiques, was divided and subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
long before hee divided from it; and by their divisions had
much weakned their own Authority, and taken away from you this
plea of S. <hi>Austine,</hi> which stands upon no other Foundation, but the
Vnity of the whole worlds Communion.</p>
               <p>102 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 38. If <hi>Luther were in the right, most certain those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
that differed from him were in the wrong:</hi> But that either he or
they were Schismatiques, it followes not. Or if it does, then either the
Iesuits are Schismatiques from the Dominicans, or they from the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits;
The Canonists from the Iesuites, or the Iesuites from the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists:
The Scotists from the Thomists, or they from the Scotists: The
Franciscans from the Dominicans, or the Dominicans from the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans.
For between all these the world knowes; that in point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
there is plain and irreconcileable contradiction, and therefore
one Part must be in error, at least not Fundamentall. Thus your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
returnes upon your selfe, and if it be good, proves the Roman
Church in a manner to bee made up of Schismatiques. But the
Answer to it is, that it begges this very false and vain supposition; That
whosoever erres in any point of doctrine is a Schismatique.</p>
               <p>103 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 39. In the next place you number up your victories,
and tell us, <hi>that out of these premises, this conclusion followes, That Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his followers were Schismatiques from the Visible Church, the
Pope, the Diocesse wherein they were baptized, from the Bishop vnder
whom they lived, from the country to which they belonged, from their
Religious order, wherein they were professed, from one another, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from a mans selfe: Because the selfesame Protestant is convicted to day,
that his yesterdaies opinion was an error.</hi> To which I Answer, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
and his followers separated from many of these, in some opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and practices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that they did it without cause, which only
can make them Schismatiques, that was the only thing you should
have prov'd, and to that you have not urged one reason of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:7615:168"/>
All of them for weight and strength, were cosen-germans to
this pretty device, wherewith you will prove them Schismatiques
from themselves, <hi>because the selfesame Protestant to day is convicted
in conscience, that his yesterdaies opinion was an error.</hi> It seemes then
that they that hold errors, must hold them fast, and take speciall care
of being convicted in conscience, that they are in error, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Schismatiques! Protestants must continue Protestants, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans
Puritans, and Papists Papists, nay Iewes, and Turkes, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
must remain Iewes, and Turkes, and Pagans, and goe on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
to the Divell, or else forsooth they must be <hi>Schismatiques,</hi> and
that <hi>from themselves.</hi> And this perhaps is the cause that makes Papists
so obstinate, not only in their common superstition, but also in adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the proper phancies of their severall Sects, so that it is a miracle
to heare of any Iesuite, that hath forsaken the opinion of the Iesuites:
or any Dominican that hath chang'd his for the Iesuits. Without
question, this Gentleman my Adversary knowes none such, or else me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
he should not have objected it to D. <hi>Potter (That he knew a man
in the world who from a Puritan, was turned to a moderate Protestant,</hi>
which is likely to bee true. But sure if this bee all his fault, hee hath
no reason to be ashamed of his acquaintance. For possibly it may be
a fault to be in error, because many times it proceeds from a fault: But
sure the forsaking of error cannot be a sinne, unlesse to be in error be
a vertue. And therefore, to doe as you doe, to damne men for false
opinions, and to call them Schismatiques for leaving them; to make
pertinacy in error, that is, an unwillingnesse to be convicted, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
not to be convicted, the forme of Heresies, and to find fault
with men, for being convicted in conscience that they are in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
is the most incoherent and contradictious injustice that ever was
heard of. But Sir, if this be a strange matter to you, that which I shall
tell you will be much stranger. I know a man that of a moderate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
turn'd a Papist, and the day that he did so, (as all things that
are done are perfected some day or other,) was convicted in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that his yesterdaies opinion was an error, and yet thinks
hee was no Schismatique for doing sos, and desires to bee informed
by you, whether or no hee was mistaken? The same man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon better consideration, became a doubting Papist, and
of a doubting Papist, a confirm'd Protestant. And yet this man
thinks himselfe no more to blame for all these changes, then a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer,
who using all diligence to find the right way to some remote
Citty, where he never had been, (as the party I speak of had never
been in Heaven,) did yet mistake it, and after finde his error, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it. Nay he stands upon his justification so farre, as to maintain
that his alterations, not only to you, but also from you by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
were the most satisfactory actions to himselfe, that ever he did,
and the greatest victories that ever he obtained over himselfe, and his
affections to those things which in this world are most precious; as
wherein for Gods sake and (as he was verily perswaded,) out of love
to the Truth, he went upon a certain expectation of those inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7615:169"/>
which to ingenuous natures are of all most terrible. So that
though there were much weaknesse in some of these alterations, yet
certainly there was no wickednesse. Neither does he yeeld his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
altogether without apology, seeing his deductions were ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and out of Principles commonly received by Protestants as well
as Papists, and which by his education had got possession of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>104 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 40. 41. D. <hi>Potter</hi> p. 81. of his booke, to prove our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from you, not only lawfull but necessary, hath these words,
<hi>Although we confesse the Church of Rome</hi> (in some sense) <hi>to be a true
Church, and her error</hi> (to some men) <hi>not damnable; yet for us who are
convinced in conscience, that she erres in many things, a necessity lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, even under pain of damnation, to forsake her in those errors.</hi> He
meanes not, in the belief of those errors; for that is presupposed to be
done already: for whosoever is convinc'd in conscience that she erres,
hath for matter of belief forsaken, that is, ceased to believe those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
This therefore he meant not, nor could not meane: but that
whosoever is convinc'd in conscience, that the Church of Rome
erres, cannot with a good conscience but forsake her in the profession
and practice of these errors: and the reason hereof is manifest; because
otherwise, he must professe what he believes not, and practise what he
approves not. Which is no more then you selfe in <hi>thesi</hi> have diverse
times affirmed. For in one place you say, <hi>It is unlawfull to speak any the
least untruth:</hi> Now he that professeth your Religion, and believes it
not, what else doth he but live in a perpetuall lye! Again in another,
<hi>you have called them that professe one thing and believe another, a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
crew of dissembling Sycophants:</hi> And therefore in inveighing against
Protestants for forsaking the Profession of these errors, the beleefe
whereof they had already forsaken, what doe you but raile at them
for not being a <hi>damned crew of dissembling Sycophants?</hi> And lastly §.
42. of this chap. within three leaves after this, whereas <hi>D. Potter
grants but only a necessity of peaceable externall obedience to the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Church, though perhaps erroneous, (provided it be in matter
not of faith, but of opinions or Rites,</hi>) condemning those men who by
occasion of errors of this quality, disturbe the Churches peace, and
cast off her communion: Vpon this occasion you come upon him
with this bitter sarcasme, <hi>I thank you for your ingenuous confession, in
recompence whereof I will doe a deed of Charity, by putting you in minde
into what Labyrinths you are brought, by teaching that the Church may
erre in some points of faith, and yet that it is not lawfull for any man to
oppose his judgement or leave her Communion, though he have evidence
of Scripture against her! Will you have such a man dissemble against his
Conscience, or externally deny Truth known to be contained in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
I Answer for him, no: It is not he but you, that would have
men doe so: not he, who saies plainly, that <hi>whosoever is convinc'd in
conscience that any Church erres, is bound under pain of damnation to
forsake her in her Profession and practice of these errors:</hi> but you, who
finde fault with him, and make long discourse against him, for thus
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7615:169"/>
Affirming. Not he who can easily winde himselfe out of your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Labyrinth, by telling you, that he no where denies it lawfull
for any man to oppose any Church, erring in matter of faith, for that
he speaks not of matters of faith at all, but only <hi>of Rites and Opinions.</hi>
And in such matters, he saies indeed at first, <hi>It is not lawfull for any
man to oppose his judgement to the publique:</hi> But he presently explaines
himselfe by saying, not only that he <hi>may hold an opinion contrary to
the Publique resolution, but besides that he may offer it to be considered
of,</hi> (so farre is he from requiring any sinfull dissimulation,) <hi>Provided,
he doe it with great Probability of Reason, very modestly and respectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and without separation from the Churches communion. It is not
therefore in this case, opposing a mans private judgement to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
simply, which the Doctor findes fault with: But the degree on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and malice of this opposition, <hi>opposing it factiously.</hi> And not hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a mans own conceit, different from the Church absolutely, which
here he censures: But a <hi>factious advancing it, and despising the Church,
so farre as to cast off her Communion,</hi> because forsooth she erres in some
opinion, or useth some inconvenient, though not impious rites and
ceremonies. Little reason therefore have you to accuse him there, as
if he required <hi>that men should dissemble against their conscience, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
deny a truth known to be contained in holy Scripture.</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a great deale lesse, to quarrell with him, for saying (which is all
that here he saies,) that <hi>men under pain of demnation, are not to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but if they be convinc'd in conscience, that your, or any other Church</hi>
(for the reason is alike for all,) <hi>erres in many things, are of necessity to
forsake that Church, in the Profession and practice of those errors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>105 But to consider your exception to this speech of the Doctors,
somewhat more particularly: I say your whole discourse against it, is
compounded of <hi>falsehoods</hi> and <hi>impertinencies.</hi> The first falsehood is,
that he in these words avoucheth, <hi>that no learned Catholiques can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi>
Vnlesse you will suppose, that all learned Catholiques are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
in conscience, that your Church erres in many things. It may
well be fear'd that many are so convinc'd, and yet professe what they
believe not. Many more have been, and have stifled their consciences,
by thinking it an act of humility, to doe so. Many more would have
beene, had they with liberty and indifference of judgement, examined
the grounds of the Religion which they professe. But to think that
all the Learned of your side, are actually convinc'd of errors in your
Church, and yet will not forsake the profession of them, this is so
great an uncharitablenesse, that I verily believe, D. <hi>Potter</hi> abhorres it.
Your next falsehood is, <hi>That the Doctor affirmes, that you Catholiques
want no meanes to Salvation:</hi> and that he judges <hi>the Roman errors not to
be in themselves fundamentall or damnable.</hi> Which calumny I have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often confuted: and in this very place it is confuted by <hi>D. Potter,</hi>
and confessed by your selfe. For in the beginning of this Answer you
tell us, that the <hi>Doctor avouches of all Catholiques whom ignorance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excuse, that they cannot be saved.</hi> Certainly then he must needs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
them to want something necessary to Salvation. And then in
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7615:170"/>
the Doctors saying, it is remarkable that he confesses <hi>your errors to
some men not damnable:</hi> which cleerely imports, that according to his
judgement, they were damnable in themselves, though by accident to
them who lived and died in invincible ignorance, and with repentance,
they might prove not damnable. A third is, that these <hi>Assertions, the
Roman Errors are in themselves not damnable, and yet it is damnable
for me (who know them to be errors,) to hold and confesse them, are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
inconsistent;</hi> which is false; for be the matter what it will, yet for
a man to tell a lye, especially in matter of Religion, cannot but be
damnable. How much more then, to goe on in a course of lying by
professing to believe these things divine Truths, which he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
to be falsehoods and fables? A fourth is, that <hi>if we erred in
thinking that your Church holds errors, this error or erroneous conscience
might be rectifyed and deposed, by judging those errors not damnable.</hi> For
what repugnance is there between these two suppositions, that you
doe hold some errors, and that they are not damnable? And if there
be no repugnance between them, how can the beleefe of the latter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
or destroy, or if it be erroneous, rectify the belief of the former?
Nay seeing there is a manifest consent between them, how can it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
but the belief of the latter, will maintaine and preserve the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the former? For who can conjoyne in one braine not crackt,
(pardon me, if I speake to you in your own words,) these Assertions:
In the Roman Church there are errors not damnable, and, in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church there are no errors at all? Or what sober understanding
would ever think this a good collection, I esteeme the errors of the
Roman Church not damnable, therefore I doe amisse to think that she
erres at all? If therefore you would have us alter our judgements,
that your Church is erroneous, your only way is to shew, your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
consonant, at least not evidently repugnant to Scripture and
Reason. For as for this device, this short cut, of perswading our selves
that you hold no errours, because we believe your errors are not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
assure your selfe it will never hold.</p>
               <p>106 A fift falsehood is, <hi>That we daily doe this favour for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
you must mean (if you speak consequently) to judge <hi>they have
no errors, because we judge they have none damnable.</hi> Which the world
knowes to be most untrue. And for our continuing in their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
notwithstanding their errors, the justification hereof, is not so
much, that their errors are not damnable: as that they require not the
beliefe and profession of these errors, among the conditions of their
communion. Which puts a main difference between them and you:
because we may continue in their communion without professing to
believe their opinions, but in yours we cannot. A sixt is, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Doctrine of all Divines, there is any difference between a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
perswasion of conscience, of the unlawfulnesse of any thing, and
a practicall Dictamen that the same thing is unlawfull.</hi> For these are but
diverse words signifying the same thing, neither is such a perswasion
wholly speculative, but tending to practice: nor such a dictame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wholly
practicall, but grounded upon speculation. A Seventh is, <hi>That Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7615:170"/>
did only conceive in speculation, that the Church of Rome erred in
some doctrines,</hi> and had not also a practicall dictamen, that it was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
for them to continue in the profession of these errors. An eighth
is, that <hi>it is not lawfull to separate from any Churches communion, for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
not appertaining to the substance of Faith:</hi> which is not universally
true, but with this exception, unlesse that Church requires the belief
and profession of them. The ninth is, that <hi>D. Potter teacheth that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was bound to forsake the house of God, for an unnecessary light.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
manifestly by <hi>D. Potter</hi> in this very place, for by the house of
God you mean the Roman Church, and of her the Doctor saies: <hi>that
a necessity did lye upon him, even under pain of damnation, to forsake the
Church of Rome in her errors.</hi> This sure is not to say, that he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to forsake her, for an unnecessary light. The tenth is covertly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in your intimation, <hi>that Luther and his followers were the proper
cause of the Christian worlds combustion:</hi> Whereas indeed the true cause
of this lamentable effect, was your violent persecution of them, for
serving God according to their conscience, which if it be done to you,
you condemne of horrible impiety, and therefore may not hope to be
excused, if you doe it to others.</p>
               <p>107 The eleaventh is, that our <hi>first reformers ought to have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whether their opinions were certain.</hi> Which is to say, that they ought
to have doubted of the certainty of Scripture: which in formall and
expresse termes, containes many of these opinions. And the reason of
this assertion is very vaine: <hi>for though they had not an absolute infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
promised unto them,</hi> yet may they be of some things infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
As <hi>Euclide</hi> sure was not infallible, yet was he certain enough,
that <hi>twice two were foure,</hi> and <hi>that every whole was greater then a part
of that whole.</hi> And so though <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp; <hi>Melanctho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> were not infallible in
all things, yet they might and did know well enough, that your Latine
Service was condemned by S. <hi>Paule,</hi> and that the communion in both
kindes was taught by our Saviour. The twelfth and last is this, that
<hi>your Church was in peaceable possession</hi> (you must mean of her doctrine,
and the Professors of it,) <hi>and enjoyed prescription for many ages.</hi> For
besides, that doctrine is not a thing that may be possessed: And the
professors of it were the Church it selfe, and in nature of possessors, (If
we may speak improperly,) rather then the thing possessed, with
whom no man hath reason to be offended, if they think fit to quit their
own possession: I say that the possession, which the governors of your
Church held for some ages, of the party governed, was not peaceable,
but got by fraude, and held by violence.</p>
               <p>108 These are the <hi>Falshoods</hi> which in this answer offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to any attentive Reader, and that which remaines is meere <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence.</hi>
As first, that <hi>a pretence of conscience will not serve to iustifie
separation from being Schismaticall.</hi> Which is true: but little to the
purpose, seeing it was not an erroneous perswasion, much lesse an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
pretence, but a true and well grounded conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which D. <hi>Potter</hi> alleaged to justifie Protestants from being
Schismaticall. And therefore though seditious men in Church and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7615:171"/>
State, may pretend conscience, for a cloak of their rebellion: yet this I
hope hinders not, but that an honest man ought to obey his rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
conscience, rather then the unjust commands of his tyrannous
Superiours. Otherwise with what colour can you defend either your
own refusing the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy? Or the ancient
Martyrs, and Apostles, and Prophets, who oftentimes disobeyed the
commands of men in authority, and for their disobedience made no
other but this Apologie, <hi>Wee must obey God rather then men?</hi> It is
therefore most apparent that this answer must be meerly impertinent:
seeing it will serve against the Martyrs and Apostles and Prophets, &amp;
even against your selues, as well as against Protestants. To as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is your rule out of <hi>Lyrinensis</hi> against them that followed <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ther,</hi>
seeing they pretend and are ready to justify, that they forsook not, with
the Doctors, the faith, but only the corruption of the Church. As vain
altogether is that which follows: That <hi>in cases of uncertainty we are
not to leave our Superiour, or cast off his obedience, nor publiquely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his decrees.</hi> From whence it will follow very evidently, that
seeing it is not a matter of faith, but a disputed question among you,
whether the Oath of Allegiance be lawfull: that either you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not the King your Superiour, or doe against conscience, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his and the kingdomes decree, requiring the taking of this Oath.
This good use I say may very fairely bee made of it, and is by men of
your own religion. But then it is so far from being a confutation, that
it is rather a confirmation of D. <hi>Potters</hi> assertion. For hee that useth
these words, doth he not plainly import (and such was the case of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,)
that we are to leaue our Superiours, to cast off obedience to
them, and publiquely to oppose their Decrees, when we are certain (as
Protestants were,) that what they command, God doth countermand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Lastly, S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> example is against Protestants impertinently and
even ridiculously alleaged. <hi>For what if S. Cyprian holding his opinion
true but not necessary, condemned no man (much lesse any Church) for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the contrary?</hi> Yet me thinks this should lay no obligation upon
<hi>Luther</hi> to doe so likewise: seeing he held his own opinions not onely
true but also necessary, &amp; the doctrine of the Roman Church not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false but damnable. And therefore seeing the condition and state of
the parties censured by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> was so different, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
though their censures also were different according to the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
merit of the parties delinquent. For as for your obtruding again
upon us, <hi>that we believe the points of difference not Fundamentall or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessary,</hi>
you have been often told that it is a calumny. We hold your
errors as damnable in themselves as you doe ours, only by accident
through invincible ignorance, we hope they are not unpardonable:
and you also professe to think the same of ours.</p>
               <p>109 <hi>Ad</hi> § 42. The former part of this discourse, grounded on D.
<hi>Potters</hi> words p. 105. I haue already in passing examined &amp; confuted:
I adde in this place. 1. That though the Doctor say, <hi>It is not fit for any
private man to oppose his iudgement to the publique,</hi> That is, his own
judgement and bare authority: yet he denies not, but occasions may
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7615:171"/>
happen wherein it may be very warrantable, to oppose his reason or
the authority of Scripture against it. And is not then to be esteem'd to
oppose his own judgement to the publique, but the judgment of God
to the judgement of men. Which his following words seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<hi>He may offer his opinion to be considered of, so he do it with evidence
or great probability of Scripture or reason.</hi> Secondly, I am to tell you
that you haue no ground from him, to enterline his words with that
interrogatory (<hi>His own conceits, and yet grounded upon evidence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</hi>)
For these things are in his words opposed, and not confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the latter, not intended for a repetition (as you mistake it) but
for an Antithesis of the former. <hi>He may offer</hi> (saith he) <hi>his opinion to
be considered of, so he doe it with evidence of Scripture. But if hee will
factiously advance his own conceits,</hi> (that is, say I, clean contrary to
your glosse,) <hi>Such as have not evident nor very probable ground in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
(for these conceits are properly his own) <hi>he may iustly bee bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
&amp;c.</hi> Now that this of the two is the better glosse, it is proved by
your own interrogation. For that imputes absurdity to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> for
calling them a mans <hi>own conceits,</hi> which were <hi>grounded upon evidence
of Scripture.</hi> And therefore you have shewed little candour or equity,
in fastning upon them this absurd construction. They not only bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
but even requiring another more faire and more sensible. Every
man ought to be presum'd to speak sense, rather then non-sense, cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
rather then contradictiously, if his words be fairely capable of
a better construction. For M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> if writing against Puritans, he
had said something unawares that might give advantage to Papists it
were not inexcusable: seeing it is a matter of such extreme difficulty,
to hold such a temper in opposing one extreme opinion, as not to
seem to favour the other. Yet if his words be rightly consider'd, there
is nothing in them that will doe you any service. For though he saies
that <hi>men are bound to doe whatsoever the sentence of finall decision shall
determine,</hi> as it is plain men are bound to yeeld such an obedience to
all Courts of civill judicature: yet he saies not, they <hi>are bound to think</hi>
that determination lawfull, and that sentence just. Nay it is plain hee
saies, that they <hi>must doe according to the Iudges sentence, though in their
private opinion it seem uniust.</hi> As if I be cast wrongfully in a suit at law,
and sentenced to pay an hundred pound, I am bound to pay the mony,
yet I know no law of God or man, that binds me in conscience to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
the Iudge of errour in his sentence. The question therefore being
only what men ought to think, it is vain for you to tell us what M. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
saies at all. For M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> though an excellent man, was but a
man. And much more vain, to tell us out of him, what men ought to
doe, for point of externall obedience. When in the very same place, he
supposeth and alloweth, that in their private opinion they may think,
this sentence to which they yeeld a passive obedience, to swarve utterly
from that which is right. If you will draw his words to such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
as if he had said, they <hi>must think the sentence of iudiciall and
finall decision iust and right, though it seem in their private opinion to
swarue utterly from what is right;</hi> It is manifest you make him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7615:172"/>
himselfe, &amp; make him say in effect, They must think thus, though
at the same time they think the contrary. Neither is there any <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that hee must either acknowledge the universall infallibility of the
Church, or driue men into dissembling against their conscience,</hi> seeing
nothing hinders, but I may obey the sentence of a Iudge, paying the
mony he awards me to pay, or forgoing the house or land which hee
hath judged from me, and yet withall plainly professe, that in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
I conceive his judgement erroneous. To which purpose they
haue a saying in France, that <hi>whosoever is cast in any cause, hath liberty
for ten daies after, to rayle at his Iudges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>110 This answer to this place, the words themselves offered mee,
even as they are alleaged by you: But upon perusall of the place in the
Author himselfe, I finde that here, as elsewhere you and M. <hi>Brerely</hi>
wrong him extremely. For mutilating his words, you make him say
that absolutely, which he there expresly limits to some certain cases.
<hi>In litigious and controverted causes of such a quality</hi> (saith he) <hi>the will
of God, is to haue them doe whatsoever the sentence of iudiciall and finall
decision shall determine.</hi> Obserue, I pray, He saies not absolutely and in
all causes, this is the will of God: But only <hi>in litigious causes, of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of those whereof he there entreats.</hi> In such matters, as haue plaine
Scripture or reason, neither for them nor against them, and wherein
men are perswaded this or that way, <hi>Vpon their own only probable colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
In such cases, <hi>This perswasion</hi> (saith he) <hi>ought to bee fully setled in
mens hearts, that the will of God is, that they should not disobey the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
commands of their lawfull superiors, upon uncertain grounds: But doe
that which the sentence of iudiciall and finall decision shall determine.</hi> For
the purpose, a Question there is, whether a Surplice may be worne in
Divine service: The authority of Superiors injoynes this Ceremony,
and neither Scripture nor reason plainely forbids it. <hi>Sempronius</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
is by some inducements, which he confesses to be onely
probable, lead to this perswasion that the thing is unlawfull. The <hi>quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
is, whether he ought for matter of practise follow the injunction of
authority, or his own private and only probable perswasion? M. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
resolves for the former, upon this ground, that the <hi>certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Church we liue in, are to be obeyed in all things, not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unlawfull.</hi> Which rule is your own, and by you extended to the
commands of all Superiors, in the very next Section before this, in
these words, <hi>In cases of uncertainty we are not to leaue our Superiour, nor
cast off his obedience, or publiquely oppose his decrees.</hi> And yet if a man
should conclude upon you, that either you make all Superiours univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
infallible, or else driue men into perplexities and labyrinths of
doing against conscience, I presume you would not think your self
fairely dealt with; but alleage, that your words are not extended to all
cases, but limited <hi>to cases of uncertainty.</hi> As little therefore ought you
to make this deduction from M. <hi>Hookers</hi> words, which are apparently
also restrained to <hi>cases of uncertainty.</hi> For as for requiring a blind and
an unlimited obedience, to Ecclesiasticall decisions universally and
in all cases, even when plain Text or reason seemes to controule them,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7615:172"/>
M. <hi>Hooker</hi> is as far from making such an Idol of Ecclesiasticall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as the Puritans whom he writes against. <hi>I grant</hi> (saith he,) <hi>that
proof derived from the authority of mans iudgement, is not able to worke
that assurance which doth grow by a stronger proofe. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ten thousand Generall Councels would set down one and the same
definitiue sentence, concerning any point of religion whatsoever, yet one
demonstrative reason alleaged, or one manifest testimony cited from the
word of God himselfe, to the contrary, could not choose, but over-weigh
them all: in as much as for them to be deceived it is not impossible, it is
that Demonstrative Reason, or Divine Testimony should deceiue.</hi> And
again, <hi>Whereas it is thought, that especially with the Church, and those
that are called, mans authority ought not to prevail: It must and doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
even with them, yea with them especially, as far as equity requireth,
and farther we maintain it not. For men to be tied and led by authority, as
it were with a kinde of captivitie of iudgement, and though there bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to the contrary, not to listen to it, but to follow like beasts, the first in
the Heard, this were brutish.</hi> Again, <hi>that authority, of men should prevaile
with men either against or aboue reason, is no part of our beliefe. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of learned men, be they never so great and reverend, are to yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
reason, the weight whereof, is no whit preiudic'd by the simplicity of his
person which doth alleage it, but being found to be sound and good, the
bare opinion of men to the contrary, must of necessitie stoop and giue place.</hi>
Thus M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his 7. Sect. of his Second Book: which place because
it is far distant from that which is alleaged by you, the oversight of it
might be excusable, did you not impute it to D. <hi>Potter</hi> as a fault, that
he cites some clauses of some Books, without reading the whole. But
besides, in that very Section, out of which you take this corrupted sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
he hath very pregnant words to the same effect. <hi>As for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
established, sith equity and reason favour that which is in being, till
orderly iudgement of decision be given against it, it is but iustice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
of you, and perversnesse in you it should be to deny thereunto your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
obedience. Not that I iudge it a thing allowable, for men to obserue
those Lawes, which in their hearts they are stedfastly perswaded, to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law of God: But your perswasion in this case, yee are all bound
for the time to suspend, and in otherwise doing, yee offend against God, by
troubling his Church without iust and necessary cause. Be it that there
are some reasons inducing you to think hardly of our Lawes: Are those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
demonstrative, are they necessary, or but meer probabilities only? An
argument necessary and demonstratiue is such, as being proposed to any
man and understood, the minde cannot choose but inwardly assent. Any one
such reason dischargeth, I grant, the conscience, and setteth it at ful liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For the publique approbation given by the body of this whole Church,
unto those things which are established, doth make it but probable that
they are good. And therefore unto a necessary proofe that they are not good,
it must giue place.</hi> This plain declaration of his judgement in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
this expresse limitation of his former resolution, hee makes in the
very same Section, which affords your former quotation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what Apology can bee made for you, and your store-house M.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7615:173"/>
                  <hi>Brerely,</hi> for dissembling of it, I cannot possibly imagine.</p>
               <p>111 <hi>D. Potter</hi> p. 131. saies, <hi>That the errors of the Donatists and
Novatians, were not in themselves Heresies, nor could be made so by the
Churches determination. But that the Churches intention was only to
silence disputes, and to settle peace and unity in her government: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they factiously opposed, they were justly esteemed Schismatiques.
From hence you conclude, that the same condemnation must passe against
the first Reformers, seeing they also opposed the commands of the Church,
imposed on them, for silencing all disputes, and setling Peace and Vnity in
government.</hi> But this collection is deceitfull, and the reason is: Because
though the first Reformers, as well as the Donatists and Novatians,
opposed herein the Commands of the Visible Church, that is, of a
great part of it: yet the Reformers had reason, nay, necessity to doe so,
the Church being then corrupted with damnable errors: which was
not true of the Church, when it was opposed by the <hi>Novatians</hi> and
<hi>Donatists.</hi> And therefore though they, and the Reformers, did the
same action, yet doing it upon different grounds, it might in these me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
applause, and in them condemnation.</p>
               <p>112 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 43. The next §. hath in it some objections against <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

you, or any of your side, shall publish a good defence, of all that your
Popes have said &amp; done, especially of them whom <hi>Bellarmin</hi> beleeves,
in such a long train <hi>to have gone to the Divell:</hi> then you shall receive an

time, I hope all reasonable and equitable judges, will esteeme it not

you to be quiet, and to demand no more, whether God be wont to send
such Furies to preach the Gospell? Vnlesse you desire to heare of your

               <p>112 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 44. 45. In the two next Particles, which are all of this
Chapter, that remain unspoken to, you spend a great deale of reading, &amp;
wit, &amp; reason, against some men, who pretending to honour &amp; believe
the Doctrine &amp; practice of the visible Church, (you mean your own,)
and condemning their Forefathers who forsook her, say they would
not have done so, yet remain divided from her Communion. Which
men in my judgement cannot be defended. For if they believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of your Church, then must they believe this doctrine, that they
are to returne to your Communion. And therefore if they doe not so,
it cannot be avoided but they must be <gap reason="foreign">

teach, that the Objects of Faith being not evident to humane reason, it is in mans power
not only to abstaine from believing, by suspending our Iudgments, or exercising no act one way
or other; but also to disbelieve, that is, to believe the contrary of that which Faith proposeth; as
the examples of innumerable Arch-heretiques can beare witnesse. This obscurity of faith we

<hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> (wherein it surpasseth humane Opinion) it must relie upon some motive
and ground, which may be able to give it <hi>certainty,</hi> and yet not release it from <hi>obscurity.</hi> For if
this <hi>motive, ground,</hi> or <hi>formall Object</hi> of Faith, were any thing evidently presented to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
and if also we did evidently know, that it had a necessary connection with the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which we believe, our assent to such Articles could not be <hi>obscure,</hi> but <hi>evident;</hi> which, as we
said, is against the nature of our Faith. If likewise the motive or ground of our faith were <hi>obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propounded</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> but were not in it selfe <hi>infallible,</hi> it would leave our assent in <hi>obscurity,</hi> but
could not endue it with <hi>certainty.</hi> We must therefore for the ground of our Faith, find out a
motive obscure to <hi>us,</hi> but most certain <hi>in it selfe,</hi> that the act of faith may remaine both <hi>obscure,</hi>
and <hi>certain.</hi> Such a <hi>motive</hi> as this, can be no other but the divine authority of almighty God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing,
or speaking those truths which our faith believes. For it is manifest, that God's infallible
testimony may transfuse <hi>Certainty</hi> to our faith, and yet not draw it out of <hi>obscurity;</hi> because no

               <p>5. These evident Arguments of Credibility are in great abundance found in the Visible
Church of Christ, perpetually existing on earth. For, that there hath been a company of men
professing such and such doctrines, we have from our next Predecessours, and these from theirs
upward, till we come to the Apostles, and our Blessed Saviour; which gradation is knowne by
evidence of sense, by reading bookes, or hearing what one man delivers to another. And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

this never interrupted existence of the Church are joyned the many and great miracles wrought

some new meanes, and arguments sufficient of themselves to find out, and prove a true
Church, and faith independently of the <hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>writing</hi> of the Apostles; neither of which
can be knowne but by <hi>Tradition;</hi> as is truely observed by <hi>Tertullian</hi> saying: <hi>I will prescribe, that</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Praes. c. 21.</note>
                  <hi>there is no meanes to prove what the Apostles preached, but by the same Church which they founded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 Thus then we are to proceed: By evidence of manifest and incorrupt Tradition, I know
that there hath alwaies been a never-interrupted Succession of men from the Apostles time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
professing, and practising such and such doctrines: By evident arguments of credibility,
as Miracles, Sanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ty, Vnity, &amp;c. and by all those wayes whereby the Apostles, and our Blessed
Saviour himselfe confirmed their doctrine, we are assured that what the said never-interrupted
Church proposeth, doth deserve to be accepted and acknowledged as a divine truth: By evidence
of Sense, we see that the same Church proposeth such and such doctrines as divine truths, that is,
as revealed and testified by Almighty God. By this divine Testimony we are infallibly assured of
what we believe: and so the last period, ground, motive, and <hi>formall obiect</hi> of our Faith, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llible
testimony of that supreme Verity, which neither can deceive, nor be deceived.</p>
               <p>7 By this orderly deduction our Faith commeth to be endued with these qualities which we
said were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>equisite thereto; namely <hi>Certainty, Obscurity,</hi> and <hi>Prudence. Certainty</hi> proceeds from
the <hi>infallible</hi> Testimony of God propounded and conveyed to our understanding by such a meane
as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> infallible in it selfe, and to us is evidently knowne that it proposeth this point or that, and
which can manifestly declare in what sense it proposeth them; which meanes we have proved to
be only the visible Church of Christ. <hi>Obscurity</hi> from the manner in which God speakes to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
which ordinarily is such, that it doth not manifestly shew the person who speakes, nor the
truth of the thing spoken. <hi>Prudence</hi> is not wanting, because our faith is accompanyed with so
many arguments of <hi>Credibility,</hi> that every well disposed <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> may and ought to judge,
that the doctrines so confirmed deserve to be believed, as proceeding from divine Authority.</p>
               <p>8. And thus from what hath been said, we may easily gather the particular nature, or defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Faith.</hi> For, <hi>it is a voluntary, or free, infallible, obscure assent to some truth, because it is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifed
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7615:174"/>
by God, and is sufficiently propounded to us for such:</hi> which proposall is ordinarily made by
the Visible Church of Christ. I say, <hi>Sufficiently proposed by the Church;</hi> not that I purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
whether the proposall of the Church enter into the <hi>

                  </hi> of Faith: or
whether an error be any heresie, <hi>formally and precisely,</hi> because it is against the proposition of the
Church, as if such proposall were the formall Object of Faith, which D. <hi>Potter</hi> to no purpose a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
all, labours so very hard to disprove: But I only affirme, that when the Church propounds any
Truth, as revealed by God, we are assured that it is such indeed; and so it instantly growes, to be
a fit Object for Christian faith, which enclines and enables us to beleeve whatsoever is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ely
presented, as a thing revealed by Almighty God. And in the same manner we are sure, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
opposeth any doctrine proposed by the Church, doth thereby contradict a truth, which is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by God: As when any lawfull Superiour notifies his will, by the meanes, and as it were
proposall of some faithfull messenger, the subject of such a Superiour in performing, or neglecting
what is delivered by the Messenger, is said to obey, or disobey his owne lawfull Superiour. And
therefore because the testimony of God is notified by the Church, we may, and we doe most
truely say, that not to beleeve what the Church proposeth, is to deny God's holy word or testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
signified to us by the Church, according to that saying of <hi>S. Irenae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>9. From this definition of faith we may also know what <hi>Heresie</hi> is, by taking the contrary
termes, as <hi>Heresie</hi> is contrary to <hi>Faith,</hi> and saying: <hi>Heresie is a voluntary error against that which
God hath revealed, and the Church hath proposed for such.</hi> Neither doth it import, whether the
error concerne points in themselves great or small, fundamentall or not fundamentall. For more
being required to an act of Vertue, then of Vice, if any truth though neuer so small may be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>Faith</hi> as soone as we know it to be testified by divine revelation; much more will it be a
formall <hi>Heresie</hi> to deny any least point sufficiently propounded as a thing witnessed by God.</p>
               <p>10. This divine Faith is divided into <hi>Actuall,</hi> and <hi>Habituall. Actuall</hi> faith, or faith actuated
is when we are in act of consideration, and belife of some mystery of Faith; for example, that our
Saviour Christ, is true God, and Man, &amp;c. <hi>Habituall</hi> faith, is that from which we are denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Faithfull,</hi> or <hi>Believers,</hi> as by <hi>Actuall</hi> faith they are stiled, <hi>Believing.</hi> This <hi>Habit</hi> of faith is
a <hi>Quality</hi> enabling us most firmly to believe Objects above humane discourse, and it remaineth
permanently in our Soule, even when we are sleeping, or not thinking of any Mystery of Faith,
This is the first among the three <hi>Theologicall</hi> Vertues. For <hi>Charity</hi> unites us to God, as he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<hi>Good in himselfe; Hope</hi> tyes us to him, as he is unspeakably <hi>Good to us. Faith</hi> joynes us to
him, as he is the <hi>Supreame immoveable Verity. Charity</hi> relies on his <hi>Goodnesse; Hope</hi> on his <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
Faith</hi> on his divine <hi>Wisdome.</hi> From hence it followeth, that <hi>Faith</hi> being one of the Vertues
which Divines terme <hi>Infused</hi> (that is, which cannot be acquired by human wit, or industry, but
are in their Nature and Essence, supernaturall,) it hath this property; that it is not destroyed by
little and little, (contrarily to the <hi>Habits,</hi> called <hi>acquisiti,</hi> that is, <hi>gotten by human ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vour,</hi>
which as they are successiuely produced, so also are they lost successiuely, or by little and little) but
it must either be conserved entire, or wholly destroyed: And since it cannot stand entire with any
one act which is directly contrary, it must be totally overthrowne, and as it were demolished, and
razed by every such act. Wherefore, as <hi>Charity,</hi> or the Love of God is expelled from our soule
by any one act of <hi>Hatred,</hi> or any other mortall sinne against his divine Majesty: and as <hi>Hope</hi> is
destroyed by any one act of voluntary <hi>Desperation:</hi> so <hi>Faith</hi> must perish by any one act of <hi>Heresy;</hi>
because every such act is directly, and formally opposite therevnto. I know that some sinnes
which (as Divines speak) are <hi>exgenere suo,</hi> in their kind, grievous and <hi>mortall,</hi> may be much
lessened, and fall to be <hi>veniall, ob levitatem materiae;</hi> because they may happen to be exercised in
a matter of small consideration; as for example, to steale a penny, is veniall, although Theft in
his kind be a deadly sinne. But it is likewise true, that this Rule is not generall for all sorts of
sinnes; there being some so inexcusably wicked of their owne nature, that no smalnesse of matter,
not paucity in number, can defend them from being deadly sinnes. For, to give an instance,
what Blasphemy against God, or voluntary false Oath is not a deadly sinne? Certainly, none at
all, although the salvation of the whole world should depend upon swearing such a falshood. The

                  <hi>Goodnesse; and another secondary, namely the good of our Neighbour; But Schisme and other sinnes
which are committed against our Neighbour, are opposite to Charity in respect of this secondary
good, which is lesse, then the obiect of Faith, which is God, as he is the Prime Verity, on which Faith
doth relie; and therefore these sinnes are lesse then Infidelity.</hi> He takes <hi>Infidelity</hi> after a generall
manner, as it comprehends <hi>Heresie,</hi> and other vices against Faith.</p>
               <p>12. Having therefore sufficiently declared, wherein <hi>Heresy</hi> consists; Let us come to prove
that which we proposed in this Chapter. Where I desire, it be still remembred: That the visible
Catholique Church cannot erre damnably, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> confesseth: And, that when <hi>Luther</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
there was no other visible true Church of Christ disagreeing from the <hi>Roman,</hi> as we have
demonstrated in the next precedent Chapter.</p>
               <p>13 Now, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers cannot be excused from formall <hi>Heresy,</hi> I prove by
these reasons. To oppose any truth propounded by the visible true Church as revealed by God,
is formall <hi>Heresie,</hi> as we have shewed out of the definition of <hi>Heresie:</hi> But <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and the
rest did oppose divers truths propounded by the visible Church as revealed by God; yea they did
<hi>therefore</hi> oppose her, because shee propounded as divine revealed truths, things which they judged
either to be fals, or human inventions: Therefore they committed formall <hi>Heresie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14 Moreover, every Errour against any doctrine revealed by God, is damnable Heresie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the matter in it selfe be great or small, as I proved before: and therefore either the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church must be guilty of formall Heresy; because one of them must erre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the word &amp; testimony of God: but you grant (perfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e) that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth not erre
damnably, &amp; I adde that she cannot erre damnably, because she is the truly Catholique Church,
which you confesse cannot erre damnably: Therefore Protestants must be guilty of formall <hi>Heresy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15 Besides, we have shewed that the visible Church is Iudge of Controversies, and therefore
must be infallible in all her Proposals; which being once supposed, it manifestly followeth, that
to oppose what she delivereth as revealed by God, is not so much to oppose <hi>her,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> himself,
and therefore cannot be excused from grievous Heresy.</p>
               <p>16 Againe, if <hi>Luther</hi> were an <hi>Heretique,</hi> for those points wherein he disagreed from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church; All they who agree with him in those very points, must likewise be Heretiques.
Now, that <hi>Luther</hi> was a formall Heretique I demonstrate in this manner. To say, that Gods vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
true Church is not universall, but confined to one only place or corner of the world, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

wherein we professe to beleeve the holy Catholique Church:</hi> And you brand <hi>Donatus</hi> with heresy,
because he limited the universall Church to <hi>Africa.</hi> But it is manifest, and acknowledged by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

cannot be excused from formall Heresy. If S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in those times said to the Donatists,
<hi>There are innumerable testimonies</hi>

of holy Scripture that the Church of Christ cannot be confined to the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the place where <hi>Luthers</hi> feet stood, but must be spread over the whole world. It is therefore
<hi>most impudent vanity, and dotage</hi> to limit her to <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformation. In another place also
this holy Father writes no lesse effectually against <hi>Luther</hi> then against the <hi>Donatists.</hi> For having

that <hi>Luther</hi> could not, when he said, <hi>At the beginning I was alone,</hi> give us an <hi>universall</hi>
Church: Therefore happy had he been, if he had then, and his followers would now, <hi>receive her

                  <hi>most certain mark, that she cannot be bidden: She is
then knowne to all Nations. The Sect of Donatus is unknowne to many Nations; therefore that

let passe, and only vrge the main point: That since <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformed Church was not in being
for divers Centuries before <hi>Luther,</hi> and yet was (because so forsooth they will needs have it) in

that the Church may erre in points not fundamentall; because we have shewed that every

when she is permitted to maintaine a <hi>damnable Heresy?</hi> Besides, we will hereafter prove, that by
any act of Heresy all divine faith is lost; and to imagine a true Church of faithfull persons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

seeing it is manifest that</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers divided themselues from the Sea of</hi> Rome, <hi>they
beare the inseparable Mark of</hi> Heresie.</p>
               <p>20 And though my meaning be not to treat the point of Ordination, or Succession in the
Protestants Church, because the Fathers alleaged in the last reason, assigne Succession as one mark
of the true Church; I must not omit to say, that according to the grounds of <hi>Protestants</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they can neither pretend <hi>personall Succession</hi> of Bishops, nor <hi>Succession of doctrine.</hi> For
whereas Succession of Bishops signifies a never-interrupted line of Persons, endued with an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<hi>Quality,</hi> which Divines call a <hi>Character,</hi> which cannot be taken away by <hi>deposition, degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
or other meanes whatsoever; and endued also with Iurisdiction and Authority to teach, to
preach, to govern the Church by lawes, precepts, censures, &amp;c. Protestants cannot pretend Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in either of these. For (besides that there was never Protestant Bishop before <hi>Luther,</hi> and
that there can be no continuance of <hi>Succession,</hi> where there was no beginning to succeed,) they
commonly acknowledge no <hi>Character,</hi> and consequently must affirme that when their pretended
Bishops or Priests are deprived of Iurisdiction, or degraded, they remain meer lay Persons as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Ordination; fulfilling what <hi>Tertullian</hi> objects as a mark of Heresie: <hi>To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

only in Iurisdiction, and authoritie, or in a kinde of morall deputation to some function, which
therefore may be taken away by the same power, by which it was given. Neither can they pretend
Succession in Authority, or Iurisdiction. For all the Authority, or Iurisdiction which they had, was
conferred by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, by the Pope: Because the whole Church collectively
doth not meet to ordain Bishops or Priests, or to giue them Authority. But according to their own
doctrine, they believe that the Pope neither <hi>hath, or ought to haue any Iurisdiction, Power, Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority,
Preheminence, or Authority Ecclesiassicall, or Spirituall within this Realme,</hi> which they
sweare even when they are ordained Bishops, Priests, and Deacons: How then can the Pope giue
Iurisdiction where they sweare he neither <hi>hath, nor OVGHT to haue any?</hi> Or if yet he had, how
could they without <hi>Schisme</hi> withdraw themselves from his obedience? Besides, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
never gaue them Authority to oppose Her, by whom it was given. But grant, their first Bishops
had such Authority from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> after the decease of those men, who gaue Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their pretended Successours? The Primate of England? But from whom had he such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
And after his decease, who shall confer Authority upon his Successours? The temporall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate?
King <hi>Henry,</hi> neither a Catholique, nor a Protestant? King <hi>Edward,</hi> a Child? Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a Woman? An Infant of one houres Age, is true King in case of his Predecessours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease:
But shall your Church lye fallow till that Infant-King, and green Head of the Church
come to yeares of discretion? Doe your Bishops, your Hierarchy, your Succession, your Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
your being or not being Heretiques for want of Succession, depend on this new-found Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy-doctrine
brought in by such a man meerly upon base occasions, and for shameful ends;
impugned by <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his followers; derided by the Christian world; and even by chiefe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
as <hi>D. Andrewes, Wotton, &amp;c.</hi> not held for any necessary point of faith? And from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I pray you, had Bishops their Authority, when there were no Christian Kings? Must the Greeke
Patriarchs receiue spirituall Iurisdiction from the Greek Turk? Did the Pope, by the Baptisme of
Princes, loose the spirituall Power he formerly had of conferring spirituall Iurisdiction upon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops?
Hath the temporall Magistrate authority to preach, to assoile from sinnes, to inflict excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
and other Censures? Why hath he not Power to excommunicate, as well as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
in Irregularity, as our late Soveraign Lord King <hi>Iames,</hi> either dispensed with the late <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or else gaue commission to some Bishops to doe it? and since they were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to their Primate, and not he to them, it is cleer, that they had no Power to dispense with him,
but that power must proceed from the Prince, as Superiour to them all, and head of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
Church in England. If he haue no such authority, how can he giue to others what himselfe
hath not? Your Ordination, or Consecration of Bishops and Priests imprinting no <hi>Character,</hi>
can only consist in giving a Power, Authority, Iurisdiction, or (as I said before) some kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to exercise Episcopall, or Priestly functions: If then, the temporall Magistrate conferres
this Power &amp;c. he can, nay he cannot chuse but Ordain, and consecrate Bishops, &amp; Priests, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as he confers Authority or Iurisdiction: and your Bishops as soone as they are designed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the King, must <hi>ip so facto</hi> be Ordained and Consecrated by him without intervention of
<hi>Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Ordination:</hi> Which absurdities you will bee more unwilling to
grant, then well able to avoid, if you will be true to your own doctrines. The Pope from whom
originally you must beg your Succession of Bishops, never received, nor will, nor can acknowledge
to receiue any Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must be derived from Princes, he hath none at all: and yet either you must acknowledge, that hee

                  <hi>Dresserus.</hi> And though <hi>Scotland</hi> hath of late admitted some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
I much doubt whether they hold them to be necessary, or of divine Institution; and so their
enforced admitting of them, doth not so much furnish that kingdome with <hi>personall Succession</hi> of
Bishops, as it doth convince them to want <hi>Succession of Doctrine;</hi> since in this their neglect of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
they disagree both from the milder Protestants of England, and the true Catholique
Church: And by this want of a continued personall Succession of Bishops, they retaine the note
of <hi>Schisme,</hi> and <hi>Heresy.</hi> So that the Church of Protestants, must either not be <hi>Vniversall,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confined to England; Or if you will needs comprehend all those Churches which want suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
you must confesse, that your Church doth not only communicate with <hi>Schismaticall</hi> and
<hi>Hereticall</hi> Churches, but is also compounded of such Churches; and your selves cannot avoid the
note of Schismatiques, or Heretiques, if it were but for participating with such hereticall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
For it is impossible to retain Communion with the true Catholique Church, and yet agree
with them who are divided from her by Schisme, or Heresy; because that were to affirme, that for
the selfe same time, they could be <hi>within,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> the Catholique Church, as proportionably
I discoursed in the next precedent Chapter, concerning the communicating of moderate Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
with those who maintaine that Heresy of the Latency and Invisibility of Gods Church,
where I brought a place of <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> to this purpose, which the Reader may be pleased to review
in the <hi>fift Chapter,</hi> and 17. <hi>Number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22 But besides this defect in the personall Succession of Protestant Bishops, there is another
of great moment; which is, that they want the right <hi>Forme</hi> of ordaining <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the manner which they use is so much different from that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (at least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the common opinion of Divines) that it cannot be sufficient for the <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi>

Protestants; and to remember, that if the forme which they use either in Consecrating Bishops,
or in ordaining Priests be <hi>at least</hi> doubtfull, they can neither have <hi>undoubted</hi> Priests, nor Bishops.
For <hi>Priests</hi> cannot be ordained but by true <hi>Bishops,</hi> nor can any be a true Bishop, unlesse he first
be <hi>Priest.</hi> I say, their Ordination is <hi>at least</hi> doubtfull; because that sufficeth for my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For Bishops and Priests, whose Ordination is <hi>notoriously known</hi> to be but doubtfull, are
not to be esteemed Bishops, or Priests: and no man without Sacriledge can receive Sacraments
from them; all which they administer unlawfully: And (if we except Baptisme, with manifest
danger of invalidity, and with obligation to be at least conditionally repeated) so Protestants
must remain doubtfull of Remission of sinnes, of their Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy, and may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be a true Church, which cannot subsist without <hi>undoubted</hi> true Bishops and Priests, not
without due administration of Sacraments, which (according to Protestants) is an essentiall note
of the true Church. And it is a world to observe the proceeding of English Protestants in this
point of their <hi>Ordinations.</hi> For first, <hi>Ann. 3. Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 2. when he was a Child about twelve

<hi>D, Horne</hi> was no Bishop; all the Iudges resolved that his exception was good, if indeed D.
<hi>Horne</hi> was not Bishop, and they were all at a stand, till <hi>An. 8. Eliz cap.</hi> 1. the act of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. was
renewed and confirmed, with a particular <hi>proviso,</hi> that no man should be impeached or molested
by meanes of any certificate by any Bishop or Archbishop made before this last Act. Whereby it
is cleere, that they made some doubt of their own ordination, and that there is nothing but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in the whole businesse of their Ordination, which (forsooth) must depend upon sixe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,
the great Seale, Acts of Parliaments being contrary one to another, and the like.</p>
               <p>23 But though they want Personall Succession, yet at least they have Succession of doctrine
as they say, and pretend to prove, because they believe as the <hi>Apostles</hi> believed. This is to begg
the Question, and to take what they may be sure, will never be granted. For if they want Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Succession, and sleight Ecclesiasticall Tradition, how will they perswade any man, that they
agree with the doctrine of the Apostles? We have heard <hi>Tertullian</hi> saying: <hi>I will prescribe</hi>

                  <hi>behold the Tradition of the

                  <hi>by the succession of Priests from
the very Sea of Peter the Apostle, to whom our Saviour after his Resurrection committed his sheep
to be fed, even to the present Bishop. Origen</hi> to this purpose giveth us a good and wholsome Rule

who went before them; let the preaching of the Church be kept, which is delivered by the Apostles
by order of Succession, and remaines in the Church to this very day; that only is to be believed for
truth, which in nothing disagrees from the Tradition of the Church.</hi> In vain then doe these men
brag of the doctrine of the Apostles, unles first they can demonstrate that they enjoyed a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
succession of Bishops from the Apostles, and can shew us a Church which, according to <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>23 But yet neverthelesse, suppose it were granted, that they agreed with the doctrine of the
Apostles; this were not sufficient to prove a <hi>Succession</hi> in <hi>Doctrine.</hi> For <hi>Succession,</hi> besides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
or similitude, doth also require a never-interrupted conveying of such doctrine,
from the time of the Apostles, till the daies of those persons, who challenge such a <hi>Succession.</hi>
And so <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith: We are to believe that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gospell which from the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<hi>the</hi>

                  <hi>Church</hi> hath brought downe to our daies <hi>by a never-interrupted course of times,
and by undoubted succession of connection.</hi> Now, that the Reformation begunne by <hi>Luther,</hi> was
interrupted for divers ages before him, is manifest out of History, and by his endeavouring a
Reformation, which must presuppose abuses. He cannot therefore pretend a continued Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Doctrine which he fought to revive, and reduce to the knowledge, and practice of men.
And they ought not to prove that they have Succession of doctrine, because they agree with the
doctrine of the Apostles; but contrarily we must inferre, that they agree not with the Apostles,
because they cannot pretend a never-interrupted succession of doctrine from the times of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
till <hi>Luther.</hi> And here it is not amisse to note, that although the <hi>Waldenses, Wicliffe &amp;c.</hi>
had agreed with Protestants in all points of doctrine; yet they could not bragge of Succession

               </p>
               <p>24 <hi>And as want of Succession of Persons and</hi> Doctrine, <hi>cannot stand with that</hi> Vniversali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

which are dispersed throughout divers Countries, and Nations, cannot help towards that</hi> Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
<hi>of</hi> Place, <hi>wherewith the true Church must be endued: but rather such locall multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
doth more &amp; more lay open their division, &amp; want of Succession in Doctrine. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Observation of</hi> S. Augustine <hi>doth punctually agree with all modern Heretiques; wherein
this holy Father having cited these words out of the Prophet</hi> Ezechiell,<note n="i" place="margin">Cap. 24.</note> My flocks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are dispersed

Earth, some here, some there, yet they are wanting in no place, they know not one another. One
Sect for example in Africa, another Heresy in the East, another in Egypt, another in Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.
In divers places they are divers: one Mother, pride hath begot them all, as our own Mother
the Catholique Church hath brought forth all faithfull people dispersed throughout the whole
world. No wonder then, if Pride breed Dissention, and Charity Vnion. <hi>And in another place,
applying to Heretiques those words of the Canticles:</hi> If thou know not<note n="l" place="margin">Cant. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

went from us, but they were not of us. Goe thou out in the steps of the flocks; not in my steps,
but in the steps of the flocks, nor of one flock, but of divers and wandring flocks; And feed thy
Kids, not as Peter, to whom is said, Feed my sheepe: but seed thy Kids in the Tabernacles of the
Pastors, not in the Tabernacle of the Pastor, where there is one flock, and one Pastor. <hi>In which
words this holy Father doth set down the Markes of Heresy, to wit,</hi> going out <hi>from the Church,
and Want of Vnity among themselves, which proceed from not acknowledging one supreme
Visible Pastor and Head under Christ. And so it being Proved that Protestants having neither
succession of</hi> Persons, <hi>nor</hi> Doctrine, <hi>nor</hi> Vniversality <hi>of</hi> Time, <hi>or</hi> Place, <hi>cannot avoid the just

               <p>25 Hitherto we have brought arguments to prove, that <hi>Luther,</hi> and all Protestants
are guilty of <hi>Heresy</hi> against the <hi>Negative</hi> Precept of <hi>faith,</hi> which obligeth us under pain

               <p>27 And first,<note place="margin">The faith of Protestants wanteth Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> that their beliefe wanteth <hi>Certainty,</hi> I proue, because denying the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

declaration of the Church, we can neither haue certain means to know what Scripture is Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;
nor what Translations be faithfull, nor what is the true meaning of Scripture: Every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,
as I suppose, is perswaded that his own opinions, be true, and that he hath used such means
as are wont to be prescribed for understanding the Scripture, as Prayer, Conferring of divers
Texts, &amp;c. and yet their disagreements shew tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> some of them are deceaved: And therefore it is
cleer that they haue no one certain ground whereon to rely for understanding of Scripture. And
seeing they hold all the Articles of Faith, even concerning fundamentall points, upon the selfe same
ground of Scripture, interpreted, not by the Churches Authority, but according to some other
Rules, which as experience of their contradictions teach, doe sometimes faile; it is cleer that the
ground of their faith is infallible in no point at all. And albeit sometime it chance to hit on the
truth, yet it is likewise apt to lead them to errour: As all Arch-heretiques believing some truths, &amp;
withall divers errours upon the same ground and motive, have indeed no true divine infallible
faith, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t only a fallible humane opinion, and perswasion. For if the ground upon which they rely
were certain, it could never produce any errour.</p>
               <p>28 Another cause of uncertainty in the faith of Protestants, must rise from their distinction
of points fundamentall, and not fundamentall. For since they acknowledge, that every errour in
fundamentall points destroyeth the substance of faith and yet cannot determine what points bee
fundamentall; it followeth that they must remain uncertain whether or no they be not in some
fundamentall error, and so want the substance of faith, without which there can be no hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>29 <hi>And that he who erreth against any one revealed truth (as certainly some Protestants must
doe, because contradictory Propositions cannot both be true) doth loose all</hi> Divine faith; <hi>is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true doctrine delivered by Catholique Divines, with so generall a consent, that the contrary is
wont to be censured as temerarious. The Angelicall Doctor S.</hi> Thomas <hi>proposeth this Question:</hi>
Whether<note n="o" place="margin">2. 2. 4. 5. ar. 3. in corp.</note> he who denieth one Article of faith, may retain faith in other Articles? <hi>and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
that he cannot which he proveth,</hi> (Argument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sed contra) <hi>because,</hi> As deadly sin is opposits
to Charity; so to deny one Article of faith is opposite to faith. But Charity doth not remain with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one deadly sin; therefore faith doth not remain after the deniall of any one Article of faith.
<hi>Whereof he gives this farther reason:</hi> Because (<hi>saith he</hi>) the nature of every habit doth depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the formall Motiue and Obiect thereof, which Motiue being taken away, the nature of the habit
cannot remain. But the formall Obiect of faith is the supreme truth as it is manifested in Scriptures,
and in the doctrine of the Church, which proceeds from the same supreme verity. Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth not rely upon the doctrine of the Church (which proceeds from the supreme verity,
manifested in Scripture) as upon an infallible Rule, hee hath not the habit of faith, but
belieues those things which belong to faith by some other me anes then by faith: as if one should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
some Conclusion, and not know the reason of that demonstration, it is cleer that hee hath not
certain knowledge, but only Opinion. Now it is manifest, that hee who relies on the doctrine of the
Church, as upon an infallible Rule, will yeeld his assent to all, that the Church teacheth. For if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those things, which she teacheth, he hold what he will, and doth not hold what he will not, hee
doth not rely upon the doctrine of the Church, as upon an infallible Rule, but only upon his own will.
And so it is cleer that an Heretique, who with pertinacity denieth one Article of faith, is not ready
to follow the doctrine of the Church in all things: And therefore it is manifest, that whosoever is an
Heretique in any one Article of faith, concerning other Articles, hath not saith, but a kind of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or his own will. <hi>Thus far.</hi> S. Thomas. <hi>And afterward:</hi> A man doth belieue<note n="q" place="margin">Ad 2.</note> all the Articles
of faith for one and the selfe same reason, to wit, for the Prime Verity proposed to us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
understood aright according to the Doctrine of the Church: and therefore whosoever fals from
this reason or motiue, is totally deprived of faith. <hi>From this true doctrine wee are to infer, that to
retain, or want the substance of faith, doth not consist in the matter, or multitude of the Articles,
but in the opposition against Gods divine testimony, which is involved in every least error against
faith. And since some Protestants must needs erre, and that they haue no certain rule to knowe,
why rather one then another; it manifestly follows that none of them haue any Certainty for the
substance of their faith in any one point. Moreover D.</hi> Potter, <hi>being forced to confesse that the
Roman Church wants not the substance of faith, it follows that she doth not erre in any one point
against faith, because as we haue seen out of</hi> S. Thomas, <hi>every such errour destroies the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of faith. Now if the Roman Church did not erre in any one point of faith, it is manifest
that Protestants erre in all those points wherein they are contrary to her. And this may suffice to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7615:178"/>
prove that the faith of Protestants wants Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30 And now for the second Condition of faith, I say: If Protestants haue <hi>Certainty,</hi> they
want <hi>Obscurity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They want the second Condition of Faith: Obscurity.</note> and so haue not that faith which, as the Apostle saith, is of things <hi>not appearing,</hi>

                  </gap>ating our Vnderstanding to an assent. For the whole edifice of the faith of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
is setled on these two Principles: These particular Books are Canonicall Scripture: And
the sense and meaning of these Canonicall Scriptures, is cleer and evident, at least in all points
necessary to Salvation. Now, these Principles being once supposed, it cleerly followeth, that what
Protestants belieue as necessary to salvation, is evidently known by them to be <hi>true,</hi> by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
It is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> that whatsoever is contained in the word of God, is true. But it is
<hi>certain</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> that these Books in particular are the word of God: Therefore it is <hi>certaine</hi>
and <hi>evident,</hi> that whatsoever is contained in these Books is true. Which <hi>Conclusion</hi> I take for a
<hi>Maior</hi> in a second Argument, and say thus: It is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> that whatsoever is contained
in these Books is true: but it is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> that such particular Articles (for example, the
Trinity, Incarnation, Originall sin, &amp;c.) are contained in these Books: Therefore it is <hi>certain</hi> and
<hi>evident,</hi> that these particular Objects are true. Neither will it avail you to say, that the said Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are not evident by naturall discourse, but onely to <hi>the eye of reason cleered by grace,</hi> as you
speak. For supernaturall evidence, no lesse (yea rather more) drawes and excludes <hi>obscurity,</hi> then
naturall evidence doth: neither can the party so enlightned be said voluntarily to captivate his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to that light, but rather his understanding is by a necessity made captive, and forced
not to disbelieve, what is presented by so cleare a light: And therefore your imaginary faith is
not the true faith defined by the Apostle, but an invention of your own.</p>
               <p>31 That the faith of Protestants wanteth the third Condition which was <hi>Prudence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their faith wants Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from all that hitherto hath been said. What wisdome was it, to forsake a Church confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <hi>that in the Papacy there are many good
things, worthy the name of Christian, which have come from them to us. Namely, we confesse
that in the Papacy there is true Scripture, true Baptisme; the true Sacrament of the Altar, the
true keys for remission of sinnes, the true office of Preaching, true Catechisme, as our Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Ten Commandements, Articles of faith &amp;c.</hi> And afterward: <hi>I avouch, that under the Papacy
there is true Christianity, yea the Kernell and Marrow of Christianity, and many pious and great

Baptisme, Sacraments, the Keyes, the Office of Preaching, Prayer, Holy Scripture, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Christianity ought to have.</hi> And a little before: <hi>I heare and see that they bring in Anabaptisme
only to this end, that they may spight the Pope, as men that will receive nothing from Antichrist;
no otherwise then the Sacramentaries doe, who therefore believe only Bread and Wine to be in the
Sacrament, meerely in hatred against the Bishop of Rome; and they think that by this meanes they
shall overcome the Papacy. Verily these men rely upon a weak ground, for by this meanes they must
deny the whole Scripture, and the Office of Preaching. For we have all these things from the Pope;
otherwise we must goe make a new Scripture. O Truth, more forcible</hi> (as S. <hi>Austine</hi> saies) <hi>to wring

               </p>
               <p>32 Lastly, since your faith wanteth <hi>Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> it is easy to inferre that it wants
the fourth Condition, <hi>Supernaturality.</hi> For being but an <hi>Humane</hi> perswasion, or Opinion, it is
not in nature, or Essence <hi>Supernaturall.</hi> And being <hi>imprudent,</hi> and rash, it cannot proceed from
divine Motion and grace; and therefore it is neither supernaturall in <hi>it selfe,</hi> nor in the <hi>cause</hi> from
which it proceedeth.</p>
               <p>33 Since therefore we have proved, that whosoever erres against any one point of faith,
looseth all divine faith, even concerning those other Articles wherein he doth not erre; and that
although he could still retaine true faith for some points, yet any one errour in whatsoever other
matter concerning faith, is a grievous sinne; it cleerely followes, that when two or more hold
different doctrines concerning faith and Religion, there can be but one Part saved. For declaring
of which truth, if Catholiques be charged with <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Modesty,</hi> and be accused of
rashnesse, ambition, and fury, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> is very free in this kind; I desire every one to ponder
the words of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> who teacheth, that every least errour overthrowes all faith, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is guilty thereof, is in the <hi>Church,</hi> like one, who in the <hi>Common wealth</hi> forgeth false come.
<hi>Let them heare</hi> (saith this holy Father)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>what S. Paul saith: Namely, that they who brought in

                  <hi>had overthrown the Gospell. For, to shew how a small thing ill mingled doth
corrupt the whole, he said, that the Gospell was subverted. For as he who clips a little of the stamp
from the Kings mony, makes the whole piece of no value: so whosoever takes away the least parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of sound faith, is wholly corrupted, alwaies going from that beginning to worse things. Where
then are they, who condemne us as contentious persons, because we cannot agree with Heretiques,
and doe often say, that there is no difference betwixt us and them, but that our disagreement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds

your whole discourse, a painted and ruinous Building upon a weak

               <p>2 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 2. 3. First for your grounds, a great part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is falsely said
to be either proved or granted. It is true indeed that <hi>Man by his naturall
wit or industry could never have attained to the knowledge of Gods will
to give him a supernaturall and eternall happinesse,</hi> nor of the meanes
by which his pleasure was to bestow this happinesse upon him. And
therefore your first ground is good, <hi>That it was requisite his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
should be enabled to apprehend that end and meanes by a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
supernaturall.</hi> I say this is good, if you mean by <hi>knowledge,</hi> an
apprehension or beliefe. But if you take the word properly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
it is both false, for faith is not knowledge, no more then three is
foure, but eminently contained in it, so that he that knowes, believes,
and something more, but he that believes many times doe not know,
nay if he doth barely and meerely believe, he doth never know: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it is retracted by your selfe presently, where you require, <hi>That
the object of faith must be both naturally and supernaturally unknown.</hi> And
againe in the next page, where you say, <hi>Faith differs from science in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the objects obscurity.</hi> For that science and knowledge properly
taken are Synonimous termes, and that a knowledge of a thing abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
unknown is a plain implicancy, I think are things so plain, that
you will not require any proofe of them.</p>
               <p>3 But then whereas you adde, <hi>that if such a knowledge were no
more then probable, it could not be able sufficiently to over beare our will,
and encounter with humane probabilities, being backed with the strength
of flesh and bloud, and therefore conclude, that it was farther necessary,
that this supernaturall knowledge should be most certain and infallible:</hi> To
this I answere, that I doe heartily acknowledge and believe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of our faith be in themselves Truths, as certain and infallible as
the very common Principles of Geometry and Metaphysicks. But
that there is required of us a knowledge of them, and an adherence to
them, as certain as that of sense or science, that such a certainty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us under pain of damnation, so that no man can hope to be
in the state of Salvation, but he that findes in himselfe such a degree
of faith, such a strength of adherence: This I have already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
to be a great errour, and of dangerous and pernitious conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
And because I am more and more confirm'd in my perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the truth which I there delivered, is of great and singular use, I
will here confirme it with more reasons. And to satisfy you that this
is no singularity of my own, my Margent presents you with a<note n="a" place="margin">M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his answer to <hi>Travers</hi> his supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—I have taught that the assurance of things which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by the word, is not so certain as of that we perceive by sence. And is it as certaine? Yes I taught, that the things which God doth promise in his word are surer unto us then any thing we touch, handle or see. But are we so sure and certain of them? If we be, why doth God so often prove his promises unto us, as he doth by arguments taken from our sensible experience? We must be surer of the proofe then the thing proved, otherwise it is no proofe. How is it that if ten men doe all looke upon the Moone, every one of them knowes it as certainly to bee the Moone as another: but many believing one and the same promises all haue not one and the same fullnesse of perswasion? How falleth it out that men being assured of any thing by sence, can be no surer of it then they are? whereas the strongest in faith that liveth upon the earth, had alwaies need to labour, and strive, and pray, that his assurance concerning heavenly and spirituall things may grow, increase, and be augmented.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

confirming in faith:</hi> Every such Text, is a demonstrative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of this vain fancy: proving that faith, even true and saving
faith, is not a thing consisting in such an indivisible point of perfection
as you make it, but capable of augmentation and diminution. Every
Praier you make to God to encrease your faith (or if you conceive
such a prayer derogatory from the perfection of your faith,) <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
praying to Christ to encrease their faith,</hi> is a convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the same conclusion. Moreover if this doctrine of yours were
true, then seeing not any the least doubting can consist with a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
certainty, it will follow that every least doubting in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of faith, though resisted and involuntary, is a damnable sinne, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
destructive, so long as it lasts, of all true and saving faith: which
you are so farre from granting, that you make it no sinne at all, but
only an occasion of merit: and if you should esteeme it a sinne, then
must you acknowledge, contrary to your owne Principles, that there
are Actuall sinnes meerely involuntary. The same is furthermore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly
confirmed by every deliberate sinne that any Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits;
by any progresse in Charity that he makes. For seeing, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
assures us, <hi>our faith is the victory which overcomes the world,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the faith of all true Believers were perfect, (and if true faith be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of no imperfection, if all faith be a knowledge most certain and
infallible, all faith must be perfect, for the most imperfect that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your doctrine, if it be true, must be <hi>most certain,</hi> and sure
the most perfect that is, cannot be more then most certain,) then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
their victory over the World, and therefore over the flesh, and
therefore over sinne, must of necessity be perfect, and so it should be
impossible for any true believer to commit any deliberate sinne, and
therefore he that commits any sinne, must not think himselfe a true
believer. Besides seeing faith worketh by Charity, and Charity is the
effect of faith: certainly if the cause were perfect, the effect would be
perfect, and consequently as you make no degrees in faith, so there
would be none in charity, and so no man could possibly make any
progresse in it, but all true believers should be equally in Charity, as
in faith you make them equall: &amp; from thence it would follow unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably,
that whosoever findes in himselfe any true faith, must present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswade himselfe that he is perfect in Charity: and whosoever on
the other side, discovers in his charity any imperfection, must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he hath any true faith. These you see are strange and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous
consequences, and yet the deduction of them from your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is cleere and apparent; which shewes this doctrine of yours,
which you would fain have true, that there might be some necessity
of your Churches infallibility, to be indeed plainly repugnant not
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7615:180"/>
only to Truth but even to all Religion and Piety, &amp; fit for nothing but
to make men negligent of making any progresse in faith or Charity.
And therefore I must entreat and adjure you either to discover unto
me (which I take God to witnesse I cannot perceive,) some fallacy in
my reasons against it, or never hereafter to open your mouth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it.</p>
               <p>5 As for that one single reason which you produce to confirm it,
it will appeare upon examination to be resolved finally into a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Assertion of your own, contrary to all Truth and experience, and
that is, <hi>That no degree of faith, lesse then a most certaine and infallible
knowledge, can bee able sufficiently to overbeare our will and encovnter
with humane probabilities, being backt with the strength of Flesh and
Blood.</hi> For who sees not that many millions in the world forgoe many
times their present ease and pleasure, undergoe great and toylsome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
encounter great difficulties, adventure vpon great dangers, and
all this not upon any certain expectation, but upon a probable hope of
some future gain and commodity, and that not infinite and eternall,
but finite and temporall? Who sees not that many men abstain from
many things they exceedingly desire, not upon any certain assurance,
but a probable feare of danger that may come after? What man ever
was there so madly in loue with a present penny, but that hee would
willingly spend it upon any litle hope that by doing so hee might gain
an hundred thousand pound? And I would fain know <hi>what gay proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities</hi>
you could devise to disswade him from this Resolution. And if
you can devise none, what reason then, or sense is there, but that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
hope of infinite and eternall happinesse, provided for all those
that obey <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and much more a firme faith, though not so
certain, in some sort, as sense or science, may be able to sway our will
to obedience, and encounter with all those temptations which Flesh
and Blood can suggest to avert us from it? Men may therefore talke
their pleasure of an absolute and most infallible certainty, but did they
generally believe that obedience to Christ were the only way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and eternall felicity, but as firmly and undoubtedly as that there is
such a Citty as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> nay but as much as <hi>Caesars</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or the History of <hi>Salust,</hi> I believe the liues of most men, both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and Protestants would be better then they are. Thus therefore out
of your own words I argue against you: He that requires to true faith,
an absolute and infallible certainty, for this onely Reason <hi>because any
lesse degree could not be able to overbeare our will,</hi> &amp;c. imports, that
if a lesse degree of faith were able to doe this, then a lesse degree of
faith may be true and divine and saving Faith: But experience shews,
and reason confirmes, that a firm faith, though not so certain as sense
or science, may be able to encounter and overcome our will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
And therefore it followes from your own reason, that faith
which is not a most certain and infallible knowledge may be true and
divine and saving faith.</p>
               <p>6 All these Reasons I haue imployed to shew that such a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and infallible faith as here you talk of, is not so necessary, but that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7615:181"/>
without such a high degree of it, it is possible to please God. And
therefore the Doctrines delivered by you § 25. are most presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and uncharitable: <hi>viz: That such a most certain and infallible faith
is necessary to salvation, necessitate Finis, or Medii,</hi> so necessary, that
<hi>after a man is come to the use of reason, no man ever was or can bee saved
without it.</hi> Wherein you boldly intrude into the judgement seat of
God, &amp; damne men for breaking Lawes, not of God's, but your own
making. But withall, you cleerly contradict your selfe, not only where
you affirm,<note place="margin">P. 1. C. 2. § 14.</note> 
                  <hi>That your faith depends finally upon the Tradition of Age to
Age, of Father to Sonne,</hi> which cannot be a fit ground, but onely for a
Morall Assurance;<note place="margin">P. 2. C. 5. §. 32.</note> nor only, where you pretend, that <hi>not alone Hearing
and Seeing,</hi> but also <hi>Histories, Letters, Relations of many</hi> (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
are things not certain and infallible,) <hi>are yet foundations good
enough to support your faith;</hi> Which Doctrine, if it were good and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,
Protestants might then hope that their Histories and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Relations might also passe for means sufficient of a sufficient
Certainty, and that they should not bee excluded from Salvation for
want of such a Certainty. But indeed the pressure of the present diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
compell'd you to speak here, what I believe you wil not justify,
and with a pretty tergiversation to shew D. <hi>Potter</hi> your means of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
certainty; whereas the Objection was that you had no means or
possibility of infallible certainty, for which you are plainly at as great
a losse and as far to seek as any of your Adversaries. And therefore it
concernes you highly not to damne others for want of it, least you
involue your selues in the same condemnation; according to those
terrible words of S. <hi>Paul, Inexcusabilis es, &amp;c.</hi> In this therefore
you plainly contradict your selfe. And lastly most plainly, in saying as
you doe here, you contradict and retract your pretence of Charity to
Protestants in the beginning of your Book: For there you make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
that <hi>you haue no assurance but that Protestants dying Protestants,
may possibly dye with contrition, and be saved:</hi> And here you are very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory,
that <hi>they cannot but want a means absolutely necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and wanting that cannot but be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7 The third Condition you require to faith, is, that our assent to
divine Truths should <hi>not only be unknown and unevident by any humane
discourse,</hi> but that <hi>absolutely also it should be obscure in it selfe, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
speaking, be void even of supernaturall evidence.</hi> Which words
must have a very favourable constructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or else they will not be sense.
For who can make any thing of these words taken properly, that <hi>faith
must be an unknown unevident assent, or an assent absolutely obscure?</hi> I had
alwaies thought that known and unknown, obscure and evident had
been affections, not of our Assent, but the Object of it, not of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
but the thing believed. For well may wee assent to a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
obscure, or unevident; but that our assent it selfe should bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
therefore unknown or obscure, seems to me as great an improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as if I should say, your sight were green or blew, because you see
something that is so. In other places therefore I answer your words,
but here I must answer your meaning: which I conceive to be, That it
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7615:181"/>
is necessary to faith that the Objects of it, the points which we belieue
should not be so evidently certain, as to necessitate our understandings
to an Assent, that so there might be some merit in faith, as you love
to speak (who will not receive no not from God himselfe, but a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-worth
for a penny,) but as we, some obedience in it, which can
hardly have place where there is no possibility of disobedience, as there
is not where the understanding does all, and the will nothing. Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Religion of Protestants, though it be much more credible then
yours, yet is not pretended to haue the absolute evidence of sense or
demonstration; therefore I might let this doctrine passe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
for any prejudice that can redound to us by it. But yet I must
not forbeare to tell you, that your discourse proves indeed this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
requisite to the merit, but yet not to the essence of faith: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it faith were not an act of obedience, but yet faith may bee faith
without it; and this you must confesse, unlesse you will say either the
Apostles believed not the whole Gospel which they preached, or that
they were not eye-witnesses of a great part of it: unlesse you will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> for saying <hi>that which we haue seen with our eyes, and which
our hands haue handled, &amp;c. declare we unto you:</hi> nay our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for saying. <hi>Thomas because thou seest thou be lievest, Blessed are they
which haue not seen and yet haue believed.</hi> Yet if you will say that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the things which they saw, the Apostles assent was not pure &amp;
proper and meer faith, but somewhat more; an assent containing faith
but superadding to it, I will not contend with you, for it will bee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
about words. But then again I must crave leave to tell you,
that the requiring this condition, is in my judgement a plain revocation
of the former. For had you made the matter of faith either naturally
or supernaturally evident, it might have been a fitly atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered &amp; due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proportioned object for an absolute certainty naturall or superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall:
But requiring as you doe, <hi>that faith should be an absolute know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a thing not absolutely known, an infallible certainty of a thing
which though it is in it selfe, yet is it not made appeare to us to be infallibly
certain,</hi> to my understanding you speak impossibilities. And truly for
one of your Religion to doe so, is but a good <hi>Decorum.</hi> For the matter
and object of your Faith being so full of contradictions, a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
faith may very well become a contradictious Religion. Your
faith therefore, if you please to haue it so, let it be a free, necessitated,
certain, uncertain, evident, obscure, prudent and foolish, naturall and
supernaturall unnaturall assent. But they which are unwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
non-sense themselves, or to perswade others to doe so, it is but
reason they should make the faith wherewith they believe, an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
compossible, consistent thing, and not define it by repugnances.
Now nothing is more repugnant, then that a man should be required
to give most certain credit unto that which cannot be made appeare
most certainly credible: and if it appeare to him to be so, then is it not
obscure that it is so. For if you speak of an acquired, rationall, discur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
faith, certainly these Reasons which make the object seem credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
must be the cause of it, and consequently the strength and firmity
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7615:182"/>
of my assent must rise and fall together with the apparent credibility
of the object. If you speak of a supernaturall infused faith, then you
either suppose it infused by the former meanes, and then that which
was said before must be said again: for whatsoever effect is wrought
meerly by meanes, must beare proportion to, and cannot exceed the
vertue of the meanes, by which it is wrought: As nothing by water can
be made more cold then water, nor by fire more hot then fire, nor by
honey more sweet then honey, nor by gall more bitter then gall: Or if
you will suppose it infused without meanes, then that power which
infuseth into the understanding assent which beares analogie to sight
in the eye, must also infuse evidence, that is, Visibilitie into the Object:
&amp; look what degree of assent is infus'd into the understanding, at least
the same degree of evidence must be infused into the Object. And for
you to require a strength of credit beyond the appearance of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
credibility, is all one as if you should require me to goe ten miles
an houre upon a horse that will goe but fiue: to discern a man certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through a myst or cloud that makes him not certainly discernable;
To heare a sound more cleerly then it is audible; to understand a thing
more fully then it is intelligible: and he that doth so, I may well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that his next injunction will be, that I must see something that is
invisible, heare something inaudible, understand something that is
wholly unintelligible. For he that demands ten of me, knowing I haue
but five, does in effect, as if he demanded five, knowing that I have
none: and by like reason, you requiring that I should see things farther
then they are visible, require I should see something invisible, and in
requiring that I believe something more firmly then it is made to mee
evidently credible, you require in effect that I believe something
which appeares to me incredible, and while it does so. I deny not but
that I am bound to believe the truth of many Texts of Scripture the
sense whereof is to me obscure, &amp; the truth of many Articles of faith
the manner whereof is obscure, and to humane understandings incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible;
But then it is to be observed, that not the sense of such
Texts, not the manner of these things is that which I am bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but the truth of them. But that I should believe the truth of any
thing, the truth whereof cannot bee made evident with an evidence
proportionable to the degree of faith required of me, this I say for any
man to be bound to, is unjust and unreasonable, because to doe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
               <p>8 <hi>Ad</hi> § 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. Yet though I deny that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us to be certain in the highest degree, infallibly certain of
the truth of the things which we believe, for this were to know &amp; not
believe, neither is it possible unlesse our evidence of it, be it naturall or
supernaturall, were of the highest degree; yet I deny not but, that wee
are to believe the Religion of Christ, we are and may be infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
For first, this is most certain, that we are in all things to doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to wisdome and reason rather then against it. Secondly, this is as
certain, That wisdome and Reason require that wee should believe
these things which are by many degrees more credible and probable
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7615:182"/>
then the contrary. Thirdly, this is as certain, that to every man who
considers impartially what great things may be said for the truth of
Christianity, and what poore things they are which may be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, either for any other Religion or for none at all, it cannot but
appear by many degrees more credible, that Christian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is true
then the contrary. And from all these premises, this conclusion evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
followes, that it is infallibly certain, that we are firmely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the truth of Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>9 Your discourse therefore touching the fourth requisite to faith
which is Prudence, I admit so farre as to grant. 1. That if we were
required to believe with certainty (I mean a Morall certainty,) things
no way represented as infallible and certain, (I mean morally,) an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
obedience were required of us. And so likewise were it,
were we required to believe as absolutely certain, that which is no way
represented to us as absolutely certain. 2. That whom God obligeth
to believe any thing, he will not fail to furnish their understandings
with such inducements, as are sufficient (if they be not negligent or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse)
to perswade them to believe. 3. That there is an abundance of
Arguments exceedingly credible, inducing men to believe the Truth
of Christianity: I say so credible, that though they cannot make us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
see what we believe, yet they evidently convince that in true
wisdome and prudence, the Articles of it deserve credit, and ought to
be accepted as things revealed by God. 4. That without such reasons
and inducements, our choice even of the true faith, is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
as prudent, but to be condemned of rashnesse and levity.</p>
               <p>10 But then for your making Prudence, not only a commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a believer, and a justification of his faith, but also essentiall to it,
and part of the definition of it, in that questionlesse you were mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and have done as if being to say what a man is, you should define
him, A Reasonable creature that hath skill in Astronomy. For as all
Astronomers are men, but all men are not Astronomers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Astronomy ought not to be put into the definition of men, where
nothing should have place, but what agrees to all men: So though all
that are truly wise (that is, wise for eternity,) will believe aright, yet
many may believe aright which are not wise. I could wish with all my
heart as <hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>that all the Lords people could Prophesy:</hi> That all
that believe the true Religion <hi>were able</hi> (according to <hi>S. Peters</hi> injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
<hi>to give a reason of the hope that is in them,</hi> a reason why they
hope for eternall happinesse by this way rather then any other! neither
doe I think it any great difficulty that men of ordinary capacities, if
they would give their minde to it, might quickly be enabled to doe so.
But should I affirme that all true Believers can doe so, I suppose it
would be as much against experience and modesty, as it is against
Truth and Charity, to say as you doe, that <hi>they which cannot doe so,
either are not at all, or to no purpose true believers.</hi> And thus wee see that
the foundations you build upon, are ruinous and deceitfull, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to support your Fabrick that they destroy one another. I come
now to shew that your Arguments to prove Protestants Heretiques,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7615:183"/>
are all of the same quality with your former grounds: which I will
doe by opposing cleere and satisfying Answers in order to them.</p>
               <p>11 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 13. To the first then, delivered by you §. 13. <hi>That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
must be Heretiques, because they opposed divers Truths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
for divine by the Visible Church:</hi> I Answer, It is not Heresy to
oppose any Truth propounded by the Church, but only such a Truth
as is an essentiall part of the Gospell of Christ. 2. The Doctrines
which Protestants opposed, were not Truths, but plain and impious
falshoods: Neither thirdly, were they propounded as Truths by the
Visible Church, but only by a Part of it, and that a corrupted Part.</p>
               <p>12 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 14. The next <hi>Argument, in the next Particle tell us,</hi>
That <hi>every error against any doctrine revealed by God is damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy:
Now either Protestants or the Roman Church must erre against the
word of God: But the Roman Church</hi> we <hi>grant (perforce) doth not erre
damnably, neither can she, because she is the Catholique Church, which</hi>
we (you say) <hi>confesse cannot erre damnably: Therefore Protestants must
erre against Gods word, and consequently are guilty of formall Heresy.</hi>
Whereunto I answer plainly, that there be in this argument almost as
many falshoods as assertions. For neither is every error against any
Doctrine revealed by God a damnable Heresy, unlesse it be revealed
publiquely, &amp; plainly with a command that all should beleeve it. 2. D.
<hi>Potter</hi> no where grants, that the Errors of the Roman Church are
<hi>not in themselves damnable,</hi> though he hopes by accident they may
not actually damne some men amongst you: and this you your selfe
confesse in divers places of your book, where you tell us, that he <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
no hope of Salvation to those amongst you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch. 5. §. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>whom ignorance cannot
excuse.</hi> 3. You beg the Question twice in taking for granted, First
that <hi>the Roman Church is the truly Catholique Church;</hi> which without
much favour can hardly passe for a part of it: And againe, that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church cannot fall into any error of it selfe damnable:</hi> for it may
doe so, and still be the Catholique Church, if it retain those Truths
which may be an antidote against the malignity of this error, to those
that held it out of a simple un-affected ignorance. Lastly, though the
thing be true, yet I might well require some proofe of it from you,
that either Protestants or the Roman Church must erre against Gods
word. For if their contradiction be your only reason, then also you
or the Dominicans must be Heretiques, because you contradict one
another as much as Protestants and Papists.</p>
               <p>13 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 15. The third Argument pretends that <hi>you have shewed
already, that the Visible Church is Iudge of Controversies, and therefore
infalliable; from whence you suppose that it followes, that to oppose her, is
to oppose God.</hi> To which I answer, that you have said onely, and not
shewed that <hi>the Visible Church is Iudge of Controversies.</hi> And indeed
how can she be Iudge of them if she cannot decide them? And how
can she decide them, if it be a question whether she be Iudge of them?
That which is question'd it selfe, cannot with any sense be pretended
to be fit to decide other questions; and much lesse this question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it have Authority to judge and decide all questions? 2. If she
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7615:183"/>
were Iudge, it would not follow that she were infallible, for we have
many Iudges in our Courts of Iudicature, yet none infallible. Nay
you cannot with any modesty deny, that every man in the world
ought to judge for himselfe, what Religion is truest, and yet you will
not say that every man is infallible. 3. If the Church were supposed
Infallible, yet it would not follow at all, much lesse manifestly, that to
oppose her declaration is to oppose God: unlesse you suppose also
that as she is infallible, so by her opposers, she is known or believed
to be so. Lastly, If all this were true (as it is all most false) yet were it
to little purpose, seeing you have omitted to prove that the Visible
Church is the Roman.</p>
               <p>14 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 16. In stead of a fourth Argument this is presented to us,
<hi>That if Luther were an Heretique, then they that agreed with him must
be so.</hi> And that <hi>Luther</hi> was a formall Heretique, you endeavour to
prove by this most formall Syllogisme; <hi>To say the Visible Church is not
Vniversall, is properly an Heresy: But Luthers Reformation was not Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall;
Therefore it cannot be excused from formall Heresy.</hi> Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I Answer, first to the first part, that it is no way impossible that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
had he been the inventor and first broacher of a false Doctrine, (as
he was not) might have been a formall Heretique, and yet that those
who follow him may be only so materially and improperly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no Heretiques. Your own men out of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> distinguish
between <hi>Haeretici &amp; Haereticorum sequaces:</hi> And you your selfe
though you pronounce <hi>the leaders among the Arrians formall Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi>
yet confesse that <hi>Salvian</hi> was at least doubtfull whether these
<hi>Arrians,</hi> who in simplicity followed their Teachers, might not be
excused by ignorance. And about this suspension of his you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
seeme suspended, for you neither approve nor condemne it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to the second part I say, that had you not presumed upon
our ignorance in Logick as well as Metaphysicks and Schoole Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
you would never have obtruded upon us this rope of sand for a
formall Syllogisme. It is even Cosen German to this, To denie the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
is properly an Heresie; But <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformation was not
Vniversall, Therefore it cannot be excused from formall Heresie! Or
to this, To say the Visible Church is not Vniversall is properly an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie:
But the preaching of the Gospell at the beginning was not Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall;
therefore it cannot be excused from formall Heresie. For as
he whose Reformation is but particular, may yet not denie the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
so may he also not denie the Churches Vniversality. And as
the Apostles who preached the Gospell in the beginning, did beleeve
the Church Vniversall, though their preaching at the beginning was
not so: So <hi>Luther</hi> also might and did beleeve the Church Universall,
though his Reformation were but particular. I say he did beleeve it
Vniversall, even in your own sense, that is, Universall <hi>de iure,</hi> though
not <hi>defacto.</hi> And as for Vniversality in fact, he beleeved the Church
much more Vniversall then his reformation: For he did conceive (as
appeares by your own Allegations out of him) that not only the Part
reformed was the true Church, but also that they were Part of it who
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7615:184"/>
needed reformation. Neither did he ever pretend to make a new
Church but to reform the old one. Thirdly and lastly, to the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of this unsyllogisticall syllogisme, I answer, That to say the
true Church is not alwaies <hi>defacto</hi> universall, is so far from being an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,
that it is a certaine truth knowne to all those that know the world,
and what Religions possesse farre the greater part of it. <hi>Donatus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was not to blame, for saying, that the Church might possibly be
confin'd to <hi>Africk;</hi> but for saying without ground, that then it was
so. And S. <hi>Austine,</hi> as he was in the right, in thinking that the Church
was then extended farther then <hi>Africk;</hi> so was he in the wrong if he
thought that of necessity it alwaies must be so; but most palpably mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in conceiving that it was then spread over the whole earth, &amp; known
to all nations, which if passion did not trouble you, &amp; make you forget
how lately almost halfe the world was discovered, and in what estate
it was then found, you would very easily see and confesse.</p>
               <p>15 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 17. In the next Section you pretend <hi>that you have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to prosecute the similitude of Protestants with the Donatists;</hi> and yet
you doe it with as much spight and malice as could well bee devised,
but in vaine: For <hi>Lucilla</hi> might doe ill in promoting the Sect of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,
and yet the Mother and the Daughter, whom you glance at,
might doe well in <hi>ministring influence</hi> (as you phrase it) <hi>to Protestants
in England.</hi> Vnlesse you will conclude because one woman did one
thing ill, therefore no woman can doe any thing well: or because it
was ill done to promote one Sect, therefore it must bee ill done, to
maintaine any.</p>
               <p>16 The <hi>Donatists might doe ill in calling the Chaire of Rome the
Chaire of Pestilence, and the Roman Church an Harlot;</hi> and yet the state
of the Church being altered, Protestants might doe well to doe so,
and therefore though, S. <hi>Austine might perhaps have reason to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Donatists for detracting from the Church,</hi> and calling her har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
when she was not so; yet you may have none to threaten <hi>D. Potter</hi>
that you would persecute him (as the Application of this place inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
you would,) if it were in your power: plainly shewing that you
are a curst cow though your hornes be short, seeing the Roman
Church is not now what it was in S. <hi>Austines</hi> time. And hereof the
conclusion of your own book affords us a very pregnant testimony:
where you tell us out of Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> that one grand-impediment,
which among many kept the seduced followers of the faction of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>
from the Churches Communion, was a vile calumny raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Catholiques, that <hi>they did set some strange thing upon their
Altar. To how many</hi> (saith S. <hi>Austine) did the reports of ill tongues shut
up the way to enter, who said, that we put, I know not what upon the Altar?</hi>
Our of detestation of the calumny, and just indignation against it, he
would not so much as name the impiety wherewith they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and therefore by a Rhetoricall figure calls it, <hi>I know not what.</hi>
But compare with him <hi>Optatus,</hi> writing of the same matter, and you
shall plainly perceive that this (<hi>I know not what</hi>) pretended to be set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar, was indeed a picture, which the Donatists (knowing how
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7615:184"/>
detestable a thing it was to all Christians at that time, to set up any Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
in a Church to worship them, as your new fashion is) bruited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to be done in the Churches of the Catholique Church. But
what answer doe S. <hi>Austine</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> make to this accusation? Doe
they confesse and maintaine it? Doe they say, as you would now, It is
true we doe set Pictures upon our Altar, and that not only for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or memory, but for worship also; but we doe well to doe so, and
this ought not to trouble you, or affright you from our Communion?
What other answer your Church could now make to such an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is very hard to imagine: And therefore were your Doctrine the
same with the Doctrine of the Fathers in this point, they must have
answered so likewise. But they to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary not only deny the crime,
but abhorre and detest it. To litle purpose therefore doe you hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
these poore shadowes of resemblances between us and the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists:</hi>
unlesse you could shew an exact resemblance between the present
Church of Rome and the Ancient: which seeing by this, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars it is demonstrated to bee impossible; that Church
which was then a Virgin may be now a Harlot, and that which was
detraction in the <hi>Donatists,</hi> may be in Protestants a just accusation.</p>
               <p>17 As ill successe have you in comparing D. <hi>Potter</hi> with <hi>Tyconius</hi>
whom as <hi>S. Austin findes fault with for continuing in the Donatists se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
having forsaken the ground of it, the Doctrine of the Churches
perishing: so you condemne the Doctor, for continuing in their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
who hold</hi> (as you say) <hi>the very same Heresy.</hi> But if this were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Doctrine of the <hi>Donatists</hi> how is it that you say presently
after, <hi>that the Protestants who hold the Church of Christ perished, were
worse then Donatists, who said that the Church remained at least in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica?</hi>
These things me thinkes, hang not well together. But to let this
passe; The truth is, this difference, for which you would faine raise
such a horrible dissention between D. <hi>Potter</hi> and his Brethren, if it be
well considered is only in words and the manner of expression: They
affirming only, that the Church perished from its integrity, and fell
into many corruptions which he derlies not: And the Doctor denying
only that it fell from its essence, and became no Church at all, which
they affirme not.</p>
               <p>18 These therefore are but velitations, and you would seeme to
make but small account of them. But the main point you say is, that
<hi>since Luthers Reformed Church was not in being for divers Centuries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Luther, and yet was in the Apostles time, they must of necessity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
heretically with the Donatists, that the true unspotted Church of
Christ perished, and that she which remained on earth, was (O Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my!)
anharlot.</hi> By which words it seemes you are resolute perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to confound <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Vnspotted;</hi> and to put no difference between a
corrupted Church and none at all. But what is this, but to make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwen a diseased and a dead man? Nay what is it but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
your selves, who cannot deny but that sinnes are as great
staines and spots and deformities in the sight of God, as errors; and
confesse your Church to be a congregation of men, whereof every
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7615:185"/>
particular, not one excepted, (and consequently the generality which
is nothing but a collection of them) is polluted and defiled with sinne?
You proceed.</p>
               <p>19 But, say you, <hi>The same heresy followes out of D. Potter and other
Protestants, that the Church may erre in points not fundamentall; because
we have shewed that every error against any revealed truth is Heresy and
Damnable, whether the matter be great or small: And how can the
Church more truly be said to perish, then when she is permitted to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
damnable Heresy? Besides we will hereafter prove that by every act
of Heresy all divine faith is lost, &amp; to maintaine a true Church without any
faith, is to fansy a living man without life.</hi> Ans. what you have said
before, hath been answered before, and what you shall say hereafter,
shall be confuted hereafter. But if it be such a certain ground, that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
error against any one revealed truth is a damnable Heresy,</hi> Then I hope
I shall have your leave to subsume, That the Dominicans in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
must hold a damnable heresy, who hold an error against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
Conception: which you must needs esteeme a revealed truth,
or otherwise why are you so urgent and importunate to have it defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
seeing your rule is, <hi>nothing may be defined unlesse it be first revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
But without your leave, I will make bold to conclude, that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that or the contrary assertion be a revealed truth, you or they,
choose you whether, must without contradiction hold a damnable
Heresy: if this ground be true that every contradiction of a revealed
Truth is such. And now I dare say, for fear of inconvenience you will
beginne to temper the crudenesse of your former assertion, and tell us,
that neither of you are Heretiques, because the Truth against which
you erre though revealed, is not sufficiently propounded. And so say I,
neither is your Doctrine which Protestants contradict sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
For though it be plain enough, that your Church proposeth
it, yet still methinkes, it is as plain, that your Churche's proposition
is not sufficient; and I desire you would not say but prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Lastly, to your Question, How <hi>can the Church more truly be said
to perish, then when she is permitted to maintaine a damnable Heresy?</hi> I
Answer, she may be more truly said to perish, when she is not only
permitted to doe so, but <hi>defacto</hi> doth maintaine a damnable Heresy.
Again, she may be more truly said to perish, when she falls into an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,
which is not only damnable in it selfe, and <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> as you
speak, but such an Heresy, the belief of whose contrary Truth is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
not only <hi>necessitate praecepti</hi> but <hi>medii,</hi> and therefore the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
so absolutely and indispensably destructive of salvation, that no
ignorance can excuse it, nor any generall repentance, without a dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it, can begge a pardon for it. Such an heresy if the Church
should fall into, it might be more truly said to perish, then if it fell only
into some heresy of its own nature damnable. For in that state all the
members of it, without exception, all without mercy must needs perish
for ever: In this, although those that might see the truth &amp; would not,
cannot upon any good ground hope for Salvation, yet without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it might send many soules to heaven, who would gladly have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7615:185"/>
the truth, but that they wanted means to discover it. Thirdly
and lastly, shee may yet more truly bee said to perish when shee
Apostates from Christ absolutely, or rejects even those Truths out
of which her Heresies may bee reformed; as if shee should directly
deny <hi>Iesus to be the Christ,</hi> or the Scripture to be the Word of God.
Towards which state of Perdition it may well be feared that the
Church of Rome doth somewhat incline, by her superinducing upon
the rest of her errors the Doctrine of her own infallibility, whereby her
errors are made incurable; and by her pretending that the Scripture
is to be interpreted according to her doctrine, and not her doctrine to
be judg'd of by Scripture, whereby she makes the Scripture uneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
for her Reformation.</p>
               <p>20 <hi>Ad</hi> § 18. I was very glad when I heard you say <hi>The Holy
Scripture and ancient Fathers doe assigne Separation from the visible
Church as a mark of Heresie:</hi> for I was in good hope, that no
Christian would so bely the Scripture, as to say so of it, unlesse hee
could have produced some one Text at least, wherein this was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirmed, or from whence it might be undoubtedly and undeniably
collected. For assure your selfe, good Sir, it is a very haynous crime to
say, <hi>thus saith the Lord, when the Lord doth not say so.</hi> I expected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some Scripture should haue been alleaged, wherein it should haue
beene said, <hi>whosoever separates from the Roman Church is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique:</hi>
or <hi>the Roman Church is infallible,</hi> or <hi>the Guide of faith:</hi> or at least,
<hi>There shall be alwaies some visible Church infallible in matters of faith.</hi>
Some such direction as this I hoped for: And I pray consider whether
I had not reason! The Evangelists and Apostles who wrote the New
Testament, we all suppose were good men, and very desirous to direct
us the surest and plainest way to heaven; wee suppose them likewise
very sufficiently instructed by the Spirit of God in all the necessary
points of the Christian faith, and therefore certainly not ignorant of
this <hi>Vnum Necessarium,</hi> this most necessary point of all others, without
which as you pretend and teach, all faith is no Faith, that is, that <hi>the
Church of Rome was designed by God the Guide of Faith.</hi> Wee suppose
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lastly wise men, especially being assisted by the spirit of wisdome,
and such as knew that a doubtfull &amp; questionable Guide was for mens
direction as good as none at all. And after all these suppositions, which
I presume no good Christian will call into question, is it possible that
any Christian heart can believe, that not One amongst them all should
<hi>ad rei memoriam</hi> write this necessary doctrine plainly so much as once?
Certainly in all reason they had provided much better for the good
of Christians if they had wrote this, though they had writ nothing
else. Me thinks the Evangelists undertaking to write the Gospell of
Christ, could not possibly haue omitted, any One of them, this most
necessary point of faith, had they known it necessary, (S. <hi>Luke</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
who plainly professeth that <hi>his intent was to write all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</hi>)
Me thinks S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> could not but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
this their Priviledge to them! Me thinks instead of saying,
<hi>Your faith is spoken of all the world over</hi> (which you haue no reason to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7615:186"/>
be very proud of, for he saies the very same thing to the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>)
he could not haue fayl'd to haue told them once at least in plaine
termes, that <hi>their faith was the Rule for all the World for ever.</hi> But then
sure he would haue forborn to put them in feare of an impossibility, as
hee doth in his eleventh Chap. that they also, nay the whole Church
of the <hi>Gentiles, if they did not look to their standing, might fall away to
infidelity,</hi> as the Iews had done. Me thinks in all his other Epistles, at
least in some, at least in one of them, he could not have fayled to haue
given the world this direction, had he known it to be a true one, that
<hi>all men were to be guided by the Church of Rome, and none to separate
from it under pain of damnation.</hi> Me thinks writing so often of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
and Antichrist, hee should haue given the world this (as you
pretend) onely sure preservative from them. How was it possible that
S. <hi>Peter</hi> writing two Catholique Epistles, mentioning his own depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
writing to preserve Christians in the faith, should in neither of
them commend them to the guidance of his pretended Successours,
the Bishops of Route? How was it possible that S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and S. <hi>Iude</hi> in
their Catholique Epistles should not giue this Catholique direction?
Me thinks S. <hi>Iohn</hi> instead of saying, <hi>he that believeth that Iesus is the
Christ, is born of God,</hi> (The force of which direction, your glosses doe
quite enervate, and make unavailable to discern who are the sonnes of
God,) should haue said, <hi>Hee that adheres to the doctrine of the Roman
Church, and lives according to it, he is a good Christian, and by this Mark
yee shall know him!</hi> What man not quite out of his witts, if he consider
as he should, the pretended necessity of this doctrine, that without the
beliefe hereof no man ordinarily can be saved, can possibly force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to conceive that all these good and holy men, so desirous of mens
salvation, and so well assured of it (as it is pretended,) should be so
deeply and affectedly silent in it, and not One say it plainly so much as
once, but leaue it to be collected from uncertain Principles, by many
more uncertain consequences? Certainly he that can judge so uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
of them, it is no marvell if he censure other inferiour servants
of Christs Atheists, and Hypocrites, and what he pleases. Plain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
therefore I did and had reason to look for, when I heard you say,
<hi>the holy Scripture assignes Separation from the visible Church as a Mark
of Heresie.</hi> But instead hereof what haue you brought us, but meer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies?
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith of some who pretended to be Christians and
were not so, and therefore when it was for their advantage forsook
their Profession, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.</hi> Of some,
who before the decree of the Councell to the contrary, were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and accordingly taught, that the convert Gentiles were to keep
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> it is said in the Acts, <hi>Some who went out from us.</hi>
And again S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the same book forewarnes the Ephesians that
<hi>out of them should arise men speaking perverse things.</hi> And from these
places which it seems are the plainest you have, you collect <hi>that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the Visible Church is assigned by Scripture as a Mark of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</hi>
Which is certainly a strang and unheard of strain of Logick.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7615:186"/>
Vnlesse you will say that every Text wherein it is said, that some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
goes out from some body, affords an Argument for this purpose!
For the first place there is no certainty that it speaks of Heretiques;
but, <hi>no Christians,</hi> of <hi>Antichrists, of such as denied Iesus to be the Christ:</hi>
See the place and you shall confesse as much. The second place, it is
certain, you must not say it speaks of Heretiques, for it speaks only of
some who beleeved and taught an Errour, while it was yet a question
and not evident, and therefore according to your doctrine, no formall
Heresy. The third saies indeed, that of the Professours of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
some shall arise that shall teach Heresy: But not one of them all
that saies or intimates, that whosoever separates from the Visible
Church; in what state soever, is certainly an Heretique. Heretiques I
confesse doe alwayes doe so; But they that doe so are not alwayes He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques,
for perhaps the state of the Church may make it necessary
for them to doe so; as Rebels alwayes disobey the command of their
King, yet they which disobey a Kings command (which perhaps may
be unjust) are not presently Rebels.</p>
               <p>21 Your Allegations out of <hi>Vincentius, Prosper,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> are
lyable to these exceptions. 1. That they are the sayings of men not
assisted by the Spirit of God, and whose Authoritie your selves will
not submit to in all things. 2. That the first and last are meerly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
neither of them affirming or intimating, that separation from the
present Visible Church is a mark of Heresy: and the former speaking
plainly of separation from Vniversality, Consent and Antiquity, which
if you will presume without proof that we did and you did not, you
beg the Question. For you know we pretend that we separated only
from that present Church which had separated from the doctrine of
the Ancient, and because she had done so, and so farre forth as she had
done so and no farther. And lastly the latter part of <hi>Prospers</hi> words
cannot be generally true, according to your own grounds; For you say
a man may be divided from the Church upon meer Schisme without
any mixture of Heresy: And a man may be justly excommunicated
for many other sufficient causes besides Heresy. Lastly, a man may be
divided by an unjust excommunication, and be both before and after
a very good Catholique; and therefore you cannot maintain it Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
true, <hi>That he who is divided from the Church is an Heretique,
and Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22 In the 19. § we have the Authority of eight Fathers urg'd to
prove <hi>that the separation from the Church of Rome as it is the Sea of S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
(I conceive you mean as it is the Particular Church) <hi>is the mark of
Heresy.</hi> Which kind of argument I might well refuse to answer, unlesse
you would first promise me, that whensoever I should produce as plain
sentences, of as great a number of Fathers, as ancient, for any doctrine
whatsoever, that you will subscribe to it, though it fall out to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the doctrine of the Roman Church. For I conceive nothing in
the world more unequall or unreasonable, then that you should presse
us with such Authorities as these, and think you selves at liberty from
them; and that you should account them Fathers when they are for
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7615:187"/>
you, and Children when they are against you. Yet I would not you
should interpret this as if I had not great assurance, that it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for you ever to gain this cause at the tribunall of the Fathers, nay
not of the Fathers whose sentences are here alleaged. Let us consider
them in order, and I doubt not to make it appear that farre the greater
part of them, nay all of them that are any way considerable fall short
of your purpose.</p>
               <p>23 S. <hi>Hierome</hi> (you say) <hi>writing to Pope Damasus,</hi> saith, <hi>I am in the
Communion of the Chaire of Peter: &amp;c.</hi> But then I pray consider he saith
it to Pope <hi>Damasus:</hi> and this will much weaken the Authority, with
them who know how great over-truths men usually write to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in letters. Consider againe, that he saies only, that <hi>he was then in
Communion with the Chaire of Peter,</hi> Nott hat he alwayes would, or of
necessity must be so: for his resolution to the contrary is too evident
out of that which he saith elswhere which shall be produced hereafter.
He saies that the <hi>Church at that present was built upon that Rock;</hi> but
not that only, Nor that alwayes. Nay his judgment as shall appeare
is expresse to the contrary. And so likewise the rest of his expressions
(if we meane to reconcile <hi>Hierome</hi> with <hi>Hierome</hi>) must bee conceived
as intended by him, of that Bishop and Sea of Rome, at that present
time, and in the present State, and in respect of that doctrine which he
there intreats of. For otherwise had he conceiu'd it necessary for
him and all men to conform their judgments in matters of faith, to the
judgment of the Bishop &amp; Church of Rome, how came it to passe that
he chose rather to believe the Epistle to the Hebrewes Canonicall, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Authority of the Easterne Church, then to reject it from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
upon the Authority of the Roman? How comes it to passe that
he dissented from the Authority of that Church, touching the Canon
of the Old Testament? For if you say, that the Church then consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> I feare you will loose your Fort by maintaining
your Out-works, and by avoyding this, runne into a greater danger of
being forc'd to confesse the present Roman Church opposite herein
to the Ancient. How was it possible, that he should ever beleeue that
<hi>Liberius</hi> Bishop of Rome either was or could haue been wrought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by <hi>the sollicitation of Fortunatianus Bishop of Aquileia, and brought
after two years banishment to subscribe Heresie?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hierom de scrip. Eccle. tit. <hi>Fortunati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus.</hi>
                  </note> Which Act of <hi>Liberius</hi>
though some fondly question, being so vain as to expect we should
rather believe them that lived but yesterday, thirteen hundred years
almost after the thing is said to be done, and speaking for themselves in
their own Cause, rather then the dis-interessed time-fellowes or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Successors of <hi>Liberius</hi> himselfe: yet I hope they will not proceed
to such a degree of immodesty, as once to question whether <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
thought so. And if this cannot be denyed, I demand then if he had
lived in <hi>Liberius</hi> his time, could he or would he have written so to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
as he does to <hi>Damasus?</hi> would he have said to him, <hi>I am in the
Communion of the Chair of Peter, I know that the Church is built upon
this Rock, Whosoever gathereth not with thee scattereth.</hi> Would he then
have said, the Roman faith and the Catholique were the same: or, that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7615:187"/>
the Roman faith received no delusions, no not from an Angell? I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he could not have said so with any coherence to his own beleif;
and therefore conceive it undeniable that what he said then to <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
he said it (though perhaps he streyned too high) only of <hi>Damasus,</hi>
and never conceiv'd that his words would have been extended to all
his Predecessors and all his Successors.</p>
               <p>24 The same Answer I make to the first place of S. <hi>Ambrose, viz.</hi>
that no more can be certainly concluded from it, but that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Bishops and the Roman Church were then at unity; so that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
agreed with the latter could not then but agree with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
But that this Rule was perpetuall, and that no man could ever
agree with the Catholique Bishops, but he must agree with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church, this he saies not, nor gives you any ground to conclude
from him. <hi>Athanasius</hi> when he was excommunicated by <hi>Liberius,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
very ill with the Roman Church, and yet you will not gainsay,
but he agreed well enough with the Catholique Bishops. The second,
I am uncertain what the sense of it is, and what truth is in it; but most
certain that it makes nothing to your present purpose. For it neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
nor imports, that separation from the Roman Church is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
marke of Heresy. For the Rights of Communion (whatsoever it
signifies,) might be said to flow from it, if that Church were by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
Law, the head of all other Churches: But unlesse it were
made so by divine Authority, and that absolutely, Separation from it
could not be a marke of Heresy.</p>
               <p>25 For S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> all the world knowes that he<note n="b" place="margin">It is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Baronius Anno. 238. N. 41.

a Decree of the Roman Bishop, and all that adhered to him in
the point of Re. baptizing, which that Church at that time delivered
as a necessary Tradition. So necessary, that by the Bishop of Rome <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milianus</hi>
and other Bishops of <hi>Cappadocia, Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all who persisted in the contrary opinion,<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Confessed by</hi> Baronius An. 258. N. 14. &amp; 15. <hi>By</hi> Card. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. <hi>Repl.</hi> l. 1. c. 25.</note> were therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the Churches Communion, (which exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication could
not but involve S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who defended the same opinion as resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as <hi>Firmilianus,</hi> though Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> magisterially and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all colour of proofe affirme the contrary,) and <hi>Cyprian</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
so farre cast off, as for it to be pronounc'd by <hi>Stephen a false Christ.</hi>
Again so necessary that the Bishops which were sent by <hi>Cyprian</hi> from
Africk to Rome, were not admitted to the Communion of ordinary
conference: But all men who were subject to the Bishop of Romes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by him not only to deny them the Churches
peace &amp; Communion, but even lodging and entertainment: manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declaring, that they reckoned them among those whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
<hi>to receive to house, or to say God speed to them.</hi> All these terrors
notwithstanding S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> holdes still his former opinion, &amp; though
out of respect to the Churches peace<note n="d" place="margin">Vide Con. Cartho apud sur. To. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>he judged no man, nor cut off any
man from the right of Communion, for thinking otherwise then he held,</hi>
yet he conceived <hi>Stephen</hi> &amp; his adherents,<note n="e" place="margin">Bell. l. 2. de Con. c. 5. Aug. ep. 48. &amp; lib. 1. de Bapt. c. 13,</note> to hold a pernitious error.
And S. <hi>Austin,</hi> (though disputing with the <hi>Donatists</hi> he useth some Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the point,) yet confesseth elsewhere, that <hi>it is not found that
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7615:188"/>
Cyprian did ever change his opinion.</hi> And so farre was he from conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any necessity of doing so, in submitting to the judgement of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and Church of Rome, that he plainly professeth that no other
Bishop, <hi>but our Lord Iesus only, had power to judge</hi> (with authority) <hi>of
his judgement,</hi> and as plainly intimates that <hi>Stephen,</hi> for usurping such
a power, and making himselfe <hi>a judge over Bishops, was little better
then a Tyrant:</hi> and as heavily almost he censures him, and peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposes him as obstinate in error, in that very place where he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that famous saying, <hi>How can he have God for his Father, who hath
not the Church for his Mother?</hi> little doubting it seemes but a man
might have the Church for his Mother, who stood in opposition to
the Church of Rome, and farre from thinking what you fondly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
upon him, that to be united to the Roman Church, and to the
Church was all one, and that separation from S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire was a
marke, I mean a certain marke, either of Schisme or Heresy. If after
all this, you will catch at a phrase or a complement of S. <hi>Cyprians,</hi> and
with that hope to perswade Protestants, who know this story as well
as their own name, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did believe that <hi>falsehood could not
have accesse to the Roman Church,</hi> and that opposition to it was the
brand of an Heretique: may we not well expect, that you will the next
time you write vouch <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Caluin</hi> also for Abettors of this Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and make us poore men believe not only (as you say) that we have
no Metaphysicks,<note place="margin">Bell. l. 2. de Con. c 5. § 1. Canisius in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio Catech.</note> but that we have no sense? And when you have
done so, it will be no great difficulty for you, to assure us that we read
no such thing in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as <hi>that Cyprian was alwaies accounted in the
number of Catholiques;</hi> nor in <hi>Canisius,</hi> that he was a <hi>most excellent
Doctor and a most glorious Martyr;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sept. die 14.</note> nor in your Calendar, that he <hi>is a
Saint and a Martyr;</hi> but that all these are deceptions of our sight, and
that you ever esteemed him a very Schismatique and an Heretique, as
having on him the Marke of the Beast, <hi>opposition to the chaire of Peter,</hi>
Nay that he (what ever he pretended) knew and believed himselfe to
be so; in as much as he knew (as you pretend,) and esteemed this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to be the Marke of Heresy, and knew himselfe to stand and
stand out in such an opposition.</p>
               <p>26 But we need not seeke so farre for matter to refute the vanity
of this pretence. Let the reader but peruse this very Epistle out of
which this sentence is alleaged, and he shall need no farther satisfaction
against it. For he shall finde, first, that you have helped the dice a
little with a false, or at least with a very bold and streined Translation:
for S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith not <hi>to whom falshood cannot have accesse,</hi> by which
many of your favourable Readers I doubt understood, that <hi>Cyprian</hi>
had exempted that Church from a possibility of error, but to whom
<hi>perfidiousnesse cannot have accesse,</hi> meaning by perfidiousnesse in the
abstract, according to a common figure of speech, those perfidious
Schismatiques whom he there complaines of: and of these by a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall
insinuation, he saies that <hi>with such good Christians as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
were, it was not possible they should finde favourable entertainment.</hi>
Not that he conceived it any way impossible they should doe so, for
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7615:188"/>
the very writing this Epistle, and many passages in it, plainly shew the
contrary: But because he was confident, or at least would seeme to
be confident, they never would, and so by his good opinion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the Romans, lay an obligation upon them, to doe as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
they would doe; as also in the end of his Epistle, he saies even of
the people of the Church of Rome, <hi>that being defended by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their Bishop, nay by their own Vigilance sufficiently guarded,
they could not be taken nor deceived with the poysons of Heretiques.</hi> Not
that indeed he thought either this or the former any way impossible:
For to what purpose, but for prevention hereof, did he write this long
and accurate and vehement Epistle to <hi>Cornelius?</hi> which sure had been
most vainly done, to prevent that which he knew or believed impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible!
Or how can this consist with his taking notice in the begining
of it, <hi>that Cornelius was somewhat moved and wrought upon by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of his Adversaries,</hi> with his reprehending him for being so, and
with his vehement exhorting him to courage and constancy, or with
his request to him, in the conclusion of his Epistle, that it should <hi>be
read publiquely to the whole Clergy and Laity of Rome, to the intent, that
if any contagion of their poisoned speech and pestiferous semination, had
crept in amongst them, it might be wholly taken away from the eares and
the hearts of the Brethren, and that the entire and syncere charity of good
men might be purged from all drosse of hereticall detraction:</hi> Or lastly
with his vehement perswasions to them to decline <hi>for the time to come,
and resolutely avoid their word and conference, because their speech crept
as a canker,</hi> as the Apostle saith; <hi>because evill communication would cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
good natures, because wicked men carry perdition in their mouthes,
and hide fire in their lips?</hi> All which had been but vain and ridiculous
pagentry, had he verily believed the Romans such inaccessible Forts,
such immoveable Rocks, as the former sentences would seeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
if we will expound them rigidly and strictly, according to the
exigence of the words, &amp; not allow him who was a professed Maister
of the Art, to have used here a little Rhetorique, and to say, <hi>That
could not be,</hi> whereof he had no absolute certainty but that it might
be, but only had, or would seem to have a great confidence that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
would be, <hi>ut fides habita fidem obligaret,</hi> that he professing to be
confident of the Romans, might lay an obligation upon them to doe
as he promist himselfe they would doe. For as for <hi>joyning the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Church and the Chair of Peter,</hi> how that will serve for your present
purpose, of proving separation from the Roman Church a marke of
Heresy, I suppose it is hard to understand! Nor indeed how it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
you in any other designe against us, who doe not altogether
deny, but that the Church of Rome might be called the <hi>Chaire of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
in regard he is said to have preached the Gospell there, and <hi>the
principall Church,</hi> because the City was the Principall and Imperiall
City: which <hi>Prerogative of the City,</hi> if we believe the Fathers of the
Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was the ground and occasion, why the Fathers
of former time (I pray observe,) conferred upon this Church, this
Prerogative above other Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:7615:189"/>27 And as farre am I from understanding, how you can collect
from the other sentence, that to communicate with the Church and
Pope of Rome, and to communicate with the Catholique Church, is
<hi>alwaies</hi> (for that is your Assumpt) one and the same thing. S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
speaks not of the Church of Rome at all, but of the Bishop only,
who when he doth communicate with the Catholique Church, as
<hi>Cornelius</hi> at that time did, then whosoever communicates with him,
cannot but communicate with the Catholique Church: and then by
accident one may truly say, such a one communicates with you, that
is, with the Catholique Church, and that to communicate with him
is to communicate with the Catholique Church. As if <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius</hi>
be together, he that is in company with <hi>Titius,</hi> cannot but be
at that time in company with <hi>Sempronius.</hi> As if a Generall be march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to some place with an Army, he that then is with the Generall
must at that time be with the Army: And a man may say without ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
such a time I was with the Generall, that is, with the Army,
and that to be with the Generall is to be with the Army. Or as if a
mans hand be joyned to his body, the finger which is joyned to the
hand is joyned to the body, and a man may say truly of it, this finger is
joyned to the hand, that is, to the body, and to be joyned to the hand
is to be joyned to the Body; because all these things are by accident
true. And yet I hope you would not deny, but the finger might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be joyned to the hand, and yet not to the Body, the hand being
cut off from the Body; and a man might another time, be with his
Generall and not with his Army, he being absent from the Army.
And therefore by like Reason your collection is sophisticall, being in
effect but this, to communicate with such a Bishop of Rome, who did
communicate with the Catholique Church, was to Communicate
with the Catholique Church, therefore absolutely and alwaies it must
be true, that to communicate with him, is by consequent to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with the Catholique Church, and to be divided from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
is to be an Heretique.</p>
               <p>28 In urging the place of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> you have shewed much more
ingenuity then many of your Fellowes. For whereas they usually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
at, <hi>Declaring the Tradition of the &amp;c.</hi> and conceale what goes
before, you have set it down, though not so compleatly as you should
have done, yet sufficiently to shew, that what Authority in the matter
he attributed to the Roman Church in particular, the same for the
kind (though perhaps not in the same degree) he attributed to all other
Apostolique Churches. Either therefore you must say that he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Testimony of other Apostolique Churches divine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
(which certainly he did not, neither doe you pretend he did, and if
he had, the confessed Errors and Heresies which after they fell into,
would demonstrate plainly that he had erred,) or else that he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the testimony of the Roman Church only humane and credible,
though perhaps more credible then any one Church beside, (as one
mans Testimony is more credible then anothers;) but certainly much
more Credible, which was enough for his purpose, then that secret
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7615:189"/>
Tradition, to which those Heretiques pretended, against whom he
wrote, overbearing them with an argument of their own kinde, farre
stronger then their own. Now if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thought the Testimony of
the Roman Church in this point only humane and fallible, then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he could never think, either adhering to it a certain marke of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique,
or separation from it a certain marke of a Heretique.</p>
               <p>29 Again, whereas your great <hi>Achilles</hi> Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> in
French, as also his <hi>noble Translatresse</hi> misled by him, in English, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that mens resorting to Rome would doe his cause little service,
hath made bold with the Latine tongue, as he does very often with
the Greek, and rendred <hi>Ad hanc Ecclesiam necesse est omnem convenire
Ecclesiam, To this Church it is necessary that every Church should agree,</hi>
you have Translated it, as it should be, <hi>to this Church it is necessary that
all Churches resort:</hi> wherein you have shewed more sincerity, and have
had more regard to make the Author speak sense. For if he had said,
<hi>By shewing the Tradition of the Roman Church we confound all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
For to this Church, all Churches must agree,</hi> what had this been,
but to give for a reason, that which was more questionable then the
thing in question: as being neither evident in it selfe, and plainly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his adversaries, and not at all proved nor offered to be proved
here or elsewhere by <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> To speak thus therefore had been weak
and ridiculous. But on the other side, if we conceive him to say thus,
<hi>You Heretiques decline a tryall of your Doctrine by Scripture, as being
corrupted and imperfect, and not fit to determine Controversies, without
recourse to Tradition, and instead hereof, you fly for refuge to a secret
Tradition, which you pretend that you received from your Ancestors, and
they from the Apostles: certainly your calumnies against Scripture are
most uniust and unreasonable, but yet moreover, assure your selves, that
if you will be tryed by Tradition, even by that also you will be overthrown.
For our Tradition is farre more famous, more constant, and in all respects
more credible, then that which you pretend to. It were easy for me, to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
up against you the uninterrupted successions of all the Churches foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Apostles, all conspiring in their Testimonies against you: But
because it were too long to number up the Successions of all Churches, I
will content my selfe with the Tradition of the most ancient and most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Church of Rome, which alone is sufficient for the confutation and
confusion of your Doctrine, as being in credit and authority, as farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Tradition you build upon, as the light of the Sunne, is beyond the
light of the Gloworme. For to this Church, by reason it is placed in the
Imperiall Citty, whither all mens affaires doe necessarily draw them, or
by reason of the powerfull Principality it hath over all the adiacent Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
there is, and alwaies hath been a necessity of a perpetuall recourse of
all the faithfull round about: who if there had been any alteration in the
Church of Rome, could not in all probability but have observed it. But
they to the contrary, have alwaies observed in this Church the very Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
which came from the Apostles and no other.</hi> I say if we conceive
his meaning thus, his words will be intelligible and rationall: which if
in stead of <hi>resort</hi> we put in <hi>agree</hi> will be quite lost. Herein therefore
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7615:190"/>
we have been beholding to your honesty, which makes me think you
did not wittingly falsify, but only twice in this sentence mistake <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<expan>

what place soever to resort to Rome</hi> is not true. That <hi>the Apostolike Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
hath alwaies been conserved there from those who are every where,</hi>
is not Sense. Now instead of <hi>conservata</hi> read <hi>observata,</hi> as in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
it should be, and translate <hi>undi<expan>

                  </hi> truly <hi>round about,</hi> and then
the sense will be both plain and good; for then it must be rendred thus,
<hi>For to this Church, by reason of a more powerfull principality, there is a
necessity that all the Churches, that is, all the faithfull round about, should
resort, in which the Apostolique Tradition hath been alwaies observed by
those who were round about.</hi> If any man say I have been too bold a
Critick in substituting <hi>observata</hi> instead of <hi>conseruata,</hi> I desire him to
know, that the conjecture is not mine, and therefore as I expect no
praise for it, so I hope I shall be farre from censure. But I would intreat
him to consider, whether it be not likely that the same greek word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
<hi>observo</hi> and <hi>conservo,</hi> the Translater of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who could
hardly speak Latine, might not easily mistake, and translate, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>conservata est,</hi> instead of <hi>observata est;</hi> Or whether it be not likely, that
those men which ancienly wrote Books, and understood them nor,
might not easily commit such an error; Or whether the sense of the
place can be salved any other way; if it can in Gods name let it, if not,
I hope he is not to be condemned, who with such a little alteration
hath made that sense which he found non sense.</p>
               <p>30 But whether you will have it <hi>Observata</hi> or <hi>Conservata,</hi> the
new <hi>sumpsimus</hi> or the old <hi>mumpsimus,</hi> possibly it may be something
to <hi>Irenaus</hi> but to us or our cause it is no way materiall. For if the rest
be rightly translated, neither will <hi>Conservata</hi> afford you any argument
against us, nor <hi>Observata</hi> helpe us to any evasion. For though at the
first hearing the glorious attributes here given, (and that justly) to the
Church of Rome, <hi>the confounding Heretiques with her tradition, and
saying it is necessary for all Churches to resort to her,</hi> may sound like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for you: yet hee that is attentive I hope will easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
that it might be good and rationall in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> having to doe
with Heretiques, who, somewhat like those who would be the only
Catholiques, declining a tryall by Scripture as not contayning the
Truth of Christ perfectly, and not fit to decide Controversies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
recourse to Tradition: I say he will easily perceive that it might
be rationall in <hi>Iraeneus</hi> to urge them with any Tradition of more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
then their own, especially a Tradition consonant to Scripture, and
even contain'd in it; and yet that it may be irrationall in you to urge us,
who doe not decline Scripture but appeale to it as a perfect rule of
faith, with a Tradition which we pretend is many wayes repugnant to
Scripture, and repugnant to a Tradition far more generall then it self,
which gives Testimony to Scripture, and lastly repugnant to it self as
giving attestation both to Scripture and to Doctrines plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Scripture. Secondly that the Authority of the Roman Church
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7615:190"/>
was then a far greater Argument of the Truth of her Tradition when
it was Vnited with all other Apostolique Churches, then now when
it is divided from them, according to that of <hi>Tertullian, Had the
Churches erred they would have varied, but that which is the same in all,
cannot be errour but Tradition;</hi> and therefore though <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be very probable, yet yours may be worth nothing. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that foureteen hundred yeares may have made a great deale of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in the Roman Church: as Rivers, though neere the fountain
they may retaine their native and unmixt syncerity, yet in long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
cannot but take in much mixture that came not from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
And therefore the Roman Tradition though then pure, may
now be corrupt and impure: and so this Argument (being one of those
things which are the worse for wearing) might in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time be
strong and vigorous, and after declining and decaying may long since
have fallen to nothing. Especially considering that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> plaies the
Historian only and not the Prophet, and saies only, that the <hi>Apostolique
Tradition had been alwayes there as in other Apostolique Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
or observed,</hi> choose you whether, but that <hi>it should be alwayes so,</hi>
he saies not, neither had he any warrant. He knew well enough that
there was foretold a <hi>great falling away of</hi> the Churches of Christ to
Anti-christ: that the Roman Church in particular was forewarned
that she also,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>nay the whole Church of the Gentiles, might fall if they look
not to their standing:</hi> and therefore to secure her that she should stand
for ever, he had no reason, nor Authority. Fourthly, that it appeares
manifestly out of this book of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> quoted by you, that the doctrine
of the Chiliasts was in his judgment Apostolique Tradition, as also
it was esteemed (for ought appeares to the contrary) by all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
and Saints, and Martyrs of or about his time, for all that speak
of it, or whose judgments in the point are any way recorded, are for it:
and <hi>Iustine Martyr</hi> professeth that <hi>all good and Orthodoxe Christians
of his time beleeved it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Dial. cunt. Tryphon.</note> and those that did not, he reckons amongst He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.
Now I demand, was this Tradition one of those that was
conserved, and observed in the Church of Rome, or was it not? If not,
had <hi>Irenaeus</hi> known so much, he must have retracted this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Church. If it was, then the Tradition of the present
Church of Rome contradicts the Ancient, and accounts it Hereticall,
and then sure it can be no certain note of Heresie to depart from
them, who have departed from themselves, and prove themselves sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto Errour by holding contradictions. Fiftly and lastly, that
out of the Story of the Church it is as manifest as the light at noone,
that though <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did esteem the Roman Tradition, a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the doctrine which he there delivers and defends against the
Heretiques of his time <hi>viz: that there was one God,</hi> yet he was very
far from thinking that Church was, and ever should be a safe keeper,
and an infallible witnesse of Tradition in generall: Inasmuch as in his
own life, his action proclaim'd the contrary. For when <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop
of Rome obtruded the Roman Tradition touching the time of Easter
upon the Asian Bishops under the pain of Excommunication, <hi>and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7615:191"/>
damnation, Irenaeus,</hi> and all the other Western Bishops, though agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him in his observation yet sharply reprehended him for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
the Asian Bishops for their disagreeing, plainly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they esteemed that not a necessary doctrine and a sufficient
ground of excommunication, which the Bishop of Rome and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
did so account of: For otherwise how could they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
him for excommunicating them, had they conceived the
cause of his excommunication just and sufficient? And besides evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declaring that they esteemed not separation from the Roman
Church a certain mark of Heresie, seeing they esteemed not them He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques
though separated and cut off from the Roman Church.</p>

the (l) successe of the after ages shewed, that even in the use of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the Popes proceeding was iust. For after the death of <hi>Victor,</hi> the

                  <note place="margin">Conc. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och. c. 1.</note> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> excommunicated

               </p>
               <p>But to this instance <hi>Calvins</hi> Sect doe annex two new observations; the
first, that the Pope having threatned the Bishops of <hi>Asia</hi> to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
them, <hi>Polycrates</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and Metropolitan of <hi>Asia,</hi>
despised the Popes threats,<note place="margin">Euseb. hist. Eccl. l. 5. c. 24. Hieron. in script. Eccl. in Polyer.</note> as it appeares by the answer of the same <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
to Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> which is inserted in the writings of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and
of <hi>S. IEROM,</hi> and which <hi>S. IEROM</hi> seemeth to approve, when he
saith, he reports it <hi>to shew the spirit and authority of the man.</hi> And the
second, that when the Pope pronounced anciently his excommunications,
he did no other thing but separate himself from the communion of those
that he excommunicated, and did not thereby separate them from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
communion of the Church. To the first then we say, that so farre is
this Epistle of <hi>Polycrates</hi> from abating and deminishing the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that contrary wise it greatly magnifies and exalts it. For although
<hi>Polycrates</hi> blinded with the love of the custome of his nation, which he
beleeved to be grounded upon the word of God, who had assigned the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of the Moneth of March for the observation of the <hi>Pasche,</hi> and
upon the example of <hi>S. IOHNS</hi> tradition maintaines it obstinately; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse,
this that he answeres, speaking in his own name,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> and in the
name of the Councell of the Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieronym, ubi supra.</note> to whom he presided; <hi>I feare
not those that threaten us, for my elders have said, it is better to obey
God then man.</hi> Doth it not shew, that had it not been, that he beleeved
the Popes threat, was against the expresse word of God, there had been cause
to feare it, and he had been obliged to obey him; for (m) who knowes not,
that this answer; <hi>it is better to obey God then men,</hi> is not to be made but
to those, whom we were obliged to obey, if their commandements were not
contrary to the commandements of God; And that he adds, that he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi> to a Nationall Councell, being (n) summoned to it
by the Pope; doth it not insinuate, that the other Councels whereof <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
speaks, that were holden about this matter,<note place="margin">Euseb. hist. Eccl. l. 5. c. 23.</note> through all the provinces of
the Earth, and particularly that of <hi>Palestina,</hi> which if you beleeve the act

was against Gods commandement? And that <hi>S. IEROM</hi> himselfe

that when <hi>S. IEROM</hi> saith; that he reports the Epistle of <hi>Polycra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
to shew the spirit, and authority of the man</hi> he intends by authority,
not authority of right, but of fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to say, the credit that <hi>Polycrates</hi>
had amongst the <hi>Asians</hi> and other <hi>Quarto decimans?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Cardinall words, The most materiall and considerable
passages whereof to save the trouble of repetition, I have noted with
letters of reference: whereunto my answers noted respectively with
the same letters follow now in order.</p>
               <p>(a) If <hi>Eusebius</hi> were an <hi>Arrian</hi> author, It is nothing to the purpose;
what he writes there is no <hi>Arrianisme,</hi> nor any thing towards it. Never
any error was imputed to the <hi>Arrians</hi> for denying the Authority or the
infallibility of the Bishop or Church of Rome. Besides what <hi>Eusebius</hi>
saies, he saies out of <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> Neither doth or can the Cardinall deny the
story to be true &amp; therefore he goes about by indirect Arts to foyle it &amp;
cast a blurre upon it. Lastly, whensoever <hi>Eusebius</hi> saies any thing,
which the Cardinall thinkes for the advantage of his side, he cites him,
and then he is no <hi>Arrian:</hi> or at least hee would not take that for an
answer to the arguments he drawes out of him.</p>
               <p>(b) That <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was enemy to the Roman Church, is said, but not
proved, neither can it be.</p>
               <p>(c) <hi>Eusebius</hi> saies the same also of <hi>caeteri omnes Episcopi,</hi> all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops: that they advised <hi>Victor</hi> to keepe those things, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to peace and unity, and that they sharpely reprehended <hi>Victor,</hi>
for having done otherwise.</p>
               <p>(d) This is said, but no offer made of any proofe of it: The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
thinks we must take every thing upon his word. They to whom
the Tradition was delivered, <hi>Polyerates</hi> and the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops, knew no
such matter, nay professed the contrary. And who is more likely to
know the Truth, they which lived within two ages of the fountain of
it, or the Cardinall who lived sixteen ages after it?</p>
               <p>(e) How can it make against those that object it: seeing it is evident
from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Reprehension, that he thought <hi>Victor</hi> and the Roman
Church, no infallible nor sufficient Iudge, of what was necessary to be
believed and done, what not: what was Vniversall Tradition, what
not: what was a sufficient ground of Excommunication and what not:
and consequently, that there was no such necessity as is pretended,
that all other Churches, should in matters of faith, conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Church of Rome?</p>
               <p>(f) This is to suppose that Excommunication, is an Act, or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or signe of Power &amp; Authority in the party excommunicating,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7615:192"/>
over the party excommunicated, whereas it is undeniably evident out
of the Church Story, that it was often used by Equalls upon Equalls,
and by Inferiors upon Superiors, if the equalls or inferiors, thought
their equalls or superiors did any thing which deserved it.</p>
               <p>(g) And what is this but to confesse, that they thought that a small
cause of excommunication and unsufficient, which <hi>Victor</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
thought great and sufficient? And consequently, that <hi>Victor</hi> and
his Part declared that to be a matter of faith and of necessity, which
they thought not so; and where was then their conformity?</p>
               <p>(h) True, you have so expounded it, but not proved nor offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
proofe of your exception. This also we must take upon your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks not one word of any other power, to which
he compares or before which he preferres the power of the Roman
Church. And it is evident out of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Can. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that
<hi>all the Principality which it had, was given it</hi> (not by God, but) <hi>by the
Church, in regard it was seated in the Imperiall City.</hi> Whereupon
when afterwards <hi>Constantinople</hi> was the Imperiall City, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that <hi>that Chuch should have equall Priviledges and dignity and
preheminence with the Church of Rome.</hi> All the Fathers agreed in
this decree, saving only the Legats of the Bishop of Rome: shewing
plainly that they never thought of any Supremacy given the Bishops
of Rome by God, or grounded upon Scripture, but only by the
Church, and therefore alterable at the Churches pleasure.</p>
               <p>(i) This is falsely translated. <hi>Convenire ad Romanam Ecclesiam,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
body knowes signifies no more but to resort or come to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church: which then there was a necessity that men should doe,
because that the affaires of the Empire were transacted in that place.
But yet <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saies not so of every Church simply, which had not
been true, but only of the adjacent Churches, for so he expounds
himselfe in saying, <hi>To this Church it is necessary that every Church,</hi> that
is, all the faithfull <hi>round about should resort.</hi> With much more reason
therefore we returne the Argument thus, Had <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thought that
all Churches must of necessity agree with the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how could he &amp;
all other Bishops have then pronounc'd, that to be no matter of Faith,
no sufficient ground of Excommunication, which <hi>Victor</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
thought to be so? And how then could they have reprehended
<hi>Victor</hi> so much, for the ill use of his power, as Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi>
confesses they did, seeing if that was true which is pretended, in this
also as well as other things, it was necessary for them to agree with
the Church of Rome?</p>
               <p>Some there are that say, but more wittily then truly, that all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> works, are so consonant to themselves, as if he had
written them in two houres. Had Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> wrote his book in
two houres, sure he would not have done that here in the middle of
the Book, which he condemns in the beginning of it. For here he urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a consequence, drawn from the mistaken words of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> against
his lively and actuall practice: which proceeding, there he justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
of evident injustice. His words are<note n="*" place="margin">In his Letter to <hi>Casaubon</hi> towards the end.</note>, <hi>For who knowes not that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7615:193"/>
it is too great an injustice to alleage consequences from passages, and even
those ill interpreted and misunderstood, and in whose illation there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
some Paralogisme hid against the expresse words, and the lively &amp;
actuall practise of the same Fathers from whom they are collected: and that
may be good, to take the Fathers for Adversaries, and to accuse them for
want of sense or memory: but not to take them for Iudges, and to submit
themselves to the observation of what they have believ'd and practised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(k) This is nothing to the purpose: he might choose these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
not as of greater force and authority in themselves, but as fitter
to be imploied against <hi>Victor,</hi> as domestique examples, are fitter and
more effectuall then forraine: and for his omitting to presse him with
his own example and others, to what purpose had it been to use them,
seeing their Letters sent to <hi>Victor</hi> from all parts, wherein they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
his presumption, shewed him sufficiently, that their example
was against him. But besides, he that reads <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Letter shall see,
that in the matter of the Lent Fast, and the great variety about the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of it, which he paralels with this of Easter, he presseth <hi>Victor</hi>
with the example of himselfe and others, not Bishops of Rome; <hi>both
they</hi> (saith hee speaking of other Bishops) <hi>notwithstanding this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
retained peace among themselves,</hi> and <hi>wee also among our selves
retaine it;</hi> inferring from his example, that <hi>Victor</hi> also ought to doe
so.</p>
               <p>(l) If the Popes proceeding was just, then the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi>
were indeed, and in the sight of God excommunicate, and out of the
state of Salvation: which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and all the other ancient Bishops ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought. And if they were so, why doe you accou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Martyrs? But the truth is, that these Councells did no way shew
the Popes proceedings just, but rather the contrary. For though they
setled an uniformity in this matter, yet they setled it as a matter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

                  <hi>Athanasius;</hi> &amp; consequently they rather declare <hi>Victors</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
unjust, who excommunicated so many Churches, for differing
from him in an indifferent matter.</p>
               <p>(m) It seemes then <hi>Polycrates</hi> might be a Saint and a Martyr, and
yet think the commands of the Roman Church enjoyned upon pain
of damnation, contrary to the commandements of God. Besides S.
<hi>Peter</hi> himselfe, the head of the Church, the Vicar of Christ (as you
pretend) made this very answer to the High Priest, yet I hope you
will not say, he was his inferior and obliged to obey him. Lastly, who
sees not, that when the Pope commandes us any thing unjust, as to
communicate Lay men in one kinde, to use the Latine service, we may
very fitly say to him, <hi>it is better to obey God then men,</hi> and yet never
think of any authority he hath over us?</p>
               <p>(n) Between requesting and summoning, methinkes there should
be some difference, and <hi>Polycrates</hi> saies no more, but that <hi>hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
by the Church of Rome</hi> to call them, and did so. Here then
(as very often) the Cardinall is faine to help the dice with a false trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and his pretence being false, every one must see, that that which
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7615:193"/>
he pretends to be insinuated by it, is cleerely inconsequent.</p>
               <p>(o) <hi>Polycrates</hi> was deceived, if he believed it to be against Gods
commandement, and the Pope deceived as much, in thinking it to be
Gods commandement, for it was neither the one nor the other, but an
indifferent matter, wherein God had not interposed his Authority.
Neither did the Councell of Nice embrace the censure of <hi>Victor,</hi> by
acknowledging his Excommunication to be just and well grounded,
for which the Cardinall neither doth pretend, nor can produce any
proofe, any way comparable to the fore-alleaged words of <hi>Athanasius</hi>
testifying the contrary; though peradventure, having setled the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and reduced it to an uniformity, they might excommunicate
those who afterward should trouble the Churches peace for an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
matter. And thus much for <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31 I come now to S. <hi>Austine,</hi> and to the first place out of him,
where he <hi>seemes to say, that the Succession in the Sea of Peter, was the
Rock which our Saviour meant when he said, upon this Rock, &amp;c.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
first we have no reason to be confident of the truth hereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
S. <hi>Austine</hi> himselfe was not, but retracts it as uncertain, &amp; <hi>leaves
to the Reader whether he will think that, or another more probable. Retr.
l. 1. c.</hi> 26. Secondly, what he saies of the Succession in the Roman
Church in this place, he saies it else where, of all the Successions in all
other Apostolique Churches. Thirdly, that as in this place he urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Donatists with separation from the Roman Church, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of their Error: So elsewhere he presseth them with their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from other Apostolique Churches, nay more from these
then from that, because in Rome the Donatists had a Bishop, though
not a perpetuall Succession of them, but in other Apostolique Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
they wanted both. <hi>These scatter'd men</hi> (saith he of the Donatists
<hi>Epist.</hi> 165.) <hi>read in the holy bookes the Churches to which the Apostles
wrote, and have no Bishop in them: But what is more perverse and mad,
then to the Lectors reading these Epistles to say, Peace with you, and to
separate from the peace of these Churches, to which these Epistles were
written?</hi> So <hi>Optatus</hi> having done you (as it might seeme) great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in upbraiding the Donatists as Schismatiques, because they had
not Communion with the Church of Rome, overthrowes and undoes
it all againe, and as it were with a spunge wipes out all that he had
said for you, by adding after, that they were Schismatiques, because
<hi>They had not the fellowship of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the seven Churches of Asia,
to which S. Iohn writes:</hi> whereof he pronounces confidently, (though

these Fathers a sufficient assurance, that separation from these other
Apostolique Churches, was a certain marke of Heresy, or not? If so,
then your Church hath been for many Ages hereticall. If not, how is
their authority, a greater argument for the Roman, then for the other
Churches? If you say, they conceived separation from these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
a note of Schisme, only when they were united to the Roman: so
also they might conceive of the Roman, only when it was united to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7615:194"/>
them. If you say, they urg'd this only as a probable, and not as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Argument, so also they might doe that. In a word, whatsoever
answer you can devise to shew, that these Fathers made not separation
from these other Churches a mark of Heresy, apply that to your own
Argument, and it will be satisfied.</p>
               <p>32 The other place is evidently impertinent to the present que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
nor is there in it any thing but this, That <hi>Caecilian might contemne
the multitude of his adversaries, because those that were united with him
were more, and of more account then those that were against him.</hi> Had
he preferr'd the Roman Church alone, before <hi>Caecilians</hi> enemies, this
had been litle, but something; but when other Countries from which
the Gospell came first into <hi>Africa,</hi> are joyned in this Patent, with the
Church of Rome, how she can build any singular priviledge upon it
I am yet to learne! Neither doe I see what can be concluded from it,

with the doctrine of the Roman Church, in all things which she
held necessary, was a certain note of a good Catholique, and by Gods
command necessary to Salvation, how was it possible they should
have opposed it in this? Vnlesse you will say they were all so foolish
as to believe at once direct contradictions, <hi>viz.</hi> that conformity to the
Roman Church was necessary in all points, and not necessary in this:
or else so horribly impious, as believing this doctrine of the Roman
Church true, and her power to receive Appeales derived from divine

               </p>
               <p>34 Your allegation of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is a manifest conviction of your
want of syncerity: For you produce with great ostentation what he
saies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but you and your fellowes alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
and dissemble, that immediatly before these words he attributes
as much for point of direction to any other Apostolique Church, and
that as he sends them to <hi>Rome</hi> who lived neare Italy, so those neare
<hi>Achaia</hi> hee sends to <hi>Corinth,</hi> those about <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Philippi,</hi> and
<hi>Thessalonica,</hi> those of <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> His words are, <hi>Goe to now thou
that wilt better imploy thy curiosity in the businesse of thy salvation,
run over the Apostolicall Churches, wherein the Chaires of the Apostles
are yet sate upon in their places, wherein their Authentique Epistles are
recited, sounding out the voyce, and representing the face of of every one!
Is Achaia neere thee? there thou hast Corinth: If thou art not farre from
Macedonia, thou hast Philippi, thou hast Thessalonica: If thou canst goe
into Asia, there thou hast Ephesus: If thou be adjacent to Italy, thou hast
Rome, whose Authority is neere at hand to us</hi> (in <hi>Africk;) A happy Church,
into which the Apostles powred forth all their Doctrine together with
their blood, &amp;c.</hi> Now I pray Sir tell me, if you can for blushing, why
this place might not have been urg'd by a Corinthian, or Philippian,
or Thessalonian, or an Ephesian, to shew that in the judgment of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
separation from any of their Churches is a certain mark of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
as iustly and rationally as you alleadge it to vindicate this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to the Roman Church only? Certainly if you will stand to
<hi>Tertullians</hi> judgment, you must either grant the authority of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church (though at that time a good Topicall Argument, and
perhaps a better then any the Heretiques had, especially in conjunction
with other Apostolique Churches:) yet I say you must grant it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
but a fallible Guide as well as that of Ephesus, and Thessalonica,
and Philippi, and Corinth: or you must maintain the Authority of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of these infallible, as well as the Roman. For though he make
a Panegyrick of the Roman Church in particular, and of the rest only
in generall, yet as I have said, for point of direction he makes them all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall;
and therefore makes them (choose you whether) either all fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
or all infallible: Now you will and must acknowledge that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended to attribute infallibility to the Churches of Ephesus, or
Corinth, or if he did, that (as experience shewes) he erred in doing so;
and what can hinder, but then we may say also that he never intended
to attribute infallibility to the Roman Church, or if he did that he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in doing so?</p>
               <p>35 From the saying of S. <hi>Basil,</hi> certainly nothing can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but only <hi>that the Bishop of Rome may discerne betweene that
which is counterfeit, and that which is lawfull and pure, and without any
diminution may preach the faith of our Ancestours.</hi> Which certainly he
might doe, if ambition and covetousnesse did not hinder him, or
else I should never condemne him for doing otherwise. But is there no
difference betweene <hi>may</hi> and <hi>must?</hi> Beleeve hee may doe so, and he
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7615:195"/>
cannot but doe so? Or doth it follow, because he may doe so, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he alwayes shall or will doe so? In my opinion rather the contrary
should follow! For he that saith you may doe thus, implies according
to the ordinary sense of words, that if he will he may doe otherwise.
You certainly may if you please leave abusing the world with such So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry
as this; but whether you will or no, of that I have no assurance.</p>
               <p>36 Your next Witnesse I would willingly have examined, but it
seemes you are unwilling he should be found, otherwise you would
have give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us your direction where we might have him. Of that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi>
who succeeded <hi>Nestorius,</hi> I can find no such thing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels:
Neither can I beleeve that any Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
twelve hundred yeares agoe was so base a parasite of the Sea of
Rome.</p>
               <p>37 Your last Witnesse <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I confesse speaks
home and advanceth the Roman sea, even to heaven: But I feare it is,
that his owne may goe up with it, which hee there professes to bee all
one sea with the sea of Rome; and therefore his Testimony, as speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his own case is not much to be regarded. But besides, I have litle
reason to be confident that this Epistle is not a forgery, for certainly
<hi>Binius</hi> hath obtruded upon us many a hundred such. This though
written by a Graecian is not extant in Greek but in Latine only. Lastly,
it comes out of a suspicious place, an old book of the <hi>Vatican Library:</hi>
which Library the world knowes to have been the Mint of very many
impostures.</p>
               <p>38 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 20. 21. 22. 23. The summe of your discourse in the 4.
next Sections, if it be pertinent to the Question in agitation, must be
this: <hi>Want of succession of Bishops and Pastours holding alwayes the same
doctrine, and of the formes of ordaining Bishops and Priests which are in
use in the Roman Church, is a certain mark of Heresie: But Protestants
want all these things: Therefore they are Heretiques.</hi> To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That nothing but want of truth and holding errour, can make or
prove any man or Church hereticall. For if he be a true Aristotelian,
or Platonist, or Pyrrhonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or Epicurean, who holds the doctrine of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi>
or <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Pirrho,</hi> or <hi>Epicurus,</hi> although he cannot assigne any
that held it before him for many Ages together, why should I not be
made a true and orthodox Christian, by beleeving all the doctrine of
Christ, though I cannot derive my descent from a perpetuall Successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that beleev'd it before me? By this reason you should say as well, that
no man can be a good Bishop or Pastour, or King or Magistrate, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that succeeds a bad one. For if I may conforme my will and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Commandements of God, why may I not embrace his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
with my understanding, although my predecessour doe not so?
You have aboue in this Chapter defin'd <hi>Faith a free Infallible, obscure,
supernaturall assent to divine Truths, because they are revealed by God
&amp; sufficiently propounded:</hi> This definition is very phantasticall; but for
the present I will let it passe, and desire you to give me some peece or
shadow of reason, why I may not doe all this without a perpetuall
Succession of Bishops and Pastours that have done so before me? You
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7615:195"/>
may judge as uncharitably, and speak as maliciously of me, as your
blind zeale to your Superstition shall direct you, but certainly I know,
(and with all your Sophistry you cannot make me doubt of what I
know,) that I doe beleeve the Gospell of Christ (as it is delivered in
the undoubted books of Canonicall Scripture,) as verily as that it is
now day, that I see the light, that I am now writing: and I beleeve it
upon this Motive, because I conceive it sufficiently, abundantly, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundantly
proved to be divine Revelation. And yet in this, I doe not
depend upon any Succession of men that have alwayes beleeved it
without any mixture of Errour; nay I am fully perswaded, there hath
been no such Succession, aud yet doe not find my self any way weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in my faith by the want of it; but so fully assured of the truth of it,
that not only, though your divels at <hi>Lowden</hi> doe tricks against it, but
though an Angell from heaven should gainsay it or any part of it, I
perswade my self that I should not be moved. This I say, and this I
am sure is true: and if you will be so hyperscepticall as to perswade me,
that I am not sure that I doe beleeve all this, I desire you to tell me,
how are you sure that you beleeve the Church of Rome? For if a man
may perswade himself he doth beleeve what he doth not beleeve, then
may you think you beleeve the Church of Rome, and yet not beleeve
it. But if no man can erre concerning what he beleeves, then you
must give me leave to assure my selfe that I doe beleeve, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that any man may beleeve the foresaid truths upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
motives, without any dependance upon any Succession that hath
beleeved it alwayes. And as from your definition of faith, so from
your definition of Heresy, this phancy may be refuted. For question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
no man can be an Heretique but he that holds an Heresie, and an
Heresie you say <hi>is a Voluntary Errour;</hi> therefore no man can be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to be an Heretique whether he will or no, by want of such a
thing that is not in his power to have: But that there should have been
a perpetuall Succession of Beleevers in all points Orthodox, is not a
thing which is in your power, therefore our being or not being Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
depends not on it. Besides, what is more certain, then that he
may make a streight line who hath a Rule to make it by, though never
man in the world had made any before: and why then may not he that
beleeves the Scripture to be the word of God, and the Rule of faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
his faith by it, and consequently beleeve aright without much
regarding what other men either will doe or have done? It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there is a necessity that if God will have his words beleeved, he
by his Providence must take order, that either by succession of men, or
by some other meanes naturall or supernaturall, it be preserv'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
and sufficiently notified to bee his word; but that this should
be done by a Succession of men that holds no errour against it, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is no more necessity, then that it should be done by a Succession
of men that commit no sinne against it. For if men may preserve the
Records of a Law, and yet transgresse it, certainly they may also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
directions for their faith, and yet not follow them. I doubt not
but Lawyers at the Barre doe find by frequent experience, that many
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:7615:196"/>
men preserve and produce evidences, which being examined of times
make against themselves. This they doe ignorantly, it being in their
power to suppresse, or perhaps to alter them. And why then should
any man conceive it strange, that an erroneous and corrupted Church
should preserve and deliver the Scriptures uncorrupted, when indeed
for many reasons which I have formerly alleaged, it was impossible
for them to corrupt them? Seeing therefore this is all the necessity
that is pretended of a perpetuall Succession of men orthodoxe in all
points, certainly there is no necessity at all of any such, neither can the
want of it prove any man or any Church Hereticall.</p>
               <p>39 When therefore you have produced some proofe of this, which
was your Major in your former Syllogisme, That want of Succession is
a certain mark of Heresy, you shall then receive a full answer to your
Minor. We shall then consider whether your indelible Character be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reality, or whether it be a creature of your own making, a fancy
of your own imagination? And if it be a thing, and not only a word,
whether our Bishops and Priests have it not as well as yours; &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
some mens perswasion that there is no such thing, can hinder them
from having it, or prove that they have it not if there be any such
thing! (Any more then a mans perswasion that he has not taken Physick
or Poyson, will marke him not to have taken it if hee has, or hinder the
operation of it?) And whether <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the place quoted by you,
speak of a Priest made a Lay-man, by just deposition or degradation,
and not by a voluntary desertion of his Order? And whether in the
same place he set not some make upon Heretiques that will agree to
your Church? Whether all the Authority of our Bishops in England
before the Reformation, was conferr'd on them by the Pope? And if it
were, whether it were the Pope's right, or an usurpation? If it were his
right, whether by Divine Law or Ecclesiasticall? And if by Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
only, whether he might possibly so abuse his power, as to deserve
to loose it? Whether <hi>de facto</hi> he had done so? Whether supposing he
had deserved to loose it, those that deprived him of it had power to
take it from him? Or if not, whether they had power to suspend him
from the use of it, untill good caution were put in, and good assurance
given, that if he had it again, he would not abuse it as he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done? Whether in case they had done unlawfully that took his
power from him, it may not (things being now setled, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
government established) be as unlawfull to goe about to restore
it? Whether it be not a Fallacy to conclude, because we believe the
Pope hath no power in England, now when the King and State and
Church hath deprived him upon just grounds of it, therefore wee
cannot believe that he had any before his deprivation? Whether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Schisme, a man may not withdraw obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from an usurp'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
commanding unlawfull things? Whether the Roman Church
might not give authority to Bishops and Priests to oppose her errors,
as well as a King gives Authority to a Iudge to judge against him, if
his cause be bad; as well as <hi>Traian</hi> gave his sword to his Prefect, with
this commission, that <hi>if he governed well, he should use it for him, if ill
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7615:196"/>
against him.</hi> Whether the Roman Church gave not Authority to her
Bishops and Priests to preach against her corruptions in manners? And
if so, why not against her errors in doctrine, if she had any? Whether
she gave them not authority to preach the whole Gospell of Christ,
and consequently against her doctrine, if it should contradict any part
of the Gospell of Christ? Whether it be not acknowledged lawfull in
the Church of Rome, for any Lay man or woman that has ability to
perswade others by word or by writing from error, and unto truth?
And why this liberty may not be practised against their Religion, if it
be false, as well as for it if it be true? Whether any man need any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commission or vocation then that of a Christian, to doe a work
of charity? And whether it be not one of the greatest works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(if it be done after a peaceable manner, and without an unnecessary
disturbance of order,) to perswade men out of a false, unto a true way
of eternall happinesse? Especially the Apostle having assur'd us, that
he, (whosoever he is) <hi>who converteth a sinner from the error of his way,
shall save a soule from death, and shall hide a multitude of sinnes?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the first Reformed Bishops died all at once, so that there were not
enough to ordain Others in the places that were vacant? Whether the
Bishops of England may not consecrate a Metropolitan of England, as
well as the Cardinalls doe the Pope? Whether the King or Queen of
England, or they that have the government in their hands, in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
of the Prince, may not lawfully commend one to them to be
consecrated, against whom there is no Canonicall exception? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Doctrine, that the King is supream head of the Church of
England, (as the Kings of Iudah, &amp; the first Christian Emperors were
of the Iewish and Christian Church,) be any new found doctrine?
Whether it may not be true, that Bishops being made Bishops, have
their authority immediatly from Christ, though this or that man be
not made Bishop without the Kings authority; as well as you say, the
Pope being Pope, has authority immediatly from Christ, and yet this
or that man cannot be made Pope without the authority of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls?
Whether you doe well to suppose, that Christian Kings have
no more authority in ordering the affaires of the Church, then the
great Turk, or the Pagan Emperors? Whether the King may not give
authority to a Bishop to exercise his function in some part of his
Kingdome, and yet not be capable of doing it himselfe: as well as a
Bishop may give authority to a Physitian, to practise Physick in his
Diocesse, which the Bishop cannot doe himselfe? Whether if <hi>Ner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
the Emperour would have commanded S. <hi>Peter</hi> or S. <hi>Paul</hi> to preach
the Gospell of Christ, and to exercise the office of a Bishop of Rome,
whether they would have question'd his Authority to doe so? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were any Law of God or man, that prohibited K. IAMES to
give Commission to Bishops, nay to lay his injunction upon them, to
doe any thing that is lawfull? Whether a casuall irregularity may not
be lawfully dispenc'd with? Whether the Popes irregularities if he
should chance to incurre any, be indispensable? And if not who is he or
who are they, whom the Pope is so subject unto, that they may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7615:197"/>
with him? Whether that be certain which you take for granted;
<hi>That your Ordination imprints a character and ours doth not?</hi> Whether
the power of consecrating and ordaining by imposition of hands, may
not reside in the Bishops, and be derived unto them, not from the
King but God; and yet the King have authority to command them
to apply this power to such a fit person, whom he shall commend unto
them: As well as if some Architects only had the faculty of archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,
and had it immediatly by infusion from God himselfe, yet, if
they were the Kings subjects, he wants not authority to command
them to build him a Palace for his use, or a fortresse for his service:
Or as the King of France pretends not to have power to make Priests
himselfe, yet I hope, you will not deny him power to command any
of his subjects that has this power, to ordaine any fit person Priest,
whom he shall desire to be ordained? Whether it doe not follow, that
whensoever the King commands an house to be built, a message to be
delivered, or a murtherer to be executed, that all these things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
done without intervention of the Architect, messenger, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner:
As well as, that they are <hi>ipsofacto</hi> ordain'd and consecrated,
who by the Kings authority are commended to the Bishops to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and consecrated: Especially seeing the King will not deny, but
that these Bishops may refuse to doe what he requires to be done, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
if the person be unworthy, if worthy, unlawfully indeed, but
yet <hi>de facto</hi> they may refuse: and in case they should doe so, whether
justly or unjustly; neither the King himselfe, nor any body else, would
esteeme the person Bishop upon the Kings designation? Whether ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Popes, though they were not consecrated Bishops by any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Prince, yet might not, or did not receive authority from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
to exercise their Episcopall function in this or that place? And
whether the Emperors had not authority, upon their desert, to deprive
them of their jurisdiction, by imprisonment or banishment? Whether
Protestants doe indeed pretend that their Reformation is universall?
Whether in saying, the <hi>Donatists, Sect was confined to Africa,</hi> you doe
not forget your selfe, and contradict what you said above, in §. 17. of
this Chapter, where you tell us, <hi>they had some of their Sect residing in
Rome?</hi> Whether it be certain, that none can admit of Bishops willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but those that hold them of divine institution? Whether they may
not be willing to have them, conceiving that way of government the
best, though not absolutely necessary? Whether all those Protestants
that conceive the distinction between Priests and Bishops, not to be of
divine institution, be Schismaticall and Hereticall for thinking so?
Whether your forme of ordaining Bishops and Priests, be essentiall to
the constitution of a true Church? Whether the formes of the Church
of England differ essentially from your formes? Whether in saying,
that <hi>the true Church cannot subsist without undoubted true Bishops and
Priests,</hi> you have not overthrown the truth of your own Church:
wherein I have proved it plainly impossible, that any man should be so
much as morally certain, either of his own Priesthood or any other
mans? Lastly, whether any one kind of these externall formes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:7615:197"/>
and government be so necessary to the being of a Church, but
that they may not be diverse in diverse places, and that a good and
peaceable Christian may and ought to submit himself to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the place where he lives whatsoever it be? All these Questions
will be necessary to be discussed for the clearing of the truth of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
proposition of your former Syllogisme, and your proofs of it: and
I will promise to debate them fairly with you, if first you will bring
some better proof of the <hi>Maior, That want of Succession is a certain note
of Heresy,</hi> which for the present remaines both unprov'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.</p>
               <p>40 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 23. <hi>The Fathers,</hi> you say, <hi>assigne Succession as one mark
of the true Church:</hi> I confesse they did urge Tradition as an argument
of the truth of their doctrine and of the falsehood of the contrary; and
thus farre they agree with you. But now see the difference: They
urg'd it not against all Heretiques that ever should be, but against them
who rejected a great part of the Scripture, for no other reason but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was repugnant to their doctrine, and corrupted other parts
with their additions and detractions, and perverted the remainder with
divers absurd interpretations:</hi> So <hi>Tertullian</hi> not a leafe before the
words by you cited. Nay they urg'd it against them who <hi>when they
were confuted out of Scripture, fell to accuse the Scriptures themselves as
if they were not right, and came not from good authority, as if they were
various one from another, and as if truth could not bee found out of them,
by those who know not Tradition, for that it was not delivered in writing,</hi>
(they did meane wholly,) <hi>but by word of mouth: And that thereupon
Paul also said, wee speak wisdome amongst the perfect.</hi> So <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the
very next Chapter before that which you alleage. Against these men
being thus necessitated to doe so, they did urge Tradition, but what or
whose Tradition was it: Certainly no other but the joint Tradition of
all the Apostolique Churches, with one mouth and one voice teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same doctrine. Or if for brevity sake they produce the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any one Church, yet is it apparent, that, that one was then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with all the rest; <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> testifie as much
in the words cited, and <hi>S. Austin,</hi> in the place before alleaged by mee.
This Tradition they did urge against these men, and in a time, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of ours, almost contiguous to the Apostles: So neare, that
one of them, <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> was Scholar to one who was Scholar to S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Apostle, <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> were not an age remov'd from him:
and the last of them all, litle more then an age from them. Yet after all
this they urg'd it not as a demonstration, but only as a very probable
argument, far greater then any their Adversaries could oppose against
it. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the place above quoted §. 5. <hi>How is it likely that so
many and so great Churches should erre in one faith?</hi> (it should be, should
have erred into on faith.) And this was the condition of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the Fathers urg'd it. Now if you having to deale with us, who
question no Booke of Scripture, which was not anciently questioned
by some whom you your selves esteem good Catholiques; nay who
refuse not to be tryed by your owne Canons, your own Translations,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7615:198"/>
who in interpreting Scriptures are content to allow of all those rules
which you propose, only except that we will not allow you to be our
Iudges; if you will come fifteen hundred years after the Apostles, a
fair time for the purest Church to gather much drosse and corruption,
and for the <hi>mystery of iniquity</hi> to bring its work to some perfection,
which <hi>in the Apostles time began to work,</hi> If (I say) you will come thus
long after and urge us with the single Tradition of one of these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
being now Catholique to it selfe alone, and Hereticall to all the
rest: nay not only with her ancient and originall Traditions, but also
with her post-nate and introduc'd Definitions, and these as we pretend,
repugnant to Scripture, and ancient Tradition, and all this to decline an
indifferent tryall by Scripture, under pretence (wherein also you agree
with the calumnie of the old Heretiques) that <hi>all necessary truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found in them without recourse to Tradition:</hi> If, I say, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all these differences, you will still be urging us with this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the very same and of the same force with that wherewith the
fore-mentioned Fathers urg'd the old Heretiques, certainly this must
needs proceed from a confidence you have, not only that we have no
School-Divinity, nor Metaphysicks, but no Logick or common sense,
that we are but pictures of men, and have the definition of rational
creatures given us in vain.</p>
               <p>41 But now suppose I should be liberall to you, and grant what
you cannot prove, that the Fathers make Succession a certain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k of the true Church; I beseech you what will come of
it? What, that want of Succession is a certain signe of an Hereticall
company? Truly if you say so, either you want Logick, which is a
certain signe of an ill disputer; or are not pleas'd to use it, which is a
worse. For speech is a certain signe of a living man, yet want of speech
is no sure argument that he is dead, for he may be dumb and yet living
still, and we may have other evident tokens that hee is so, as eating,
drinking, breathing, moving: So, though the constant and universall
delivery of any doctrine by the Apostolique Churches ever since the
Apostles, be a very great argument of the truth of it, yet there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
but that truth, even Divine truth, may through mens wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
be contracted from its universality, and interrupted in its perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,
and so loose this argument, and yet not want others to iustifie
and support it self. For it may be one of those principles which God
hath written in all mens hearts, or a conclusion evidently arising from
them: It may be either contain'd in Scripture in expresse terms, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
from it by apparent consequence. If therefore you intend to
prove want of a perpetuall Succession of Professors a certain note of
Heresie, you must not content your self to shew, that having it is one
signe of truth; but you must shew it to be the only signe of it and inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from it. But this, if you be well advis'd, you will never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
First because it is an impossible attempt: and then because if you
doe it you will marre all: for by proving this an inseparable signe of
Catholique doctrine, you will prove your own, which apparently
wants it in many points, not to be Catholique. For whereas you say
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7615:198"/>
                  <hi>this Succession requires two things, agreement with the Apostles doctrine,
and an uninterrupted conveyance of it down to them that challenge it:</hi> It
will be prov'd against you that you fail in both points; and that some
things wherein you agree with the Apostles have not been held al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
as your condemning the doctrine of the Chiliasts, and holding
the Eucharist not necessary for Infants; and that in many other things
you agree not with them nor with the Church for many ages after.
For example; In mutilation of the Communion, in having your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in such a language as the Assistants generally understand nor,
your offering to Saints, your picturing of God, your worshipping of
Pictures.</p>
               <p>42 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 24. As for <hi>Vniversality of place, the want whereof you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Protestants as a marke of Heresie:</hi> You have not set down
cleerely and univocally what you mean by it, whether universality of
fact or of right: and if of fact, whether absolute or comparative: and
if comparative, whether of the Church in compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or only of Hereticall Christians: or if in comparison of these,
whether in comparison of all other Sects conjoyn'd, or in comparison
only of any One of them. Nor have you proved it by any good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in any sense to be a certain mark of Heresy: For those places of
S. <hi>Austine</hi> doe not deserve the name. And truly in my judgement you
have done advisedly in proving it no better. For as for Vniversality
of right, or a right to Vniversality, all Religions claime it, but only
the true has it, and which has it cannot be determin'd, unlesse it first
be determin'd which is the true. An absolute Vniversality, and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
through all the world if you should pretend to, all the world
would laugh at you. If you should contend for latitude with any one
Religion, <hi>Mahumetisme</hi> would carry the victory from you. If you
should oppose your selves against all other Christians besides you, it
is certain you would be cast in this suit also. If lastly, being hard driven
you should please you selves with being more then any one Sect of
Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it would presently be replied, that it is u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>certain whether now
you are so, but most certain that the time has been when you have not

that if you had prov'd want of Universality even thus restrained, to be

And besides, I see not how you would have avoided this great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
of laying grounds and storeing up arguments for Antichrist,
against he comes, by which he may prove his Company the true
Church. For it is evident out of Scripture, and confessed by you, that

that the true Church shall be then, the <hi>woman driven into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>43 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. The remainder of this Chapter if I would
deale strictly with you, I might let passe as impertinent to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
now disputed. For whereas your argument promises that this
whole Chapter shall be imploied in proving <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; the Protestants
guilty of Heresy, here you desert this question, and strike out into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
accusation of them, that <hi>their faith even of the truth they hold,
is not indeed true faith.</hi> But put case it were not, does it follow, that
the having of this faith makes them Heretiques, or that they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Heretiques because they have this faith? <hi>Aristotle</hi> beleeved there
were Intelligences which moved the Spheares; he believed this with
an humane perswasion, and not with a certain, obscure, prudent, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
faith: and will you make <hi>Aristotle</hi> an Heretique, because he
believed so? You believe there was such a man as <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that
there is such a City as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and your beliefe here of has
not these qualifications which you require: And will you be content
that this shall passe for a sufficient proofe that you are an Heretique?
Heresy you have defin'd above to be a voluntary error: but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
truth, though his belief be not qualified according to your
minde, yet sure in believing truth he believes no error; &amp; from hence
according to ordinary Logick methinkes it should follow, that such a
man for doing so, cannot be guilty of Heresy.</p>
               <p>44 But you will say, though he be not guilty of Heresy for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
these truths, yet if his faith be not saving, to what purpose will
it be? Truly very litle to the purpose of Salvation, as litle as it is to
your proving Protestants guilty of Heresy. But out of our wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
let us pardon this fault also, and doe you the favour to hear
what you can say, to beget this faith in us, that indeed wee have no
faith, or at least not such a <hi>faith, without which it is impossible to please
God.</hi> Your discourse upon this point, you have, I know not upon
what policie, disjoynted, and given us the grounds of it in the begining
of the Chapter, and the superstructure here in the end. Them I have
already examined, and for a great part of them, proved them vain and
deceitfull. I have shewed by many certain arguments, that though
the subject matter of our faith be in it selfe most certain, yet that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
certainty of adherence, is not required to the essence of faith, no
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7615:199"/>
nor to make it acceptable with God, but that to both these effects it
is sufficient, if it be firme enough to produce Obedience and Charity.
I haue shewed besides, that Prudence is rather commendable in faith,
then intrinsecall and essentiall to it. So that whatsoever is here said,
to prove the faith of Protestants no faith, for want of certainty or for
want of prudence, is already answered before it is objected: for the
foundation being destroyed the building cannot stand. Yet for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
refutation of all pretences, I will here make good, that to prove
our faith destitute of these qualifications, you have produc'd but vain
Sophismes, and for the most part, such arguments as returne most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
upon your selves. Thus then you say,</p>
               <p>45 <hi>First that their belief wanteth certainty, I prove, because they
denying the universall Infallibility of the Church, can have no certain
ground to know what objects are revealed or testified by God.</hi> But if there
be no other ground of certainty but your Churches infallibility, upon
what certain ground doe you know that your Church is infallible?
Upon what certain ground doe you know all those things which must
be known before you can know that your Church is infallible? As
that there is a God: that God hath promised his assistance to your
Church in all her Decrees: that the Scripture wherein this promise is
extant is the word of God: that those texts of Scripture which you
alleage for your infallibility are incorrupted: that that which you
pretend is the true sense of them? When you have produc'd certain
grounds for all these things, I doubt not but it will appeare, that we
also may have grounds certain enough to believe our whole Religion,
which is nothing else but the Bible, without dependance on the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
infallibility. Suppose you should meet with a man that for the
present, believes neither Church, nor Scripture, nor God, but is ready
&amp; willing to believe them all, if you can shew some sufficient grounds
to build his faith upon; will you tell such a man there are no certain
grounds, by which he may be converted; or there are? If you say the
first, you make all Religion an uncertain thing; If the second, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you must ridiculously perswade, that your Church is infallible,
because it is infallible, or else that there are other certain grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
your Churches infallibility.</p>
               <p>46 But you proceed and tell us, that <hi>Holy Scripture is in it selfe
most true and infallible, but without the direction and declaration of the
Church, we can neither have certain meanes to know what Scripture is
Canonicall, nor what Translations be faithfull, nor what is the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Scripture.</hi> Answ. But all these things must be known, before
we can know the direction of your Church to be infallible, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proofe of it can be pretended, but only some Texts of Canonicall
Scripture, truly interpreted: Therefore either you are mistaken, in
thinking there is no other meanes to know these things, but your
Churches infallible direction, or we are excluded from all meanes of
knowing her direction to be infallible.</p>
               <p>47 <hi>But Protestants, though as you suppose, they are perswaded their
own oponions are true, and that they have used such meanes as are wont to
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7615:200"/>
be prescribed for understanding the Scripture, as Prayer, conferring of
Texts &amp;c. Yet by their disagreement shew, that some of them are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Now they hold all the Articles of their faith, upon this only ground
of Scripture, interpreted by these rules, and therefore it is cleere, that the
ground of their faith is infallible in no point at all.</hi> The first of these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
must needs be true, but the second is apparently false: I
mean, that every Protestant is perswaded that he hath used those means
which are prescribed for understanding of Scripture. But that which
you collect from these suppositions is cleerely inconsequent: and by
as good Logick you might conclude, that Logick and Geometry
stand upon no certain grounds, that the rules of the one, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the other doe sometimes faile, because the disagreement of
Logicians and Geometricians shew, that some of them are deceived.
Might not a Iew conclude as well against all Christians, that they have
no certain ground whereon to rely in their understanding of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because their disagreements shew that some are deceived; because
some deduce from it the infallibility of a Church, and others no such
matter? So likewise a Turke might use the same argument against both
Iewes and Christians, and an Atheist against all Religions, and a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
against all reason. Might not the one say, Mens disagreement in
Religion, shew that there is no certainty in any; and the other, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of their contradictions teacheth, that the rules of reason doe
sometimes faile? Doe not you see and feele how void of reason and
how full of impiety your sophistry is? And how transported with
zeale against Protestants, you urge arguments against them, which if
they could not be answered, would overthrow not only your own, but
all Religion? But God be thanked, the answere is easy and obvious!
For let men but remember not to impute the faults of men but only to
men, and then it will easily appear, that there may be sufficient certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in reason, in Religion, in the rules of interpreting Scripture, though
men through their faults, take not care to make use of them, and so run
into divers errors and dissentions.</p>
               <p>48 <hi>But Protestants cannot determine what points be fundamentall,
and therefore must remain uncertain, whether or no they be not in some
fundamentall error.</hi> Ans. By like reason since you acknowledge, that
every error in points defin'd and declared by your Church destroies
the substance of faith, and yet cannot determine what points be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it followeth that you must remain uncertain, whether or no you
be not in some fundamentall error, and so want the substance of faith,
without which there can be no hope of Salvation. Now that you are
uncertain what points are defined, appeares from your owne words.
<hi>c.</hi> 4. §. 3. of your second Part, where say you, <hi>No lesse impertinent is your
discourse, concerning the difficulty to know what is Heresy: For we grant
that it is not alwaies easy to determine in particular occasions, whether
this or that Doctrine be such, because it may be doubtfull, whether it be
against any Scripture, or divine Tradition, or Definition of the Church.</hi>
Neither were it difficult to extort from you this confession, by naming
diverse Points, which some of you say are defin'd, others the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7615:200"/>
And others hang in suspense, and know not what to determine.
But this I have done elsewhere: as also I have shewed plainly enough,
that though we cannot perhaps say in particular, thus much, and no
more is fundamentall, yet believing all the Bible, we are certain enough
that we believe all that is fundamentall. As he that in a receit, takes
twenty ingredients whereoften only are necessary, though he know
not which those ten are, yet taking the whole twenty he is sure enough
that he has taken all that are necessary.</p>
               <p>49 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 29. <hi>But that he who erreth against any one revealed truth
looseth all Divine Faith, is a very true doctrine delivered by Catholique
Divines,</hi> (you mean your own) <hi>with so generall a consent, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is wont to be censur'd as temerarious: Now certainly some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
must doe so, because they hold contradictions which cannot all be
true; Therefore some of them at least, have no divine faith.</hi> Ans. I passe
by your weaknesse, in urging Protestants with the authority of your
Divines, which yet in you might very deservedly be censur'd. For
when D. <hi>Potter,</hi> to shew the many actuall dissentions between the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Doctors, notwithstanding their braggs of potentiall Vnity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
to <hi>Pappus,</hi> who has collected out of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> their contradictions,
and set them down in his own words to the number of 237. &amp; to <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,
de Sect is &amp; controversiis Religionis Papisticae;</hi> you making the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same use of M. <hi>Breerely</hi> against Protestants; yet jeere and scorne D.
<hi>Potter,</hi> as if he offer'd you for a proofe, the bare authority of <hi>Pappus</hi>
and <hi>Flacius,</hi> and tell him, which is all the answer you vouchsafe him,
<hi>It is pretty that he brings Pappus and Flacius, flat Heretiques, to prove
your many contradictions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> As if he had proved this with the bare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
the bare judgement of these men, which sure he does not, but
with the formall words of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> faithfully collected by <hi>Pappus.</hi>
And why then might not we say to you, Is it not pretty that you
bring <hi>Breerly</hi> as flat an Heretique as <hi>Pappus</hi> or <hi>Flacius,</hi> to prove the
contradictions of Protestants? Yet had he been so vain as to presse you
with the meere authority of Protestant Divines in any point, me
thinkes for your own sake, you should have pardon'd him, who here
and in many other places, urge us with the judgement of your Divines
as with weighty arguments. Yet, if the authority of your Divines
were even Canonicall, certainly nothing could be concluded from it
in this matter, there being not one of them, who delivers for true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
this position of yours, thus nakedly set down, <hi>That any error
against any one revealed truth destroies all divine faith.</hi> For they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
(not your selfe excepted) that this truth must not only be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but revealed publiquely, and (all things considered) sufficiently
propounded to the erring Party, to be one of those, which God under
pain of damnation commands all men to believe. And therefore the
contradiction of Protestants (though this vaine doctrine of your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
were supposed true, is but a weak argument) That any of them
have no divine. Faith, seeing you neither have, not ever can prove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(without begging the Question of your Churches infallibility,) that
the truthes about which they differ, are of this quality and condition.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7615:201"/>
But though out of curtesy wee may suppose this doctrine true, yet
we have no reason to grant it, nor to think it any thing but a vain and
groundlesse fancy: and that this very weak and inartificiall argument,
from the authority of your Divines, is the strongest pillar which it
hath to support it. Two reasons you alleage for it out of <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi>
the first whereof vainly supposeth against reason and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that <hi>by the commission of any deadly sinne, the habit of Charity is
quite extirpated.</hi> And for the second, though you cry it up for an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi>
and think like the Gorgons head it will turne us all into stone,
and in confidence of it, insult upon D. <hi>Potter</hi> as if he durst not come
near it, yet in very truth having considered it well, I finde it a serious,
grave, prolixe, and profound <hi>nothing.</hi> I could answer it in a word, by
telling you, that it beggs without all proofe or colour of proofe, the
main question between us, that the infallibility of your Church is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the formall motive, or rule, or a necessary condition of faith:
which you know we flatly deny, and therefore all that is built upon
it has nothing but wind for a foundation. But to this answer I will
adde a large confutation of this vain fancy, out of one of the most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
and profound Doctors of your own Church, I mean <hi>Estius,</hi>
who upon the third of the <hi>Sent.</hi> the 23. <hi>dist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the 13. §. writes thus, <hi>It is
disputed</hi> (saith he) <hi>whether in him who believes some of the Articles of
our faith, and disbelieves others, or perhaps someone, there be faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called in respect of that which he does believe? In which question
we must before all, carefully distinguish between those, who retaining a
generall readinesse to believe whatsoever the Church believes, yet erre
by ignorance in some doctrine of faith, because it is not as yet sufficiently
declared to them that the Church does so believe; and those who after suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
manifestation of the Churches doctrine, doe yet choose to dissent
from it, either by doubting of it, or affirming the contrary. For of the
former the answer is easy; but of these, that is, of Heretiques retaining
some part of wholsome doctrine, the question is more difficult, and on both
sides by the Doctors probably disputed. For that there is in them true
faith of the Articles wherein they doe not erre, first experience seemes to
convince: For many at this day denying, for example sake, Purgatory, or
Invocation of Saints, neverthelesse firmely hold, as by divine revelation,
that God is Three and One<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Sonne of God was incarnate and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and other like things. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>As anciently the Novatians, excepting their
peculiar error, of denying reconciliation to those that fell in persecution,
held other things in common with Catholiques: So that they assisted them
very much against the Arrians, as Socrates relates in his Eccl. Hist.
Moreover the same thing is proved by the example of the Apostles, who
in the time of Christs passion being scandaliz'd, lost their faith in him: as
also, Christ after his resurrection upbraids them with their incredulity,
and calls Thomas incredulous, for denying the Resurrection,</hi> Ioh. 20.
<hi>Whereupon S. Austine also in his preface upon the</hi> 96. Ps. saith, <hi>That after
the Resurrection of Christ, the faith of those that fell was restored again.
And yet we must not say, that the Apostles then lost the faith of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of the Creation of the world, of Eternall life, and such like other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7615:201"/>
Besides, the Iewes before Christs comming, held the faith of one
God the Creator of Heaven and Earth: who although they lost the true
faith of the Messias by not receiving Christ, yet we cannot say, that they
lost the faith of one God, but still retained this Article as firmely as they
did before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Adde hereunto, that neither Iewes nor Heretiques seeme to lye, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they believe either the books of the Prophets, or the four Gospels: It
being apparent enough, that they acknowledge in them Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though they hold not the true sense of them, to which purpose is that in
the Acts. c. 20. Believest thou the Prophets? I know that thou believest.
Lastly it is manifest, that many gifts of God, are found even in bad men,
and such as are out of the Church; therefore nothing hinders but that
Iewes and Heretiques, though they erre in many things, yet in other
things may be so divinely illuminated as to believe aright. So S. Austin
seemes to teach in his book, <hi>De Vnico Baptismo: contra Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ilianum</hi> c. 3.
in these words: When a Iew comes to us to be made a Christian, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
not in him Gods good things but his own ill. That he believes one
God is to be worshipped, that he hopes for eternall life, that he doubts not
of the Resurrection, we approve and commend him: we acknowledge, that
as he did believe these things, so he is still to believe them, and as he did
hold, so he is still to hold them. Thus he: subioyning more to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the next, and again in the 26. Chapter, and in his third book, De
Bapt. contr. Donat. cap. ult. and upon Psal. 64. But now this reason seems
to perswade the contrary: Because the formall obiect of faith seemes to be
the first verity, as it is manifested by the Churches Doctrine as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and infallible Rule, wherefore whosoever adheres not to this Rule, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he assent to some matters of faith, yet he embraces them not with
faith, but with some other kinde of assent: as if a man assent to a conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not knowing the reason by which it is demonstrated, he hath not true
knowledge, but an opinion only of the same conclusion. Now that an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique
adheres not to the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le aforesaid, it is manifest: Because if he did
adhere to it, as divine and infallible, he would receive all without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the Church teacheth, and so would not be an Heretique. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner discourseth S. Thom. 2. 2. q. 5. art. 3. From whom yet
Dur and dissents upon this distinction, thinking there may be in an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
true faith, in respect of the Articles in which he doth not erre. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as Scotus and Bonaventure, define not the matter plainly, but seeme
to choose a middle way.</p>
               <p>To the authority of S. Austine and these Schooleme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
That it is usuall with good Christians to say, that Heretiques
have not the entire faith. Whereby it seemes to be intimated, that some
part of it they doe retaine. Whereof this may be another reason: That if
the truths which a Iew or a Heretique holds, he should not hold them by
faith, but after some other manner, to wit, by his own proper will and
judgement, it will follow, that all that excellent knowledge of God and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things, which is found in them, is to be attributed not to the grace of
God, but the strength of Free will, which is against S. Austine, both else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and especially in the end of his book <hi>De potentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:7615:202"/>
As for the reason alleaged to the contrary, We answer: It is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to faith, by what meanes we believe the prime Verity, that is, by what
meanes God useth to conferre upon men the gift of Faith. For although
now the ordinary meanes be the Testimony and teaching of the Church,
yet it is certain that by other meanes, faith hath been given heretofore,
and is given still. For many of the Ancients, as <hi>Adam, Abraham, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck,
Iob,</hi> received faith by speciall revelation; the Apostles by the
Miracles and Preaching of Christ; others again by the Preaching and
miracles of the Apostles; and Lastly others, by other meanes, when as yet
they had heard nothing of the infallibility of the Church; to little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by Baptisme, without any other help, faith is infus'd: And therefore
it is possible, that a man not adhering to the Churches doctrine as a Rule
infallible, yet may receive some things for the word of God, which doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
truly belong to the faith, either because they are now, or heretofore
have been confirm'd by miracles: Or because he manifestly sees that the
ancient Church taught so, or upon some other inducement. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
we must not say, that Heretiques and Iewes doe hold the Faith,
but only some part of the Faith. For the Faith signifies an entire thing,
and compleat in all parts; whereupon an Heretique is said to be simply an
Infidell, to have lost the Faith, and according to the Apostle 1. Tim. 1. to
have made shipwrack of it, although he holds some things, with the same
strength of assent and readinesse of will, wherewith by others are held all
those points which appertaine to the Faith. <hi>And thus farre</hi> Estius.
<hi>Whose discourse I presume may passe for a sufficient refutation of
your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of</hi> Aquinas. <hi>And therefore your Corollaries drawn
from it, That</hi> every error against faith, involves opposition against Gods
testimony, <hi>That</hi> Protestants have no Faith, no certainty, <hi>and that</hi> you
have all Faith, <hi>must together with it fall to the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>50 But <hi>if Protestants have certainty, they want obscurity, and so
have not that faith, which as the Apostle saith is of things not appearing.</hi>
This argument you prosecute in the next Paragraph; But I can find
nothing in it, to convince or perswade me that Protestants cannot have
as much certainty as is required to faith, of an object not so evident as
to beget science. If obscurity will not consist with certainty in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree, then you are to blame for requiring to faith contradicting
conditions. If certainty and obscurity will stand together, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can be imagin'd that a Protestant may not entertain them both as
well as a Papist? Your bodies &amp; souls, your understandings and wills
are, I think, of the same condition with ours: And why then may not
we be certain of an obscure thing as well as you? And as you made
this long discourse against Protestants, why may not wee putting
Church instead of Scripture, send it back again to you? And say; If
Papists have certainty, they want obscurity, and so have not that faith,
which as the Apostle saith, is <hi>of things not appearing,</hi> or not necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our understanding to an assent? For the whole edifice of the faith
of Papists is setled on these two principles, These particular proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are the propositions of the Church, And the sense and meaning
of them is clear and evident, at least in all points necessary to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:7615:202"/>
Now these principles being one suppos'd, it clearly followeth,
that what Papists beleeve as necessary to salvation is evidently known
by them to be true, by this argument; It is certain and evident, that
whatsoever is the word of God or Divine Revelation is true; But it
is certain and evident that these propositions of the Church in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
are the word of God and Divine Revelations; therefore it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and evident, that all propositions of the Church are true. Which
Conclusion I take for a Major in a second argument, and say thus; It
is certain and evident that all propositions of the Church are true; But
it is certain and evident, that such particulars, for example, The law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of the halfe Communion, The lawfulnesse and expedience of
Latine Service, the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, Indulgences &amp;c.
are the Propositions of the Church; therefore it is certain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that these particular objects are true. Neither will it avail you
to say, that the said principles are not evident by naturall discourse,
but only by the eye of reason clear'd by grace: For supernaturall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
no lesse (yea rather more) drowns and excludes obscurity, then
naturall evidence doth. Neither can the Partie so enlightned, be said
voluntarily to captivate his understanding to that light, but rather his
understanding is by necessity made captive and forc'd not to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
what is presented by so clear a light. And therefore your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
faith is not the true faith defined by the Apostle, but an inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your own.</p>
               <p>51 And having thus cryed quittance with you, I must intreat you
to devise (for truly I cannot) some answer to this argument, which
will not serve in proportion to your own. For I hope you will not
pretend that I have done you injurie, in setling your faith upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which you disclaim. And if you alleage this disparity, That
you are more certain of your principles, then we of ours, and yet you
doe not pretend that your principles are so evident, as we doe that ours
are: what is this to say, but that you are more confident then we, but
confesse you have lesse reason for it? For the evidence of the thing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to, be it more or lesse, is the reason and cause of the assent in the
understanding. But then besides, I am to tell you, that you are here, as
every where, extremely, if not affectedly mistaken in the Doctrine of
Protestants; who though they acknowledge, that the things which they
beleeve are in themselves as certain as any demonstrable or sensible
verities, yet pretend not that their certainty of adherence is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and absolute, but such as may be perfected and increas'd as long
as they <hi>walke by faith and not by sight.</hi> And consonant hereunto is
their doctrine touching the evidence of the objects whereunto they
adhere. For you abuse the world &amp; them, if you pretend that they hold
the first of your two principles, That these particular Books are the
word of God, (for so I think you mean) either to be in it self evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
certain, or of it self and being devested of the motives of credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
evidently credible: For they are not so fond as to be ignorant, nor
so vain as to pretend, that all men doe assent to it, which they would if
it were evidently certain, nor so ridiculous as to imagine, that if an
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7615:203"/>
Indian that never heard of Christ or Scripture, should by chance find
a Bible in his own Language, and were able to read it, that upon the
reading it hee would certainly without a miracle beleeve it to bee the
word of God: which he could not chuse if it were evidently credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
What then doe they affirm of it? Certainly no more then this, that
whatsoever man that is not of a perverse mind, shall weigh with seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and mature deliberation, those great moments of reason which
may incline him to beleeve the Divine authority of Scripture, and
compare them with the light objections that in prudence can be made
against it, he shall not chuse but find sufficient nay abundant induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to yeeld unto it firme faith and syncere obedience. Let that
learned man <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> speake for all the Rest, in his Booke <hi>of the
truth of Christian Religion;</hi> which Book whosoever attentively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses
shall find that a man may have great reason to be a Christian
without dependance upon your Church for any part of it: and that
your Religion is no foundation, but rather a scandall and an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against Christianity. He then in the last Chapter of his second book
hath these excellent words, <hi>If any be not satisfied with these arguments
above-said, but desires more forcible reasons for confirmation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Christian Religion, let such know that as there are variety of
things which be true, so are there divers waies of proving or manifesting
the truth. Thus is there one way in Mathematicks, another in Physicks, a
third in Ethicks, and lastly another kind when a matter of fact is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
wherein verily we must rest content with such testimonies as are
free from all suspition of untruth; otherwise down goes all the frame and
use of history, and a great part of the art of Physick, together with all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnesse
that ought to be between parents and children: for matters of
practice can no way else be known but by such testimonies. Now it is the
pleasure of Almighty God that those things which he would have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
(so that the very beleef thereof may be imputed to us for obedience)
should not so evidently appear, as those things which are apprehended by
sense and plaine demonstration, but only be so farre forth revealed as may
beget faith, and a perswasion thereof, in the hearts and minds of such as
are not obstinate: That so the Gospell may be as a touchstone for triall of
mens judgments, whether they be sound or unsound. For seeing these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
whereof we have spoken, have induced so many honest, godly, and
wise men to approve of this Religion, it is thereby plain enough that the
fault of other mens infidelity is not for want of sufficient testimony, but
because they would not have that to be had and embraced for truth which
is contrary to their wilfull desires; it being a hard matter for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
their honours, and set at naught other commodities; which thing
they know they ought to doe, if they admit of Christs doctrine and obey
what he hath commanded. And this is the rather to be noted of them, for
that many other historicall narrations are approved by them to be true,
which notwithstanding are only manifest by authority, and not by any such
strong proofs, and perswasions, or tokens, as doe declare the history of
Christ to be true: which are evident, partly by the confession of those Iewes
that are yet alive; and partly in those companies and congregations of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7615:203"/>
Christians which are any where to be found; whereof doubtlesse there was
some cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly seeing the long duration or continuance of Christian Religion,
and the large extent thereof can be ascribed to no humane power, therefore
the same must be attributed to miracles: or if any deny that it came to passe
through a miraculous manner; this very getting so great strength and
power without a miracle, may be thought to surpasse any miracle.</p>
               <p>52 And now you see I hope that Protestants neither doe nor need
to pretend to any such evidence in the doctrine they beleeve, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well consist both with the essence and the obedience of faith. Let
us come now to the last nullity which you impute to the faith of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and that it is <hi>want of Prudence.</hi> Touching which point, as I have
already demonstrated, that wisdome is not essentiall to faith, but that
a man may truly beleeve truth, though upon insufficient motives; So
I doubt not but I shall make good, that if prudence were necessary to
faith, we have better title to it then you; and that if a wiser then <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
were here, he should have better reason to beleeve the Religion
of Protestants then Papists, the Bible rather then the Councell of
<hi>Trent.</hi> But let us hear what you can say!</p>
               <p>53 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 31. You demand then first of all, <hi>What wisdome was it
to forsake a Church confessedly very ancient, and besides which there could
be demonstrated no other Visible Church of Christ upon earth?</hi> I answer:
Against God and truth there lyes no presoription, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it might be great wisdome to forsake ancient errours for more
ancient Truths. One God is rather to be follow'd then innumerable
worlds of men: And therefore it might be great wisdome either for
the whole Visible Church, nay for all the men in the world, having
wandred from the way of Truth, to return unto it; or for a part
of it, nay for one man to doe so, although all the world besides were
madly resolute to doe the contrary. It might be great wisdome to
forsake the errors though of the only Visible Church, much more the
Roman, which in conceiving her self the whole Uisible Church, does
somewhat like the Frog in the Fable, which thought the ditch he liv'd
in to be all the world.</p>
               <p>54 You demand again, <hi>What wisdome was it to forsake a Church
acknowledg'd to want nothing necessary to Salvation, indued with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Bishops, &amp;c, us<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> ad Election or Choice?</hi> I answer: Yet might
it be great wisdome to forsake a Church not acknowledged to want
nothing necessary to Salvation, but accused and convicted of many
damnable errors: certainly damnable to them who were convicted of
them, had they still persisted in them after their conviction; though
perhaps pardonable (which is all that is acknowledg'd) to such as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
continued in them. A Church vainly arrogating without
possibility of proof a perpetuall Succession of Bishops, holding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the same doctrine; and with a ridiculous impudence pretending
perpetuall possession of all the world: whereas the world knows, that a
litle before <hi>Luthers</hi> arising, your Church was confined to a part of
a part of it. Lastly a Church vainly glorying in the dependance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7615:204"/>
Churches upon her, which yet she supports no more then those
crouching Anticks which seeme in great buildings to labour under
the weight they beare, doe indeed support the Fabrick. For a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and false Church may give authority to preach the truth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
against her own falshoods and corruptions. Besides, a false
Church may preserve the Scripture true, (as now the Old Testament
is preserved by the Iewes,) either not being arriv'd to that height of
impiety as to attempt the corruption of it, or not able to effect it, or
not perceiving, or not regarding the opposition of it to her corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And so we might receive from you lawfull Ordination and true
Scriptures, though you were a false Church; and receiving the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from you (though not from you alone,) I hope you cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us, neither need wee aske your leave, to believe and obey them.
And this, though you be a false Church, is enough to make us a true
one. As for a <hi>Succession of men that held with us in all points of Doctrine,</hi>
it is a thing we need not, and you have as litle as we. So that if we
acknowledge that your Church before <hi>Luther</hi> was a true Church, it
is not for any ends, for any dependance that we have upon you; but
because we conceive that in a charitable construction, you may passe
for a true Church. Such a Church (and no better) as you doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
acknowledge Protestants to be, that is, a Company of men,
wherein some ignorant soules may be saved. So that in this ballancing
of Religion against Religion, and Church against Church, it seemes
you have nothing of weight and moment to put into your scale; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but smoak and winde, vaine shadowes and phantasticall preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Yet if Protestants on the other side, had nothing to put in their
Scale but those negative commendations which you are pleas'd to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them; nothing but, no unity, nor meanes to procure it; no farther
extent when <hi>Luther</hi> arose then <hi>Luthers</hi> body; no Vniversality of time
or place; no visibility or being, except only in your Church; no Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of persons or doctrine; no leader but <hi>Luther,</hi> in a quarrell begun
upon no ground but passion; no Church, no Ordination, no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
but such as they receiv'd from you; if all this were true, and this
were all that could be pleaded for Protestants, possibly with an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of three graines of partiality your Scale might seem to turne.
But then if it may appear that part of these objections are falsely made
against them, the rest vainely; that whatsoever of truth is in these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
is impertinent to this triall, and whatsoever is pertinent
is untrue; and besides, that plenty of good matter may be alleaged for
Protestants which is here dissembled: Then I hope, our cause may be
good notwithstanding these pretences.</p>
               <p>55 I say then, that want of Vniversality of time &amp; place, The invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
or not existence of the professors of Protestant Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Luther, Luthers</hi> being alone when he first opposed your Church,
Our having our Church, Ordination, Scriptures, personall and yet not
doctrinall Succession from you, are vain and impertinent allegations,
against the truth of our Doctrine and Church. That the entire truth
of Christ without any mixture of error should be professed or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:7615:204"/>
in all places at any time, or in any place at all times, is not a thing
evident in reason, neither have we any Revelation for it. And therefore
in relying so confidently on it, you build your house upon the sand.
And what obligation we had either to be so peevish, as to take nothing
of yours, or so foolish as to take all, I doe not understand. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you say that <hi>this is to be choosers and therefore Heretiques,</hi> I tell you
that though all Heretiques are choosers, yet all choosers are not He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques,
otherwise they also, which choose your Religion must be
Heretiques. As for <hi>our wanting Vnity and Meanes of proving it,
Luthers opposing your Church upon meere passion, our following
private men rather then the Catholique Church;</hi> the first and last are
meere untruths, for we want not Vnity, nor Meanes to procure it in
things necessary. Plain places of Scripture, and such as need no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
are our meanes to obtaine it. Neither doe we follow any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men, but only the Scripture, the word of God as our rule, and
reason, which is also the gift of God given to direct us in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in the use of this rule. And then for <hi>Luthers opposing your Church
upon meere passion,</hi> it is a thing I will not deny because I know not his
heart, and for the same reason you should not have affirmed it. Sure I
am, whether he opposed your Church upon reason or no, he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
enough to oppose it. And therefore if he did it upon passion, we
will follow him only in his action and not in his passion, in his opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not in the manner of it; and then I presume you will have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to condemne us, unlesse you will say that a good action cannot be
done with reason, because some body before us hath done it upon pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
You see then how imprudent you have been in the choice of
your arguments, to prove Protestants unwise in the choice of their
Religion.</p>
               <p>56 It remaines now, that I should shew that many reasons of
moment may bee alleaged for the justification of Protestants,
which are dissembled by you, and not put into the ballance. Know
then Sir that when I say, The Religion of Protestants, is in prudence
to be preferr'd before yours: as on the one side I doe not understand by
your Religion, the doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> or any other
privat man amongst you, nor the Doctrine of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> or of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi>
or of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or of any other particular Company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, but that wherein you all agree, or professe to agree, <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Councell of Trent:</hi> so accordingly on the other side, by the
<hi>Religion of Protestants,</hi> I doe not understand the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi>
or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Melancthon;</hi> nor the Confession of <hi>Augusta,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi>
nor the Catechisme of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> nor the Articles of the Church of
England, no nor the <hi>Harmony</hi> of Protestant Confessions; but that
wherin they all agree, and which they all subscribe with a greater Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
as a perfect rule of their Faith and Actions, that is, The BIBLE.
The BIBLE, I say, The BIBLE only is the Religion of Protestants!
Whatsoever else they believe besides it, and the plain, irrefragable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable
consequences of it, well may they hold it as a matter of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but as matter of Faith and Religion, neither can they with cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7615:205"/>
to their own grounds believe it themselves, nor require the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of it of others, without most high and most Schismaticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
I for my part after a long (and as I verily believe &amp; hope,)
impartiall search of <hi>the true way to eternall happinesse,</hi> doe professe
plainly that I cannot find any rest for the sole of my foot, but upon
this Rock only. I see plainly and with mine own eyes, that there are
Popes against Popes, Councells against Councells, some Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
others, the same Fathers against themselves, a Consent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of one age against a Consent of Fathers of another age, the
Church of one age against the Church of another age. Traditive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of Scripture are pretended, but there are few or none to
be found: No Tradition but only of Scripture, can derive it selfe from
the fountain, but may be plainly prov'd, either to have been brought
in, in such an age after Christ; or that in such an age it was not in. In a
word, there is no sufficient certainty but of Scripture only, for any
considering man to build upon. This therefore, and this only I have
reason to believe: This I will professe, according to this I will live, and
for this, if there be occasion, I will not only willingly, but even glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loose my life, though I should be sorry that Christians should take
it from me. Propose me any thing out of this book, and require whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I believe it or no, and seeme it never so incomprehensible to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
reason, I will subscribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no
demonstration can be stronger then this, God hath said so, therefore
it is true. In other things I will take no mans liberty of judgement from
him; neither shall any man take mine from me. I will think no man
the worse man, nor the worse Christian: I will love no man the lesse,
for differing in opinion from me. And what measure I meat to others
I expect from them again. I am fully assured that God does not, and
therefore that men ought not to require any more of any man then
this, To believe the Scripture to be Gods word, to endeavour to find
the true sense of it, and to live according to it.</p>
               <p>57 This is the Religion which I have chosen after a long delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and I am verily perswaded that I have chosen wisely, much
more wisely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if I had guided my selfe according to your Churches
authority. For the Scripture being all true, I am secur'd by believing
nothing else, that I shall believe no falshood as matter of Faith. And
if I mistake the sense of Scripture, and so fall into error, yet am I se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from any danger thereby, if but your grounds be true: because
endeavouring to finde the true sense of Scripture, I cannot but hold
my error without pertinacy, and be ready to forsake it when a more
true and a more probable sense shall appear unto mee. And then all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
truth being as I have prov'd, plainly set down in Scripture, I
am certain by believing Scripture, to believe all necessary Truth: And
he that does so, if his life be answerable to his faith, how is it possible
he should faile of Salvation?</p>
               <p>58 Besides, whatsoever may be pretended to gain to your Church
the credit of a Guide, all that &amp; much more may be said for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Hath your Church been ancient? The Scripture is more ancient.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7615:205"/>
Is your Church a meanes to keep men at vnity? So is the Scripture
to keep those that believe it and wil obey it, in unity of belief, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
necessary or very profitable, and in unity of Charity in points un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary.
Is your Church universall for time or place? Certainly the
Scripture is more universall. For all the Christians in the world (those
I mean that in truth deserve this name,) doe now, and alwaies have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Scripture to be the word of God: whereas only you say that
you only are the Church of God, &amp; all Christians besides you deny it.</p>
               <p>59 Thirdly, following the Scripture, I follow that whereby you
prove your Churches infallibility, (whereof were it not for Scripture
what pretence could you have, or what notion could we have?) and
by so doing tacitely confesse, that your selves are surer of the truth of
the Scripture then of your Churches authority. For we must be surer
of the proofe then of the thing proved, otherwise it is no proofe.</p>
               <p>60 Fourthly, following the Scripture, I follow that which must
be true if your Church be true: for your Church gives attestation to
it. Whereas if I follow your Church, I must follow that which, though
Scripture be true, may be false; nay which if Scripture be true must
be false, because the Scripture testifies against it.</p>
               <p>61 Fiftly, to follow the Scripture I have Gods expresse warrant
and command, and no colour of any prohibition: But to believe your
Church infallible, I have no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand at all, much lesse an expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Nay I have reason to fear that I am prohibited to doe so in these
words: <hi>call no man Master on earth: They fell by infidelity, Thou standest by
faith, Bee not high minded but feare: The spirit of truth The world
cannot receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>62 Following your Church I must hold many things not only
above reason but against it, if any thing be against it: whereas follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture I shall believe many mysteries but no impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
many things above reason, but nothing against it; many things
which had they not been reveal'd, reason could never have discover'd,
but nothing which by true reason may be confuted: many things which
reason cannot comprehend how they can be, but nothing which reason
can comprehend that it cannot be. Nay I shall believe nothing which
reason will not convince that I ought to believe it: For reason will
convince any man, unlesse he be of a perverse mind, that the Scripture
is the word of God: And then no reason can be greater then this, God
sayes so therefore it is true.</p>
               <p>63 Following your Church I must hold many things which to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mans judgment that will give himself the liberty of judgment, will
seem much more plainly contradicted by Scripture, then the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of your Church appeares to be confirm'd by it; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
must be so foolish as to believe your Church exempted from
error upon lesse evidence, rather then subject to the common conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mankind upon greater evidence. Now if I take the Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for my Guide, I shall not need to doe any thing so unreasonable.</p>
               <p>64 If I will follow your Church I must believe impossibilities,
and that with an absolute certainty, upon motives which are confess'd
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7615:206"/>
to be but only <hi>Prudentiall</hi> and probable: That is, with a weak founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I must firmly support a heavy, a monstrous heavy building: Now
following the Scripture I shall have no necessity to undergoe any such
difficulties.</p>
               <p>65 Following your Church I must be servant of Christ and a
Subject of the King, but only-<hi>Ad placitum Papae.</hi> I must bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
in mind to renounce my allegiance to the King, when the Pope
shall declare him an Heretique and command me not to obey him:
And I must be prepar'd in mind <hi>to esteem Vertue Vice, and Vice Vertue
if the Pope shall so determine.</hi> Indeed you say it is impossible he should
doe the latter; but that you know is a great question, neither is it fit my
obedience to God and the King should depend upon a questionable
foundation. And howsoever, you must grant that if by an impossible
supposition the Popes commands should be contrary to the law of
Christ, that they of your Religion must resolve to obey rather the
commands of the Pope then the law of Christ. Whereas if I follow
the Scripture, I may, nay I must obey my Soveraign in lawfull things,
though an Heretique, though a Tyrant, and though, I doe not say the
Pope, but the Apostles themselves, nay <hi>an Angell from heaven should
teach any thing against the Gospell of Christ, I may, nay I must denounce
Anathem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>66 Following the Scripture I shall believe a Religion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to flesh and blood, without any assistance from worldly
power, wit or policy; nay against all the power and policy of the world
prevail'd and enlarg'd it self in a very short time all the world over.
Whereas it is too too apparent, that your Church hath got and still
maintaines her authority over mens consciences, by counterfeiting
false miracles, forging falle stories, by obtruding on the world suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitious
writings, by corrupting the monuments of former times, and
defacing out of them all which any way makes against you, by
warres, by persecutions, by Massacres, by Treasons, by Rebellions;
in short, by all manner of carnall meanes whether violent or fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>67 Following the Scripture I shall believe a Religion, the first
Preachers and Professors whereof, it is most certain they could have
no worldly ends upon the world, that they could not project to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by it any of the profits or honours or pleasures of this world,
but rather were to expect the contrary, even all the miseries which the
world could lay upon them. On the other side, the Head of your
Church, the pretended Successor of the Apostles, and Guide of faith,
it is even palpable, that he makes your Religion the instrument of his
ambition, &amp; by it seekes to entitle himselfe <hi>directly or indirectly to the
Monarchy of the world.</hi> And besides, it is evident to any man that has
but halfe an eye, that most of those Doctrines which you adde to the
Scripture doe make one way or other, for the honour or temporall
profit of the Teachers of them.</p>
               <p>68 Following the Scripture only, I shall embrace a Religion of
admirable simplicity, consisting in a manner wholly in the worship of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7615:206"/>
God in spirit and truth. Whereas your Church and Doctrine is even
loaded with an infinity of weak, childish, ridiculous, unsavoury super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
and ceremonies, and full of that righteousnesse for which
Christ shall judge the world.</p>
               <p>69 Following the Scripture, I shall believe that which Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
never-failing Tradition assures me, that it was by the admirable
supernaturall worke of God confirm'd to be the word of God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
never, any miracle was wrought, never so much as a lame horse
cur'd in confirmation of your Churches authority and infallibility.
And if any strange things have been done, which may seeme to give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
to some parts of your doctrine, yet this proves nothing but
the truth of the Scripture, which foretold that (Gods providence
permitting it, and the wickednesse of the world deserving it) <hi>strange
signes and wonders should be wrought to confirme false doctrine, that they
which love not the truth, may be given over to strange delusions.</hi> Neither
does it seeme to me any strange thing, that God should permit some
true wonders to be done to delude them who have forged so many
to deceive the world.</p>
               <p>70 If I follow the Scripture, I must not promise my selfe Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without effectuall dereliction and mortification of all vices, and
the effectuall practice of all Christian vertues: But your Church o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
an easier and a broader way to Heaven, and though I continue all
my life long in a course of sinne, and without the practice of any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
yet gives me assurance that I may be let in to heaven at a posterne
gate, even by any act of Attrition at the houre of death, if it be joyn'd
with confession, or by an act of Contrition without confession.</p>
               <p>71 Admirable are the Precepts of piety and humility, of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and patience, of liberality, frugality, temperance, sobriety, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
meeknesse, fortitude, constancy and gravity, contempt of the
world, love of God and the love of man kind; In a word, of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and against all vice, which the Scriptures impose upon us, to be
obeyed under pain of damnation: The summe whereof is in manner
compriz'd in our <hi>Saviours Sermon upon the Mount,</hi> recorded in the 5. 6.
and 7. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which if they were generally obeyed, could
not but make the world generally happy, and the goodnesse of them
alone were sufficient to make any wise and good man believe that
this Religion rather then any other, came from God the Fountain of
all goodnesse. And that they may be generally obeyed, our Saviour
hath ratified them all in the close of his Sermon, with these universall
Sanctions, <hi>Not every one that sayeth Lord Lord, shall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doth them not, shall be
likned unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand, and the
ruine descended, and the stood came, and the winds blew, and it fell, and
great was the fall thereof.</hi> Now your Church, notwithstanding all this,
enervates and in a manner dissolves and abrogates many of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
teaching men that they are not lawes for all Christians, but
Counsells of perfection and matters of Supererrogation: that a man
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7615:207"/>
shall doe well if he doe observe them, but he shall not sinne if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them not; That they are for them who ayme at high places in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
who aspire with the two sonnes of <hi>Zebede,</hi> to the right hand or
to the left hand of Christ: But if a man will be content barely to goe
to heaven, and to be a doore keeper in the house of God, especially if
he will be content to tast of Purgatory in the way, he may obtaine it
at any easier purchase. Therefore the Religion of your Church is not
so holy nor so good as the doctrine of Christ delivered in Scripture,
and therefore not so likely to come from the Fountaine of holinesse &amp;
goodnesse.</p>
               <p>72 Lastly, if I follow your Church for my Guide, I shall doe all
one, as if I should follow a Company of blind men in a judgement of
colours, or in the choice of a way. For every unconsidering man is
blind in that which he does not consider. Now what is your Church
but a Company of unconsidering men, who comfort themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are a great company together, but all of them, either out of
idlenesse refuse the trouble of a severe tryall of their Religion, (as if
heaven were not worth it,) or out of superstition fear the event of such
a tryall, that they may be scrupled and staggered and disquieted by it;
and therefore, for the most part doe it not at all. Or if they doe it, they
doe it negligently and hypocritically, and perfunctorily, rather for
the satisfaction of others then themselves: but certainly without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
without liberty of judgement, without a resolution to
doubt of it, if upon examination the grounds of it prove uncertain, or
to leave it, if they prove apparently false. My own experience assures
me, that in this imputation I doe you no injury: but it is very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to all men from your ranking, <hi>doubting of any part of your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
among mortall sinnes. For from hence it followes, that seeing
every man must resolve that he will never commit mortall sinne, that
he must never examine the grounds of it at all, for fear he should be
mov'd to doubt: or if he doe, he must resolve that no motives, be they
never so strong shall move him to doubt, but that with his will and
resolution he will uphold himselfe in a firme belief of your Religon,
though his reason and his understanding faile him. And seeing this
is the condition of all those whom you esteem good Catholiques,
who can deny, but you are a Company of men unwilling and afraid to
understand, least you should doe good! That have eyes to see and will
not see, that have <hi>have not the love of truth</hi> (which is only to be known
by an indifferent tryall,) &amp; therefore deserve <hi>to be given over to strong
delusions;</hi> men that love darknesse more then light: in a word, that you
are <hi>the blind leading the blind,</hi> and what prudence there can be, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
such Guides, our Saviour hath taught us in saying, <hi>If the blind
lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>73 There remaines unspoken to in this Section, some places out
of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and some sayings of <hi>Luther,</hi> wherein he confesses that in
the Papacy are many good things. But the former I have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
and return'd the argument grounded on them. As for
<hi>Luthers</hi> speeches, I told you, not long since, that we follow no privat
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7615:207"/>
men, and regard not much what he saies either against the Church of
Rome, or for it, but what he proves. He was a man of a vehement Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and very often what he took in hand, he did not doe it but over
doe it. He that will justify all his speeches, especially such as he wrote
in heat of opposition, I believe will have work enough. Yet in these
sentences, though he overreach in the particulars, yet what he saies in
generall we confesse true, and confesse with him <hi>that in the Papacy are
many good things,</hi> which have come from them to us, but withall we
say there are many bad, neither doe wee think our selves bound in
prudence either to reject the good with the bad, or to retain the bad
with the good, but rather conceive it a high point of wisdome, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
between the <hi>pretious and the vile, to sever the good from the bad,
and to put the good in vessels to be kept, and to cast the bad away; to try all
things, and to hold that which is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>74 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 32. Your next and last argument against the faith of
Protestants is, because <hi>wanting Certainty and Prudence, it must also
want the fourth condition, Supernaturality. For that being a humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
it is not in the essence of it supernaturall: and being imprudent
and rash, it cannot proceed from Divine motion, and so is not supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
in respect of the cause from which it proceedeth.</hi> Ans. This litle
discourse stands wholly upon what went before, and therefore must
fall together with it. I have proved the Faith of Protestants as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and as prudent as the faith of Papists; and therefore if these be
certain grounds of supernaturality, our faith may have it as well as
yours. I would here furthermore be inform'd how you can assure us
that your faith is not your perswasion or opinion (for you make them
all one,) that your Churches doctrine is true? Or if you grant it your
perswasion, why is it not the perswasion of men, and in respect of the
subject of it, an humane perswasion? I desire also to know, what sense
there is in pretending that your perswasion is, not in regard of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
only and cause of it, but in nature or essence of it supernaturall?
Lastly, whereas you say, that <hi>being imprudent it cannot come from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
motion:</hi> certainly by this reason all they that believe your own
Religion, and cannot give a wise and sufficient reason for it, (as millions
amongst you cannot) must be condemn'd to have no supernaturall
faith: or if not, then without question nothing can hinder, but that the
imprudent faith of Protestants may proceed from divine motion, as
well as the imprudent faith of Papists.</p>
               <p>75 And thus having weighed your whole discourse, and found it
altogether lighter then vanity, why should I not invert your conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and say, Seeing you have not proved that whosoever erres against
any one point of Faith looseth all divine Faith: nor that any error
whatsoever concerning that which by the Parties litigant may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
a matter of faith is a grievous sinne, it followes not at all, that
when two men hold different doctrines concerning Religion, that but
one can be saved? Not that I deny, but that the sentence of S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi>
with which you conclude this Chapt. may in a good sense be true: for
oftimes by <hi>the faith</hi> is meant only that Doctrine which is <hi>necessary to</hi>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:7615:208"/>
salvation, and to say that salvation may be had without any the least
thing which is necessary to salvation, implyes a repugnance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies
it selfe. Besides, not to believe all necessary points, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
none at all, is for the purpose of salvation all one; and therefore
he that does so, may justly be said to destroy the Gospell of Christ,
seeing he makes it uneffectuall to the end for which it was intended,
the Salvation of mens soules. But why you should conceive that
all differences about Religon, are concerning matters of
faith, in this high notion of the word, for that
I conceive no reason.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT, due <hi>Order</hi> is to be observed in the Theologicall Vertue of <hi>Charity,</hi>
whereby we are directed to preferre some Objects before others, is a truth
taught by all Divines, and declared in these words of holy Scripture: <hi>He hath
ordered</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Cant. 2, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Charity in me.</hi> The reason whereof is: because the infinite
Goodnesse of God, which is the <hi>formall Obiect,</hi> or Motive of <hi>Charity,</hi> and for
which all other things are loved, is differently participated by different Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and therefore the love we beare to them for Gods sake, must according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be unequall. In the vertue of <hi>Faith,</hi> the case is farre otherwise; because all the Objects, or points
which we believe, doe equally participate the divine Testimony or Revelation, for which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
alike all things propounded for such. For it is as impossible for God, to speake an untruth
in a small, as in a great matter. And this is the ground for which we have so often affirmed, that
any least errour against <hi>Faith,</hi> is injurious to God, and destructive of Salvation.</p>
               <p>2 This order in Charity may be considered; Towards God; Our owne soule; The soule of
our Neighbour; Our owne life, or Goods; and the life or goods of our Neighbour. God is to be
beloved above all things, both <hi>objectivè</hi> (as the Divines speake) that is, we must wish or desire
to God, a Good more great, perfect, and noble then to any; or all other things: namely, all that
indeed He is, a Nature Infinite, Independent, Immense &amp;c. and also <hi>appretiative,</hi> that is, wee
must sooner loose what good soever, then leave, and abandon Him. In the other Objects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
of which I spake, this order is to be kept. We may, but are not bound, to preferre the life
and goods of our Neigbour before our owne: we are bound to pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erre the soule of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
before our own temporall goods or life, if he happen to be in extreme spirituall necessity,
and that we by our assistance can succour him, according to the saying of S. <hi>Iohn: In this we have
knowne</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1. Ioan. 3. v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the Charity of God, because he hath yielded his life for us: and we ought to yield our
life for our Brethren.</hi> And <hi>S. Augustine</hi> likewise saith: <hi>A Christian will not doubt</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">De mendac. cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>to loose his
owne temporall life, for the eternall life of his Neighbour.</hi> Lastly we are to preferre the <hi>spirituall</hi>
good of our own soule, before both the spirituall and temporall good of our Neighbour, because
as Charity doth of its own Nature, chiefly encline the person in whom it resides, to love God,
and to be united with him: so of it selfe it enclines him to procure those things whereby the said
Vnion with God is effected, rather to himselfe then to others. And from hence it followes, that
in things necessary to salvation, no man ought in any case, or in any respect whatsoever, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the spirituall good, either of any particular person, or of the whole world before his own
soule; according to those words of our Blessed Saviour: <hi>What doth it;</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 6</note> 
                  <hi>availe a man, if he gaine
the whole world, and sustaine the damage of his own soule?</hi> And therefore (to come to our present
purpose) it is directly against the <hi>Order</hi> of Charity, or against Charity as it hath a reference to our
selves, which Divines call <hi>Charitas propria,</hi> to adventure either the <hi>omitting</hi> of any meanes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation, or the committing of any thing repugnant to it, for whatsoever respect, and
consequently, if by living out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church we put our selves in hazard, either to want
some thing necessarily required to salvation, or else to performe some act against it, wee commit a
most grievous sinne against the vertue <hi>of Charity,</hi> as it respect our selves, and so cannot hope for
salvation without repentance.</p>
               <p>3 Now, of things necessary to salvation, there are two sorts, according to the doctrine of all
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7615:208"/>
Divines. Some things (say they) are necessary to salvation, <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> necessary only
because they are commanded; For, <hi>If thou wilt</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 10. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>enter into life, keepe the Commandements.</hi> In
which kind of things, as probable ignorance of the Law, or of the commandement doth excuse the
party from all faulty breach thereof; so likewise doth it not exclude salvation in case of ignorance.
Some other things are said to be necessary to salvation <hi>necessitate medij, finis,</hi> or <hi>salutis;</hi> because
they are Meanes appointed by God to attaine our <hi>End</hi> of eternall <hi>salvation,</hi> in so strict a manner,
that it were <hi>presumption</hi> to <hi>hope</hi> for Salvation without them. And as the former meanes are said
to be <hi>necessary,</hi> because they are <hi>commanded,</hi> so the latter are commonly said to be <hi>commanded:</hi>
because they are <hi>necessary,</hi> that is: Although there were no other speciall precept concerning them;
yet supposing they bee once appointed as meanes absolutely necessary to salvation, there cannot
but arise an obligation of procuring to have them, in vertue of that universall precept of Charity,
which obligeth every man to procure the salvation of his own soule. In this sort <hi>divine infallible
Faith</hi> is necessary to salvation; as likewise repentance of every deadly sinne, and in the doctrine
of Catholiques, Baptisme <hi>in re,</hi> that is, <hi>in act,</hi> to Children, and for those who are come to the
use of reason, <hi>in voto,</hi> or <hi>harty desire,</hi> when they cannot have it in act. And as Baptisme is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for remission of <hi>Originall</hi> and <hi>Actuall</hi> sinne committed before it: so the Sacrament of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
or Pennance is necessary <hi>in re,</hi> or <hi>in voto,</hi> in <hi>act,</hi> or <hi>desire,</hi> for the remission of mortall
sinnes, committed after Baptisme. The Minister of which Sacrament of Pennance being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
a true Priest, true Ordination is necessary in the Church of God for remission of sinnes by
this sacrament, as also for other ends not belonging to our present purpose. From hence it riseth,
that no ignorance or impossibility can supply the want of those means which are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation. As if, for example, a sinner depart this world without repenting himselfe of
all deadly sinnes, although he dye suddenly, or unexpectedly fall out of his wits, and so commit
no new sinne by omission of repentance; yet he shall be eternally punished for his former sinnes
committed, and never repented. If an Infant dye without Baptisme, he cannot be saved, not by
reason of any actuall sinne committed by him in omitting Baptisme, but for Originall sinne, not
forgiven by the meanes which God hath ordained to that purpose. Which doctrine, all, or must
Protestants will (for ought I know) grant to be trve, in the Children of Infidels, yea not only
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> but also some other Protestants, as M. <hi>Bilson</hi> late of <hi>Winchester</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">In his true difference <hi>&amp;c. Part. 4. pag. 168. &amp;</hi> 369.</note> &amp; others hold it to be
true, even in the Children of the faithfull. And if Protestants in generall disagree fom Catholiques
in this point, it cannot be denyed but that our disagreement is in a point very <hi>fundamentall.</hi> And
the like I say of the Sacrament of Pennance, which they deny to be necessary to salvation, either in
act, or in desire; which error is likewise fundamentall, because it concernes (as I said) a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation: And for the same reason, if their Priesthood and Ordination be doubtfull, as
certainly it is, they are in danger to want a meanes without which they cannot be saved. Neither
ought this rigour to seeme strange, or unjust: For Almighty God having of his own <hi>Goodnesse,</hi>
without our <hi>merit,</hi> first ordained Man to a <hi>supernaturall</hi> end of eternall felicity; and then; after
our fall in <hi>Adam</hi> vouchsafed to reduce us to the attaining of that End, if his blessed <hi>Will</hi> be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to limit the attaining of that End, to some meanes which in his infinite Wisdome he thinks
most fit; who can say, why dost thou so? Or who can <hi>hope</hi> for that <hi>End,</hi> without such <hi>meanes?</hi>
Blessed be his divine Majesty, for vouchsafing to ordaine us, base creatures, to so sublime an End,
by any <hi>meanes</hi> at all!</p>
               <p>4 Out of the foresaid difference followeth another, that (generally speaking) in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
only, because they are commanded, it is sufficient for avoiding sinne, that we proceed pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and by the conduct of some probable opinion, maturely weighed and approved by men of
vertue, learning and wisdome, Neither are we alwaies obliged to follow the most strict, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
or secure part, as long as the doctrine which wee embrace, proceeds upon such reasons, as
may warrant it to be truly probable, and prudent, though the contrary part want not also probable
grounds. For in humane affaires, and discourse, evidence and certainty cannot be alwaies expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But when wee treat not precisely of avoiding sinne, but moreover of procuring some thing
without which I cannot bee saved; I am obliged by the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> to procure as
great certainty as morrally I am able; and am not to follow euery probable opinion or dictamen,
but <hi>tutiorem partem, the safer part,</hi> because if my <hi>probability</hi> prove false, I shall not <hi>probably,</hi> but
<hi>certainly</hi> come short of Salvation. Nay in such case, I shall incurre a new sinne against the <hi>Vertue</hi>
of <hi>Charity</hi> towards my <hi>selfe,</hi> which obligeth every one not to expose his soule to the hazard of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
perdition, when it is in his power, with the assistance of Gods grace, to make the matter
sure. From this very ground it is, that although some Divines be of opinion, that it is not a sinne
to use some <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter,</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of Sacraments, only probable, if we respect precisely the reverence
or respect which is due to Sacraments, as they belong to the <hi>Morall i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fused</hi> Vertue of <hi>Religion;</hi>
yet when they are such Sacraments, as the invalidity thereof may endanger the salvation of soules,
all doe with one consent agree, that it is a grievous offence to use a doubtfull, or onely probable
<hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Forme,</hi> when it is in our power to procure certainty. If therefore it may appeare, that
though it were not certaine that Protestancy unrepented destroyes Salvation (as we have proved to
be very certaine) yet at least that is <hi>probable,</hi> and with all, that there is a way more safe; it will
follow out of the grounds already said, that they are obliged by the law of Charity to imb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace
that safe way.</p>
               <p>5 Now, that Protestants have reason at least to doubt in what case they stand, is deduced
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7615:209"/>
from what we have said, and proved about the universall infallibility of the Church, and of her
being Iudge of Controversies, to whom all Christians ought to submit their Iudgement (as even
some Protestants g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant,) and whom to oppose in any one of her definitions; is a grievous sinne:
As also from what we have said of the <hi>Vnity, Vniversality,</hi> and <hi>Visibility</hi> of the Church, and of
Succession of Persons, and Doctrine; Of the Conditions of Divine Faith, <hi>Certainty, Obscurity,
Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Supernaturality,</hi> which are wanting in the faith of Protestants; Of the frivolous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of points fundamentall &amp; not fundamentall, (the confutation whereof proveth that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques</hi>
disagreeing among themselves in any least point, cannot have the same faith, nor be of the
same Church:) Of Schisme; of Heresy; of the Persons who first revolted from <hi>Rome,</hi> and of their
Motives; of the Nature of Faith, which is destroyed by any least errour, &amp; it is Certaine that some
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must be in error &amp; want the substance of true faith; &amp; since all pretend the like certainty, it is
cleer that none of them have any certainty at all, but that they want true faith, which is a meanes
<hi>most absolutely necessary</hi> to Salvation. Moreover, as I said heretofore, since it is granted that every
Error in fundamentall points is damnable, and that they cannot tell in particular, what points be
fundamentall; it followes that none of them knowes whether he, or his Brethren doe not erre
damnably, it being certain that amongst so many disagreeing persons some must erre. Vpon the
same ground of not being able to assigne what points be fundamentall, I say, they cannot be sure
whether the difference among them be fundamentall or no, and consequently whether they agree
in the substance of faith and hope of Salvation. I omit to adde that you want the Sacrament of
Pennance, instituted for remission of sinnes, or at least you must confesse that you hold it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
and yet your own Brethren, for example, the <hi>Century Writers</hi> doe<note n="g" place="margin">Cent. 3. cap. 6. Col. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>7.</note> acknowledg that
in times of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian, Private Confession</hi> even of <hi>Thoughts was used;</hi> and that, it
was then <hi>commanded, and thought necessary.</hi> The like, I say, concerning your Ordination, which
at least is very doubtfull, and consequently all that depends thereon.</p>
               <p>6 On the other side, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the the safer way to <hi>Heaven</hi> (not to repeat
what hath been already said upon divers occasions) I will again put you in mind, that unlesse the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church was the true Church there was no visible true Church upon earth. A thing so
manifest, that Protestants themselves confesse that more then one thousand years the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church possessed the whole world, as we have shewed heretofore, out of their own<note n="h" place="margin">Chap. 5. Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 9.</note> words:
from whence it follows, that unlesse Ours be the true Church, you cannot pretend to any perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
visible Church of your Own; but Ours doth not depend on yours, before which it was. And
here I wish you to consider with feate and trembling, how all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, not one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
that is, those very men whom you must hold not to erre damnably in their belief, unlesse
you will destroy your own Church, and salvation, doe with unanimous consent believe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that Protestancy unrepented destroyes Salvation; and then tell me, as you will answer at the
last day, Whether it be not more safe, to live and die in that Church, which even your selves are
forced to acknowledge <hi>not to be cut off from hope of Salvation,</hi> (which are your own words) then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>live in a Church, which the said confessedly true Church doth firmly believe, and constantly
professe not to be capable of Salvation. And therefore I conclude that by the most strict obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Charity</hi> towards your own soule, you are bound to place it in safety, by returning to that
Church, from which your Progenitors Schismatically departed; least too late you find that saying
of the holy Ghost verified in your selves: <hi>He that loves</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Eccl. 3. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>the danger, shall perish therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7 Against this last argument of the greater security of the Roman Church drawn from your
own confession, you bring an Objection; which in the end will be found to make for us, against
your selfe. It is taken from the words of the Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tists, speaking to Catholiques in this manner:
<hi>Your selves confesse</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Pag. 112.</note> 
                  <hi>our Baptisme, Sacraments, and Faith</hi> (here you put an Explication or
your own, and say, <hi>for the most part,</hi> as if any small error in faith did not destroy all Faith) <hi>to be
good, and available. We deny yours to be so, and say there is no Church, no salvation amongst you;
Therefore it is safest for all to joyn with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8 By your leave our Argument is not (as you say) for simple people alone, but for all them
who have care to save their soules. Neither is it grounded upon your <hi>Charitable Iudgement</hi> (as
you<note n="l" place="margin">Pag. 81.</note> speak) but upon an inevitable necessity for you, either to grant salvation to our Church,
or to entaile certaine damnation upon your owne: because yours can have no being till <hi>Luther,</hi>
unlesse ours be supposed to have been the true Church of Christ. And since you term this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a charme, take heed you be none of those, who according to the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> doe not

                  <hi>who charmeth wisely.</hi> But to come to the purpose: Catholiques never
granted that the Donatists had a true Church, or might be saved: And therefore you having cited
out of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> the words of the Catholiques, that the Donatists had true <hi>Baptisme,</hi> when
you come to the contrary words of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> you adde, <hi>No Church, No Salvation;</hi> making
the Argument to have <hi>quin<expan>

                     </expan> terminos;</hi> without which Addition you did see it made nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us: For, as I said, the Catholiques never yielded, that among the Donatists there was a
true Church, or hope of salvation. And your selfe, a few leaves after, acknowledge that the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
<hi>maintained an error,</hi> which <hi>was in the Matter and Nature of it properly haereticall, against that
Article of the Creed, wherein we professe to believe the holy</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 126.</note> 
                  <hi>Catholique Church:</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
you cannot allow salvation to them, as you doe, and must doe to us. And therefore the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
could not make the like argument against Catholiques, as Catholiques make against you,
who grant us Salvation, which we deny to you. But at least (you will say) this Argument for the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7615:209"/>
Certainty of their Baptisme, was like to Ours touching the Security and Certainty of our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore that Catholiques should have esteemed the Baptisme of the Donatists more
certain then their own, and so have allowed Rebaptization of such as were baptized by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
or sinners, as the Donatists esteemed all Catholiques to be. I answer, no. Because it being
a matter of faith, that Baptisme administred by Heretiques, observing due Matter, form &amp;c. is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide;
to rebaptize any so baptized, had been both a sacriledg in reiterating a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not reiterable,
and a profession also of a damnable Heresy, and therefore had not been more <hi>safe,</hi> but certainly
<hi>damnable.</hi> But you confesse that in the doctrine or practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, there is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
or profession of any damnable error, which if there were, even your Church should certainly
be no Church. To believe therefore and professe as we doe, cannot exclude Salvation, as Rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
must have done. But if the <hi>Donatists</hi> could have affirmed with truth, that in the opinion
both of Catholiques and themselves, their Baptisme was good, yea and good in such sort as that
unlesse theirs was good, that of the Catholiques could not be such; but theirs might be good,
though that of the Catholiques were not: and further that it was no damnable error to believe,
that Baptisme administred by the Catholiques was not good, nor that it was any Sacriledg to rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
the same Baptisme of Catholiques: If, I say, they could have truly affirmed these things,
they had said somewhat, which at least had seemed to the purpose. But these things they could not
say with any colour of truth, and therefore their argument was fond, and impious. But we with
truth say to Protestants: You cannot but confesse that our doctrine containes no damnable error;
and that our Church is so certainly a true Church, that unlesse ours be true you cannot pretend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
Yea you grant, that you should be guilty of Schisme, if you did cut off our Church from the
Body of Christ, and the hope of salvation: But we neither doe, nor can grant that yours is a true
Church, or that within it there is hope of salvation: <hi>Therefore it is safest</hi> for you <hi>to joyn with us,</hi>
And now against whom hath your Objection greatest force?</p>
               <p>9 But I wonder not a little, and so I think will ever body else, what the reason may be, that
you doe not so much as goe about to answer the argument of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> which you say is all
one with Ours, but referre us to <hi>S. Augustine</hi> there to read it; as if every one carried with him a
Library, or were able to examine the places in <hi>S. Augustine:</hi> and yet you might be sure your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
would be greedy to see some solid answer to an argument so often urged by us, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
unless you can confute it, ought alone to move every one who hath care of his soule, to take
the safest way, by incorporating himself in our Church. But we may easily imagine the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of your silence: For the answer which <hi>S. Augustine</hi> gives to the <hi>Donatists,</hi> is directly against
your self, and the same which I have given. Namely, that Catholiques<note n="o" place="margin">Ad lit. Petil. l. 2. cap. 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Donatists, but abhorre their heresy of Rebaptization. And that as gold is good (which is the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude

                  <hi>S. Augustine</hi>) yet not to be sought in company of theeves; so though Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
be good, yet it must not be sought for in the Conventicle of <hi>Donatists.</hi> But you free us from
damnable heresy, and yield us salvation, which I hope is to be imbraced in whatsoever Company
it is found; or rather that Company is to be imbraced before all other, in which all sides agree,
that salvation may be found. We therefore must inferre, that it is safest for you to seeke salvation
among us. You had good reason to conceal <hi>S. Augustins</hi> answer to the <hi>Donatists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10 <hi>You frame another argument in our behalf, and make us speake thus: If Protestants</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

<hi>which wise argument of your own, you answer at large, and confirm your answer by this instance:</hi>
The Iesuits and Dominicans hold different Opinions touching Predetermination, and the Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Conception of the Blessed Virgin: Yet so, that the Iesuits hold the Dominicans way safe, that is,
his error not damnable, and the Dominicans hold the same of the Iesuits; Yet neither of them with
good Consequence can presse the other to believe his opinion, because by his own Confession it is no
damnable error.</p>
               <p>11 But what Catholique maketh such a wise demaund as you put into our mouths? If our
Religion be a safe way to heaven, that is, not damnable; why doe you not follow it? As if every
thing that is good, must be of necessity imbraced by every body. But what think you of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
framed thus? Our Religion is safe even by your Confession, therefore you ought to grant
that all <hi>may</hi> imbrace it. And yet further, thus: Among different Religions and <hi>contrary</hi> waies to
heaven, one only can be safe: But ours, by your own Confession, is safe, whereas we hold that in
yours there is no hope of salvation: Therefore you <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to imbrace ours. This is our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
And if the Dominicans and Iesuits did say one to another as we say to you; then one of
them might with good consequence press <hi>the other to believe his opinion.</hi> You have still the hard
for tune to be beaten with your own weapon.</p>
               <p>12 It remaineth then, that both in regard of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> Protestants are obliged to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
themselves with the Church of Rome. And I may adde also, in regard of the <hi>Theologicall</hi> V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Certainty,</hi> or excessive in <hi>Evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce;</hi> as likewise according to the rigid Calvinists, it is either so strong,
that once had, it can never be lost; or so more then weak, and so much nothing; that it can never be
gotten. For the trve Theologicall <hi>Hope</hi> of Christians, is a <hi>Hope</hi> which keeps a mean between <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi>
and <hi>Desperation;</hi> which moves us to work our salvation with feare, and trembling; which
conducts us to make sure our salvation by good works, as holy Scripture adviseth. But contrarily,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7615:210"/>
Protestants doe either exclude <hi>Hope</hi> by <hi>Despaire,</hi> with the Doctrine that our Saviour died not for
all, and that such want grace sufficient to salvation; or else by vaine <hi>Presumption</hi> grounded upon
a fantasticall persuasion, that they are Predestinate; which Faith must exclude all feare, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
Neither can they make their Calling <hi>certain by good works,</hi> who doe certainly beleeve
that before any good works they are justified, and justified even by Faith alone, and that by Faith
whereby they certainly believe that they are justified. Which points some Protestants doe expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirme to be <hi>the soule of the Church, the principall Origen of salvation, Of all other points of
Doctrine the chiefest and weightiest;</hi> as already I have noted <hi>Chap. 3. n.</hi> 19. And if some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
doe now relent from the rigour of the aforesaid doctrine, we must affirme, that at least
some of them want the Theologicall Vertue of <hi>Hope;</hi> yea that none of them can have trve <hi>Hope,</hi>
while they hope to be saved in the Communion of those, who defend such doctrines, as doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
overthrow all true Christian <hi>Hope.</hi> And for as much as concernes <hi>Faith,</hi> we must also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that they want <hi>Vnity</hi> therein (and consequently have none at all) by their disagreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>the soule of the Church, the principall Origen of salvation, of all other points of Doctrine the
chiefest and weightiest.</hi> And if you want trve <hi>Faith,</hi> you must by consequence want <hi>Hope,</hi> or if
you hold that this <hi>point</hi> is not to be so indivisible on either side, but that it hath latitude sufficient
to imbrace all parties, without prejudice to their salvation; notwithstanding that your Brethren
hold it to be <hi>the soule of the Church &amp;c.</hi> I must repeat what I have said heretofore, that, even by
this Example, it is cleer, you cannot agree what points be <hi>fundamentall.</hi> And so (to whatsoever
answer you fly) I presse you in the same manner, and say, that haue no Certainty whether you
agree in fundamentall points, or Vnity and substance of Faith, which cannot stand with difference
in fundamentalls. And so upon the whole matter, I leave it to be considered, whether, <hi>Want of
Charity can be iustly charged</hi> on us, because we affirme, that they cannot (without repentance)
be saved, who want of all other the most necessary meanes to salvation, which are, the three <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall</hi>
Vertues, FAITH, HOPE, <hi>and</hi> CHARITY.</p>
               <p>13 And now I end this <hi>first part,</hi> having as I conceive, complyed with my first designe, (in
that measure, which Time, Commodity, scarcity of Books, and my own small Abilities could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford)
which was to shew, that <hi>Amongst men of different Religions, one side only can be saved.</hi>
For since there must be some <hi>infallible Meanes</hi> to decide all Controversies concerning Religion,
and to propound truth revealed by Almighty God; and this <hi>Meanes</hi> can be no other, but the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church of Christ,</hi> which at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> appearance was only the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
and such as agreed with her: We must conclude, that whosoever opposeth himself to her defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or forsaketh her Communion, doth resist God himself, whose Spouse she is, and whose
divine truth she propounds; and therefore becoms guilty of <hi>Schisme,</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi>
which since <hi>Luther,</hi> his Associates, and Protestants have done, and still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to doe; it is not <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> but abundance of evident cause

and charity to himselfe, is to take the safest way to

               <p>2 The <hi>fift and sixt</hi> are nothing in a manner,

               </p>
               <p>4 In the <hi>twelfth</hi> there is something that has some probability to
perswade some Protestants to forsake some of their opinions, or others
to leave their communion; but to prove Protestants in state of sinne
while they remain separate from the Roman Church, there is not one
word or syllable: and besides, whatsoever argument there is in it for
any purpose, it may be as forcibly return'd upon Papists, as it is urg'd
against Protestants; in as much as all Papists, either hold the doctrine
of Predetermination, and absolute Election, or communicate with
those that doe hold it. Now from this doctrine, what is more prone
and obvious, then for every naturall man (without Gods especiall
preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting grace) to make this practicall collection, Either I am elected
or not elected; If I be, no impiety possible can ever damne me: If not,
no possible industry can ever save me? Now whether this disiunctive
perswasion be not as likely (as any doctrine of any Protestants,) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
Christian hope, and filiall feare, and to lead some men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
others to presumption, all to a wretchlesse and impious life, I
desire you ingenuously to informe me! and if you deny it, assure your
selfe you shall be contradicted and confuted by men of your own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and your own Society, and taught at length this charitable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that though mens opinions may be charg'd with the absurd
consequences which naturally flow from them, yet the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not; I meane, if they perceive not the consequence of these
absurdities, nor doe not own and acknowledge, but disclaim and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
them. And this is all the answer which I should make to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
if I should deale rigidly and strictly with you. Yet that you
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7615:211"/>
may not think your selfe contemn'd, nor have occasion to pretend,
that your arguments are evaded, I will entreat leave of my Reader to
bring to the test every particle of it, and to censure what deserves a
censure, and to answer what may any way seeme to require an answer:
and then I doubt not, but what I have affirm'd in generall will appear
in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ad</hi> §. 1. To the <hi>First</hi> then I say. 1. It was needlesse to prove,
that due Order is to be observed in any thing; much more in Charity,
which being one of the best things, may be spoil'd by being disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red!
Yet if it stood in need of proofe, I fear this place of the Canticles,
<hi>He hath ordered Charity in me,</hi> would be no enforcing demonstration
of it. 2. The reason alleaged by you why we ought <hi>to love one object
more then another, because one thing participates the Divine Goodnesse
more than another,</hi> is phantasticall, and repugnant to what you say pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after. For by this rule no man should love himselfe more then
all the world; unlesse he were first vainely perswaded that he doth
more participate the Divine Goodnesse then all the world. But the
true reason why one thing ought to be lov'd more then another is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
one thing is better then another, or because it is better to us, or
because God commands us to doe so, or because God himselfe does
so, and we are to conforme our affections to the will of God. 3. It is
not true that <hi>all objects which we believe, doe equally participate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Testimony or Revelation:</hi> For some are testified more evidently,
and some more obscurely; and therefore whatsoever you have built
upon this ground, must of necessity fall together with it. And thus
much for the first number.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 2. In the <hi>Second</hi> many passages deserve a censure. For 1.
it is not true that <hi>we are to wish or desire to God a nature infinite, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
immense:</hi> For it is impossible I should desire to any person
that which he hath already, if I know that he hath it; nor the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
of it, if I know it impossible but he must have it for perpetuity.
And therefore, rejoycing only and not <hi>welwishing</hi> is here the proper
work of love. 2. Whereas you say, That <hi>in things necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
no man ought in any case or in any respect whatsoever, to preferre
the spirituall good of the whole world before his own soule:</hi> In saying this
you seeme to me to condemne one of the greatest acts of Charity, of
one of the greatest Saints that ever was, I mean S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>for his
brethren desir'd to be an Anathema from Christ.</hi> And as for the Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
by you in confirmation of your saying, <hi>what doth it availe a
man if he gaine the whole world, and sustaine the damage of his owne
soule!</hi> it is nothing to the purpose: For without all question it is not
profitable for a man to doe so; but the question is, whether it be not
lawfull for a man to forgoe and part with his own particular profit, to
procure the universall, spirituall, and eternall benefit of others?
3. Whereas you say, <hi>it is directly against Charity to our selves, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
the omitting of any meanes necessary to salvation,</hi> this is true:
But so is this also, that it is directly against the same Charity, to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the omitting any thing, that may any way helpe or conduce to
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:7615:211"/>
my salvation, that may make the way to it more secure or lesse dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
And therefore if the errors of the Roman Church doe but hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me in this way, or any way endanger it, I am in Charity to my
selfe bound to forsake them, though they be not destructive of it.
4. Whereas you conclude, That <hi>if by living out of the Roman Church
we put our selves in hazard to want something necessary to Salvation,
we commit a grievous sinne against the vertue of Charity as it respects our
selves:</hi> This consequence may be good in those which are thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the Roman Church, and yet live out of it. But the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is certainly false. We may live and dye out of the Roman
Church, without putting our selves in any such hazard: Nay to live
and dye in it is as dangerous as to shoote a gulfe, which though some
good ignorant soules may doe and escape, yet it may well be feared
that not one in a hundred but miscarries.</p>
               <p>7 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 3. I proceed now to the <hi>third Section;</hi> &amp; herein first I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this acknowledgement of yours, <hi>That in things necessary only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
commanded, a probable ignorance of the commandement excuses the
Party from all fault, and doth not exclude Salvation.</hi> From which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
it seemes to me to follow, that seeing obedience to the Roman
Church cannot be pretended to be necessary, but only because it is
commanded, therefore not only an invincible, but even a probable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of this pretended command, must excuse us from all faulty
breach of it, and cannot exclude Salvation. Now seeing this command
is not pretended to be expresly delivered, but only to be deduced
from the word of God, and that not by the most cleere and evident
consequences that may be; and seeing an infinity of great objections
lies against it, which seeme strongly to prove that there is no such
command; with what Charity can you suppose, that our ignorance of
this command, is not at the least probable, if not, all things conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
plainly invincible? Sure I am, for my part, that I have done my
true endeavour to finde it true, and am still willing to doe so; but the
more I seeke, the farther I am from finding, and therefore if it be true,
certainly my not finding it is very excusable, and you have reason to
be very charitable in your censures of me. 2. Whereas you say, That
<hi>besides these things necessary because commanded, there are other things,
which are commanded because necessary: of which number you make Divine
infallible faith, Baptisme in Act for Children, and in Desire for those who
are come to the use of Reason, and the Sacrament of Confession, for those
who have committed mortall sinne:</hi> In these words you seeme to me to
deliver a strange Paradoxe <hi>viz.</hi> That Faith, and Baptisme, and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
are not therefore necessary for us, because God appointed them,
but are therefore appointed by God because they were necessary for
us, antecedently to his appointment; which if it were true, I wonder
what it was beside God that made them necessary, and made it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for God to command them! Besides, in making faith one of these
necessary meanes, you seem to exclude Infants from Salvation: Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> and they have not heard. In requiring that
this Faith should be <hi>divine and infallible,</hi> you cast your <hi>Credentes</hi> into
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:7615:212"/>
infinite perplexity, who cannot possibly by any sure marke discerne
whether their Faith be Divine or humane, or if you have any certain
signe, whereby they may discerne, whether they believe your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
infallibility with Divine or only with humane faith, I pray
produce it, for perhaps it may serve us to shew, that our faith is divine
as well as yours. Moreover in affirming that <hi>Baptisme in act is necessary
for Infants, and for men onely in desire,</hi> You seeme to me in the latter
to destroy the foundation of the former. For if a desire of Baptisme
will serve men instead of Baptisme, then those words of our Saviour,
<hi>Vnlesse a man be borne again of water &amp;c.</hi> are not to be understood lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and rigidly of externall Baptisme; for a desire of Baptisme is not
Baptisme, and so your foundation of the Absolute necessity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
is destroied. And if you may glosse the Text so farre, as that
men may be saved by the desire, without Baptisme it selfe, because
they cannot have it, why should you not glosse it a little farther, that
there may be some hope of the salvation of unbaptized infants: to
whom it was more impossible to have a desire of Baptisme, then for
the former to have the thing it selfe? Lastly, for your <hi>Sacrament of
Confession,</hi> we know none such, nor any such absolute necessity of it.
They that confesse their sinnes and forsake them shall finde mercy,
though they confesse them to God only and not to men. They that
confesse them both to God and men, if they doe not effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in time forsake them, shall not finde mercy. 3. Whereas
you say, that <hi>supposing these meanes once appointed as absolutely necessary
to salvation, there cannot but arise an obligation of procuring to have
them;</hi> you must suppose I hope, that we know them to be so appointed,
and that it is in our power to procure them: otherwise though it may
be our ill fortune to faile of the end, for want of the meanes, certainly
we cannot be obliged to procure them. For the rule of the law is also
the dictate of common reason and equity, That <hi>no man can be obliged
to what is impossible.</hi> We can be obliged to nothing but by vertue of
some command: now it is impossible that God should command in
earnest anything which he knowes to be impossible. For to command
in earnest, is to command with an intent to be obeyed; which is not
possible he should doe, when he knowes the thing commanded to be
impossible. Lastly, whosoever is obliged to doe any thing, and does
it not, commits a fault; but Infants commit no fault in not procuring
to have Baptisme; therefore no obligation lies upon them to procure
it. 4. Whereas you say, that <hi>if Protestants dissent from you in the point
of the necessity of Baptisme for Infants, it cannot be denied but that our
disagreement is in a point fundamentall;</hi> If you mean a point esteemed
so by you, this indeed cannot be denied: But if you mean a point that
indeed is fundamentall, this may certainly be denied, for I deny it,
and say, that it doth not appear to me any way necessary to Salvation
to hold the truth, or not to hold an error, touching the condition of
these Infants. This is certain, and we must believe that God will not
deale unjustly with them, but how in particular he will deale with
them concernes not us, and therefore we need not much regard it.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7615:212"/>
5. Whereas you say the like of your <hi>Sacrament of Penance,</hi> you only
say so, but your proofes are wanting. Lastly, whereas you say, <hi>This
rigour ought not to seeme strange or uniust in God, but that we are rather
to blesse him for ordaining us to Salvation by any meanes:</hi> I answer, that
it is true, we are not to question the known will of God, of injustice;
yet whether that which you pretend to be Gods will, be so indeed,
or only your presumption, this I hope may be question'd lawfully &amp;
without presumption; and if we have occasion we may safely put you
in mind of <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> commination, against all those who say, <hi>thus saith
the Lord,</hi> when they have no certain warrant or authority from him
to doe so.</p>
               <p>8 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 4. In the <hi>fourth Paragraph</hi> you deliver this false &amp; wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctrine, <hi>that for the procuring our own salvation we are allwaies
bound under pain of mortall sinne to take the safest way, but for avoiding
sinne we are not bound to doe so, but may follow the opinion of any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Doctors,</hi> though the contrary may be certainly free from sinne, and
theirs be doubtfull. Which doctrine in the former part of it is appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false: For though wisdome and Charity to our selves would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us alwaies to doe so, yet many times, that way which to our
selves and our salvation is more full of hazard, is notwithstanding not
only lawfull, but more charitable and more noble. For example, to
fly from a persecution and so to avoid the temptation of it, may be the
safer way for a mans own salvation; yet I presume no man ought to
condemne him of impiety, who should resolve not to use his liberty in
this matter, but for Gods greater glory, the greater honor of truth, &amp;
the greater confirmation of his brethren in the faith, choose to stand
out the storme and endure the fiery tryall, rather then avoid it; rather
to put his own soule to the hazard of a temptation, in hope of Gods
assistance to goe through with it, then to baulke the opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God and his brethren so great a service. This part therefore of
this Doctrine is manifestly untrue. The other not only false but impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
for therein you plainly give us to understand, that in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a resolution to avoid sinne, to the uttermost of our power, is no
necessary meanes of Salvation, nay that a man may resolve not to doe
so, without any danger of damnation. Therein you teach us, that
we are to doe more for the love of our selves, and our own happinesse
then for the love of God; and in so doing contradict our Saviour, who
expresly commands us, <hi>to love the Lord our God withall our heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
our soule, and withall our strength;</hi> and hath taught us <hi>that the loue of
God consists in avoiding sinne and keeping his commandements.</hi> Therein
you directly crosse S. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, who though he were a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Doctor, and had delivered his judgement for the <hi>lawfulnesse of
eating meats offered to Idols;</hi> yet he assures us that he which should
make scruple of doing so, and forbear upon his scruple, should not
sinne, but only be <hi>aweak brother;</hi> whereas he, who should doe it with
a doubtfull conscience, (though the action were by S. <hi>Paul</hi> warranted
lawfull, yet) <hi>should sinne and be condemn'd for so doing.</hi> You pretend
indeed to be rigid defenders and stout champions for the necessity of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:7615:213"/>
good workes; but the truth is, <hi>you speak lies in hypocrisy,</hi> and when the
matter is well examin'd, will appear to make your selves and your
own functions necessary, but obedience to God unnecessary: Which
will appear to any man who considers what strict necessity the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
imposes upon all men, of effectuall mortification of the habits of
all vices, and effectuall conversion to newnesse of life, and universall
obedience,<note place="margin">Bellar. Contr. Barcl. c. 7. In 7. c. resutare con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

say with Priestly absolution is sufficient to salvation, is not mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which being a work of difficulty and time, cannot be perform'd in
an instant. But for the present, it appears sufficiently out of this impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
assertion, which makes it absolutely necessary for men, either in
Act if it be possible, or if not, in Desire, to be Baptiz'd and Absolv'd by
you, and that with Intention: and in the mean time warrants them that
for avoding of sinne, they may safely follow the uncertain guidance
of a vain man, who you cannot deny may either be deceiv'd himselfe,
or, out of malice deceive them, &amp; neglect the certain direction of God
himselfe, and their own consciences. What wicked use is made of this
Doctrine, your own long experience can better informe you, then it is
possible for me to doe: yet my own litle conversation with you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
one memorable example to this purpose. For upon this ground
I knew a young Scholar in <hi>Doway,</hi> licenc'd by a great Casuist to swear
a thing as upon his certain knowledge, whereof he had yet no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
but only a great presumption, <hi>because</hi> (forsooth) <hi>it was the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one Doctor that he might doe so.</hi> And upon the same ground,
whensoever you shall come to have a prevailing party in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and power sufficient to restore your Religion, you may doe it
by deposing or killing the King, by blowing up of Parliaments, and
by rooting out all others of a different faith from you. Nay this you
may doe, though in your own opinion it be unlawfull, because <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
a man with you of approved vertue, learning and judgement,
hath declared his opinion for the lawfulnesse of it, in saying, that <hi>want
of power to maintaine a rebellion, was the only reason that the Primitive
Christians did not rebell against the persecuting Emperors.</hi> By the same
rule, seeing the Priests and Scribes and Pharisees, men of greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
among the Iewes for vertue, learning and wisdome, held it a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and a pious work to persecute Christ and his Apostles,<note place="margin">Et posi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the people to follow their leaders: for herein, according to your
Doctrine, they proceeded prudently, and according to the conduct of
opinion, maturely weighed and approved by men as it seem'd to them
of vertue, learning and wisdome; nay by such as sate in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, and
of whom it was said, <hi>whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and
doe:</hi> which universall you pretend is to be understood universally, and
without any restriction or limitation. And as lawfull was it for the
Pagans to persecute the Primitive Christians, because <hi>Truian</hi> &amp; <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
men of great vertue and wisdome were of this opinion. Lastly,
that most impious &amp; detestable Doctrine, (which by a foule calumny
you impute to me, who abhorre and detest it,) that <hi>men may be saved
in any Religion,</hi> followes from this ground unavoidably. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7615:213"/>
Religion is one of those things which is necessary only because it is
commanded: for if none were commanded under pain of damnation,
how could it be damnable to be of any? Neither can it be damnable to
be of a false Religion, unlesse it be a sin to be so. For neither are men
saved by good luck, but only by obedience; neither are they damned
for their ill fortune but for sin and disobedience. Death is the wages
of nothing but sin: and S. <hi>Iames</hi> sure intended to deliver the adequate
cause of sin and death in those words, <hi>Lust when it hath conceived brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
forth sin, and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death.</hi> Seeing
therefore in such things, according to your doctrine, it is sufficient for
avoiding of sin, that we proceed prudently, &amp; by the conduct of some
probable opinion, maturely weighed &amp; approv'd by men of learning,
vertue and wisdome: and seeing neither Iews want their <hi>Gamaliels,</hi>
nor Pagans their <hi>Antoninus'es,</hi> nor any sect of Christians such profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
and maintainers of their severall sects, as are esteem'd by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which know no better (and that very reasonably) men of vertue,
learning, and wisdome, it followes evidently that the embracing their
religion proceeds upon such reason as may warrant their action to bee
prudent, and this is sufficient for avoiding of sin, and therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for avoiding damnation, for that in humane affaires and discourse,
evidence and certainty cannot be alwaies expected. I haue stood the
longer upon the refutation of this doctrine, not only because it is impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and because bad use is made of it, and worse may be, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the contrary position, <hi>That men are bound for avoiding sin alwaies
to take the safest way,</hi> is a faire and sure foundation, for a cleer confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the main conclusion, which in this Chapter you labour in vain
to prove, and a certain proof that in regard of the precept of charity
towards ones selfe, and of obedience to God, Papists (unlesse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
excuse them) are in state of sin as long as they remain in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Roman Church.</p>
               <p>9 For if the safer way for avoiding sin, be also the safer way for
avoiding damnation, then certainly whether the way of Protestants
must be more secure, and the Roman way more dangerous, take but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your consideration these ensuing controversies: Whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to worship Pictures? to picture the Trinity? to invocate Saints and
Angels? to deny Law-men the Cup in the Sacrament? to adore the
Sacrament? to prohibite certain Orders of men and woemen to marry?
to celebrate the publique service of God in a language which the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants
generally understand not? and you will not choose but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that in all these you are on the more dangerous side for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of sin, and we on that which is more secure. For in all these
things, if we say true, you doe that which is impious: on the other side
if you were in the right, yet we might be secure enough, for we should
only not doe something which you confesse not necessary to be done.
We pretend, and are ready to justifie out of principles agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, that in all these things, you violate the manifest commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God; and alleage such texts of Scripture against you, as, if
you would weigh them with any indifference, would put the matter
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7615:214"/>
out of question, but certainly you cannot with any modesty deny, but
that at least they make it questionable. On the other side, you cannot
with any face pretend, and if you should, know not how to goe about
to proue, that there is any necessity of doing any of these things; that
it is unlawfull not to worship pictures, not to picture the Trinity, not
to invocate Saints &amp; Angels, not to giue all men the entire Sacrament,
not to adore the Eucharist, not to prohibite marriage, not to celebrate
divine service in an unknown tongue: I say you neither doe nor can
pretend that there is any law of God which enjoynes us, no nor so
much as an Evangelicall Counsell that advises us to doe any of these
things. Now <hi>where no law is there can be no sin, for sin is the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the law;</hi> It remaines therefore that our forbearing to doe these
things, must be free from all danger &amp; suspicion of sin; whereas your
acting of them, must be, if not certainly impious, without all contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
questionable and dangerous. I conclude therefore that which
was to be concluded, that if the safer way for avoiding sin, be also (as
most certainly it is,) the safer way for avoiding damnation, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the way of Protestants must bee more safe, and the Roman way
more dangerous. You will say, I know, that <hi>these things being by your
Church concluded lawfull, we are obliged by God, though not to doe, yet to
approue them; at least in your iudgement we are so, and therefore our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is as questionable as yours.</hi> I answer. The Authority of your
Church is no common principle agreed upon between us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon that you are not to dispute against us. We might presse you
with our judgement as well and as justly as you doe us with yours. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
this very thing that your Church hath determin'd these things
lawfull, and commanded the approbation of them, is that whereof she
is accused by us, and we maintain you haue done wickedly, or at least
very dangerously in so determining; because in these very determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
you haue forsaken that way which was secure from sinne, and
haue chosen that which you cannot but know to be very questionable
and doubtfull; &amp; consequently haue forsaken the safe way to heaven,
and taken a way which is full of danger. And therefore, although if
your obedience to your Church were questioned, you might fly for
shelter to your Churches determinations, yet when these very deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
are accused, me thinks they should not be alleag'd in defence
of themselues. But you will say, your Church is infallible, &amp; therefore
her determinations not unlawfull. Ans. They that accuse your Church
of error, you may be sure doe question her infallibility: shew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where it is written, that your Church is infallible, and the dispute
will be ended. But till you doe so, give mee leaue rather to conclude
thus, your Church in many of her determinations, chooses not that
way which is more secure from sin, and therefore not the safest way to
salvation; then vainly to imagine her infallible, and there upon to
belieue, though she teach not the securest way to avoid sin, yet shee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the certainst way to obtain salvation.</p>
               <p>10 In the close of this Number, you say as followes, <hi>If it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
though not certain, yet at least probable, that Protestancy unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7615:214"/>
destroies salvation, and withall that there is a safer way, it will follow
that they are obliged by the law of Charity to that safe way.</hi> Ans. Make
this appear and I will never perswade any man to continue a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
for if I should, I should perswade him to continue a fool. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all these prolix discourses, still we see you are at, <hi>If it may appeare:</hi>
From whence without all Ifs and Ands that appeares sufficiently
which I said in the beginning of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> that the <hi>foure first Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs</hi>
of this Chap. are wholly spent in an unnecessary introduction,
unto that which never by any man in his right wits was denied, That
<hi>men in wisdome and charity to themselves are to take the safest way to
eternall salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11 <hi>Ad</hi> § 5. In the <hi>fift</hi> you begin to make some shew of arguing, &amp;
tells us, that <hi>Protestants haue reason to doubt in what case they stand from
what you have said about the Churches universall infallibility, &amp; of her
being Iudge of Controversies, &amp;c.</hi> Ans. From all that which you haue
said, they have reason only to conclude that you haue nothing to say.
They haue as much reason to doubt, whether there can bee any Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from what <hi>Zeno</hi> saies in <hi>Aristotles</hi> Physicks, as to doubt from what
you haue said, whether the Roman Church may possibly erre. For
this I dare say, that not the weakest of <hi>Zeno's</hi> arguments but is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then the strongest of yours, and that you would be more perplext
in answering any one of them, then I haue been in answering all yours.
You are pleas'd to repeat two or three of them in this Section, and in
all probability so wise a man as you are, if he would repeat any,
would repeat the best, and therefore if I desire the Reader by these to
judge of the rest, I shall desire but ordinary justice.</p>
               <p>12 The first of them being put into form stands thus, <hi>Every least
errour in faith destroies the nature of faith; It is certain that some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
doe erre, and therefore they want the substance of Faith.</hi> The Major
of which Syllogisme I haue formerly confuted by unanswerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts out of one of your own best Authors, who shewes plainly that
he hath amongst you, as strange as you make it, many other abettors.
Besides, if it were true, it would conclude that either you or the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans
haue no faith, in as much as you oppose one another as much
as Arminians and Calvinists.</p>
               <p>13 The second Argument stands thus, <hi>Since all Protestants pretend
the like certainty, it is clear that none of them haue any certainty at all:</hi>
Which argument if it were good, then what can hinder but this must
also be so, Since Protestants and Papists pretend the like certainty; it is
cleer that none of them haue any certainty at all! And this too: Since
all Christians pretend the like certainty it is cleer that none of them
haue any certainty at all! And thirdly this: Since men of all religions
pretend a like certainty, it is cleer that none of them haue any at all!
And lastly this: Since oft-times they which are abused with a specious
Paralogisme, pretend the like certainty with them which demonstrate,
it is cleer that none of them haue any certainty at all! Certainly Sir,
Zeal and the Divell did strangely blind you, if you did not see that
these horrid impieties were the immediate consequences of your posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7615:215"/>
if you did see it, &amp; yet would set them down, you deserve worse
censure. Yet such as these, are all the arguments wherewith you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your selfe to have prov'd undoubtedly, that <hi>Protestants haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at least to doubt in what case they stand.</hi> Neither am I afraid to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my life upon it, that your selfe shall not choose so much as one
out of all the pack, which I will not shew before indifferent Iudges, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be impertinent to the question, inconsequent in the deduction,
or grounded upon some false, or at least uncertain foundation.</p>
               <p>14 Your third and fourth argument may bee thus put into one;
<hi>Protestants cannot tell what points in particular be fundamentall; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot tell whether they or their brethren doe not erre fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
and whether their difference be not fundamentall.</hi> Both which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
I haue formerly shewed to be most inconsequent; for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture to contain all fundamentalls, (though many more
points besides, which makes it difficult to say precisely what is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
and what not,) knowing this I say and believing it, what can
hinder but that I may be well assured, that I belieue all fundamentalls,
and that all who believe the Scripture syncerely as well as I, doe not
differ from me in any thing fundamentall?</p>
               <p>15 In the close of this Section, you say, that <hi>you omit to adde that
we want the Sacrament of Repentance instituted for the remission of sins,
or at least we must confesse that we hold it not necessary: and yet our own
brethren the Century writers acknowledge that in the times of Cyprian
and Tertullian, private Confession even of thoughts was used, and that it
was then commanded and thought necessary; and then our Ordination,</hi> you
say <hi>is very doubtfull and all that depends upon it.</hi> Ans. I also omit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
1. That your brother <hi>Rhenanus,</hi> acknowledges the contrary, &amp;
assures us that the Confession then required and in use, was publique,
and before the Church, and that your auricular Confession was not
then in the world; for which his mouth is stopped by your <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius.</hi>
2. That your brother <hi>Arcudius</hi> acknowledges, that the
Eucharist was in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time given to Infants, and esteemed neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or at least profitable for them, and the giving it shewes no lesse; &amp;
now I would know whether you will acknowledge your Church
bound to giue it, and to esteem so of it? 3. That it might be then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and being commanded be thought necessary, and yet be
but a Church Constitution. Neither will I deny, if the present
Church, could, and would so order it, that the abuses of it might bee
prevented, and conceiving it profitable, should enjoyn the use of it, but
that being commanded it would be necessary. 4. Concerning our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations,
besides that I haue prou'd it impossible that they should be
so doubtfull as yours, according to your own principles; I answer,
that experience shewes them certainly sufficient to bring men to faith
and repentance, and consequently to salvation; and that if there were
any secret defect of any thing necessary, which we cannot help, God
will certainly supply it.</p>
               <p>16 <hi>Ad</hi> § 6. In the <hi>sixt,</hi> you say, <hi>you will not repeat, but only put us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in minde that unlesse the Roman Church were the true Church there
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:7615:215"/>
was no visible Church upon earth, a thing so manifest that Protestants
themselves confesse, &amp;c.</hi> Ans. Neither will I repeat, but only put you in
minde that you haue not prov'd that there is any necessity that there
should be any visible true. Church; nor if there were, that there was no
other besides the Roman. For as for the confession of Protestants
which here you insist upon, it is evident out of their own words cited
by your selfe, that by the <hi>whole world,</hi> they meant onely the <hi>greatest
part of it,</hi> which is an usuall figure of speech; and never intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that besides the Church then reigning &amp; triumphing in this world,
there was another militant Church, other Christians visible enough
though persecuted and oppressed. Nor thirdly doe you here make
good so much as with one fallacy, that if the Roman Church were
then the visible Church, it must needs be now the only or the safer way
to heaven; and yet the connexion of this consequence was very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be shewne. For, for ought I know, it was not impossible that it
might then be the only Visible Church, &amp; yet now a very dangerous
way to heaven, or perhaps none at all.</p>
               <p>17 Afterwards you vainly pretend that <hi>all Roman Catholiques, not
one excepted, professe, that Protestancy unrepented destroies salvation.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which generality wee may except two at least to my knowledge, and
those are, <hi>your selfe,</hi> and <hi>Franciscus de Sancta Clara,</hi> who assures us that
<hi>Ignorance and Repentance may excuse a Protestant from damnation
though dying in his errour.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

own confession also, the most favourable Protestants allow to Papists;
and therefore with strange repugnance to your selfe you subjoyne, that
<hi>these are the men whom we must hold not to erre damnably, unlesse we will
destroy our owne Church and salvation.</hi> Whereas, as I have said before,
though you were Turks, and Pagans, we might bee good Christians.
Neither is it necessary for the perpetuating of a Church before <hi>Luther,</hi>
that your errours even then should not be <hi>damnable,</hi> but only not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
damning</hi> to some ignorant soules among you. In vaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

&amp; finde neither terrour nor truth in them. Let children and fooles bee
terrified with bug-beares, men of understanding will not regard them.</p>
               <p>18 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Your whole discourse in your <hi>five
next Paragraphs,</hi> I have in the beginning of this Chapter fully confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by saying, that it stands altogether upon the false foundation of
this affected mistake, that <hi>we doe and must confesse the Roman Church
free from damnable error;</hi> which will presently be apparent, to any one
who considers, that the <hi>seaventh and tenth</hi> are nothing but D. <hi>Potters</hi>
words; and that in the <hi>other three,</hi> you obtrude upon us this <hi>Crambe</hi> no
fewer then seven times. May you be pleased to look back to your own
Book, &amp; you shall find it so as I have said: &amp; that at least in a hundred
other places you make your advantage of this false imputation: which
when you have observ'd, and withall considered that your selfe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intimate, that D. <hi>Potters</hi> discourses which here you censure, would
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7615:216"/>
be good and concluding, if we did not (as we doe not) free you from
damnable errour, I hope you will acknowledge that my vouchsafing
these <hi>Sections</hi> the honour of any farther answer, is a great supererroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in point of civility. Neverthelesse partly that I may the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
my selfe with you, but especially, that I may stop their
mouthes who will be apt to say, that every word of yours which I
should omit to speak to, is an unanswerable argument, I will hold
my purpose of answering them more punctually and particularly.</p>
               <p>19 First then, to your little parenthesis, which you interline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
D. <hi>Potters</hi> words, §. 7. <hi>That any small error in faith destroies all
faith,</hi> (To omit what hath been said before,) I answer here what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for this place; that S. <hi>Austine,</hi> whose authority is here stood upon,
thought otherwise: He conceived the Donatists to hold some error in
faith and yet not to have no faith. His words of them to this purpose
are most pregnant and evident, <hi>you are with us</hi> (saith he to the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.
Ep. 48.) <hi>in Baptisme, in the Creed, in the other Sacraments:</hi> And
again. <hi>Super gestis cum emerit: Thou hast proved to me that thou hast
faith; prove to me likewise that thou hast charity.</hi> Paralell to which
words are these of <hi>Optatus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 5. prope initium.</note> 
                  <hi>Amongst us and you is one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ecclesiasticall
conversation, common lessons; the same faith, the same Sacraments.</hi>
Where by the way we may observe, that in the judgements of these
Fathers, even the Donatists, though Heretiques and Schismatiques,
gave true Ordination, the true Sacrament of Matrimony, true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Absolution, Confirmation, the true Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
true extream Vnction; or else (choose you whether) some of
these were not then esteem'd Sacraments. But for Ordination, whether
he held it a Sacrament or no, certainly he held that it remain'd with
them entire: for so he saies in expresse tearmes, in his book against
<hi>Parmenianus</hi> his Epistle. Which Doctrine if you can reconcile with
the present Doctrine of the Roman Church,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20 Whereas in the beginning of the 8. Sect. <hi>you deny that your
argument drawn from our confessing the Possibility of your Salvation,
is for simple people alone, but for all men:</hi> I answer, certainly whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is moved with it, must be so simple as to think this a good and a
concluding reason; Some ignorant men in the Roman Church may be
sav'd, by the confession of Protestants, (which is indeed all that they
confesse,) therefore it is safe for me to be of the Roman Church; and
he that does think so, what reason is there why he should not think
this as good, Ignorant Protestans may be saved, by the confession of
Papists, (by name M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.) therefore it is safe for me to be of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Church? Whereas you say, that <hi>this your argument is grounded
upon an inevitable necessity for us, either to grant Salvation to your
Church, or to entail certain damnation upon our own, because ours can
have no being till Luther, unlesse yours be supposed to have been the true
Church.</hi> I answer, this cause is no cause: For first, as <hi>Luther</hi> had no
being before <hi>Luther,</hi> and yet he was when he was, though he was not
before; so there is no repugnance in the termes, but that there might
be a true Church after <hi>Luther,</hi> though there were none for some ages
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7615:216"/>
before; as since <hi>Columbus</hi> his time, there have been Christians in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi>
though before there were none for many ages. For neither
doe you shew, neither does it appear, that the generation of Churches
is univocall, that nothing but a Church can possibly beget a Church;
nor that the present being of a true Church, depends necessarily upon
the perpetuity of a Church in all ages; any more then the present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Peripateticks or Stoicks depends upon a perpetuall pedigree of
them. For though I at no hand deny the Churches perpetuity, yet I
see nothing in your book to make me understand, that the truth of
the present depends upon it, nor any thing that can hinder, but that a
false Church, (Gods providence overwatching and overruling it,)
may preserve the meanes of confuting their own Heresies, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
men to truth, and so raising a true Church, I mean the integrity
and the authority of the word of God with men. Thus the Iewes
preserve meanes to make men Christians, and Papists preserve means
to make men Protestants, and Protestants (which you say are a false
Church) doe, as you pretend, preserve means to make men Papists;
that is, their own Bibles, out of which you pretend to be able to prove
that they are to be Papists. Secondly, you shew not, nor does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the perpetuity of <hi>the Church</hi> depends on the truth of <hi>yours.</hi>
For though you talke vainly, as if you were the only men in the world
before <hi>Luther,</hi> yet the world knowes that this but talke, and that
there were other Christians besides you, which might have perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Church though you had not beene. Lastly, you shew not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth it appear, that your being acknowledged in some sense a true
Church, doth necessarily import, that we must grant salvation to it,
unlesse by it you understand the ignorant members of it, which is a
very unusuall <hi>Sinechdoche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21 Whereas you say, <hi>that Catholiques never granted that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists
had a true Church or might be saved.</hi> I answ. S. <hi>Austin</hi> himselfe
granted that those among them, who sought the Truth, being <hi>ready
when they found it to correct their error were not Heretiques, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
notwithstanding their error might be saved.</hi> And this is all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that Protestants allow to Papists.</p>
               <p>22 Whereas you say, that D. <hi>Potter</hi> having cited out of S. <hi>Austine</hi>
the words of the Catholiques, <hi>that the Donatists had true Baptisme,</hi>
when he comes to the contrary words of the Donatist, addes, <hi>no
Church, no Salvation!</hi> Ans. You wrong D. <hi>Potter,</hi> who pretends not to
cite S. <hi>Austines</hi> formall words but only his sense, which in him is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and full for that purpose whereto it is alleaged by D. <hi>Potter.</hi>
His words are, <hi>Petilianus dixit, venite ad Ecclesiam Populi &amp; aufugite
Traditores,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cont. lit. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. l. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>si perire non vultis: Petilian saith, come to the Church yee
people, and fly from the Traditours if ye will not be damn'd, for that yee
may know that they being guilty, esteeme very well of our Faith, Behold
I Baptize these whom they have infected; but they receive those whom we
have baptized.</hi> Where it is plain, that <hi>Petilian</hi> by his words makes the
Donatists the Church, and excludes the Catholiques from salvation
absolutely. And therefore <hi>no Church, no Salvation</hi> was not D. <hi>Potters</hi>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:7615:217"/>
addition. And whereas you say, the <hi>Catholiques never yeelded that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Donatists there was a true Church and hope of Salvation,</hi> I say
it appears by what I have alleaged out of S. <hi>Austine,</hi> that they yeelded
both these were among the Donatists, as much as we yeeld them to be
among the Papists. As for D. <hi>Potters</hi> acknowledgement; that <hi>they
maintained an error in the matter &amp; nature of it Hereticall:</hi> This proves
them but Materiall Heretiques, whom you doe not exclude from
possibility of Salvation. So that all things considered, this argument
must be much more forcible from the Donatists against the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
then from Papists against Protestants, in regard Protestants
grant Papists no more hope of salvation then Papists grant Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants:
whereas the Donatists excluded absolutely all but their own
Part from hope of Salvation, so farre as to account them no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that were not of it: the Catholiques mean while accounting them
Brethren, and freeing those among them, from the imputation of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,
who being in error <hi>quaerebant cautâ sollicitudine veritatem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigi
parati cùm invenerint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23 Whereas you say, <hi>That the Argument for the certainty of their
Baptisme (because it was confessed good by Catholiques, whereas the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of Catholiques was not confessed by them to be good,) is not so good
as yours, touching the certainty of your Salvation grounded on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Protestants, because wee confesse there is no damnable error in
the Doctrine or practice of the Roman Church:</hi> I Ans. no: we confesse no
such matter, and though you say so a hundred times, no repetition
will make it true. We professe plainly, that many damnable errors
plainly repugnant to the precepts of Christ both Ceremoniall and
Morall, more plainly then this of Rebaptization, and therefore more
damnable, are believed and professed by you. And therefore seeing
this is the only disparity you can devise, and this is vanished, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
that as good an answer as the Catholiques made touching the
certainty of their Baptisme, as good may we make, and with much
more evidence of Reason, touching the security and certainty of our
Salvation.</p>
               <p>24 By the way I desire to be inform'd, seeing you affirme that
<hi>Rebaptizing those whom Hereticks had baptized was a sacriledge, and a
profession of a damnable Heresie,</hi> when it began to be so? If from the
beginning it were so, then was <hi>Cyprian</hi> a sacrilegious professor of a
damnable heresy, and yet a Saint and a martyr. If it were not so, then
did your Church excommunicate <hi>Firmilian</hi> and others, and separate
from them without sufficient ground of Excommunication or Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is Schismaticall. You see what difficulties you runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
on both sides; choose whether you will, but certainly both can
hardly be avoided.</p>
               <p>25 Whereas again in this §. you obtrude upon us, <hi>That we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but confesse that your doctrine containes no damnable error, and that
yours is so certainly a true Church, that unlesse yours be true we cannot
pretend any:</hi> I answer, there is in this neither truth nor modesty to
outface us, that we cannot but confesse what indeed we connot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7615:217"/>
For my part, if I were upon the rack, I perswade my selfe I should
not confesse the one nor the other.</p>
               <p>26 Whereas again presently you adde, that D. <hi>Potter grants we
should be guilty of Schisme, if we did cut off your Church from the body
of Christ and the hope of Salvation:</hi> I have shewed above that he grants
no such matter. He saies indeed, <hi>that our not doing so frees us from the
imputation of Schisme,</hi> &amp; from hence you sophistically inferre, that he
<hi>must grant, If we did so, wee were Schismatiques,</hi> and then make your
Reader believe; that this is D. <hi>Potters</hi> confession, it being indeed your
own false collection. For as every one that is not a Papist, is not a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,
and yet not every one that is a Papist is a Iesuit: As whosoever
comes not into England, comes not to London, and yet many may
come to England, and not come to London: As whosoever is not a
man, is not a King, and yet many are men that are not Kings: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it may be certain, that whosoever does not so is free from
Schisme, and yet they that doe so (if there be sufficient cause,) may be
not guilty of it.</p>
               <p>27 Whereas you <hi>pretend to wonder that the Doctor did not answer
the argument of the Donatists, which he saies is all one with yours, but
referres you to S. Austine there to read it, as if every one carried with
him a Library, or were able to examin the places in S. Austin:</hi> I answer, the
parity of the Arguments was that which the Doctor was to declare,
whereto it was impertinent what the answer was: But sufficient it was
to shew that the Donatists argument which you would never grant
good, was yet as good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> yours, and therefore yours could not be
good. Now to this purpose as the concealing the answer was no way
advantagious, so to produce it was not necessary; and therefore he did
you more service then he was bound to, in referring you to S. <hi>Austin</hi>
for an answer to it. Whereas you say, <hi>he had reason to conceale it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it makes directly against himselfe:</hi> I say it is so farre from doing
so, that it will serve in proportion to the argument, as fitly as if it had
been made for it: for as S. <hi>Austine</hi> saies, <hi>that Catholiques approve the
Doctrine of Donatists, but abhorre their Heresy of Re-baptization:</hi> so we
say, that we approve those fundamentall and simply necessary Truths
which you retaine, by which some good soules among you may be
saved, but abhorre your many Superstitions and Heresies. And as he
saies, that as gold is good, yet ought not to be sought for among a
company of Theeves, and Baptisme good but not to be sought for in
the Conventicles of Donatists: so say we, that the Truths you retaine
are good, and as we hope sufficient to bring good ignorant soules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you to salvation, yet are not to be sought for in the Conventicle
of Papists, who hold with them a mixture of many vanities, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
impieties. For, <hi>as for our freeing you from damnable Heresy, and
yeelding you Salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> (which stone here again you stumble at,) neither
he nor any other Protestant is guilty of it; and therefore you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that this very answer will serve Protestants against this charme
of Papists, as well as S. <hi>Austine</hi> against the Donatists, and that indeed it
was not <hi>D. Potter</hi> but <hi>You,</hi> that, without a Sarcasme, <hi>had reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7615:218"/>
this Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28 The last piece of D. <hi>Potters</hi> book, which you are pleased to
take notice of in this <hi>first Part</hi> of yours, is an argument he makes in
your behalfe p. 79. of his book, where he makes you speak thus, <hi>If
Protestants believe the Religion of Papists to be a safe way to heaven, why
doe they not follow it?</hi> This argument you like not, because <hi>many things
may be good and yet not necessary to be embraced by every body,</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
scoffe at it, and call it an <hi>argument of his own, a wise argument, a
wise demand:</hi> and then aske of him, what he thinkes of it being fram'd
thus, <hi>Our Religion is safe, even by your confession, and therefore you ought
to grant that all may embrace it.</hi> And yet farther thus, <hi>Among different
Religions one only can be safe: But yours by our own confession is safe:
where as you hold that in ours there is no hope of salvation, therefore we
ought to embrace yours.</hi> Ans. I have advised with him, &amp; am to tell you
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, that he thinks reasonable well of the arguments, but very ill of
him that makes them, as affirming so often without shame and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
what he cannot but know to be plainly false: and his reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is so farre from confessing, or giving you any ground to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
he does confesse, <hi>that your Religion is safe for all that are of it,</hi>
from whence only it will follow that all may safely embrace it, that
in this very place, from which you take these words, he professeth
plainly, <hi>that it is extreamly dangerous, if not certainly damnable to all
such as professe it, when either they doe, or if their hearts were upright
and not perversly obstinat might believe the contrary, and that for us wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
are convinc'd in conscience that she (the Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Church) erres in many
things, it lies upon us, even under pain of damnation to forsake her in
those errors.</hi> And though here you take upon you a shew of great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and will seem to hold <hi>that in our way there is no hope of Salvation;</hi>
yet formerly you have been more liberall of your charity towards us,
and will needs vye and contend with D. <hi>Potter</hi> which of <hi>the two shall
be more Charitable,</hi> assuring us that <hi>you allow Protestants as much Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as D. Potter spares you, for whom he makes Ignorance the best hope of
Salvation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 1. §. 4.</note> And now I appeale to any indifferent reader, whether
our disavowing to confesse you free from damnable error, were not
(as I pretend) a full confutation of all that you say in these <hi>five fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Paragraphs:</hi> And as for you I wonder, what answer, what evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what shift you can devise to cleere your selfe from dishonesty, for
imputing to him almost a hundred times, this acknowledgment which
he never makes, but very often, and that so plainly that you take notice
of it, professeth the contrary!</p>
               <p>29 The best defence that possibly can be made for you, I conceive,
is this, that you were led into this error, by mistaking a supposition of
a confession, for a confession; a Rhetoricall concession of the Doctors,
for a positive assertion. He saies indeed of your errors, <hi>Though of
themselves they be not damnable to them which believe as they professe,
yet for us to professe what we believe not, were without question damnable.</hi>
But, to say, <hi>Though your errors be not damnable, we may not professe them,</hi>
is not to say, your errors are not damnable, but <hi>only though they be not.</hi>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:7615:218"/>
As if you shoul say, though the Church erre in points not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
yet you may not separate from it: Or, though we doe erre in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Christ really present, yet our error frees us from Idolatry:
Or, as if a Protestant should say, Though you doe not commit Idolatry
in adoring the Host, yet being uncertain of the Priests Intention to
consecrate, at least you expose yourselfe to the danger of it: I presume
you would not think it fairely done, if any man should interpret either
this last speech as an acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that you doe not commit Idol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or the former as confessions, that you doe erre in points not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
that you doe erre in believing the reall presence. And
therefore you ought not so to have mistaken D. <hi>Potters</hi> words, as if he
had confessed the errors of your Church not damnable, when he saies
no more but this, <hi>Though they be so,</hi> or, suppose, or put the case they
be so, yet being errors, we that know them may not professe them to
be divine truths. Yet this mistake might have been pardonable, had
not D. <hi>Potter</hi> in many places of his book, by declaring his judgement
touching the quality and malignity of your errors, taken away from
you all occasion of error. But now that he saies plainly, <hi>That your
Church hath many waies played the Harlot, and in that regard, deserv'd
a Bill of divorce from Christ, and the detestation of Christians p. 11. That
for that Masse of Errors and abuses in judgement and practice which is
proper to her, and wherein she differs from us, we judge a reconciliation
impossible, and to us (who are convicted in conscience of her corruptions)
damnable. pag. 20. That Popery is the contagion or plague of the Church.
p. 60. That we cannot, we dare not communicate with her in her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Liturgy, which is manifestly polluted with drosse of Superstition. p.
68. That they who in former ages dyed in the Church of Rome died in
many sinfull errors. p. 78. That they that have understanding and means
to discover their errors and neglect to use them, he dares not flatter them
with so easy a censure, as to give them hope of salvation p. 79. That the
way of the Roman Religion is not safe, but very dangerous, if not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
damnable, to such as professe it, when they believe (or if their hearts
were upright and not perversely obstinate might believe) the contrary,
p. 79. That your Church is but (in some sense) a true Church, and your
errors only to some men not damnable, &amp; that we who are convinc'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that she erres in many things, are under pain of damnation to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
her in those errors.</hi> Seeing I say, he saies all this so plainly and so
frequently, certainly your charging him falsely with this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement,
and building a great part not only of your discourse in this
Chapter, but of your whole book upon it, possibly it may be palliated
with some excuse, but it can no way be defended with any just apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.
Especially seeing you your selfe more then once or twice, take
notice of these his severer censures of your Church, and the errors of
it, and make your advantage of them. In the first number of your first
Chapter, you set down three of the former places; and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
That <hi>as you affirme Protestancy unrepented destroies Salvation, so
D. Potter pronounces the like heavy doome against Roman Catholiques:</hi>
and again §. 4. of the same Chap. <hi>We allow Protestants as much charity
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:7615:219"/>
as D. Potter spare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> us, for whom he makes ignorance the best hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
And c. 5. § 41. you have these words: <hi>It is very strange that
you iudge us extreamly uncharitable in saying Protestants cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
while your selfe avouch the same of all Learned Catholiques, whom
Ignorance cannot excuse!</hi> Thus out of the same mouth you blow hot
and cold; and one while, when it is for your purpose, you professe D.
<hi>Potter censures your errors as heavily as you doe ours;</hi> which is very true,
for he gives hope of Salvation to none among you, but to those
whose ignorance was the cause of their error, and no sinne cause of
their ignorance: and presently after, when another project comes in
your head, you make his words softer then oile towards you; you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
he does and must confesse, <hi>That your Doctrine containes no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
error, that your Church is certainly a true Church, that your way
to heaven is a safe way,</hi> and all these acknowledgements you set down
simple and absolute, without any restriction or limitation; whereas in
the Doctor they are all so qualified, that no knowing Papist can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
himselfe any security or comfort from them. <hi>We confesse</hi> (saith
he) <hi>the Church of Rome to be (in some sense) a true Church, and her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
(to some men) not damnable: we believe her Religion safe, that is,
by Gods great mercy not damnable, to some such as believe what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse:
But we believe it not safe but very dangerous, if not certainly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to such as professe it, when they believe (or if their hearts were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
and not perversly obstinate might believe) the contrary.</hi> Observe I
pray these restraining termes which formerly you have dissembled, <hi>A
true Church in some sense, not damnable to some men, a safe way, that is
by Gods great mercy not damnable to some:</hi> And then seeing you have
pretended these confessions to be absolute, which are thus plainly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
how can you avoid the imputation of an egregious Sophister?
You quarrell with the Doctor, in the end of your Preface, for using
in his Book such ambiguous tearmes as these, <hi>in some sort, in some
sense, in some degree:</hi> and desire him if <hi>he make any reply, either to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
them, or to tell you roundly in what sort, in what sense, in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
he understands these and the like mincing phrases.</hi> But the truth is
he hath not left them so ambiguous and undetermin'd as you pretend;
but told you plainly, in what <hi>sense, your Church may passe for a true
Church, viz.</hi> In regard we may hope that she retaines those truths
which are simply, absolutely, and indispensably necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may suffice to bring those good soules to heaven, who
wanted meanes of discovering their errors; this is the charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
in which you may passe for a Church: And <hi>to what men your
Religion may be safe, and your errors not damnable, viz.</hi> to such whom
Ignorance may excuse, and therefore he hath more cause to complain
of you, for quoting his words without those qualifications, then you
to finde fault with him for using of them.</p>
               <p>30 That your Discourse in the 12. §. presseth you as forcibly as
Protestants, I have shewed above: I adde here, 1. Whereas you say
that <hi>faith, according to rigid Calvinists, is either so strong, that once had,
it can never be lost, or so more then weak, and so much nothing that it can
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:7615:219"/>
never begotten:</hi> That, these are words without sense. Never any Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinist
affirmed that faith was so weak, and so much nothing that it can
never be gotten: but it seemes you wanted matter to make up your
Antithesis, and therefore were resolved to speak empty words rather
then loose your figure,
<q>
                     <l>Crimina rasis</l>
                     <l>Librat in antithetis, doct as posuisse Figuras</l>
                     <l>Laudatur.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>2. That there is no Calvinist that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Truth of this proposition, Christ died for all, nor to subscribe
to that sense of it, which your Dominicans put upon it; neither can you
with coherence to the received Doctrine of your own Society, deny
that they as well as the Calvinists, take away the distinction of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and effectuall grace, and indeed hold none to be sufficient, but
only that which is effectuall. 3. Whereas you say, <hi>They cannot make
their calling certain by good workes, who doe certainly believe that before
any good works they are justified, and justified by faith alone, and by that
faith whereby they certainly believe they are justified:</hi> I ans. There is no
Protestant but believes that Faith, Repentance, and universall Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
are necessary to the obtaining of Gods favour and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.
This being granted, the rest is but a speculative Controversy,
a Question about words which would quickly vanish, but that men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
not to understand one another. As if a company of Physitians
were in consultation, and should all agree, that three medicines and
no more were necessary for the recovery of the Patients health, this
were sufficient for his direction towards the recovery of his health;
though concerning the proper and specificall effects of these three
medicines, there should be amongst them as many differences as men:
So likewise being generally at accord that these three things, Faith,
Hope, &amp; Charity, are necessary to salvation, so that whosoever wants
any of them cannot obtain it, and he which hath them all cannot faile
of it, it is not very evident that they are sufficiently agreed for mens
directions to eternall Salvation? And seeing Charity is a full compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of all good workes, they requiring Charity as a necessary
qualification in him that will be saved, what sense is there in saying,
<hi>they cannot make their calling certain by good workes?</hi> They know what
salvation is as well as you, and have as much reason to desire it: They
believe it as heartily as you, that there is no good worke but shall have
its proper reward, and that there is no possibility of obtaining the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
reward without good workes: and why then may not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
be a sufficient incitement and provocation unto good workes?</p>
               <p>31 You say, that <hi>they certainly believe that before any good works
they are iustified:</hi> But this is a calumny. There is no Protestant but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
to Iustification, Remission of sinnes, and to Remission of sinnes
they all require Repentance, and Repentance I presume may not be
denied the name of a good worke, being indeed, if it be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and according to the sense of the word in Scripture, an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
conversion from all sinne to all holinesse. But though it be taken
for meer sorrow for sinnes past, and a bare purpose of amendment, yet
even this is a good worke, and therefore Protestants requiring this to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:7615:220"/>
Remission of sinnes, and Remission of sinnes to justification, cannot
with candor be pretended to believe, that they are justified before any
good worke.</p>
               <p>32 You say, <hi>They believe themselves iustified by faith alone, and
that by that faith whereby they believe themselves iustified:</hi> Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
doe so, but withall they believe that that faith which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and unaccompanied with <hi>sincere</hi> and universall obedience, is to
be esteem'd not faith but presumption, and is at no hand sufficient to
justification: that though Charity be not imputed unto justification,
yet is it required as a necessary disposition in the person to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that though in regard of the imperfection of it, no man can be
justified by it, yet that on the other side, no man can be justified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. So that upon the whole matter, a man may truly and safely
say, that the Doctrine of these Protestants, taken altogether, is not a
Doctrine of Liberty, not a Doctrine that turnes hope into presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and carnall security; though it may justly be feared, that many licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
persons, taking it by halfes, have made this wicked use of it. For
my part, I doe heartily wish, that by publique Authority it were so
ordered, that no man should ever preach or print this Doctrine that
Faith alone justifies, unlesse he joynes this together with it, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
obedience is necessary to salvation. And besides that those
Chapters of S. <hi>Paul</hi> which intreat of justification by faith, without the
works of the Law, were never read in the Church, but when the 13.
Chap. of the 1. Epist. to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> concerning the absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Charity should be, to prevent misprision, read together with
them.</p>
               <p>33 Whereas you say, that <hi>some Protestants doe expresly affirme the
former point to be the soule of the Church, &amp;c. and that therefore they
must want the Theologicall vertue of Hope, and that none can have true
hope, while they hope to be saved in their Communion.</hi> I Ans. They have
great reason to believe the Doctrine of Iustification by faith only, a
Point of great weight and importance, if it be rightly understood: that
is, they have reason to esteeme it a principall and necessary duty of a
Christian, to place his hope of justification and salvation, not in the
perfection of his own righteousnesse (which if it be imperfect will
not justify,) but only in the mercies of God through Christs satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
and yet notwithstanding this, nay the rather for this, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
themselves in the right temper of good Christians, which is a
happy mixture and sweet composition of confidence and feare. If this
Doctrine be otherwise expounded then I have here expounded, I will
not undertake the justification of it, only I will say (that which I may
doe truly) that I never knew any Protestant such a soli-fidian, but
that he did believe these divine truths; <hi>That he must make his calling
certain by good workes: That he must work out his salvation with Fear
and Trembling, and that while he does not so, he can have no well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
hope of Salvation:</hi> I say I never met with any who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
these divine Truths, and that with a more firme, and a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken
assent, then he does that himselfe is predestinate, and that he is
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:7615:220"/>
justified by believing himselfe justified. I never met with any such,
who if he saw there were a necessity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> doe either, would not rather
forgoe his beliefe of these Doctrines then the former: these which he
sees disputed and contradicted and opposed with a great multitude of
very potent Arguments; then those, which being the expresse words
of Scripture, whosoever should call into question, could not with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
modesty pretend to the title of Christian. And therefore there is no
reason but we may believe, that their full assurance of the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
doth very well qualify their perswasion of the latter, and that
the former (as also the lives of many of them doe sufficiently testify)
are more effectuall to temper their hope, and to keep it at a stay of a
filiall and modest assurance of Gods favour, built upon the conscience
of his love and fear, then the latter can be to swell and puffe them up
into vain confidence and ungrounded presumption. This reason,
joyn'd with our experience of the honest and religious conversation
of many men of this opinion, is a sufficient ground for Charity, to hope
well of their hope: and to assure our selves that it cannot be offensive,
but rather most acceptable to God, if notwithstanding this diversity
of opinion, we embrace each other with the strict embraces of love &amp;
communion. To you and your Church we leave it, to separate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
from the Church, and to proscribe them from heaven upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall
and trifling causes: As for our selves, we conceive a charitable
judgement of our Brethren and their errors, though untrue, much
more pleasing to God then a true judgement, if it be uncharitable; and
and therefore shall alwaies choose (if we doe erre) to erre on the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and more mercifull part, and rather to retain those in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
which deserve to be ejected, then eject those that deserve to
be retain'd.</p>
               <p>34 Lastly, whereas you say, that <hi>seeing Protestants differ about
the point of Iustification, you must needs inferre that they want Vnity in
faith, and consequently all faith, and then that they cannot agree what
points are fundamentall;</hi> I Answer, to the first of these inferences, that
as well might you inferre it upon <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of Rome and <hi>Poli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi>
upon <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of Rome and S. <hi>Cyprian:</hi> in as much as it is
indeniably evident, that what one of those esteemed necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
the other esteemed not so. But points of Doctrine (as all other
things) are as they are, and not as they are esteemed: neither can a
necessary point be made unnecessary by being so accounted, nor an
unnecessary point be made necessary by being overvalued. But as the
ancient Philosophers, (whose different opinions about the soule of
man you may read in <hi>Aristotle de Anima,</hi> and <hi>Cicero's Tusculan Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,</hi>)
notwithstanding their divers opinions touching the nature of
the soule, yet all of them had soules, and soules of the same nature: Or
as those Physitians who dispute whether the braine or heart be the
principall part of a man, yet all of them have braines and have hearts,
and herein agree sufficiently: So likewise, though some Protestants
esteeme that Doctrine the soule of the Church, which others doe not
so highly value, yet this hinders not but that which is indeed the soule
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7615:221"/>
of the Church may be in both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of them; and though one account
that a necessary truth which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> account neither necessary nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
true, yet this notwithstanding, in those truths which are truly &amp;
really necessary they may all agree. For no Argument can be more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall
then this; They differ in some points which they esteeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
Therefore they differ in some that indeed and in truth are so.</p>

                  </gap>35 Now as concerning the other inference, <hi>That they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
what points are fundamentall:</hi> I have said and prov'd formerly
that there is no such necessity as you imagin or pretend, that men
should certainly know what is, and what is not fundamentall. They
that believe all things plainly delivered in Scripture, believe all things
fundamentall, and are at sufficient Vnity in matters of faith, though
they cannot precisely and exactly distinguish between what is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
and what is profitable: nay though by error they mistake
some vaine, or perhaps hurtfull opinions for necessary and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Truths.<note place="margin">c. 3. §. 53. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>libi.</note> Besides, I have shewed above, that as Protestants doe not
agree (for you overreach in saying they cannot) touching what points
are fundamentall; so neither doe you agree what points are defin'd &amp;
so to be accounted, and what are not: nay, nor concerning the subject
in which God hath placed this pretended Authority of defining: some
of you setling it in the Pope himselfe, though alone without a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell:
Others in a Councell, though divided from the Pope: Others
only in the conjunction of Councell and Pope: Others not in this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but in the acceptation of the present Church Vniversall: Lastly,
others not attributing it to this neither, but only to the perpetuall
Succession of the Church of all ages: of which divided Company it is
very evident and undeniable, that every former may be and are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to hold many things defin'd and therefore necessary, which
the latter, according to their own grounds, have no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to doe, nay cannot doe so upon any firme
and sure and infallible
foundation.</p>

cause, I am at length through a passage rather tireing
then difficult, arriv'd at the end of my undertaken voyage;
and have, as I suppose, made appear to all dis-interessed
and unprejudicate readers what in the begining I undertook, that a
vein of Sophistry and Calumny runs clean through this first part of
your book: wherein though I never thought of the <hi>directions</hi> you have
been pleas'd to give mee <hi>in your Pamphlet entitled a Direction to N. N.</hi>
yet upon consideration of my answer, I finde that I have proceeded as
if I had had it alwaies before my eyes, and steer'd my course by it as by
a card and compasse.</p>
            <p>For first, <hi>I have not proceeded by a meere destructive way</hi> (as you call
it,) <hi>nor objected such difficulties against your Religion, as upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
tend to the overthrow of all Religion,</hi> but have shewed that the truth
of Christianity is cleerely independent upon the truth of Popery: and
that on the other side, the arguments you urge, and the courses you
take for the maintenance of your Religion, doe manifestly tend (if they
be closely and consequently followed) to the destruction of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and lead men by the hand to Atheisme and impiety; whereof I
have given you ocular demonstrations in divers places of my book,
but especially, in my answer to your direction to N. N.</p>
            <p>Neither can I <hi>discover any repugnance between any one part of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
and any other,</hi> though I have used many more judicious and more
searching eyes then mine owne to make, if it were possible, such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery:
and therefore am in good hope that, though the musicke I
have made be but dull and flat, and even downright plain-song, yet
your curious and criticall eares shall discover no discord in it; but on
the other side, I have charg'd you frequently and very justly, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
contradiction and retractation of your own assertions, and not
seldome of the main grounds you build upon, and the principall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
which you endeavour to maintain: which I conceive my

            <p>And though I did never pretend to defend D. <hi>Potter</hi> absolutely and
in all things, but only so farre as he defends truth; (neither did D.
<hi>Potter</hi> desire me, nor any law of God or man oblige me to defend him
any farther,) yet I doe not finde that I have cause to differ from him in
any matter of moment: particularly, <hi>not concerning the infallibility of
Gods Church,</hi> which I grant with him to be infallible in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
because if it should erre in fundamentalls, it were not the Church:
<hi>Nor concerning the supernaturality of Faith,</hi> which I know &amp; believe as

unto us, but our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> But now if it were demanded
<pb facs="tcp:7615:222"/>
what defence you can make for deserting <hi>Ch. Mistaken</hi> in the main
question disputed between him and D. <hi>Potter, Whether Protestancy,
without a particular repentance and dereliction of it, destroy Salvation,</hi>
whereof I have convinc'd you? I believe your answer would be much

               </gap>amorphosis for his running

            <p>For <hi>Opposing the Articles of the Church of England,</hi> the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I presume, cleeres my book from this imputation.</p>
            <p>And whereas you give me a Caution, <hi>that my grounds destroy not the
belief of diverse Doctrines which all good Christians believe, yea and of
all verities that cannot be prov'd by naturall reason:</hi> I professe syncerely
that I doe not know nor believe, that any ground laid by me in my
whole Book, is any way inconsistent with any one such Doctrine, or
with any verity revealed in the word of God, though neuer so impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
or incomprehensible to Naturall Reason: and if I thought there
were, I would deale with it, as those primitive converts dealt with
their curious Books in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Ep. <hi>of S. Iames, and those other Books which were anciently
controverted, and are now received by the Church of England as Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;</hi>
I am so farre from relying upon any Principles which must (to my
apprehension) bring with them the deniall of the authority of them,
that I my selfe believe them all to be Canonicall.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>overthrowing the Infallibility of all Scripture,</hi> my Book is so
innocent of it, that the Infallibility of Scripture is the chiefest of all
my grounds.</p>
            <p>And lastly for Arguments <hi>tending to prove an impossibility of all Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vine,
Supernaturall, Infallible Faith and Religion,</hi> I assure my self that
if you were ten times more a spider then you are, you could suck no
poyson from them. My heart, I am sure, is innocent of any such inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and the searcher of all hearts knowes that I had no other end in
writing this Book, but to confirm to the uttermost of my ability the
truth of the Divine and Infallible Religion of our dearest Lord and
Saviour Christ Iesus, which I am ready to seale and confirm not
with my arguments only, but my bloud!</p>
            <p>Now these are directions which you have been pleas'd to give
me, whether out of a fear that I might otherwise deviate from them, or
out of a desire to make others think so: But howsoever, I have not, to
my understanding, swarved from them in any thing, which puts me in
good hope that my Answer to this first Part of your Book will give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to you your self indifferent good satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I have also provided, though this were more then I undertook, a
just and punctuall examination and refutation of your <hi>second Part:</hi>
But (if you will give your consent) am resolv'd to suppresse it, and that
for divers sufficient and reasonable considerations.</p>
            <p>First, because the discussion of the Controversies entreated of in the
<hi>first Part</hi> (if we shall think fit to proceed in it, as I for my part shall, so
long as I have truth to reply,) will, I conceive, be sufficient employment
for us, though wee cast off the burden of those many lesser dispu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:7615:222"/>
which remain behind in the Second. And perhaps wee may doe God
and his Church more service by exactly discussing and fully clearing
the truth in these few, then by handling many after a sleight and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory
manner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because the additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Second Part whether for your
purpose or mine is clearly unnecessary: there being no understanding
man Papist or Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estant, but will confesse that (for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the main Question now in agitation, about the saveablenesse of
Protestants) if the first Part of your Book be answered, there needes
no reply to the Second: as on the other side I shall willingly grant, if
I have not answered the First, I cannot answer a great part of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because the addition of the Second not only is unnecessary,
but in effect by your self confess'd to bee so. For in your preamble to
your Second Part you tell us, <hi>That the substance of the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
is handled in the first: and therein also you pretend to have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the chief grounds of D. Potters book:</hi> So that in replying to your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part I shall doe litle else but pursue shadowes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, because your Second Part (setting aside Repetitions and
References) is in a manner made up of disputes about particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which you are very importunate to have forborn, as suspecting, at
least pretending to suspect, that they <hi>were brought in purposely by D.
Potter to dazle the Reader's eyes and distract his mind, that hee might
not see the clearnesse of the reasons brought in defence of the Generall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
delivered in Charity Mistaken.</hi> All which you are likely enough
(if there bee occasion) to say again to mee; and therefore I am resolv'd
for once even to humour you so farre as to keepe my discourse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
those very lists and limits which your self have prescrib'd, and to
deal with you upon no other arguments, but only those wherein you
conceive your chief advantage and principall strength, and, as it were,
your Sampson's lock to lye: wherein if I gain the cause clearly from
you (as I verily hope by Gods help I shall doe) it cannot but redound
much to the honour of the truth maintain'd by me, which by so weak a
Champion can overcome such an <hi>Achilles</hi> for error even in his stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
holds.</p>
            <p>For these reasons, although I have made ready an answer to your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part, and therein have made it sufficiently evident: That for shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
evasions from <hi>D. Potters</hi> arguments; for impertinent cavills, and
frivolous exceptions, and injurious calumnies against him for misal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging
of Authors: For proceeding upon false and ungrounded princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
for making inconsequent and sophisticall deductions, and, in
a word, for all the vertues of an ill answer your Second Part is no way
second to the First. Yet notwithstanding all this anvantage, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
if you will give me leave, either wholly to suppresse it, or at least
to deferre the publication of it, untill I see what exceptions, upon a
twelve-months examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for so long I am well assur'd you have had
it in your hands) you can take at this which is now published, that so if
my grounds bee discovered false I may give over building on them: or
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7615:223"/>
(if it shall be thought fit) build on more securely when it shall appeare
that nothing materiall and of moment is or can bee objected against
them. This I say, upon a supposition that your self will allow these
reasons for satisfying and sufficient, and not repent of the motion
which your self has made, of reducing the Controversy between us
to this short Issue. But in case your mind be altered, upon the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
you shall give mee, that you doe not desire to have it out, your
desire shall prevail with me above all other reasons, and you shall not
fail to receive it with all convenient speed.</p>
            <p>Only that my Answer may be compleat, and that I may have all my
work together, and not be troubled my self, nor enforc'd to trouble
you with after-reckonings, I would first entreat you to make good your
Promise of not <hi>omitting to answer all the particles of D. Potters book,
which may any way import,</hi> and now at least to take notice of some (as it
seemes to me) not unconsiderable passages of it, which between your
first and second Part, as it were betweene two stooles, have beene suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
hitherto to fall to the ground, and not beene vouchsaf'd any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
at all.</p>
            <p>For after this neglectfull fashion you have passed by in silence, First
his discourse, wherein he proves briefly but very effectually, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
may be sav'd, and that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, especially the Iesuits are
very uncharitable. S. 1. p.</hi> 6. 7. 8. 9. Secondly the authorities whereby
he justifies, That <hi>the ancient Fathers, by the Roman understood alwaies
a particular, and never the Catholique Church:</hi> to which purpose he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth
the words of <hi>Ignatius, Ambrose, Innocentius, Celestine, Nicolaus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
S. 1. p.</hi> 10, Whereunto you say nothing, neither doe you infringe his
observation with any one instance to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the greatest and most substantiall part of his answers to
the Arguments of <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> built upon <hi>Deut. 17. Numb. 16.
Mat. 28. 20. Mat.</hi> 18. 17. and in particular many pregnant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Texts of Scripture, quoted in the margent of his book, <hi>p.</hi> 25. to
prove that the Iudges of the Synagogue (whose Infallibility yet you
make an Argument of yours, and therefore must be more credible then
yours) are vainly pretended to have been infallible: but as they were
oblig'd to judg according to the Law, so were obnoxious to deviations
from it. <hi>S. 2. p.</hi> 23. 24. 25. 26. 27.</p>
            <p>Fourthly his discourse wherein hee shewes the difference betweene
the Prayers for the Dead used by the Ancients, and those now in use
in the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the Authority of three Ancient, and above twenty moderne
Doctors of your own Church alleag'd by him, to shew that in their
opinion even Pagans, and therefore much more erring Christians (if
their lives were morally honest) by Gods extraordinary mercy and
Christs merit may be saved. <hi>S. 2. p.</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, a great part of his discourse whereby he declares that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and externall communion with the Church is not of absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to Salvation: nay that those might be saved whom the Church ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refus'd to admit to her Communion. <hi>S. 2. p.</hi> 46. 47. 48. 49.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:7615:223"/>
Seaventhly, his discourse concerning the Churches latitude, which
hath in it a cleare determination of the maine Controversy against
you: For therein he proves plainly, that all appertain <hi>to the Church, who
believe that Iesus</hi> is the Christ the sonne <hi>of God and Saviour of the world
with submission to his Doctrine</hi> in mind and will: which hee irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably
demonstrates by many evident Texts of Scripture containing
the substance of his Assertion even in termes. <hi>S. 4. p.</hi> 114. 115. 116.
117.</p>
            <p>Eightly, that wherein he shewes by many pertinent examples, that
<hi>grosse error and true Faith may bee lodged together in the</hi> same mind:
And that men are not <hi>chargeable with the damnable consequences of
their erroneous opinions. S. 4. p.</hi> 122.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly, a very great part of his Chapter touching</hi> the dissensions of
the Roman Church, <hi>which he shewes (against the pretences of</hi> Charity
Mistaken) to bee no lesse then ours for the importance of the matter, and
the pursuite of them to bee exceedingly uncharitable. S. 6. p. 188. 189.
190. 191. 193. 194. 195. 196. 197.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, his clear refutation and just reprehension of <hi>the Doctrine
of implicite Faith as it is deliver'd by the Doctors of your Church:</hi> which
he proves very consonant to the Doctrine of Heretiques and Infidels,
but evidently repugnant to the word of God. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 201. 202. 203.
204. 205.</p>
            <p>Lastly, his discourse wherein hee shewes that <hi>it is unlawfull for the
Church of after Ages to adde any thing to the Faith of the Apostles:</hi> And
many of his Arguments whereby hee proves that in the <hi>judgment of
the Ancient Church the Apostles Creed was esteem'd a sufficient summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the necessary</hi> Points of simple belief, and a great number of great
authorities, to justifie the Doctrine of the Church of England touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Canon of Scripture, especially the Old Testament. <hi>S. 7. p.</hi> 221,
223. 228. 229.</p>
            <p>All these parts of <hi>Doctor Potter's</hi> book, for reasons best known
to your self, you have dealt with as the Priest and Levite in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
did with the wounded Samaritan, that is, <hi>only look't upon them
and pass'd by:</hi> But now at least when you are admonish't of it, that my
Reply to your second part (if you desire it,) may be perfect, I would
entreat you to take them into your consideration, and to make some
shew of saying something to them, least otherwise the world should
interpret your obstinate silence a plaine confession that you can say
nothing.</p>

            <p>GOod reader, through the Authors necessary absence for some
