            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N a time in Lent <hi>Scogin</hi> conſulted with a Chamber-fellow of his, a Collegioner, &amp; ſaid, How ſhall we do to fare well this Lent? The ſcholler replyed, I cannot tell, for I lacke mony. Nay ſaid <hi>Scogin,</hi> if you will be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by me, we will fare well. The ſcholler anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I will do as you ſhall counſel me. Then <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> ſaid, faine your ſelfe ſicke, &amp; goe to bed, grone and cry out for helpe, and call for me to come vnto you, which was done; and when <hi>Scogin</hi> came to his chamber-fellow he fained himſelfe ſore ſicke. <hi>Scogin</hi> asked how he did? I am ſo ſicke quoth he, that I thinke I ſhal die, then ſaid <hi>Scogin,</hi> bee of good comfort, I ſée no perill of death in you: O ſir, ſaid the ſcholler, you doe not féele the paines that I féele. I pray you ſir, as my truſt is in you, kéepe mée, and go not from m, vntill I am amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for euery Lent is vnto me very euill, vnleſſe that I haue ſome good cheriſhing; as you ſée this little ſickneſſe hath made mée ſo faint and weak, that I cannot ſtand on my legges, and I feare I ſhall pine away: not ſo, ſaid <hi>Scogin,</hi> be of good
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1786:4"/>
chéere, and pull vp your heart, here be of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, which will take the paines to goe to the Eowcers of your place, to entreat them to take care of you. When it was known in the Colledge that <hi>Scogins</hi> chamber-fellow was ſo ſore ſicke, ſome were afraid that it had been the peſtilence, or elſe ſome other infectious ſickneſſe: wherefore <hi>Scogin</hi> was put in truſt both for the keeping, and to doe other neceſſary things for his chamber-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and had euery night the keyes of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery and Buttery deliuered, whereby he prouided for bread &amp; drinke, good ſalt Eeles, ſalt Salmon, &amp; other ſalt fiſhes, ſo they did lack no good cheere, beſides freſh fiſh which came out of the Kitchin.</p>
            <p>This done, the fellowes of the place would that the patients urine ſhould be had to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, to know what manner of ſickneſſe the Patient had. <hi>Scogin</hi> then being afraid that the Phyſitian wold now know that his fellow was not ſicke, ſaid to him, we ſhal be both ſhamed and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Phyſitian ſaid, he that doth owe this water or vrine, is a whole man. Nay, ſaid Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that is not ſo, the man is a ſore ſicke man, &amp; doth breake out about the lips and noſe. Ah ſaid ſhe Phyſitian, a water or vrine is but a ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1786:4"/>
a man may be deceiued in a water: and if he be as you doe ſay, (ſaid the Phyſician to <hi>Scogin)</hi> then hath he a great heat in the liuer, &amp; in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke Yea ſir, ſaid <hi>Scogin</hi> hée doth complaine of his ſtomacke. Then ſaid the Phyſician, you ſhall haue a bill of the Apothecarie, and let him take ſuch medicines as ſhall be there made: Sir, ſaid <hi>Scogin,</hi> it is but a poore ſcholler, and he hath little to ſpend. Then ſaid the Phyſitian, for your ſake it ſhall be but a groat matter: which when he had bought, and brought home, he caſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine into the fire, ſaying to his fellow, I haue deceiued the Phyſician, and now let vs make merry, and fill all the pots in the houſe After this <hi>Scogin</hi> ſhewed the Bowcers and the fellowes, how he was with the Phyſician, and that he had ſent the patient medicines: but for all that, <hi>Scog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> ſaid that the Phyſician cannot tell as yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what infirmity this matter will turne: but ſaid <hi>Scogin,</hi> I feare much the peſtilence, which he ſaid, becauſe none ſhould viſit the patient: this continued vntill that Lent was done, &amp; on maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Thurſday, <hi>Scogin</hi> ſaid to his chamberfellow, we wil make our maundy, and eate &amp; drink with aduantage: be it ſaid the ſcholler. On Maundy thurſday at night they made ſuch chéere, that the ſcholler was drunke. <hi>Scogin</hi> then pulled off all the ſchollers clothes, and laid him ſtark naked on the ruſhes, and ſet a forme ouer him, and ſpread a couerlet ouer it, and ſet vp two fallow candles
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1786:5"/>
in candleſticks ouer him, one at his head, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his feet, and ran from chamber to cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and told the fellowes of the place that his chamberfellow was dead; and they asked of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> if he died of the peſtilence. <hi>Scogin</hi> ſaid no, I pray you go vp and pray for his ſoule, and ſo they did. And when the ſcholler had ſlept his firſt ſleepe, he began to turne himſelfe, and caſt downe the forme and the candles. The fellowes of the houſe ſeeing that Scogin did run firſt out of the chamber, they and all that were in the chamber (one running and tumbling downe on anothers neck) were afraid. The ſcholler ſeeing them run ſo faſt out of the chamber, followed them ſtarke naked; and the fellowes ſeeing him runne after them like a ghoſt, ſome ran into their chambers, and ſome ran into one corner, and ſome into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Scogin</hi> ran into the chamber, to ſee that the candles ſhould doe no harme, and at laſt fetcht vp his chamberfellow, which ran about naked like a mad man, and brought him to bed, for which matter <hi>Scogin</hi> had rebuke.</p>

            <p>AFter this, <hi>Scogin</hi> and his chamber-fellow lacked money, and <hi>Scogin</hi> ſaid, if thou wilt be ruled after me, we will goe to Tame market, where we ſhall ouertake going or comming ſome that driue ſhéepe, now doe as I ſhall tell thee,

and we will get ſome money: and as they went to Tame, they did ſée a man driue ſheepe. Then Scogin ſaid to his fellow, goe thou before, and make bargaine with him, that the ſheepe bee no ſhéepe, but Hogs, and when that thou haſt made a full bargaine, aſke by whom the matter ſhall be tried, and ſay thou, by him that ſhall next ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take vs. The ſcholler did ouertake him that droue the ſheepe, and ſaid, Well ouertaken my friend, from whence haſt thou brought theſe faire hogs? Hogs quoth the fellow, they be ſheepe: ſaid the ſcholler, you begin to ieſt. Nay, ſir, ſaid the fellow, I ſpeake in good earneſt. Art thou in earneſt, ſaid the ſcholler? Thou wilt lay no wager with me to the contrary. Yes by the boke of a pudding, I will lay all the money in my purſe. How much is that, ſaid the ſcholler? The fellow ſaid, I haue two ſhillings. Two ſhillings, ſaid the ſcholler, that is nothing, wilt thou lay halfe thy hogs, and two ſhillings, and I will lay as much againſt it? ſtrike hands, and he that loſeth ſhall pay. Be it, ſayd the fellow. Now ſaid the Scholler, by whom ſhall we be tryed? the fellow ſaid, we ſhal be tried in the towne of Tame. Nay, ſaid the ſcholler, Tame is out of my way, let vs bee tried by him that ſhall next ouertake vs. Be it, ſaid the fellow: by and by <hi>Scogin</hi> did ouertake them, ſaying, well ouertaken good fellowes. Welcome maſter, ſaid the ſcholler and the fellow. Maſter, ſaid the fellow here is a ſcholler of Oxford hath made a bargaine

Alacke good fellow, thou haſt loſt thy bargaine, ſaid <hi>Scogin,</hi> for they bee faire Hogs. Then ſaid the Scholler, giue me my mony, and diuide theſe Hogs, for I muſt haue halfe of them.

Nay, ſaid <hi>Scogin,</hi> I will be indifferent betweene you both, let the Scholler haue the two ſhillings, and take thou the hogs away with thée. The fellow ſaid, bleſſed be the time that euer you were borne: hold Scholler, there is two ſhillings. The fellow was glad he loſt not his hogs, which were ſhéepe.</p>

            <p>VVHen Scogin had broght to Oxford ſuch things as he had in <hi>London,</hi> hee lacked furres for his gownes, and Miniuer furres for his hood. Whereupon hee went to an Alderman in Oxford, which was a Skinner, and ſaid vnto him. It is ſo that I muſt procéed Maſter of Art at the next Act, and I haue beſtowed my money at <hi>London,</hi> and now I haue néed of furres, (as you know) wherefore if I ſhall haue of you as much as ſhall ſerue me, I will content you with thankes.

Then ſaid <hi>Scogin</hi> you ſhal haue them within theſe two dayes, and then I pray you make me a bill what I ſhall pay for euery thing. It ſhall bee done ſaid the Alderman.

At laſt Scogin ſaid; doth the fiſh play? Jack ſaid, would you haue one play without a fellow? Scogin ſaid, Jacke thou ſaiſt truth: put another whiting into the pan. Then Jacke prepared his fiſh to ſeeth them: then Scogin ſaid, Jacke, doth the fiſh play now? Jack ſaid, I trow they be mad or elſe wood, for one doth fight with the other, that I haue much adoe to keepe them in the pan.

            <p>ON a time Scogin did ſend Jacke to Oxford to market, to buy a penny worth of freſh herring. Scogin ſaid, bring foure herrings for a penny, or elſe bring none. Jack could not get four herrings, but three for his penny; and when he came home, <hi>Scogin</hi> ſaid, how many herrings haſt thou brought? and Jacke ſaid, thrée herrings, for I could not get foure for a penny. Scogin ſaid, he would none of them: ſir, ſaid Jacke, then will I, and here is your penny againe. When dinner time was come, then Jack did ſet bread and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before his Maſter, and roſted his herrings, and ſate downe at the lower end of the table, and did eate the herrings. Scogin ſaid, let mee haue one of thy herrings, and thou ſhalt haue another of mee another time. Jacte ſaid, and if you will haue one herring, it ſhall coſt you a penny.
