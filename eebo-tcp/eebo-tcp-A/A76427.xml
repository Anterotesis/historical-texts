            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>IUDGE BARKELY HIS PENITENTIALL COMPLAINT: Wherein he laments the Condition of his preſent Impriſonment, and the late Corruptions of violated and inforced IUSTICE.</head>
            <l>WHat wonder's this, to heare a Terme ſhould be</l>
            <l>Gone off, and yet Vacation ſtill with me?</l>
            <l>That I ſhould owne the leaſure to rehearſe</l>
            <l>My Cauſe to'th Stones, and plead my Griefes in Verſe:</l>
            <l>That I who ballanc'd <hi>Right,</hi> and in her Scale</l>
            <l>Did raiſe or ſinke her to make <hi>Wrong</hi> prevaile,</l>
            <l>Should now lye loſt to Juſtice, and inferre</l>
            <l>My ſelfe an Exile to her Hall and her;</l>
            <l>Should feare her ſentence, and ſhould hide my face</l>
            <l>(Where once I ſate) from her Tribunall place.</l>
            <l>Judgement proves then moſt happy, when the Law</l>
            <l>Of Truth and Goodneſſe doth the Conſcience awe.</l>
            <l>Nor can he quickly into danger fall,</l>
            <l>Who to himſelfe lives a law rationall.</l>
            <l>But when the ſhowes of Honour or of Gaine</l>
            <l>Grow on the heart, and doe corrupt the braine,</l>
            <l>Reaſon doth ſtartle, and th' affections ſtraight</l>
            <l>Prove conquer'd Captives to that golden bait.</l>
            <l>Why ſhould thoſe thicke and glittering ſpangles, that</l>
            <l>Doe dance in glory on the robes of State,</l>
            <l>Trouble the knowing minde to gaze upon</l>
            <l>Their flattering ſplendors, or to put them on?</l>
            <l>But that's not all; for when that fatall Vice</l>
            <l>(That Turke 'mongſt Chriſtians) ſordid Avarice,</l>
            <l>Leads her blacke Army up, and doth begin</l>
            <l>To make the heart an Uſurer to Sin;</l>
            <l>Then Peace, Religion, Safety, Juſtice, all</l>
            <l>Who owne to Grace or Honour, humbled fall</l>
            <l>Before that tyrant Fiend, whoſe irefull doome</l>
            <l>Breathes nought but ruine, rage, and martyrdome,</l>
            <l>Who bribes the Law, and what was made ſo ſtrong</l>
            <l>To ſpeake our <hi>Right,</hi> makes Law to ſpeake it <hi>Wrong.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Theſe were my faults, made happy did they gueſt</l>
            <l>But in one Inne, or lodg'd but in my Breſt:</l>
            <l>But when that Juſtice on her knees ſhall fall</l>
            <l>To beg the Judge to doe her right, and call</l>
            <l>Her ſpotleſſe Ermines to his eye, and wrong'd,</l>
            <l>Deſire that grace to have her Cauſe prolong'd</l>
            <l>Untill ſome happy Parliament ſhould raiſe</l>
            <l>New ſtrength to her unnerved hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and praiſe</l>
            <l>Her faint and labouring pulſes, make her know</l>
            <l>Holds ſhe the Ballance in her hand, or no,</l>
            <l>To lend her eyes, and from their gracious tongues</l>
            <l>Infuſe new breath to her deſpairing lungs,</l>
            <l>When Life and Honour lay upon the ſtake,</l>
            <l>And Juſtice dumbe, while Falſhoods tongue did ake,</l>
            <l>My ſadded bloud ſickens to whay, and while</l>
            <l>That <hi>Right</hi> now laughes, I gratulate her ſmile.</l>
            <l>That Hand of Juſtice which I downe did beare,</l>
            <l>Strikes now repentance through me, which no eare</l>
            <l>Can heare and ſpare no griefes, nor paſſing by</l>
            <l>Can any ſee but with a bleeding eye.</l>
            <l>Let all my Lawes be broken, let the wheele</l>
            <l>Of Fortune ſplit, and her Atturneyes reele.</l>
            <l>It is a glad and happy ſinne would prove</l>
            <l>It ſelfe reform'd to every good mans love:</l>
            <l>Thus much my penitence can doe, but this</l>
            <l>Is good begotten from too much amiſſe.</l>
            <l>Though cold my hopes, and my more ſad affaires</l>
            <l>Doe pull more winter on my ſnow-touch'd haires,</l>
            <l>I now learne Juſtice, patient I learne more</l>
            <l>Then ere her Agent I perform'd before:</l>
            <l>And ſhall decree what ever way ſhe's bent,</l>
            <l>Juſt is my fate, as juſt the Parliament.</l>
