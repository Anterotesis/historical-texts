         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Such an one hath doone but ill, therefore no man can doo wel:
which reason is much like their owne rymes, in condemning
the arte, for the fault of some artificers. For others, that like
well of the thing, but not of my peculier labour herein,
mine aunswere is the same it was: if there were anie penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
appointed for him that would not read, hee might well
complaine of mee that publish it to bee read: But if it bee in
euerie mans choyce to reade it, or not to reade; why then not
in mine also to publish or not to publish it? Hee that will,
let him see and reade; hee that will neither reade nor see, is
<pb facs="tcp:5939:3"/>
neither bound to see nor reade. If anie begin to reade, when
hee beginneth to take no delight, let him leaue off, and go no
further. If he folowe on in reading without pleasure, let
him neither blame mee, that did what I could; nor bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie

               <l>Then with his head half vp, most heauyly groaned <hi>Amyntas,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And as he groan'd, then he felt his feete to the ground to be rooted,</l>

            <l>Left hand arm'd with a bow, and back with a quyuer adorned,</l>
            <l>Right hand held vp her head; her thye was a stay to the right hand:</l>
            <l>Head neuer mouing, eyes euer fixed on one thing,</l>
            <l>Fixed on one yong man sore wounded downe by the sea-shore.</l>
            <l>Sore-wounded yongman now lifted his eyes to the heauens</l>
            <l>Heauily, like to a man that's wak'ned late from a dead sleepe,</l>
            <l>And yet he seemed faire and looked louely for all that;</l>
            <l>And though some bloody spots his face had lately defaced,</l>
            <l>His whitenes by the red more fresh and liuely apeared.</l>
            <l>Sore-wounded yongman for grief now closed his eye-lidds,</l>
            <l>And yet he causd this mayd very steedily stil to behold him,</l>

            <l>Whoe, when he came t'himself, these woords very faintily vttred:</l>
            <l>And art thou yet saulf, thou sweetest soule of a thousand,</l>
            <l>Or by thy death hast thou augmented this bloody slaughter?</l>
            <l>Whether death doe triumph, or whether life be prolonged,</l>
            <l>Whom Loue hath ioyned, noe death shall cause to be seu'red.</l>
            <l>In thee alone doe I ioy, and for thee alone am I liuing,</l>
            <l>On thee alone doe I see my wealth to be wholly depending.</l>
            <l>And thee alone I doe loue, that sweete Nymph quickly replyed,</l>
            <l>On thee alone I relye: therefore was I fully resolued,</l>
            <l>With this knife, loe here, t'haue speedily giu'n mee my deaths-wound</l>

Thus said, lightly she leapt fro the stone; which made the beholders</l>
            <l>Like men lately amazd with a lightning, run to the bushes,</l>
            <l>And there hyde themselues for feare and wonder among them.</l>
            <l>For, standing vpright, this mayde more stately apeared,</l>
            <l>And much more diuine, and farr more lyke to a Goddesse.</l>
            <l>Her shafts on shoulders did clash by her hasty remouing,</l>
            <l>Her gold-wrought garments by the Sun-beames glystred about her,</l>
            <l>And fro the greene garland her fayre hayre sweetly beseeming</l>
            <l>Scattred abroade by the wynde, fell dayntily downe to the gyrdle:</l>
            <l>Which princelyke marching of a mayden greatly apaled</l>
            <l>Those timorous vagabonds, whoe peeping out fro the bushes</l>

            <l>Some said, Sure this Nymph must needs be the mighty <hi>Diana<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi>
            </l>
            <l>Some rather thought her that great <hi>Aegyptian Isis</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whom those men worshipt; and some were flatly resolued</l>
            <l>That some Priest of Gods inspyr'd with fury from heauen</l>
            <l>Had causd that bloodshed; soe euery man was a gessing,</l>
            <l>Noeman gessed aright, noeman came nere to the matter.</l>
            <l>But shee away gan fly, and ran forthwith to the yongman,</l>
            <l>Weeping sore for his hurts, his wounds very daintily wiping,</l>
            <l>Kissing, embracing, pitying, and greatly bewayling</l>
            <l>His late misfortune and griefe; which causd the beholders</l>
            <l>Quickly to change their minde and former opinion alter.</l>
            <l>And are these, said they, such wondrous woorks of a Goddesse?</l>
            <l>What? can a Goddesse kisse, can a Goddesse clip thus a dead-man?</l>
            <l>What? can such loue-tricks and fancies fly to the heauens?</l>
            <l>Nay, then downe lets goe, and see what may bee the matter:</l>
            <l>Soe then downe they goe to behold what might be the matter,</l>
            <l>Goe to the mayde; whoe then this yongmans wounds was a dressing.</l>
            <l>When they came to the mayde, they stopt and staid on a soddaine,</l>
            <l>And not a woord, for life, was there once vttred among them,</l>
            <l>And not a deede, for life, was there attempted among them,</l>
            <l>But like stocks or stones they stoode very ghastly beside her.</l>
            <l>When she beheld the shadoes of men stand rightly before her,</l>
            <l>And perceaued a sound and noyse of somewhat about her;</l>
            <l>Thereat somewhat mou'd, herself shee remoued a litle,</l>
            <l>And lookt back for a while, but againe very speedily stouped</l>
            <l>Downe to the yongmans wounds, and them with care was a dressing,</l>
            <l>Noething troubled at all to behold that company theeuish,</l>
            <l>Which there gapte for a pray, and glistred in armor about her.</l>
            <l>Such is true-loues force, that where it taketh a lyking,</l>

There noe payne is felt, noe pleasure can be regarded</l>

            <l>But when those Rakehells gan march on bowldly before her</l>
            <l>With fowle black visages, making some shew of an onset,</l>
            <l>Vp then againe, poore wench, herself shee began to bee lyfting,</l>
            <l>And thus spake, theyr lookes, and countnance ougly beholding.</l>
            <l>Yf that you be the ghosts of such as lately departed,</l>
            <l>Then doe yee vs greate wrong with such strange sights to molest vs:</l>
            <l>For moste parte of you your selus haue fylthyly murdred,</l>
            <l>And wee for our sauegard, God knowes, were forc't to be fighting</l>
            <l>Syth force and violence were offered vnto my person:</l>
            <l>Yf not ghosts but men, then sure yee bee theeues, as apeareth</l>

            <l>If you cause our death, our death cause griefe to be dying.</l>
            <l>Thus shee bewayld her woe; but alas those barbarus outlawes</l>
            <l>Vnderstood noe woord, noe part of her heauy bewayling;</l>
            <l>But there left them alone as noething lyke to be starting;</l>
            <l>And ran straight to the ship with treasures wished abounding,</l>
            <l>With precious diamonds, gold, syluer, curius arrace</l>
            <l>Cloathes, and finest sylk themselus all heauyly loading,</l>
            <l>Other wares, that were of lesse price, lightly regarding.</l>
            <l>When that enough was brought, and pray pleasd greedy desyring,</l>
            <l>All was caste on a heape, and then they fell to dyuyding</l>
            <l>And parting booties, by the greatenes, not by the goodnes,</l>
            <l>Thincking afterwards, of those poore sowles to determyne,</l>
            <l>Pooreman, poore mayden. But now whilst this was a working,</l>
            <l>Other theeues gan aproach, whose foremen lustyly praunsing</l>
            <l>Were two stout horsemen, resolute, and fram'd for an onset.</l>
            <l>First theeues feare last theeues (one robber robbeth an other)</l>
            <l>Feare, and fly for feare; and leaue theyr booty behynde them,</l>
            <l>Least by a quyck pursuyte theyr pray might chaunce to betray them</l>
            <l>Into the hands of these last theeues, in number abounding,</l>
            <l>They ten, these thrice ten. Now, now that louely <hi>Virago</hi>

            <l>Yet somwhat fearefull (theeues always vse to be fearefull)</l>
            <l>And with wonder amasd (such sight might well be a wonder)</l>
            <l>Paused a whyle, and thought those former theeues to be autors</l>
            <l>Of this fowle outrage: but when they lastly reflected</l>
            <l>Theyr distracted sight to the braue and glorius obiect</l>
            <l>Of sweete Nymph, with strange attyre yet costly adorned,</l>

Stowt-hart Nymph, that styrd not a foote nor feard any danger,</l>

            <l>Constant Nymph, whose eyes, hart, hands were bent to the yongman,</l>
            <l>Louing Nymph, pytying this youngman more then her owneself,</l>
            <l>(And yet most pytyfull, God knows, shee seemed her ownself)</l>
            <l>Theeues themselus, rude theeues were eu'n compeld to be wondring</l>

            <l>Eu'n as hee lay on ground; for now was hee somwhat amended,</l>
            <l>And had strength at length and former beauty recou'red.</l>
            <l>After much gazing, theyr guyde and capten aproaching</l>
            <l>Caught poore mayde by the hande, and bade her for to bee rysing</l>
            <l>And accompany hym: poore mayde surprysde by the capten</l>
            <l>Vnderstood not a woord, (as borne in a contrary countrey)</l>
            <l>And yet gest what hee ment: and cleaued fast to the yongman,</l>
            <l>And held yongman fast, and euery way shee declared;</l>
            <l>Vnles yongman went, shee neuer meant to be going,</l>
            <l>Vnles yongman went, herself shee meant to be murdring,</l>
            <l>And with a knife in her hand to her hart shee begins to be poynting.</l>
            <l>Which when theyre capten (with some compassion harcknyng)</l>
            <l>Partly by her wyld talk perceau'd, but chiefly by gesture,</l>
            <l>And saw this yongman, though wounded, yet to be manly,</l>
            <l>And very lyke to be fitt for some greate noble auenture</l>
            <l>If that he once might chaunce his former strength to recouer,</l>
            <l>Hymself dismounting commaunds his squyre to be lighting,</l>
            <l>And yongman youngmayd to the horses straight to be lyfting,</l>
            <l>Then byds his fellowes take opportunyty offred,</l>
            <l>And make haste after, when spoyles and booty be gathred:</l>
            <l>Himself by theyr sydes stil runs as a page or a lackey,</l>
            <l>Staying wounded-man, weake mayde for feare of a falling.</l>
            <l>Thus was a Lord at last made vassall vnto a vassall,</l>
            <l>Thus was a braue capten made captyue vnto a captyue;</l>

            <l>Ouer a hill to a poole, which there lyes downe in a valley,</l>

            <l>Poole is a trusty refuge which poole-babes strongly protecteth.</l>
