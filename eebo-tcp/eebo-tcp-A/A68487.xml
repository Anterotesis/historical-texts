         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A pleaſant Dittie, of a familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that paſſed betweene certaine Ladies, as they walked abroade into the fields for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation: wherein is prooued, that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is nothing worth, except it be coupled with vertue.</head>
            <opener>This Ditty may be ſung to <hi>A. Munday</hi> his <hi>Toy.</hi>
            </opener>
            <lg>
               <l>IT was my chaunce to walke abroade,</l>
               <l>where Ladies were a ſporting:</l>
               <l>And youthfull yonkers on a row,</l>
               <l>from euery place reſorting.</l>
               <l>And ſitting downe vpon the bancks,</l>
               <l>where Flowers grew full ſwéetlie:</l>
               <l>By one and one they did begin,</l>
               <l>to ſpeake their ſeuerall fancie.</l>
               <l>One did Beautie much commend,</l>
               <l>Saying ſuch a daintie fréende:</l>
               <l>deſerued eſtimation:</l>
               <l>And they that were not Beauties freends,</l>
               <l>Should reape diſhonour for amendes:</l>
               <l>ſooner then commendation.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb facs="tcp:21671:40"/>
               <l>¶The ſecond Lady then replied,</l>
               <l>and ſaid, I like well Beautie:</l>
               <l>If vertue be conioynd therewith,</l>
               <l>it then becomes it fitly.</l>
               <l>For what may better beare the name,</l>
               <l>of Beauties ſoueraigne gracing:</l>
               <l>Then Vertue which ſo decks the ſame,</l>
               <l>there can be no defacing.</l>
               <l>But beauty that's maintaind by pride</l>
               <l>Hath no aſſuraunce to abide,</l>
               <l>but quickly is confounded:</l>
               <l>Let Vertue dwell in Beauties breaſt,</l>
               <l>And then muſt Beautie néeds be bleſt,</l>
               <l>that is ſo ſurely grounded.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶We muſt not name them beautifull,</l>
               <l>which beare a gaye complexion:</l>
               <l>And make no reckoning of their ſtates,</l>
               <l>but liue without diſcretion.</l>
               <l>And wound their honor with diſgrace,</l>
               <l>in companie laſciuious:</l>
               <l>Who onely praiſe their daintie face,</l>
               <l>to worke them treaſon tretcherous.</l>
               <l>Faire beauty liketh none of this,</l>
               <l>That with pure Vertue ioyned is,</l>
               <l>but highly dooth diſdaine it:</l>
               <l>Then let vs name that Woman faire,</l>
               <l>That of her credite hath a care,</l>

               <l>is not to be deſpiſed:</l>
               <l>For Beautie walketh now a daies,</l>
               <l>me thinks too much diſguiſed.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21671:40"/> For they that ſeeme in outward ſhow,</l>
               <l>as Saints in their profeſſion:</l>
               <l>So careleſſe out of courſe doo goe,</l>
               <l>as it is paſt ſuſpition.</l>
               <l>And yet are theſe accounted faire,</l>
               <l>Who dare not looke into the ayre,</l>
               <l>leaſt that the Sun ſhould ſhow them:</l>
               <l>Faire Beautie that is faire indéede,</l>
               <l>Accounts this Beautie as a weede,</l>
               <l>and thinketh ſcorne to know them.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶Me thinks thoſe men are worſe then mad,</l>
               <l>that doo ſo much abaſe them:</l>
               <l>To haue affiance in ſuch Dames,</l>
               <l>whoſe very déedes diſgrace them.</l>
               <l>But ſome ſay men are cauſe of all,</l>
               <l>who flatter them ſo kindly:</l>
               <l>Tuſh, vertuous Women will not fall,</l>
               <l>let men ſpeake nere ſo fréendly.</l>
               <l>With that there fell a ſhowre of raine,</l>

               <l>I would be glad the reſt to heare,</l>
