            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Vncient and noble is the queſtion concernyng the originall of the worlde, and firſte beeginning of all things, Right honorable Baron, which hath not only long tyme and much troubled the wittes of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, but alſo of Chriſtians, &amp; in the end by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diuerſe iudgements of men hath reſted ſo doubtfull, that many graue writers coulde not tell what to determine therin. For amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <hi>Origen,</hi> in his bookes of the beginnings (which bookes aboue the reſidue moſt men do iudge to bee his woorthy woork) and they which after him wrote the <hi>Exame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> are ſo diuided in opinions, that nothing may ſeeme certeinly to bee gathered out of their writinges. But among the Philoſophers, men igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God and his trueth, there is farre more diuerſitie of opinions, ſo that concernyng this matter a man may better gheaſſe than vnderſtand by their doctrine what hee hath to follow. Now touchyng theſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, perhaps there is no ſuch cauſe to wonder at their blindnes in ſo great a matter, and that thei were ſo deepely drowned in darknes, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were deſtitute of Gods woord, that is to ſay, the true light of knowledge. But among Chriſtians ſuche diſoorde and diſagreement cannot with like vprightnes bee excuſed, for that there is but one way of the trueth, wherof they might haue found moſt aſſured groundes in the woord of God, if they had had regard therto. What was tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cauſe of ſo greate diſagreement among the Chriſtians concernyng this matter? Forſooth it was the Heathen Philoſophie, with the preceptes wherof they were not onely then inſtructed and infected, but many alſo of them beeing ſtuffed, bee witched and deceiued therwith, (in reſpect that they aſcribed moſtvnto this art) would graunt and admit nothyng whiche they ſuppoſed to bee repugnant to the principles thereof. And this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif did not onely continue in the tyme of our forefathers, and the firſte
<pb facs="tcp:5427:4"/>
age of the Churche, whiche many hauing learned in the ſchooles of the Philoſophers euen in their tender yeeres, and afterward beeing conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the faith of Chriſt, could not eaſily lay doune and chaunge thoſe opinions whiche they had receiued beefore, and of long tyme moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly embraced. Yea now, ſince the name of the Philoſophers is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, it cannot bee plucked out of the minds of many that would bee called Chriſtians: ſo deepely forſooth the admiration and reuerence of this Heathen Philoſophie is imprinted within the mindes of ſome men, and of ſo great a force it is, as the Prouerbe fayeth, in tender youth, and as it were with the Mothers milke, to accuſtome a mans ſelf vnto er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as it were vnto the preceptes of trueth. And therefore I doe not doubt, but that this my woorke concerning Chriſtian Naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, that is to ſay, how to refourme the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Philoſophers by the woord of God, ſhalbee reprooued of many, and therfore hath need of ſome noble and great perſonage, that is welbecloued among all eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, to bee patrone vnto it, by whoſe auctoritie beeing defended, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, it may ſafely and acceptably come abroade into mens hands to bee read. You only, right honorable, are hee vnto whoſe name therefore I dedicate the ſame, how far ſoeuer I bee diſioyned from you by diſtance of place. And as for your honour, there wanteth nothyng in you, that may ſuffice to diſcomfite the force of all enemies, if ſo bee that you can well like of this woork, and doe accept it vnto your protection. For if it might pleaſe you to oppoſe that ſame your moſte ſingulare and true Chriſtian godlines of minde, againſt the old and ſtubburne crue of heathen men concerning this part of Philoſophie, in reſpect that you do ſyncerely and purely woorſhippe God by direction of his vndoubted woord, weighyng and examinyng euery thing accordyng to that as a moſt certeine rule: there is no man that doubteth but that there is more credite to be giuen vnto your iudgement, than to all the rabble of thoſe blind Philoſophers. But as touching other, I will obiect your greate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and auctoritie for a ſhielde beetweene them and mee for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whiche auctoritie of yours beeyng by you purchaſed in the ſight of all men by meanes of infinite benefites by you beeſtowed vpon the Churches of <hi>Boheme</hi> and <hi>Morauia,</hi> is farre and wide renouined in the mouthes of all people, and knowne vnto thoſe nations that know not your perſon: whiche alſo is eaſily able by the excellencie thereof to put
<pb facs="tcp:5427:4"/>
to ſilence the ſlaunderous tongues of certein light perſons. And whereas all men whiche know you, doe graunt and confeſſe, that I doe not falſly attribute theſe prayſes vnto you, then your moſte noble Sunne, and no leſſe heire to your vertues, than ſucceſſour to your goodes, <hi>Iohn George,</hi> prooueth and declareth the ſame. VVho both of hys owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination, and by the inſtruction and diligence of the right lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly man <hi>Vuenceſlaus Lauanus</hi> his ſcholemaſter, beeyng the expreſſe patterne and image of your vertue, how greate the ſame vertues bee in you, may bee by euery man eaſily perceiued. And truely, all wee that liue heere, profeſſe that wee are mutch beeholden vnto you for this cauſe, for that you haue giuen vs a pleadge of youre ſingulare loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, namely your Sunne, at whoſe handes wee expect all good things. And in that you would haue this notable teſtimony of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Churches with ours in the true and auncient fayth, to bee extant in the ſight of all men: which that it may continually ſo remaine, and neuer bee broken of through any contention amongeſt men, wee ceaſe not to make our prayers to Almightie God. And that ſame deſire whiche is in you to deſerue well of all nations bee they neuer ſo farre of, is not only a ſingulare vertue, but alſo moſt worthy of a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which aboue all other is moſt familiar and proper vnto you. And although you doe farre excell in nobilitie of birthe, as deſcendyng from the moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient houſe of the <hi>Nachoſij</hi> (whom I ſuppoſe to bee the onely remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the moſte renoumed ſtock of the <hi>Nariſci</hi>) and alſo of the moſte ſtout and martiall family of the <hi>Moranians</hi> (who are ſucceſſours to the people called <hi>Marcomanni,</hi> that were ſumtyme fearefull enemies to the Romanes, yea when they were in their moſt floriſhyng ſtate) amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whom you enioye very large poſſeſſions: notwithſtanding your greate humanitie and gentlenes which is vnto you a peculiare vertue, ſhal farre more excellently aduaunce your name among al ages. And as touchyng my booke, I had rather it were knowne by the effect it ſelfe, than by my report, what and how greate the commoditie thereof is. How beeit this will I ſay in fewe woordes, that therein I haue breifly comprehended whatſoeuer I coulde reade to haue binne diſputed by the auncient and holy Fathers, either againſt the Philoſophers, or Heretikes: and that I haue not intermingled any queſtion which they haue not handled bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: neither haue omitted any thing whiche ſeemed might ſtande in

ſteede towardes the vnderſtanding of their writinges. Wherein I will plainly confeſſe vnto you, I haue not ſo mutch ſtudied to ſatiſfie the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of curious perſons, as to aduaunce the commoditie of ſtudious young men. And therfore I hope it will come to paſſe, that your honours moſte noble Sunne the <hi>Lord Iohn,</hi> with other young Princes, beeyng mooued by your auctoritie, will follow ſutch kindes of ſtudies whiche they ſhall perceiue to bee acceptable, and that woorthily, vnto ſo greate eſtates.

                  <p>Yea, manifolde. But that I may not run ouer them all, for thei are almoſte infinite I wil alledge fiue onely.

All theſe thinges are copiouſly declared there, which are the peculiar ſubiect &amp; matter of the Art of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie. Wherefore Naturall Philoſophie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in holy ſcripture.

But, as it is to bee graunted that hee ſpake ſimply, ſo can it not bee prooued that hee ſpake or wrote lyingly, falſely, and ignorantly of thoſe thinges. It is one thing therfore, to acknowledg that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtile is bare &amp; ſimple, which kinde of vtterau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is meet for the truth: and another thing to ſay that hee is a falſe man and a lyar: which no man can affirme, but whoſo is of a corrupt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                  <p>Firſte, the Chriſtian Philoſophers doe both alledge ſuche cauſes as are true, and alſo far other than thei do. For, who will doubt, but that thei alledge ſuche as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5427:16"/>
bee true, ſince thei receiue them and learne them out of the fountaine of Truthe, that is to ſaie, the woorde of God? And that thei make farre other cauſes, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations and diſcourſes of them bothe doe ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly declare. For wee profeſſe, teache, and acknowledge that God himſelfe is the firſt, and efficient cauſe of al thinges: moreouer, wee haue a ſpeciall reſpecte vnto his voyce and commaundement as a moſte mightie cauſe, whereby a certaine peculiare force is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery thinge which is the cheifeſt and moſte princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe of all other, that wee can poſſibly thinke of or imagine in our minde. Thirdely, wee make for one cauſe, that force and vertue whiche GOD hath alotted and ingraffed in all things: howbeit the ſame to bee onely a ſeconde and an inſtrumental cauſe, and not woorking of it ſelfe, as <hi>Eſay</hi> teacheth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 44. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the 3. and 4. verſe: not principally but depending wholy vpon another, to wit y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> power &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of GOD, without which God woorketh the ſame effectes, when him pleaſeth, which hee is wont to do by meanes thereof. So, when a Hen ſitteth vppon egges out of which afterwarde chicken are hatched, what is ſhe other than Gods bare inſtrument, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſhee frameth neither the harte, nor heade, nor feete of hir chick within the ſhell, wherein it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, but onely keepeth it, and warmeth it? So, when a woman is with childe, doeth ſhee faſhion hir babe with hir owne handes, whiche afterwarde ſhee bringeth foorth into the world? No ſurely: but is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it were, the receiuer, nouriſher, and keeper of the ſeede which the man caſteth foorth into hir. For God, and the power and ſownd of theſe woordes, <hi>Increaſe</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:5427:17"/>
                     <hi>yee, and multiplye, and fill the earth</hi> which as yet are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall force, doe frame the infant within the woman, facion it, and bringe it foorth. The Philoſophers doe not acknowledge this cauſe. For they holde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that this force and vertue which was giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were created, is the firſt cauſe of all things. So that they place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effected cauſe in ſteed of the efficient, and the inſtrumentall, for the agent: which is a verie foule errour in a Naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. Againe, in that they do not ſubmit the capacitie of mans wit, which in deede is very ſimple, vnto the vnſearcheable wiſdome of GOD, but rather make God ſubiect to them and to their capacitie, they deuiſe and dreame of the cauſes of all thinges and their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, accordinge to the imagination of their owne braine, likeninge GOD hymſelfe the incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woorkeman, vnto ſome Smith or Carpenter: &amp; alſo that the matter wherof hee made all things was before prepared and made readie vnto his hand, from euerlaſting: and at the length, that the forme ioyneth it ſelfe vnto this matter, (for according to their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this matter is rude and without forme) and ſo they conclude, that this matter and forme is the firſt principle of naturall things, which compariſon of moſt vnlike thinges togither, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily laugheth at, and reiceteth, which as it thinketh nothinge honourably of God, ſo doeth it alſo repugne playnely againſt the trueth of the matter, and the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this worlde.</p>

                  <p>Uerily, there is not one onely meane of defininge, and determininge of all the partes therof. For thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which in this art and knowledge wee learne out of Gods woorde, are moſt ſure &amp; moſt true, as groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon a moſt certaine foundation, whiche, whoſo will gainſay, wee muſt deale no farther with him, but giue him quite ouer. But whatſoeuer other things are recited touching Naturall Philoſophie, they are not ſo ſure and firme, bycauſe they bee onely eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by mans ſence, and reaſon: which two thinges, are no vndoubted, and aſſured groundes. For mans reaſon is many times: and his ſenſes are moſt times deceiued. Wherefore, they doe thincke well, who will haue the foundation of that knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie which is not learned out of Gods word, chiefly to reſte vpon theſe two grounds, to wit, mans coniecture, and hiſtoricall experience: in whiche two poyntes alſo, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth in the 9. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>Enchiridion, <hi>Naturall Philoſophers doe ſuppoſe more, than they knowe.</hi>

                  <p>Bicauſe GOD hath not giuen thoſe two partes of iudgement vnto men in vaine: to wit, reaſon of the minde, and ſenſe of the body, as wee bee taught in the 12. Chapter of <hi>Iob,</hi> the 12 verſe, and 34. chapter, and 3. verſe: the iudgement of both which, althoughe it bee not moſt certaine in al things, and ſuffeciently ſubtile and expacte: yet is it not lyinge, and deceiued in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinges. So that all handlinge of matters, which is eſtabliſhed and confirmed vppon thoſe twaine, ought not to bee condemned as altogither vaine and falſe. For who will ſaye that the knowledge of ſo manye notable things and artes is worthily to bee diſpiſed, which GOD, beſydes the Scripture of his woorde, hath giuen vnto men, yea vnto Ethnickes? ſuche as <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Galene,</hi> and many other Philoſophers, both auncient, and of later tymes, haue founde out, and taught.

                  <p>Theſe two ought to bee the endes. The firſt is, that accordinge to S. <hi>Paules</hi> aduertiſement, whatſoeuer ſhall bee diſputed of in this kinde of ſcience, all maye bee referred to the onely glory, and knowledge of our great and good God. For that is the chiefeſt and trueſt ende of humaine Philoſophie, that through it, wee may attaine to the vnderſtandinge of the trueth, and the nature of GOD, like as alſo <hi>Plutarch</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. The ſeconde is, that wee folow not, and affirme vncerteine thinges in the ſteede of certeine. For ſince to erre and bee deceiued is alwayes ſhamefull, then it is moſt ſhamefull to erre in thoſe thinges which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes are of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and in which a man maye honeſtly and ſittingly enough for him, confeſſe that hee is ignorant. Wherfore, in my iudgement, S <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid very well in his bookes <hi>de Geneſiad Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> vpon Geneſis accordinge to the letter, <hi>There bee manye things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of this vniuerſall creature which wee know not, either bicauſe they bee higher in heauen than our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is able to attaine vnto them, or perhaps are in vnhabitable regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth: or lie hidden very low in the bottom of the deap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes.</hi> And this raſſhnes in pronouncinge certainely of vncertaine things, hath miniſtred occaſion that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Philoſophers haue beene mocked by many, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Since then, neyther God, neither the Angels, doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the Naturall Philoſophers, and to this our preſent diſputation: it remaineth, that the matter of this knowledge and ſcience bee ſaide properly to be that creature which may bee ſeene, and hath a place as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh, and hath a body, and is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte vnto our ſenſes, all, or ſome of them.</p>

                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>But the Philoſophers, almoſt all of them, are of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other opinion: For they thinke that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubiect &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:5427:21"/>
of this Art, is that thing which is mouable in that reſpecte that it is Moueable, not in reſpecte that it is created, or ſubiect vnto our ſight.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true. But therein they erre doubly. The fyrſte errour is, that foraſmuch as the ſignification of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is verie large, accordinge to their owne opinion, that it may alſo bee extended to the Angels, ſince ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye times alſo they moue from place to place at Gods commaundement, and indeede are fallen from theire fyrſt originall, (hauinge ſuffered no ſmall chaunge not onely of their place, but alſo of theyr nature:) ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diſputation concerninge them were a parte &amp; that proper of the ſcience of Naturall Philoſophie, which notwithſtandinge they doe very ſtoutly, and that alſo verily &amp; in deed dency. And this is theyr firſt erroure. The ſecond is that the knowledge of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philoſophie doth not beelonge vnto the thynges which wee ſee, if ſo bee any of them bee vnmouable, as thinges that neither periſhe nor are changed. Which, ſince it hath hapned vnto man for ſinne after his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; perfect nature: truely, according to their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither ſhould ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before hee had ſinned, for the moſt part of him haue ben a ſubiect of natural Philoſophie, neither ſhoulde the treatie of him haue appertayned to Naturall Philoſophie. Which thing, howe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true it is, it appeareth out of the ſayinge of S. <hi>Paule:</hi> who will haue althings that may bee ſeene with our eies, to belong to this our knowledge, &amp; to the ſcience of Naturall Philoſophie, and to bee a ready and apte meane and degree, to the knowledge of GOD. It appeareth alſo by the ſame place, that the nature of man, while hee was pure and had not yet ſinned, is by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5427:21"/>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> reckoned amonge Naturall thinges. It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth moreouer, out of ſundrie Pſalmes, that Man and the nature of man, as it was firſt created by God is moſt truely numbred among the kindes of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges: as in the 8. and 104. and 139. Pſalmes. the 13. 15. and 16. verſes: and alſo in the 148. Pſalme. To conclude, they that make <hi>The mouable bodye</hi> to bee the ſubiect of this ſcience, what other thinge go they about, but to teache that there bee two ſubiectes of one Art, to wit, the bodie, and his motion? when as indeede one arte ought to haue but one ſubiect.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then doe Naturall Philoſophers define and determine thoſe thinges which they call Naturall by Motion eſpecially?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Firſt, bicauſe al their knowledge is gathered, as they tearme it, from that which is latter, not from that which is fyrſt. For things then began to bee knowne when they were once extant, and by meanes of mans tranſgreſſion were made mortall, that is to ſaie, were by GOD appointed vnto miſerie and deſtruction. For when they were deſtitute of Gods woorde and light, they perceiued not nor ſaw, what manner ones they were firſt created. Wherefore, when they began to bee buſied in theſe naturall things which are now corrupted, they perceiued their great and perpetuall chaunges, ebbinge and flowinge, and inconſtancie in abidinge in one eſtate, and they iudged that Natural things ſhould bee ſuppoſed of accordinge to that their owne condition. Moreouer, ſeeing that Motion and chaunge may moſt eaſilie and generally bee noted in all theſe things which wee ſee, and which are in this worlde: it was an eaſie matter to diſtinguiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb facs="tcp:5427:22"/>
Naturall thinges by their motion. There is motion truely in all naturall thinges, and alſo in other which are not Naturall, as in Angels: where by it cummeth to paſſe, that Natural thinges cannot properly bee ſeparated and diſcerned from things not Naturall by Motion.</p>

                  <p>Bicauſe, foraſmuch as God hath created two chiefe kindes of thinges to his owne glorie, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teacheth verie often, the one is viſible thinges, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is inuiſible, which is to bee ſeene in the 1. chapter of Geneſis, <hi>Moſes</hi> in his treatice of Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended and handled but one kinde, to wit, of viſible thinges onely, and thoſe things one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly doth the Scripture acknowledge for the Natural thinges. Wherefore Naturall thinges are to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, as wee haue ſaide, in that they bee viſible. As for inuiſible thinges, and ſuch as cannot bee ſeene, whether they moue or moue not, they are reuoked &amp; reduced to another kinde of Art as thinges that are not Naturall. And to confirme this my ſayinge, I coulde alleage the aucthorities almoſt infinite of the auncient Fathers, S. <hi>Baſile.</hi> S. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but what ſhoulde that neede in ſo euident a matter?</p>

                  <p>It is euerie thinge which is neither of it ſelfe, neither hath bene euer, but was once made, yea and that by GOD. Thus doe the learned ſaye, and that true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my iudgement.</p>

                  <p>But S. <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> the 8. Chapter, and 20. verſe, ſeemeth to haue taught otherwiſe, to wite, <hi>that a creature is that thinge which is ſubiect to vanitie, corruption, and ſeruitude by reaſon of ſinne:</hi> which deffinition alſo S. <hi>Hillarius</hi> followeth in his booke of the Trinitie.</p>

                  <p>You remember it well. Howbeit S. <hi>Paule</hi> doeth not in that place define what a creature is generally, and of it ſelfe, but what it is now after ſinne, and ſo farre foorth as was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſarie for the argument which hee had in hande. Wherfore, hee had reſpect then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one kinde of creatures onely: Neither doth Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> define a creature by it owne true nature, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the qualitie and accident which indeede is in it, and which hapned vnto things after they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is to ſay, after they were once made creaturs, but as hauinge nowe loſt their full and perfect nature in parte, by reaſon of mans tranſgreſſion. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may bee anſwered vnto him, whoſo ſhall obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs the ſayinge of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Felicianus,</hi> the 7. chap. <hi>A creature is the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of euery corruptible thinge, made by the will of God, out of that which is not yet, or was not ſumtime, ſo far as the nature of the thing wil permit.</hi>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea verily: For neither ſhould the bleſſed Angels bee truely called creatures, neither wee our ſelues, (if ſo bee that <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in his firſt ſtate of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie) haue bene truely tearmed creatures, if the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter definitions were reteined: for wee ſhoulde haue beene incorruptible, and without all vanitie. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the fleſhe of our Lorde Jeſus Chriſte ſhoulde not rightly be called a creature, as it is oftentimes called by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the trueth it ſelfe beareth record, that it was a creature. For of it owne ſelfe it might haue beene voide of all infirmitie, bycauſe it was free from ſinne and corruption, neither was it ſubiecte to death for it owne ſinne: although notwithſtandinge wee confeſſe, that Chriſt died in the fleaſh. Wherfore, whoſoeuer ſtubburnly impugneth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whiche wee ſay, ſhall fall into all maner of abſurdities. So that thys which wee haue alreadie alleaged, and which wee fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in this place, is the moſt true and ample defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this woorde, creature.</p>

                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>Nowe then by your definition, is that to bee called a creature, I meane the eſſence of the thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and alſo their vertues and properties, togither with their accidents? as for example, in a man ther is a certayne eſſence, which conſiſteth in the body and ſoule: there is in him alſo a vertue &amp; property where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee reaſoneth, woorketh, feeleth, mooueth &amp; wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. There are moreouer certeine accidentes which are exiſtinge and vnſeperable partes in euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare man, whiche doo diſtinguiſh &amp; ſeparate the ſame
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5427:23"/>
man, makinge hym to differ from other particulare perſons of the ſame kinde, whiche in the Schooles are called indiuiduall Conditions. Theſe are alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and exiſting partes vnto the ſame particulare perſons whereby they liue, as place, time, coloure of the face, ſtature of the body, with other ſuch like: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their eſſence, Logicians call accidents. Wherefore I demaund this queſtion of you, whether you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſe vnder the name of a creature, thoſe three kindes of thinges, to wit, the eſſence of the thing, the propertie, and accident, which, as you ſee, are diſtince one from another?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea truely. For whatſoeuer was by GOD firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed within thinges, or by courſe of nature is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto them, or whatſoeuer was by him created in this great vniuerſalitie of all thinges, whether it bee a ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or called an accident, I tearme a creature. Although <hi>Moſes</hi> haue onely or ſpecially handled and entreated of thoſe kindes of thinges whiche are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſo in deede are called, which onely I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe principally and of them ſelues to belong to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Philoſopher. And whatſoeuer hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from him, but is made by the art of man, or by him wrought, or by his miſcheiuous or peruerſe will added, that I call not a creature of GOD, no not a creature at all. For there can bee no creature, but that which is made by God, who is the onely creator.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, the handie woorkes of men, their deuiſes and inuentions, which ſometime are very excellent, ſhall not beelong vnto this arte: no not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſinne of man, but by accident, and in reſpect that by meanes thereof ther is a great alteration wrought in the fyrſt &amp; pure
<pb facs="tcp:5427:24"/>
nature of thinges, which at this preſent appeareth in all thinges, but ſpecially in man, who is the moſt beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull woorke of God.</p>

                  <p>Theſe thinges I vnderſtande. But what meane you by this woorde viſible, when you ſaye a viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was the ſubiect of Naturall Philoſophie?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Not that onely which maye bee comprehended by the ſenſe of the eies, as are ſubſtance, light, and coloure, (although this woord viſible ſeeme properly to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame,) but what ſo euer elſe may bee knowne and perceiued by anye other ſenſe of the bodie, as by feelinge, hearinge, ſmellinge, and taſtinge: as ſmell, ſounde, ſweete, or ſoure, &amp;c. And all bodily thinges are eſpecially tearmed viſible, for that our ſight is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt certaine, moſt excellent, and moſt noble of all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our bodie: and for that alſo the actions of euery lyuinge thinge, and the argumentes whereby we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them to bee aliue, are chiefly gathered by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſence of ſeeinge, as moouing, and breathinge. Finally, that bodily thinges are more exactly diſcerned by the eye, than by taſtinge or hearinge: ſo that to ſaye, that a viſible creature is the matter and ſubiect of Naturall Philoſophie, is as much as to meane, that wee wold haue euery creature whiche is ſenſible of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be the true &amp; proper obiect therof: whether the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5427:24"/>
ſame be bodies, as are the ſubſtaunces of thinges: or whether they bee not bodies, as are the vertues, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, qualities, motions and actions, which vnto all corporall thinges by nature and their firſt creation and beeginning either cleaue vnto them without, or are engraffed in them within.

                  <p>In that the Scripture many tymes reciteth vnto vs all thinges created and viſible, vnder the name of the world: as in <hi>Iſay</hi> the 38. chapter, and 11. verſe: <hi>Iohn</hi> the 1. chapter, the 9. verſe; and the 9. chap. the 39. verſe. And many tymes the Scripture reciteth them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and ſeuerally, thereby the more to ſet foorth the wounderfull wiſedome of God, as in the 104. and 147. <hi>Plalmes,</hi> and 8. verſe, and the 149. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> Wherfore wee muſte alſo entreate of them after both theſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that ſutch thinges as may bee gathered &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of theſe creatures apperteinyng to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and ſetting foorth of his glorie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Scripture teacheth, may bee by vs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

                  <p>Firſt, for aſmutch as when the holie Scripture doeth diligently reckon vp the ſpecial viſible works of God, wherein his maieſtie and omnipotencie may eaſilye bee perceiued, hee maketh mention of this one worlde only, and not of any other. Whiche if there had bine many, doubtleſſe hee would haue made mention of them. For that poinct had made verie mutch to the ſettyng foorth of Gods glorie, and power. Moreouer, what is their ſtate, order, condition, fall, conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Sauiour and Jeſus: what likewiſe is their life euerlaſting, and from whence commeth the ſaluation of this ſecond or third world, it is no where declared, neither in what ſort theſe other worldes were made and created: but al theſe thinges are expreſſed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng this one onely. Wherefore, it muſt needes bee, either that thoſe worldes were made by ſome other God, or that they came of themſelues, both whiche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions are plainly blaſphemous. Or if they bee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſame God by whiche this was whiche wee dwell in, why doeth the Scripture ſpeake nothing of it? Surely there can bee no probable reaſon alleaged of ſo enuious and daungerous ſilence. And therefore it came to paſſe, that the auncient fathers in fore time did verie well thinke and gather that there is but one God, bicauſe there is but one worlde, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe that there is but one worlde, bicauſe there is but one God. Moreouer, all this framing of manye and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie worldes, how fooliſh and childiſhe is it? For why ſhould God make many worldes, ſince hee might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend althing more commodiouſlie in one, and the ſame beeyng of ſo greate receite, whiche hee ment to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5427:31"/>
comprehende in thoſe diuerſe and ſundrye worldes? But, as it is commonly and truely ſayd, <hi>God and Nature make nothyng in vaine,</hi> and that is vainlye and raſhlye doone by moe things which may bee doone by fewer. For admit that GOD had created moe in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, thoſe worldes ſhoulde differ in number onely, and not in kinde or likeneſſe. What neede hee then to create one maner of thing ſo often? To conclude, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſelfe ſame Scripture oftentymes addeth the <hi>Greek</hi> article <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, when it ſpeaketh of the world, the auctoritie of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 1. chap. and 10. verſe witneſſeth, that there are not many, but one onely, and that a certeine one. For the article whiche is ioyned vnto it, doeth ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie a certeine and ſure thing. But if wee graunte that there bee manie worldes, euen by the very ſame reaſon wee muſt confeſſe, that they are in number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. I let paſſe thoſe abſurdities whiche notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doe neceſſarily followe, to wit, that neuer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wee ſhould haue any Eclipſes of the Sunne or Moone. Yea, wee ſhould neuer haue night, ſince one Sunne or another of one of the other worlds, ſhould either riſe vnto vs when ours goeth downe, or elſe ſhould ſhine in the middes of Heauen, when ours is ſhadowed, and in the Eclipſe.</p>

                  <p>Truely, not by reaſon of any impotencie, or lacke of power: ſince that hee is omnipotente. Not that hys ſenſes were exhauſted in the framinge of ſo huge a mole, or his ſtrength weried: for hee made althinge with his woord onely, as it appeareth in the 33. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> Not alſo that it happened ſo for wante of matter, as the <hi>Peripatetikes</hi> ſuppoſe, for that all the matter that
<pb facs="tcp:5427:32"/>
was prepared was ſpent in makinge of the bodie of ſo great a frame. For hee that coulde firſte make thys ſo great a worlde of nothing, coulde, if hee had luſted, haue prepared matter for him ſelfe to make infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worlds of.

For euery ſheepe, euery horſe, euery tree, euery particulare ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a part of this world: yet are they ſo deuided by place &amp; mole of body, and by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription of diſtance, that it cannot bee ſaide, that all and euerye one of theſe haue one ſoule onely. For what would come to paſſe, if it were imagined that in deed there were one onely ſoule, and ſpirite in all theſe thinges? For ſooth this abſurditie: That the ſoule, which is a certein ſimple nature and altogither ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, were to be diuided as bodily things are, and not by imagination onely. Neither can this inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce bee auoyded, ſeeinge that thoſe thinges in which that onely and ſingulare ſoule is conteined are in truth ſeparate and diuided by place, and determined euerye one of them by circumſcription of their owne bodye. Moreouer, it ſhoulde folowe that all the partes of the world had life, as the Sunne, the moone, the ſtarres, the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe, yea &amp; all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> celeſtial bodies which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> moſte plainely denieth in hys booke againſt <hi>Priſcillia</hi> the 8. 9.

Finally, ſince of the par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes of the worlde, ſome bee mortall, as brute beaſtes:
<pb facs="tcp:5427:35"/>
and certeine immortall, as men: howe can it bee that this ſingulare and one onely ſoule of the whole world, can admit in it ſelfe qualities and conditions ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie and repugnaunt one to an other, that it ſhoulde bee one parte of it mortall, and another immortall? ſpecially beeing it ſelfe ſingulare, one, and ſimple: not double, and compounded. Moreouer, amonge ſuch thinges as die, ſomeperyſhe verie ſoone, as wormes, and flies: ſome continue verie long, as Ceder trees, the Crowe, and the Heart: by this reckonyng it cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that this ſoule of the world, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in theſe mens opinion is onely one, and in number ſingulare and a lone, may bee called part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, and partly a liue.

                  <p>If then, there bee not one certeine ſoule of this whole vniuerſalitie, as you teache, truely the opinion of the <hi>Stoikes, Platonikes,</hi> and of certeine other Philoſophers: and likewiſe of the <hi>Priſcillianiſt</hi> Heretikes is ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: who ſay, <hi>that this worlde is a liuyng creature: and indued with will and reaſon.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe foure. Firſt the voyce and auctoritie of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Scripture, whiche ſpeaketh in this maner: <hi>In the beeginnyng God made heauen and earth: <hi>Geneſis</hi>
                     </hi> the 1. chapter and 1. verſe. The ſecond reaſon is certeine: For if the world were coeternall with GOD, it ſelfe alſo were God: for eternitie is not only proper to diuine nature, but alſo the moſt it ſelfe ſubſtance therof, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part, and definition: <hi>Exodus</hi> the 2. chapt. and 14. verſe. <hi>Reuelat.</hi> the 1. chap. and 8. verſe. The thirde, that foraſmuch as this world ſhall haue an ende, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing hath meanes whereby it doth conſiſt, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth neceſſarily that it had a beeginnyng of beeyng. For although, that bee truely ſayde, not whatſoeuer had a beeginnyng ſhall haue an ende (foraſmuche as there bee many thinges made, which through the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulare benefite of God, are not ſubiect to death and corruption, as <hi>Angels, and the ſoules of men whiche are immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>) notwithſtandyng it is moſte certeinly affirmed, that, whatſoeuer ſhall haue an ende, the ſame alſo had beeginnyng of beeing.

                  <p>Concerning that auctority whiche you alleage out of the Scripture, and the 1. chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſome doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe interprete it. They graunte, that all theſe things indeede were made in the beeginnyng, but not in tyme. For the meaning and ſignification of a bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng, or of this woord <hi>principium,</hi> is manifolde, and in that place, they ſaye, it muſt not bee vnderſtoode of the beeginning of tyme.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>The ſignification of a beeginnyng, or of this woord <hi>principium,</hi> is threefold. For it reſpecteth either the time either the thing &amp; the cauſes, or elſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnynge of time, in thoſe things which are brought forth in a certein time, is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moment of an houre either wherein they are conceiued, or are brought foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world. Thoſe thinges haue onely the beegin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of tyme, which are doone in tyme. That which is called the beginning of a thing, and is taken for the cauſe in thoſe thinges which are of one age and time, is that relation and affection, whereby one thyng is the cauſe of the beeing of another. So, if wee make a conference beetweene the day and the night, wee ſaye that the Sun is the beeginning of the daye and light, although both of them do appeere vnto vs at one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sutch a beeginning, a diuerſe or certeine time doth not eſtabliſh. Finally, a beeginnyng in reſpect of order, is called that which miniſtreth the beeginnyng of numbryng, in ſutch thinges as are diſpoſed in one order, as for example: The father is the beginning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the three perſons in trinitie, which are one god: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> magiſtrate is one amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many of like auctoritie, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in telling we do begin: like as we do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our cheif Magiſtrate or Judge in this our Citie of <hi>Geneua.</hi>

                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>In this reſpect then, they woulde haue God to bee the beginninge of this worlde, as beeinge the cauſe and woorkeman therof, as hee that is firſt numbred, is called the beginninge.</p>

                  <p>Marke howe abſurde this is. Firſte, what ſhall bee the ſence and meaning of this ſaying, <hi>In the beeginnyng God made heauen and earth,</hi> if ſo be they wil thus expound it, <hi>God in the beeginnyng,</hi> that is to ſaye, <hi>God in God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heauen and earth?</hi> Moreouer, why ſaide hee, <hi>did create,</hi> which woorde doth not onely determine a beginning of beeing, but alſo the force of woorking, and a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate beeginning of time is therein manifeſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and included. Beeſides, will wee, nill wee: by this reaſon we ſhal fall into that damnable hereſie of the <hi>Hermogenians,</hi> who make the woorke to bee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall with the woorkeman, and ſo wee muſte needes make moe Gods than one. Of which errour, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth I ſhoulde ſpeake ſumwhat more at large, were it not, that <hi>Tertullian,</hi> longe ſcience, had vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne it in a whole woorke, yea, the Scripture it ſelfe doth manifeſtly expounde this ſayinge of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the beeginning of time, <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> the 8. Chap. and verſes 25. 27. and 28. Hee vſeth alſo the ſame woords and the ſame compariſon, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee ſpeaketh of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge of the worlde, wherein there muſte needes bee vnderſtood a beginning and moment of tyme, and of beeing. Neither can that which S. <hi>Paule</hi> repeateth ſo often, ſpeakinge of the beginning of the world, bee vnderſtoode of the laying of the foundations thereof to the <hi>Epheſi.</hi> the 1. Chapter, and 4. verſe, and, wheras in an other place he calleth certain tymes ſeculare, the 2. to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the 2. Chapter and 9. verſe: to <hi>Titus</hi> the 1.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5427:37"/>
Chapter, and 2. verſe: vnleſſe that wee confeſſe that all theſe thinges had a certeine time of beginning, and beeing. What are theſe eternall and ſeculare tymes, what ugnifieth this woord <gap reason="foreign">

In which point Sainet <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agréeth with vs, in his booke againſte the <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> the 6. chapter. To bee ſhorte, howe ſhoulde the ages of thoſe auncient men <hi>Adam, Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp; alſo the time of the vniuerſall flood, bee knowne how far diſtant it is ſince the beeginninge of the woorlde, if there were no beeginning of time in which the world was made? In ſo much, as I meruaile what ſhoulde mooue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Eccleſiaſticall writers, to doubt thereof: and ſpecially S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> a man ſo much exerciſed in the ſcriptures: as namely in his booke of <hi>Geneſis</hi> vpon the letter: althoughe alſo afterwarde hee bee altogither variable in defending the ſame, and manye times di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and diſſentinge from him ſelfe.</p>

                  <p>But ther bee ſome, that obiect two auctorities which are repugnaunt to your opinion: whereof the firſt is that which is written in the 18. chapter, and 5. verſe of <hi>Eccleſi. <hi>GOD made althing at once,</hi>
                     </hi> wherevnto I praye you to anſwere firſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>It ſhall bee an eaſie matter ſo to doe. For if I lyſte, I coulde aunſwere that, which as I ſuppoſe, wee haue already agreed vpon, that the auctoritie of this booke is farre to bee remooued and ſeparated, from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine &amp; canonicall Scriptures. And therefore it proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:5427:38"/>
nothing. Howbeit, I had rather ſay that that is true, which is confirmed by the woordes of the texte, and that the place is corruptly tranſlated in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>God made all thinge at once,</hi> for the meaninge of the aucthours woordes is this: <hi>Hee that liueth for euer, made all thinges togither:</hi> hee ſaith, altogither. Wherfore wee are taught, to acknowledge one onely aucthour and creatuor of all thinges, as <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſayth in the 4. booke and 21. chapter: it is not there affirmed that all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are created had there beeing beeginninge, or were all made in one moment, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, or without beeginning of time. This is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſignification of this woorde, <hi>Pariter,</hi> togither, to wit, that the power to create all thinges, is giuen to one, and not to many. For the ſame booke in the 16. Chapter, and 25. verſe, ſetteth downe, howe that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated things were diſpoſed and made in certein order, and time, Howbeit, I am not ignorant, howe much the ſignification and readinge of this onely woorde, <hi>Pariter</hi> togither, did oftentimes trouble S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the 5. booke, and 3. Chap: and alſo in his 6. booke, and 6. Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> vpon the letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of the Fathers. Thus haue you mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to your firſte obiection, to wyt, that for at once, you muſt vnderſtande, togyther. Nowe tell me your other aucthoritie.</p>

                  <p>Truely, wee ſhould bee hardly vrged by ſo great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie of the Scripture, vnleſſe the matter it ſelfe, whereof wee intreate, did miniſter vnto vs the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and expoſition of this difficultie. Wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie declared, howe that the ſignification of this woord, <hi>principium,</hi> or <hi>beeginnyng,</hi> is ſundrie, wherfore, it ought too bee taken accordyng to the reaſon and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thyng whereof wee diſpute. And you ſee, how S. <hi>Iohn</hi> plainly ſaith, that this woord, or Sunne of GOD, was not created in the beginning, but that it was in the beeginning, when God created all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: ſo that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſetteth this his, <hi>In the beginnyng was,</hi> againſt the ſaying of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and creation of all things, where the Scripture ſpeaketh thus, <hi>In the beginnyng God created heauen:</hi> and not thus, <hi>in the beginning was heauen.</hi> And moreouer, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth, that the ſame woord of God, is alſo the ſame God. And that woord, ſayeth hee, was God. But that whiche is God, can haue no beeginning of tyme. Wherfore, the ſame is moſt falſly expounded and vnderſtoode of time and beeginnyng of exiſtencie in Chriſt. And therefore this woord, <hi>Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng,</hi> hath another ſignification in that place: too wit, that, by whiche S. <hi>Iohn</hi> excludeth all beeginnyng of time, to the ende that ſo far as our mindes are able by thinkyng too looke backe, and to ſtretche foorthe themſelues, wee may not withſtanding beeleue moſte aſſuredly, that beefore, that woorde and Sunne of GOD, had beeing, and had a diſtinct ſubſtance from the Father. By whiche meanes of ſpeaking, eternitie is accuſtomably ſignified in the Scriptures, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the 8. of the <hi>Prouerbes.</hi> And alſo by the ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:5427:39"/>
ſame teſtimonie of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> it is declared, how that all theſe thinges were made and brought foorthe in the beeginning of tyme: for they were not in the beegin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as was the woorde, but they were made, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were not in the beeginning.</p>

                  <p>For that no woorkman bee hee neuer ſo mightie and ſkilfull, is able to make anye thyng vnleſſe hee haue ſtuffe miniſtred vnto him: for if he haue no ſtuffe, hee is able to make nothing. Take away yron from the Smith, timber from the Carpendour, yearne from the Weauer, what other good can they doe but ſtand ſtill gaping in their ſhoppes? For euerie Arte and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation requireth naturally to haue ſome ſtuffe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, wheruppon afterwarde it woorketh, and bringeth foorth ſundrie fourmes. Yea, not the cauſes themſelues, and powers whiche are termed naturall, and are proper to euery thing, are able to bring foorth any thing without conuenient matter and ſtuffe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted vnto them. For, if a man ſearche throughly the greateſt and whole vertues of the natures of all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, notwithſtandyng hee ſhall finde that to bee true which is generally ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natural Philoſophers. <hi>Nothyng is made of nothyng.</hi> Who euer reaped Wheate or Barly without ſowing? who euer ſaw trees growe without planting, ſettinge, or ſpringing from ſome berrie, or kernell, or hearbes and flowers without ſeede or ſlippe? But hee that is the true creatour, hee maketh his matter and ſtuffe in whiche and of which hee woorketh, of nothing, hee hath it not alreadie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, or miniſtred from ſome other place. But to ſaie that the matter was coeternall with God himſelfe, or exiſting of it ſelfe, and to deny that it was firſte made and brought foorth by God out of nothing, is not the part of Chriſtians, but plainly of the <hi>Hermogenian</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. So that there is a moſte large diſtinction bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb facs="tcp:5427:44"/>
creation, and engendring. Thoſe thinges are created, whiche are made of no ſubſtanciall or materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all beeginnyng. Thoſe are engendred or made, not whiche are made out of nothing, but out of a former ſubſtance and matter. Wherefore, neither good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels nor bad, nor diuelles, bee, or ought to bee called creatours, mutch leſſe men: for it is onely proper to God to create, whiche theſe places following doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, to wit, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 3. booke of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, the 8. chap. <hi>Iſay</hi> the 45. chapt. <hi>Iob</hi> the 26. chapt the 33 <hi>Pſalme, Actes</hi> the 17. chap. and 24. verſe.

                  <p>Firſt that whiche your ſelfe alleaged, and is a moſte certeine poſition among the naturall Philoſophers, and confirmed in all mens iudgementes by continual experience: <hi>Nothyng is made of nothyng.</hi> How then ſhould God haue made al theſe thinges, if ſo bee that hee had no matter prepared to his hand, that is to ſay, if hee had nothing to make them of?</p>

                  <p>Truely this is an olde obiection, and often repeated by Heathen men, in expoundyng whereof, <hi>Iuſtine</hi> the Martyr, or whoſoeuer he was elſe that anſwered the obiections of the <hi>Ethnikes,</hi> hee tooke great paines ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which difficultie mee thinkes I can eaſilye reſolue. Firſt in that the inſinite &amp; incomprehenſible omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of God the creatour is not only a miſſe, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly called to the lawes of nature, which was made
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5427:44"/>
and created. For what is that other, than to go about to make the creature equall to the Creatour? But as the Lorde witneſſeth, that his thoughtes doe differ farre from ours, ſo likewiſe is the force &amp; power farre diſcrepant from ours, and farre excelling the ſtrength and vertue of this nature, <hi>Iob</hi> the 10. chapter, and 45. verſe. Now if a man woulde thus conclude: At this preſent, and ſince the tyme that the Lorde appointed this order, that nothing ſhoulde bee made of nothing, there is nowe nothing made without matter readye and prepared beefore. Wherefore in the beeginning, and before that God had ordeined theſe lawes, it toke place then, neither coulde anye thinge bee made other wiſe. Your ſelfe perceiue how much they are deceiued that doe ſo conclude. As, for example, if a man would thus diſpute, that in the beeginning the firſt trees, at the ſame verie inſtant wherin God made them, could not bring foorthe their fruites, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> now adaies they bee not ſo forwarde, but neede longer time to beare and ripen them: if a man, I ſay, ſhoulde reaſon thus, euerie body woulde laughe him to ſkorne: and woulde perceiue that hys ſayinge were falfe, out of <hi>Iſay</hi> the 46. chapter, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. verſe: and not onely out of the firſt Chapter of <hi>Moyſes.</hi> For whoſo were of that opinion, were deceiued through great ignorance and confuſion of diuerſe tymes, and conditions, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge thinges are to bee diſtinguiſhed. And euen ſo, they, who as you ſay, doe obiect againſt the firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of thinges, <hi>That Nothing is made of nothing,</hi> bycauſe that nowe nothing is made of nothing, hee diſputeth of moſt different, and vnlike times, and conditions, To wit, from the nature whiche was to bee created
<pb facs="tcp:5427:45"/>
and not yet tied by any law, vnto the nature created &amp; which is now reuoked &amp; conſtrained by ſure &amp; certein lawes. Which kynde of concluſion S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo laugheth at in his booke 2. booke againſt <hi>Pelagia,</hi> the 25. Chapter. Thus haue you my anſwere vnto that moſt common and vſuall argument of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. What is the ſeconde argument, which you ſay may be brought againſt vs?</p>

                  <p>The aucthoritie which they alleage out of the xi. cha. and 18. verſe of the booke of <hi>VViſedome: <hi>For vnto thyne almightie hande that made the worlde out of a rude and vnfourmed matter, there lacked no ſtrength to ſende a multitude of beares, or of fierce Lions amonge them.</hi> Ergo</hi> the worlde was made of rude and vnformed matter, and not of nothyng. To which opinion Sainct <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſeemeth to agree in the 3. booke, the 5. and 6. Chapters, of the Trinitie.

                  <p>Indeede, this which you doe aleage, hath ſeemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome to bee a verie forceable argument. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> materiar heretikes, which are called alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

God. But whoſoeuer he was that wrote that booke, hee wrote in ſuch manner, out of the opinion whiche was then receiued and knowne amonge the <hi>Hebrue Rabbines,</hi> and was afterward alowed of and embraced of all, to wit, that heauen and earth (which two are ſaide in the 1. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to haue beene created the firſte daye) were as it were the firſt matter of Gods woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes which were created afterwarde, whiche God by his mightie vertue prepared vnto him ſelf and caſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, miniſtred firſt rudely whereby afterwarde hee might finiſhe and forme the reſidue of that ſo greate a woorke. And as touching Sainct <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> they that alleage him againſt vs, do altogither wreaſt hys auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority. For S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> intreateth not there of the firſt matter of thys whole worlde, as though hee would haue it to bee one: or feigned or imagined it to bee coeternall with God: but hee ſpeaketh of the ſeconde matter, through which as in thinges nowe alreadye created, one thinge ſprunge of an other by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of GOD, as out of the earth trees and beaſtes, and as at thys daye alſo they are made and doe proceede. <hi>There was foreſowne</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>eeuen in thoſe thinges, the matter of ſuch thinges as aroſe and ſprung out of them:</hi> the 3. booke of <hi>Geneſis</hi> vppon the letter, the 14. chapter, and the 2. booke, the 15. chapter, and the 1. booke, the 14. and 15.

                  <p>Thirdly they ſaye, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not the proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall force and ſignification of this woorde, <hi>Create,</hi> For in the 43. chap. and 13. verſe of <hi>Iſay,</hi> the Lorde calleth himſelfe the creatour of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> which people notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge are knowne to haue beene borne of ſeede. And againe, in in the 65. Chapter, and 18. verſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:5427:46"/>
ſame Prophet, he ſaith. <hi>Beeholde, I create Hieruſalem:</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che place whether it bee vnderſtoode of the citizens or of the citie it ſelfe, it is certayne that God made ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them without ſeede, or matter, but the men of the one, and the Citie of the other. For this woorde <hi>Barah</hi> is vſed in both places, ſo that I am of opinion, that wee ought not to ſticke to religiouſly or perciſely to the interpretation of one poore woorde. Likewiſe they alleage this ſaying of the ſame Prophete: <hi>Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, I create a newe heauen, and a newe earth:</hi> When as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Lorde will onely renue theſe bodyes which nowe are heauen and earth, and not make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again of nothing.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>It is writen in <hi>Iſay</hi> as you ſay. But theſe places doe plainly confirme mine opinion, much leſſe confute it. For the woorde, create, is taken Metaphorically, and wreſted a litle from the proper ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the power of God may appeare the greater &amp; more excellent in reſtoringe his people, and holy Citie bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides al hope, and other thinges beeſides all ordinarie meanes. For lyke as the thinges that are created, are beeſides the courſe of nature made of nothinge, ſo likewiſe bycauſe the Lord promiſeth that hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore and renue his people and Citie, hee vſeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the woorde of creating, for that this which the Lord will woorke, is, as it were, a new creation, and a certayne won<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull bringing foorth and generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of nothinge. Althoughe I will not deney, but that the ſignification of this word <hi>Barah</hi> is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times tranſlated and vſed more largely: as when it is ſayd: <hi>Create a cleane hart within mee, O God,</hi> the 51. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and 12. verſe: and againe, <hi>The ſeat of the frowarde createth iniquitie:</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:5427:46"/>
                     <hi>Pſalme.</hi> 94. and 20. verſe. Of this ſayinge and opinion of Sainct <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that I maye ſaye ſo much by the licence of ſo woorthy a man, I doe not well alowe. Who in his firſt booke againſt the aduerſaries of the lawe and the Prophetes, the 23 chap, writeth thus: <hi>And when there is anye difference made beetweene makinge and creatinge, this maye bee the oddes beetwene thoſe two woordes as I ſayde, that that is made which beefore was not at all, and that created which is ordeyned of ſumthinge that was beefore.</hi> Hee diſtinguiſhed thoſe two woordes, Make, and Creat, toto ſubtily whiche oftentimes are vſed one for an other.</p>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus the Scripture plainly defineth, to wit, that God is the creatour of the world, that is to ſay, of all thinges that are, who made, framed &amp; brought foorth them all out of nothing, and not out of any matter preexiſting or made to his hande, or whiche is coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall with God himſelf, or miniſtred vnto him by ſome other woorking God, as the <hi>Manichees</hi> doe ſuppoſe. For that opinion induceth two Goddes: and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king twayne, it leaueth none. For either there is no God, or there is but one. Finally, as ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe, <hi>God ſhould bee onely the diuiſer of the figure, and not the maker of Nature: and hee had founde and receiued more than hee had made, if there had bin any matter readie to his hande.</hi>

the materiare heretikes.

                  </lg>
                  <p>This muche therefore they doe attribute vnto God, that hee is the diſtinguiſher, trimmer, and ſetter foorth of this ſo confuſed a <hi>Chaos,</hi> mole and heape: and not the creatour of it in time, giuinge vnto it the firſt meanes of beeinge. And therefore the Poet ſayde <hi>There was,</hi> as it were, from euerlaſting: and not the ſame <hi>Chaos</hi> was made and created by God. And for this cauſe they doe not call God the Creatour of the world, but onely the beutifier, and as Sainct <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayeth, the deuiſer of the ſhape and fourme thereof: as though hee hadde giuen a certeine comlineſſe and order vnto thinges that exiſted before, and which had of themſelues their owne proper ſtrength and nature, whiche hee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by a certaine wiſe and apt diſtinction of them, and by ſeparating &amp; diſtributing of euery part into it owne conuenient place. Otherſome there bee that doe
<pb facs="tcp:5427:48"/>
attribute more vnto GOD. For they holde opinion, that the matter was a great mole from eternitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but matter onely, and not that althinges were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and comprehended within it (whiche the firſte ſorte doe alſo holde,) but that it was rude and vnſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Which matter, for that it was great, GOD ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in hande, diuided it into ſmale peaces: and, as hee is a moſte wiſe and cunninge woorkeman, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it into ſundrye fourmes.

                  <p>You mooue mee to enter into a difficult queſtion, which conſiſteth both of like number of weightie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of auctorities of graue writers. For among the learned auctours, ſome thinke that Heauen and earth, of whiche in the 1. chapt. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and 1. verſe it is writen, <hi>In the beginnyng God made heauen and earth,</hi> were made by God of nothyng: howbeit, firſt, and before all thinges, to the intent that they might be the prepared matter of all other thinges that were to be afterward created. And therfore, they ſay, that God did nothyng the other daies following, but onely diſtinguyſh this matter and maſſe which was firſt confuſedly brought foorth, and conteined in it the ſeedes of all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into the proper kindes and elementes, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing ſhould be trimmed foorth in it owne kind, and gouerned by it owne lawe. Other dooe ſuppoſe
<pb facs="tcp:5427:51"/>
otherwiſe, that theſe thinges were only ſet downe in the beginning, as it were, in maner of a preface or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome diſcourſe that ſhould enſue, to the end that the ſumme of the whole matter following might be the better vnderſtoode, and the boundes of ſo great a frame as the world is, bee drawne foorth. In like maner, cunning Carpenters when they are about to build ſome goodly and large houſe, they firſte drawe out a platfourme in certeine proportions and lines, conteining the fourme of the whole woork that ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee, to the intent, they may point out and place the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther roomthes of the buildyng within that circuite, &amp; ſo conteine themſelues within thoſe limites. Thus, ſay they, heauen and earth are propoſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that in the beeginning of his Narration, to the ende, wee might vnderſtande what limites the diſcription following, and the whole woorke ſhould haue: Like as he alſo repeateth again thoſe limites after the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the creation, &amp; concludeth the whole woorke whiche hee ſet foorth, after the ſame manner. <hi>Geneſis</hi> the 2. chapter, and 1. verſe. Wherefore, <hi>In the beginnyng God created heauen and earth,</hi> that is to ſaye, firſte of all the ſumme of all Gods woorkes is layd beefore vs to bee thought on. Moreouer, <hi>Ireneus</hi> in his 2. booke, the 10. 11. and 16. chapters, ſheweth that GOD is not like men, as not hauing neede of any matter that hee had created or prepared before hand, to finiſh or make his other woorkes of.</p>

                  <p>Truely, the interpretation and opinion of the fyrſte ſorte ſeemeth vnto mee the more probable, which hold that the heauen and earth (in ſuche maner as thei are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5427:51"/>
there ſpoken of) were firſte created by GOD of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, howbeit as it were, a rude matter of the whole woorke and bewtie that ſhoulde folowe, out of which God by his mightie power brought foorth all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue. Although almightie God lacked no matter to create firſte heauen and earth with all, neither yet to bring forthe the woorkes of the other daies, like as at this day alſo he needeth not the ſeede of man to bryng foorth men of, if hee luſt to doe otherwiſe: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>in theſe queſtions wee muſt not enquire how much hee was able to doe,</hi> ſayeth S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 2. booke <hi>de Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſi,</hi> but rather what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe of nature in things will ſuffer, and what his pleaſure is, and what hee hath reuealed vnto vs by his woorde. Neither doth this mine opinion want iuſt and ſufficient confirmation, either of the auctoritie of men, or of reaſon. And as for auctoritie there is none againſt mee, ſeeing bothe <hi>Philo Iudaeus,</hi> and the <hi>Rabbines</hi> commonly, and the beſt learned of the <hi>Hebrues</hi> doe ſo expounde that place of <hi>Moſes:</hi> yea, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo oftentimes, as in the 5. booke <hi>de Ge neſi ad Literam,</hi> the 3. and 5. chapters: and the 1. booke, the 5. chapter.

                  <p>Yea, by twaine. And the firſt is, that this expoſition doth very well agree with <hi>Moſes</hi> woordes, and order: and againe, that it ſeemeth to be plainly confirmed by this woord <hi>Beeginning,</hi> and the ſignification therof. For a beeginning is ſayd in compariſon of other thinges. And therefore, to the intent hee might ſhewe how all other thinges were made afterwarde out of thoſe twayne, <hi>Moſes</hi> plainly vſeth this preface, to wit, that
<pb facs="tcp:5427:52"/>
the ſame heauen, and the ſame earth were created in the beeginning, that is to ſaye, beefore all the other woorkes that God made, and alſo to the vſe of all the other, that is to ſaie, from whence afterward the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due were taken, and as it were, made. The very foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteppes, as it were, of whiche opinion, howbeeit the trueth beeyng now and then manifeſtly intercepted, do appeare to be exſtant in <hi>Heſiodus</hi> in his <hi>Theogonia,</hi> and <hi>Ouid</hi> alſo in that place of the firſte booke of his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis, which is ſo well knowne: <hi>Beefore the Sea and Earth, &amp;c.</hi> This reaſon alſo may bee alleaged, that the thing itſelf, and ſpecially the earth, is thus deſcribed vnto vs, and is called by <hi>Moſes Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu:</hi> whereby it appeareth that there was a certein Maſſe, ſtuffe, and matter prepared by GOD, for the world that ſhould afterwarde bee made, whiche was then firſte onely, and not prepared from euerlaſting. Yea, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee denied but that at that tyme there was ſome confuſion euen in heauen, when as the heauenly and earthly ſubſtances were not as yet diſtinguiſhed &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one from another, whiche at length was brought too paſſe. And that alſo there was no beutie, nor brightnes as yet in heauen, neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light ſhining therein. Howbeeit that confuſion was greater vpon the earth.

                  <p>Moreouer, as ther are two chiefe kindes of althings, one heauenly, the other earthly: euen ſo at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge God created two ſortes of matter, God I ſay, who knewe well ynough of what and how manifolde natures the thinges ſhould bee that hee would make, and did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make but preparation for them.

And the earth of the earthly, which earth at that time moiſte, wet, &amp; mooriſhe, ouer which the water was ſpread abroad for this cauſe, as it is writen in the 104. <hi>Pſalme</hi> and 6. verſe. that there ſhoulde bee then onely one bodye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, conſiſting of two elementes.

a thing better formed and compounded. But in diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binge the ſtate of the earth, hee vſeth moe woordes. For hee calleth that firſt and material earth. <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu,</hi> that is to ſay, a certeine confuſed maſſe: ſuch an one as wee muſt needes imagine it to haue been, if a man will in minde take from it that bewtie and order which the Lorde added vnto it afterwarde.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:5427:54"/>
mynde, rather than in mole of bodie comprehenſible: but that it was that huge mole and globe, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng afterwarde diuided into partes, conteined this earth whiche wee goe vppon, and the great ſea whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wee ſayle vpon.

and marking ſo fondly. Yea, and the <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> alſo their Patriarkes for this cauſe were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For, beeing led by their owne wicked thoughtes in this kinde of argument, they ſayd, that this world, and the firſt beginning therof, were the matter, fruite, and effect of a certein foule imperfection &amp; ignorance in God, and not the woorke of a wiſe God or woork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whiche can not bee read without horrour and trembling.

Wherefore, like as it was the parte of a moſte wiſe God, to finde out and chooſe the way that he thought moſt conuenient to reueale himſelfe: ſo is it likewiſe our duetie too allowe, reuerence, and adore the ſame that hee hath choſen.

in the ſcripture, that the giftes and tokens of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſte, are taken for the holy Ghoſte himſelfe, and when they are recited, hee likewiſe is vnderſtoode to bee there by his owne ſpecial meanes, as appeareth in the 3. chap. of S. <hi>Matthewe,</hi> becauſe wee cannot know hym any other way than through thoſe his effectes, and giftes. Whererefore, the Spirite of God, had alſo his owne proper function and office, openly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in the creation of this world. Secondly. that wee might know by what power and ſpirite that firſt mole, whiche was ſo greate, was at the beeginning ſuſteined and helde vp. Truely not of it ſelf, neither by the waters that were round about it, neither by the darkneſſe that was vppon it, whiche rather couered that firſte matter whiche was now a growing, as it were in a wombe, and made it an vntimely fruite: but by the almightie ſpirite of God, whiche ſuſteineth and quickneth all thinges by his diuine power, by whom that huge and vnprofitable mole of earth and water, ſubſiſted, flouriſhed, was quickned, was ſuſteined, was reteined, and as I may ſaye, made aliue: to the ende wee ſhould aſcribe all theſe thinges, and their vertues, onely to the glorie of God.</p>

                  <p>That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water was created by God at one time with the firſt earth, <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth ſufficiently, when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by and by, <hi>and darkeneſſe was vpon the face of the deapths,</hi> that is to ſaye, vpon the mole of waters.

But why that force and ſpirite of GOD, did ſpecially appeare in the top of the waters, that is to ſay, of the whole mole, and not in the bottom or middes, the reaſon is this: not that it did not pearce alſo vnto the very deapthes, but ſuſteined onely the vppermoſt face of the mole (for the Spirite of God reached at that time euen vnto Hell. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 139. the 5. verſe. &amp; filled alſo with his power, and went throughout euery parte of this mole, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſecret &amp; hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) but foraſmuch as it pleaſed God that all theſe thinges ſhoulde ſo bee extant and doone, to the ende his power ſhoulde bee manifeſt, open and eaſie to bee knowne, not hid and couered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull

that his miſterie and tokens ſhould appeare and ſhowe themſelues in the vppermoſte parte and openly, not in the bottome of the whole mole, or in the middeſt thereof, that is to ſaye, in ſecrete and out of fight.

                  <p>Why doth hee call them earth, water, and heauen, whiche were not yet diſtinct by that name, or ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their proper natures? for they were ſo called the daies followyng, after that theſe thinges were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided one from another.</p>

                  <p>As for heauen, God had made it at that time, and it was called heauen, but the <hi>Etymon</hi> and cauſe of the name is vnderſtoode by the latter woorkes, whiche was the ſtretching foorth, and the woorkmanſhip of the ſecond day. And thus are thei termed heauen and earth by anticipation, leſte if theſe bodies were ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by no names, the thinge it ſelf could not bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Beeſides this, inaſmuch as theſe thinges are alſo afterward called by their owne proper names, it is a ſigne, that there is none other ſubſtance added vntoo them, but the ſame reteined which was in them, when as yet they were confuſed: but onely beautie added, whereby they were dinſtinguiſhed from other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of diuerſe kindes, and alſo made more beautifull in themſelues.</p>

was made one of an other, and termeth the firſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge of all thinges, but a diſtinction and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of a certain confuſed heape, wherin they were beefore?</p>

                  <p>No not ſo: for I doe not ſaye, that within the ſame, mole of earth, whereof I doe now diſpute, there were hidden and buried trees alreadye framed, men four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or cattell and beaſtes ſhapen, and that they were couered and infoulded within certeine plightes and fouldes, and ſo were extant, as <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> thought: but <hi>Moſes</hi> confuteth this, who ſheweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things which were brought forth the daies following, were made, and not onely ſeuered, neither taken and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, as it were, out of a certeine heape, and ſtoare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of all thinges. Howebeeit, I maye truely ſaye with Sainct <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that the ſeedes of all thinges were at the firſt, yea, and that throughly infuſed into that firſt matter: which ſeedes were not diuerſe from the ſubſtance of the earth, and yet laye hidden within the bowels thereof: but the earth beeing made apt by the woorde and woorking of the Spirite, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde bringe foorth thoſe thinges, which it pleaſed God ſhoulde bee in the worlde. To conclude, howe ſhoulde wee bringe in this <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> confuſion, ſince wee reade ſo playnely in the holy Scripture, that the matter of heauenly thinges is diuerſe and ſeparated, from the matter of earthly thinges? And, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that heauen which as it is written, God made the fyrſt daye when he made the earth, was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all heauenly thinges.</p>

                  <p>Yea, very much both in name and effect. In name, for that the firſt is called heauen, and this latter parte of the worlde is tearmed by the name of the elementes, yea and that by the ſcripture. For S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 2. Epiſtle, the 3. Chapter, the 10. and 14. verſes, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth theſe words, Heauen, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Elementes. In effect, for that this endureth and continueth in the old ſtate: the other is dayly chaunged, and at one time is engendred, and at an other tyme periſheth. The firſt, God hath reſerued to himſelfe, the other hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the vſe of man: <hi>Pſalme</hi> 115. and 16. verſe. The firſt, as wee are taught, ſhall periſhe at the latter day but with ſinale noyſe, and a lyght flaſhe of flame, for

that it conſiſteth of a fine and ſubtill nature: but the other ſhall burne with great heat, and bee diſſolued with mightie rage of fyre, eeuen in ſuch ſorte, as looke how it hapeneth in our earthly &amp; material fire whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it flameth, the ſtickes crack, &amp; ſmoke, &amp; ſende foorth a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, which proceedeth from the moyſt partes therof: ſo it is ſaide that the elementes ſhall glowe with heat, and melt, for that they are of an hard, thick and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie nature, and not pure and cleane. This difference alſo may bee obſerued betwene the two partes of the worlde, that the thinges which are in the firſt, are the efficient &amp; principall cauſes, of thoſe thinges that are engendred in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other.

So that, that great wiſedome of God hath not made, no not the leaſt thing in vaine, whiche is truely the manifold wiſedome, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> termeth it to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the 3. chapter, and 10. verſe. And therefore it is ſaid in the 136. <hi>Pſalme:</hi> and 5. verſe, that hee made the heauens with vnſearchable vnderſtanding and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And when as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> conſidered in his minde deepely the framing of this world, hee cried out, and ſayd: <hi>Thy knowledge is to woonderfull and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for mee, I can not attaine vnto it: <hi>Pſalme</hi>
                     </hi> 139. and 6. verſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto alſo that may bee added which is writen in the 39. chapter, and 26. verſe of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus.</hi> This our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion alſo is confirmed in the 8. chapt. and 27. and 28. verſes, and the reſidue following: and alſo the 21. cha. and 30. verſe: and by this one thing moreouer, that whereas there bee certein thinges, yea, and men alſo,
<pb facs="tcp:5427:71"/>
that are of diuerſe and fundrie qualities and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and of natures quite contrarie: they were to good purpoſe by the ſame wiſedom of God, created in ſuche maner. For the Lord hath wiſely, made a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and diſtinction beetweene the ritchman and the poore: <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> the 22. chapter, and 2. verſe. To bee ſhort, thoſe thinges whiche wee make none accoumpt of, and are indeede but ſmall, as a Guat, a Woorme, and a Butterflie, in theſe notwithſtanding appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the wonderfull wiſedome of God, inſomuche as wee muſt needes acknowledge that to bee true which was ſpoken by <hi>Plinie</hi> an Heathen writer: <hi>Nature is neuer more whole in any thing then in the leaſt.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, this is a great goodneſſe of God, that he would haue thinges to exiſt and bee, which were not beefore. Moreouer, in that hee gaue them lyfe and nature, to the intent they ſhoulde exiſt, whiche could not bee had from any other than him. Who onely is the fountayn of lyfe and afterward hath aſſigned vnto euery kinde of thing it owne proper &amp; moſt conuenient foode, and and not aſſigned it once, but alſo prepareth, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and yeldeth it euery day.

                  <p>You ſaye well. For Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> aunſwereth in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the 1. chapter, and 20. verſe, that although the knowledge which is had by the worlde, bee trewe, yet is it not fully ſufficient, that thereby wee may vnderſtande anye thing concerning our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation through Chriſt: but that it is in this reſpecte profitable, that therby wee are made vnaccuſable. For it teacheth vs that God is our Creatour, but it is not able to enfourme vs y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he is alſo our redeemer thorow Chriſte: For wee are not able to atteine to that knowledge without the preachinge of the Goſpell. Wherefore, wee muſt not begin with that knowledge of God, whereby wee vnderſtande that hee is our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, but rather that hee is our creatour, whereat wee muſt indeede beeginne, and conſequently proceed vnto better and higher things. For the Heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; Philoſophers, who chiefly folowed this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Naturall thinges, neyther perceiued they

It profiteth notwithſtanding, and it mutch profiteth too, that wee ſeeke the true God, that hath created all theſe thinges: and when wee haue founde hym, that wee woorſhip hym and praye vnto hym, as farre as hee ſhall giue vs grace ſo to doe. This much at the leaſtwiſe hee wringeth from vs whether wee will or no: that he ought both to bee ſought and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, who hath firſt created, and now gouerneth al this world.

For that light ſhineth clearely enough in this world, and in ſutch ſorte as it cannot bee put out, and alſo is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſeene whoſo will lift vp his eyes vnto it, and looke vpon it. For God hath engrauen in the world greate and wonderfull tokens of his goodnes, power, and wiſedome: hee layeth alſo beefore our eyes moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt teſtimonies, and documentes that may bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode,

yea by the moſt ignorant perſons.

And man is the image of God, and not onely the lookinge glaſſe of his power, but alſo of his nature after a manner, for man of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the worlde commeth neereſt to the nature of God, and caried the very fourme of him in the light of his minde and the vprightnes of his will, which was in him at his firſt creation. But Chriſt who is God manifeſted in the fleſhe, who was without ſinne, in whome the Godhead remained, who in his whole life and by al meanes ſhewed foorth the nature, ſimilitude &amp; fygure of God through his great power, wiſedome, and clemencie, is in a farre more excellent reſpect the image of God than was the firſt man, althoughe hee were ſounde and perfect. Wherefore, the world hath no ſuch ſimilitude and likelineſſe with Chriſt, who is vnto vs not onely the ymage, and as it were the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the goodneſſe, Wiſedome, and Power of God, but alſo the moſt bright, and ſelfeſame repreſentation of the fathers ſubſtance: <hi>Hebrues</hi> the 1. chapter and 3. verſe. And therefore hee is not called onely the image, but alſo the liuely brightneſſe of the Fathers glorye. And yet farther to the intent it may bee the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, what, and how great the difference is wee
<pb facs="tcp:5427:74"/>
muſt note, that the world and man are a notable, but yet a ſhadowed repreſentation of thoſe things which they do teach vs, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning god. And Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> expreſſe and liuely fourme, in whoſe inward, natural, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciall brightneſſe, wee may moſt euidently behold the infinite power of God, and incomprehenſible loue towardes vs men. Thus therefore, when wee thincke vppon God and beholde him in all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſuche is our vanitie, that immediatly wee decay and come to naught: but when wee looke vppon him in Chriſt, wee are quieted and ſtayed moſt firmely and ſubſtantially. Wherefore there ought no compariſon bee made betweene theſe, which differ in kinde, and manner of repreſentation.</p>

                  <p>The ſeconde impediment is, that wheras in another place in like kind of thinges, and ſemblable argument mention is made of the woorde of God, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Gods ſecret will is ment thereby, whiche is not expreſſed in any woord, or commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as in the 147. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 15. and 18. verſes, where he ſpeaketh of Ice: <hi>Hee ſendeth out his woorde, and melteth it.</hi>

                  <p>You ſay well. Howbeit in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the verye text, &amp; alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> minde teatheth vs, that wee muſt ſay and thinke otherwiſe, where it is plainly writen that God ſpake and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that to bee which was made. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the only bare and ſecrete will of God is not there to bee vnderſtood and taken, but that which is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the prolation and vtteringe of ſome woorde of his, and commaundement. Which opinion of mine is confirmed by an interpretation which the Scripture it ſelf maketh, noting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was doone by vttering of ſome woorde or voyce. For in the 33. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and 6. verſe, after that it is declared that theſe things were made by the woorde of God, for true expoſition ſake it is added: <hi>&amp; by the ſpirite of his mouth.</hi> For a voice is made by the breathing foorth of aire, which is doone by the mouth.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>But by this meanes, feigning that God hath a to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, roofe of the mouth, and teeth, with out whiche inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments no voyce can bee vttered, you ſeeme to reuoke againe out of Hell the abominable errour of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropomorphites.</hi>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>God forbid that I ſhould thinke ſo wickedly of the infinite and omnipotent maieſtie of God. But like as the Lorde ſpake ſo as he might bee heard and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode
<pb facs="tcp:5427:76"/>
when hee gaue the law in mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which no man can deney: as likewiſe when hee ſpake to <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gaue anſwere by <hi>Vrim &amp; Thumim,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord ſpake &amp; vttered a voice in the hearing of the people, &amp; yet not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we muſt not feigne y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> god hath a tongue, a mouth, a palate of the mouth, &amp; teeth. So, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning &amp; creation of the world, when it is ſayd that God ſpake, his diuine ſhape was not chaunged intoo an humane fourme: but it came to paſſe by a ſpeciall prouidence and pollicie. For the Lord tooke vpon him for a tyme ſuche meanes as were neceſſarie for the bringing foorth a cleare and audible voice, wherof af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward hee left the vſe.</p>

                  <p>But theſe things are referred to the Sunne, when it is ſayd that the Lord created all thing by his woord, ſo that Chriſte is ment by the woorde, for by him all thinges were made. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> the 1. chapter, and 16. verſe.</p>

                  <p>I will not much contende herein, ſo that they will graunt mee, that as the Sunne is called the woorde ſo likewiſe that woorde was a ſigne and token of his preſence, power, and perſon, and alſo of his woorking. Whiche doeth likewiſe diſtinguiſhe the Father from, the Sunne.</p>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Hee commaunded, to the intent that the thinges that were afterward made, might be knowne not to haue bin made by the Water, or Earth out of whiche they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5427:76"/>
came, or the heauens, or, to bee ſhort, by the vertue or power of any creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the commaundement of the Lord onely, and the power of his woord. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let vs giue prayſe vnto hym for all thinges that are created. And he ſpake, not that hee could not haue fourmed all thinges by the vertue and decree of his alonely will, who hadde already made Heauen and Earth without ſpeaking of any word: but when as it pleaſed God to reueale &amp; manifeſt himſelf outwardly by his works, hee vſed thoſe meanes wherby hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and commaundeth himſelfe to bee moſt certeinly knowne, to wit, his woorde &amp; voice. The ſumme and ſcope of this word, is Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euerlaſting Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euerlaſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g father, who was afterward manifeſted in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fleſh: &amp; therfore hereof they do rightly gather, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Chriſt the Sunne of God, did woorke in the creation of the world. For ther is a threefold meane, &amp; booke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God reuealeth himſelf vnto vs, to wit, the booke of creatures, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> boke of ſcripture, &amp; the boke of life.

                  <p>Both that by appliyng, as it were, a Candle or other light, that confuſed mole might bee ſeen, and diuided into meete partes and members: and alſo bicauſe it was neceſſarie that ſome firie qualitie ſhould bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto that moyſte matter, too warme it, and to make it frutefull.

now wee doe behold to woorke in them.

                  <p>This forſooth, that GOD framed this ſo greate and huge a Mole of the worlde, without anye payne or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſomneſſe at all: that the <hi>Epicures</hi> neede not to feare leaſte wee aſcribe any greife and paine vnto God, in that men are not able to finiſhe the leaſt woorke that they haue to doe, without ſome trauayle and wearineſſe of bodye.

in his 39. Epiſtle: neither came it to paſſe by reaſon of impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, wearines, or weakeneſſe in God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was ſix dayes in making it: but bicauſe he is moſt wiſe, by moſt wiſe &amp; good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would thus finiſh his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. For whatſoeuer is made, requireth ſome order in the making. And order requireth diſtinct time, and number. Firſt therfore, god putteth vs in minde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that hee wrought not confuſedly, nor out of order: and ſo conſequently, that wee muſt not meditate and thinke vpon his works lightly, and as it were a farre of in general: but in order, ſeuerally, and particularly of euery one. Hee ſheweth moreouer, howe great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence wee ought to vſe in conſidering of them, ſeing that hee declareth that hee pauſed vppon the order of his woorks, by this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the daies &amp; labours. Beeſides this, hee declareth that wee are not able ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to comprehend his workes: the reaſon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and manner of creating them is ſuch, and ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that wee haue ſufficient matter in them to thinke vpon and beeholde euery daye in the weeke, and ſo throughout the whole yeare. For what other thinge is a yeare, than a continuall repeating of one, and the ſelfe ſame weeke? For there was an whole day ſpent in the finiſhinge of euery part and worke. Moreouer, god wold not creat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world at once, but by piece meale that is to ſay, in ſome ſpace of time, for he ment imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, to declare the ſtate, law, &amp; naturall order which the things that hee had made ſhould afterward folow, to wit, that, by which all thinges doe require a ſpace of time for their beeing, that is to ſaye, are brought foorth in tyme: and are not perfectly growne in a moment, as wee ſee dayely.
<pb facs="tcp:5427:79"/>
So thoſe thinges that growe out of the earth, doe at this daye keepe this order, that they ſpringe not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deynly, but by proceſſe of time.

                  <p>Uerily if you call that onely ful, that is filled with this aire whiche wee drawe in and breath foorth, there bee many places too bee called voyd, For all that ſpace of the worlde. whiche is aboue the Circle of the Moone (which ſome ſay is very large) is void. But if you call that full, whiche is repleniſhed with ſome bodie and nature of it owne kinde, then maye I call no parte of this whole worlde voide, no not ſo muche as that whiche the Aſtronomers ſaye, is conteined within the Globe and ſpace of the Heauens: but all full, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied. Not onely bicauſe God made nothing in vain, for that is repugnant to his wiſedome, but alſo for that the whole ſtretching foorth of the heauens, howe big ſoeuer it be, is an heauenly body.

                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>The firſt is this. Seeyng the worlde is rounde, and of a Sphericall fourme, there can neither beginnyng, nor endyng bee noted therein: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that when it mooueth it mooueth circularly or
<pb facs="tcp:5427:81"/>
rounde, whiche motion alſo hath neither beeginnyng nor endyng, but is a continuall and perpetuall motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and is therefore eternall. Now, if the worldes motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bee eternall the worlde alſo muſt needes bee eternall. Thus the <hi>Peripatetikes</hi> by the figure and motion of the world, doe conclude y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the world it ſelf is alſo eternall.</p>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Truely this is a verie ſlender argumente. For firſte, who will graunt vnto them, that all the partes of the world doe mooue, by that circulare and ſphericall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? ſeeyng that, as thei them ſelues doe write, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the fire, neither the aier, neither the water, neither the earth dooe mooue by this motion, but by a right line and a pendent: to wit, the fire and aire vpwarde: the water and earth dounewarde. Moreouer, if wee deale thus liberally with them, to graunte, that the worlde is of a ſphericall fourme and figure, who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prooue notwithſtandyng, that there can bee no beeginning of motion aſſigned, and obſcrued therein? Seeyng it is not mooued of it ſelf, but by an other, too wit the greate God, or, as thei terme it, by a certeine firſte intelligence, or Angell. And whereas it is ſaied of a wheele, of a ſphere, or of a circle, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the motion there of cannot bee aſſigned in this poincte of the circumference more than in another, it is true onely in reſpecte of the thing &amp; the figure, and not if you reſpect the hande that turneth it, or the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng of the cauſe that mooueth it, in reſpect whereof, the poinct is called the beeginnyng of moouyng in the ſphere or circle, where hee beginneth to mooue it firſt, that turneth the circle, ſphere, or wheele about. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, although the worlde can haue no beginnyng of moouyng, neither of it ſelf, neither of it owne figure:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5427:81"/>
notwithſtandyng it hath of God who once beegan it, and turned it from a certeine poincte of the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and a certeine place, to wit, from the Eaſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to mooue into the Weſte, whether it turneth now daiely, beeyng by hym mooued, and not of it ſelf. And although it bee vnknowne to vs nowe, whiche parte of the circumference of heauen God firſt moued (for you ſee how many, and diuerſe thynges men dooe affirme, concernyng the greate yeere of the worlde, whiche is that ſtate of the worlde, wherein Heauen and all thinges returne to their place, where thei wer firſt created) yet it is certein, that heauen began ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme to mooue, from ſome one prefixed poincte and part of the circumference.</p>

For after ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſpaces of yeres paſte, what ſhould moue hym at length, that hee would Create the worlde? Thei de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde therefore, why GOD remained ſo long ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhe and idle, why hee ſlept ſo long, what he did then, why hee ceaſed from dooyng ſomethyng ſo long, why hee made not this noble and goodlie woorke ſooner?

But euen then, as alſo now, he was inwardly occupied in his woorkes, that is to ſay, hee was wonderfully delighted in the contemplation of hymſelf, hee enioyed then himſelf, and his perfect and vnſpeakeable glorie: hee was buſied in the moſt large and incomprehenſible light of his ſubſtance and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as may eaſily bee vnderſtoode out of the <hi>Prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> the 8. chapter, and 30. verſe: and <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 17. chapt. and 4. verſe: and likewiſe out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the 4. booke, and 28. chapter.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:5427:82"/>
nowe call Sundaye, and which the Jewes called the firſt daye of the Sabbathes, and not that which wee commonly call Munday.</p>

                  <p>Bicauſe it is euidente, that the Lorde wrought ſixe whole dayes togither, before the Sabbath &amp; ſeuenth daye. And amonge the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> in olde time, that was the Sabbath and ſeuenth daye which wee nowe call Satterdaye, whiche is the next daye, beefore Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, and next after Fridaye. For Chriſtians, to the entente that they woulde not retaine the auncient ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoneis of the Jewes, but deuoutly to honour the reſurrection of our Lorde Jeſus Chriſt, wherby ther began a new ſtate of the Church, in ſtead of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, they choſe the next daye following to reſt on, as it appeareth in the 20. Chapter of the <hi>Actes:</hi> the 1. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the 16. chapter: and the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Reuclation:</hi> and alſo it is extant in the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie:</hi> which day they called the Lords day, or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye. But, if you woulde number ſixe dayes beefore the Sabbath daye, you muſte begin vpon Sundaye, not vpon Mundaye: and ſo ſhall you haue ſixe daies, after which followeth the Sabbath, which is the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth: Thus: Firſt Sunday, then Munday. Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, Wedenſday, Thurſeday, Fryday, after which followeth the Seauenth, whiche are the Sabbath dayes. So that the Lorde began his woorke of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the worlde, vpon Sunday: which is confirmed to bee true, by a counſell holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as <hi>Euſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I will vtter, in this poinct that whiche ſeemeth vnto mee moſt likely, and I craue pardon herein, that no man thinke mee to bee curious: notwithſtanding I muſte needes vtter my minde, for that this queſtion is demaunded by many. Uerily, it ſemeth vnto mee, that the worlde was created in that moneth which is called by the Hebrues <hi>Tiſri,</hi> and is anſwereable partly vnto our moneth of Auguſt, and partly to Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: for doubtles it began after the Autumnal or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſt <hi>equinoctium.</hi> So that I doe nothinge agree vnto thoſe, that write &amp; ſuppoſe that the world was made in the Moneth of March, and in the Springe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>Can you confirme your opinion by any reaſon?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea, and that by diuerſe. And not onely this, that in the time of Autumne or Haruaſt, the earth is moſt apt to receiue the ſeedes of good fruites, as of Wheat, and Barly, and ſuch like. For at that time, it ſeemeth moſt meete and fit to conceiue, as in the Springe to bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth fruite: and in Summer to yelde them vp: and as for winter, then the earth digeſteth and concocteth the ſeedes that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto hir, and embracing them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middes of hir boſome, frameth &amp; nouriſheth them, as a mother doeth hir young, whiche, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhee bringeth foorth in the ſpring tune, when they bee ſumwhat growne: and in Summer is quite del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uered of them, as beeinge then ripe and perfecte. Wherefore, the ſpringe and Summer, doe ſeeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee as it were midwiues to the earth, than to miniſter vnto it any force, or vertue to bringe foorth: whiche vertue notwithſtandinge Autumne yeeldeth vnto the earth, as beeing yet mindefull of the firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5427:83"/>
of all thinges, and of hir owne bringinge foorth of all manner commodities, reteininge vnto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the force, effect, and power of the auncient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, which the Lorde enioyned at that time. So y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Hebrues will haue it, that this moneth <hi>Tiſri,</hi> ſhall not be ſo called of muſt or newe wine, but of iuce, wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth is full at that ſeaſon. And theſe bee the two reaſons of mine opinion. The fyrſt, for that as the ſcripture teacheth in the 28. chapter, and 9. verſe: and ſo folowinge of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> this moneth hath beene alwayes, ſince the firſte age of man, as farre as euer there can bee had any remembrance, the beeginninge of the yeare and firſt moneth. And therefore, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractes and bargaines, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and priuate affaires, and to bee briefe, in ſupputation of the yeares and age of the worlde, which was done by the yeares of <hi>Iubilee,</hi> the yeare euer beegan in this moneth among the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers in old time, and among the Jewes: and ended alſo in the ſame. So that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeares &amp; age of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and the reſidue of the Fathers whiche liued both beefore the floude and ſince, are to bee reckened from this moneth. The ſeconde reaſon is this: For that the feaſt of Trumpettes which God commaunded to bee kept vpon the firſt daye of this moneth, ſeemeth to haue beene ſpecially inſtituted by God, to the intente, that the remembraunce of the firſt originall and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde, whiche was doone vppon that day might bee holily preſerued &amp; continued in the Church. Truely, it was not in vaine, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord would haue that day kept holy, &amp; ſo great honour &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto theſe trumpettes &amp; Inſtruments whiche wee reade, at that time, were ſo toſſed &amp; blowne. But
<pb facs="tcp:5427:84"/>
by that great and pleaſant ſownd, hee ment to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and put in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce, men, &amp; the whole world alſo, of their firſt natiuitie, which as by the ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of God, it fell vpon the firſte daye of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſo was it godlily and reuerently renued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the Church, that the world might not bee ignorant of it owne byrth daye. Whereby alſo it came to paſſe, that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded many feaſtes and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies to bee kept in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeauenth moneth, which moneth was called alſo <hi>Aetanim,</hi> that is to ſaye, the Moneth of ſtrength or ſtrong thinges. 1. Kinges, the 8. chap. and 2. verſe. Yea, ſome ſaye alſo, that our Sauiour Chriſt was borne the ſame moneth, and not without ſome reaſon.</p>

                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>But it is ſaide in the 12. Chapter, and 1. verſe of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,</hi> that <hi>Niſan</hi> was the firſt moneth of the yeare, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering vnto our monethes of March and April, and falling in the Uernall or Springe <hi>equinoctium</hi>

                  <p>You ſay well. But therevnto I anſwere two waies: Firſt, that <hi>Niſan</hi> or March was not alwayes the bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeere, but at length after that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſraell</hi> returned out of <hi>Egyt,</hi> in the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of ſo great a benefite, that is to ſay, for the conſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the memorie of the newe founding &amp; reſtoaringe of that people. Moreouer, <hi>Niſan</hi> was not the beegin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the yeere, for all things that were done among the people of God, but onely in reſpect of their holie &amp; feſtiuall daies, and of the tabernacle. For the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as it had it owne peculiare reuolution, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe from the common: ſo had it alſo a proper begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of the yeere, not agreeing with the order of the Politike yeere: to the intent that men mighte knowe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5427:84"/>
that there was a difference too bee put beetweene the Politike and Eccleſiaſtical gouernment, and that the reaſon of them both is diuerſe, and their nature ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſtinct.</p>

                  <p>Euen by this ſhort reckninge. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the creation of the world vnto the generall diluge, whiche happened in the daies of <hi>Noe,</hi> are numbred in the Hiſtorie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures 1656. yeeres. And from the diluge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the promiſe whiche God made firſte vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his departing vpon commaundment out of <hi>Vr,</hi> a Citie of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and <hi>Charris</hi> a citie of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> are 427. yeeres. And from that promiſe, vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was vnder <hi>Moſes,</hi> are 430. yeeres, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the 12. chapter, and 40. verſe of <hi>Exodus.</hi> And from the departure out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> vnto the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the building of <hi>Salomons</hi> temple, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the fourth yeere of <hi>Salomons</hi> reigne, are 480. yeeres, as it appeareth the 1. <hi>Kinges,</hi> and 6. chap. And from that tyme, vnto the leading away of the Jewes into the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I meane that whiche beegan vnder King <hi>Ioachim,</hi> are about 167. yeres, or ſumwhat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe. In this captiuitie the people aboade the ſpace of 70. yeeres, according as <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet foretold them in the 25. chapter. And from the departure of the
<pb facs="tcp:5427:85"/>
Jewes out of the captiuitic of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and from the day of the publication of <hi>Cyrus</hi> edict concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueryng and ſendyng home of the Jewes into their owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, vnto the paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are 70. weekes of yeeres, that is to ſaye, 490. yeeres, as the Prophet Daniell writeth: <hi>Daniell</hi> the 9. chapter. And from the paſſion of Chriſt vnto this our preſent tyme, are 1578. yeeres. So that if all theſe numbers be gathered too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one ſumme, they make 5298. whiche is the diſtance of yeeres ſince the creation of the worlde: although the Rabbines of the Jewes do diſſent from this ſumme of yeres.

For thei had it then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte and whole, that is to ſaie, in no parte failyng: at that tyme ſounde and ſtrong, and not as it is nowe, weake, ſicke, and wounded. So that the Nature of Heauen and Earth was moſte perfecte, and likewiſe of all Beaſtes and liuyng thynges, Hearbes, Trees,
<pb facs="tcp:5427:86"/>
and other creatures of God: their ſtrength alſo pliant and forcible, and not as thei bee now adaies, weake and imperfect, ſcarce able to ſuſteine themſelues, or to doe theyr duety and function, neyther alwaies able to dooe it. Moreouer, if wee conſider the beautie of thoſe thynges, and of the whole worlde as it was made at the firſte, in reſpecte whereof, bothe the whole worlde was good, and euery one of his partes were good. For thei had in themſelues a merueilous comelineſſe of outward fourme and ſhape, and gliſtering beautie: thei were pleaſant and delectable to beholde, and had due and conuenient proportion of all the partes and members in euery bodie: in reſpecte whereof, and alſo for that as yet there remaine many tokens of it, it is now at this daie called by the <hi>Grecians Koſmos,</hi> of the comelineſſe thereof. Thei had alſo a wounderfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in reſpecte of the whole worlde. For euery thyng was by GOD placed in conuenient and apte place moſte wiſely, and thei agreed among themſelues with wounderfull concorde, and mutuall good will one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another: and heauen was anſwerable too the earth, and the earth to heauen, ſo farre foorthe and at what tyme the one had neede to helpe the other.

To bee ſhorte, the profite alſo and commoditie of theſe thynges, as thei were by GOD created, was very greate, in reſpect wherof the whole worlde, and all his partes were called good. For the

For in deed they haue ſo in them, and the Lorde himſelfe teſtifieth the ſame. And therefore, much leſſe that wee ought to condemne, diſpraiſe, and mocke at ſo excellent woorkes of God, bicauſe of the confuſion and diſorder which nowe is in them through Mans tranſgreſſion, as did that blaſphemous felowe <hi>Momus</hi> and the <hi>Mamchees,</hi> and <hi>Marcianite</hi> heretikes. For wee cannot ſo doe with out offeringe greate iniurie vnto God, and in ſo doeing, wee take the Lordes name in vaine. Wherefore, the <hi>Mamchees,</hi> are to bee condemned, and whoſoeuer elſe doe contende that the creatures of themſelues, and as God firſt made them, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. For that is moſt falſe, as it appeareth in the 1. to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the 4. Chapter, and 4. verſe. Moreouer, this admonition and ſayinge mooueth mee not to diſpute this queſtion whiche certaine curious felowes haue doone, to wit, whether God could haue created euery particulare thing, or the whole worlde better: or now coulde if neede were frame it in more abſolute ſtate, than hee firſt created it.

our owne wandringe mindes? For God made all things that hee created, very good.

Thus they ſaye colde thinges and hotte, highe and lowe, white and blacke, greate and ſmall were firſt created, to the ende that the force of things might bee preſerued in a certaine temperament, by theſe contraries. This is written in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> the 42. chapter, and 25. verſe: and the 33. Chapter, &amp; 15.

                  <p>It is true whiche you ſay. For God made not althin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at the firſte of one qualitie, colour, and greatnes, neither of one kind and nature. But hee made ſome high ſome lowe, ſome moyſt ſome drie, ſome warme ſome cold, the day to bee one thing and the night ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet God made nothing that was eeuill. But why hee created them in ſuche varietie, this is the cauſe: both for that the power and wiſedome of God is thereby more apparant: and alſo the thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by this repugnancie of contrarie vertues and natures, and mitigacion of them, may bee the more eaſely preſerued. For what maner ſtate of thinges would there haue bin, if all thinges had bin hoat? what numneſſe, if all thinges had bin cold? what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, if all wayes there had bin darknes? what wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſomneſſe, if it had alwaies bin daye? And therefore when God had created the natures of this worlde, and of the thinges conteined therein, hee thought it conuenient to refreſh and eaſe them with change and courſe, becauſe they were bodies, or apperteinyng to bodies: and likewiſe to nouriſhe them with a certein mutuall knot and temperament, bicauſe they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe partes of one whole thyng: hee ingraffed alſo contrarie qualities in them, that the one ſhould bee a let, bridle, and temperament to the other. And to bee ſhort, to the intent there ſhould bee chaunge and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in theſe thinges, that there might bee ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce plainly perceiued beetweene the eſſence of them and of the angels, &amp; alſo of God hymſelf, who needeth
<pb facs="tcp:5427:90"/>
no ſutch meanes for his preſeruation. Euen ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a well gouerned citie conſiſteth of ſundry orders and of diuerſe fortes of men, ritche, poore, faire, foule, Subiectes, Magiſtrates, young, olde, Huſbandmen, Souldiours, who are of diuerſe ſtates and vnlike callinges, and many tymes alſo of contrarie. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they bee neceſſarie for the preſeruation of the mutuall ſafetie of the whole citie, wherby it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cummeth the more beautifull, the more plentifull and conuenient for the vſe of this life. And therfore I will confirme this opinion with the moſte excellent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who in the 45. chapter of his <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticum,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>which reaſon made the vniuerſalitie out of diuerſitie, that all thinges might appeare togither from many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into an vnitie: out of voyd and ſound: out of liuyng and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuyng: out of comprehenſible and incomprehenſible: out of light and darknes, and out of life and death.</hi> Neither doe wee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, fauour the errour of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who hold opinion, that at the beeginning there were twoo Giauntes whiche afflicted mutually one another, one of the light, and another of darknes.

the ſpace of thoſe ſixe dayes, &amp; reſted the ſeauenth day. God ſanctified, ſayth S. <hi>Auguſtine, <hi>no day of hys woorke, but onely the day of his reſt, that it might bee vnderſtoode that God is more bleſſed than his woorkes. For hee was delighted with none of his woorkes ſo much as with himſelfe. So hee ſanctified the daye of his reſt, and not of his woorke.</hi>
                     </hi> And nowe bycauſe wee are come to the day of Gods reſt, let vs reſte alſo in this place, and make an ende of this diſputation whiche wee erewhile began. So much as may ſeeme can bee ſaide generally concernyng the creation of the world, and the firſt beeginning of all things apperteining vnto Chriſtian Naturall Philoſophie, wee haue heere for the moſt part declared. And wee giue thankes vnto God, for that hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs a minde and abilitie to write thoſe things which wee haue heere declared.(:)</p>
