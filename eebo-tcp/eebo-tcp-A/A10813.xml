            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This <hi>Thelarchus,</hi> in the blooming of his Princelie yeares, deſirous to leaue iſſue to his Noble houſe, ioyned in marriage with <hi>Alinda,</hi> daughter and ſole heire to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> by whome in ſhort time after their Nuptials, he had iſſue one daughter, who was named <hi>Nutania,</hi> (This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) as in comelineſſe of perſon ſhee exceeded, ſo for her beautie, wiſdome and other good graces, there liued none her equall: the reporte of whoſe excellence, as Fame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth with her loudeſt trump the honorable (eſpecially) ſuch péereleſſe creatures, as this Princeſſe (yea) ſo highlie ſtood-ſhee graced in the Gods fauour, that none but <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanias</hi> beautie was remembred in moſt Princes Courts, both Chriſtian and heathen.</p>
            <p>The renowme of whoſe peereleſſe beautie, ſo often bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, came to the hearing of <hi>Dionicus,</hi> ſon and heir apparant of the <hi>Numidian</hi> King, who vpon the ſurpaſſing praiſes by

euery one giuen of this Lady, begun more and more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hearing ſuch ſeuerall reportes, to conceiue an inwarde ioy of her, diligently hearkening to each ſtranger which ſhould recount her vertues, and honour by vertue gayned. Long had not this humour followed the louely Prince <hi>Dionicus,</hi> but loue the ſoueraign guide of mens thoughts, had ſo enthralled him, that all his delight was in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating of this Princeſſe beautie, yea ſo was he ouertaken in loues ſnare, that nothing was pleaſing vnto him, but the ſwéete remembrance of <hi>Nutania:</hi> ſo much was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that oftentimes, in the midſt of his paſtimes, calling the Princeſſe to minde, he would as one paſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, altogether ouercome with melancholy, abandon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of his moſt familiars, ſéeking fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their pleaſing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes ſome ſolitary place, where he might vnheard or ſéen recount w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> large amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the Princeſſe beauty, whoſe ſeruant in mind he was wholly vowed.

ſome their vertuous ſubiectes, or taking pittie of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, as wee read in holie writ, teſtimony of our ſoules comfort, how <hi>Abraham</hi> beloued of God, mooued his diuine Deitie for thoſe Cities for ſinne by his iuſt iudgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, if fiue godlie people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had bene founde within their walles, they had bene preſerued: ſo either for the vertues of the King, or the interceſſion of thoſe ſorrowing ſubiects, the giuer of all comfort ſent them comforte, as you ſhall heare.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Numedian</hi> King, whoſe prime of youth was ſpent in manie honourable actions, holding in great regard the loue of his neighbour Princes, liued in ſuch tranquility, that he was honoured of all that heard of his gouernment. The report of whoſe long ſickneſſe and weake eſtate, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Kings of diuers regions, by their embaſſage, to comfort them, and to bee aduertized of the trueth of their eſtates. Amongſt which thoſe honorable Princes that held his health in ſuch regard, <hi>Thelarchus</hi> King of <hi>Thrace</hi> diſpatched his Ambaſſadour. Who for the more honour of their King, was accompanied with diuers Gentlemen, both of honour and great worſhip.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ambaſſadors ariuing at the Court of <hi>Numedia,</hi> their cauſe of comming vnknowne, many matters were of the commons ſuppoſed (who will entermeddle with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces affairs) ſo that amongſt them diuers things were ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, and ſundrie dangers ſuſpected, but no aſſurance of anie, vntill their day of hearing, which the king appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be as ſodaine as they could require.</p>
            <p>Againſt which time royall preparation was made, with all the pompe could be deuiſed, where for feaſting there wanted no daintie, how rare ſoeuer, nor diuerſitie of Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andes to pleaſe the appetite, with many pleaſing ſhowes, and paſtimes, the better to giue them occaſion of welcome: all which, notwithſtanding the Kings weakneſſe, was ſo exquiſitlie performed, that it was admirable.</p>
            <p>The day of hearing come (as time ſtayeth not) <hi>Manpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:26186:11"/>
hauing ſummoned his councell and chiefeſt Nobilitie, againſt that time to attende his pleaſure: theſe ſeuerall Ambaſſadors were brought to his preſence, where with more ſhewe of hartie welcome, then his weak bodie could deliuer, hee gaue them ſuch honourable entertainment, as beſéemed the meſſengers of ſuch Princes, and highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented them, whoſe curteſie the ſtrangers Nobles applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and gréeued the more at his extremity, by how much the more they ſaw his debilitie.</p>
            <p>After ſome talke paſſed betwéen the King and theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and that hee had enquired with all kindneſſe of the health of their Princes, and welfare of their countries, and receiued their Letters with diuers Princelie preſentes, they were diſmiſſed, but yet not ſuffered to depart, without gracious thanks to their kinges, and kind ſhew of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of their paines, leauing them to their repoſe, with great charge to his Nobles and thoſe in authoritie, to ſée their entertainment ſuch, as if their ſoueraigne Lordes were preſent: which charge was not forgotten of thoſe which prized their Princes honours as dear as their liues, but with ſuch pompe and coſte accompliſhed each ſeuerall commaunde of his Highneſſe: as the Strangers might wel admire to beholde it. Their diets ſo diuerſe and ſo aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as they had neuer ſéene the like, furniſhed with ſo much ſundrie muſicke, and ſo cunningy vſed, as might well delight the Goddes. To acquaint you with other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, for recreation, as Playes, Maſkes, Tilting, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying, Barriours, and other Courtly paſtimes, beſides, their hunting of Tygers, wilde Bores, and Lyons, which mooued ſuche delight, as other ſportes pleaſure vnto them. Thus in vſing dayly thoſe pleaſures, when the Nobles had ſpent ſome time in the Court, euerie one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his royall entertainment, hearing amongſt the Nobles of the countrie ſuch generall honour of the Prince <hi>Dionicus,</hi> whome they had not yet ſeene, an eſpeciall deſire mooued them to viſite the Prince, bewayling greatly that mooued

            <p>The Prince <hi>Dionicus,</hi> albeit the imbecility of his body denied thoſe nobles his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at their paſtimes, in which ſeueral ſport he much delighted, yet that they might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of him vnſéen, he commanded a ſumptuous banquet in his lodging to be ordained: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o which he inuited the ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger Nobles &amp; their companies: who wiſhing to ſée the Prince, were as glad to accompany him, as hee deſirous of their companie, and graciouſly with many humble thankes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Princes good wil. The youthfull Nobles atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the Prince, carefull to ſée each thing ordered, for the honour of his Maieſtie, wanted nothing that might bée deſired, only exſpected the comming of their gueſtes, who not vnmindful of their promiſe, as dinner time drew nigh, prepared themſelues towards the Prince, vnto whome by his Nobility in moſt gorgious maner, they were conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: no ſooner entred they his preſence, but <hi>Dionicus,</hi> whoſe curteſie was ſuch as gained the loue of his ſubiects, and all ſtrangers that had ſéen his demeanor, yet at this time had better knowledge how to entertaine them, then abilitie to performe what he would, ſtretching himſelfe in his bed, as his weake limbes would ſuffer him, hee gaue them ſuch harty welcoms, as highly contented them, &amp; beſéemed their eſtates. Theſe Nobles when they had made their eies wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, of what report had ſo often bruted, rather accuſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of great wrong, in not giuing him ſuch due as hée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, then of ouer much praiſe: for that the fame bruted of him, was not to be valued with his woorthineſſe. The time of dinner paſſed they, with many glaunces on the Prince, noting his curteſie, but euer lamenting his griefe, &amp; wiſhing his health, framing them ſelues to pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, to put him from thoſe melancholie thoughtes, wherewith hée was ouer much burthened. Thus with much diuerſitie of table talke, conſumed the time, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſort, of matters for benefite of the ſtate: the gréener
<pb facs="tcp:26186:12"/>
heades whoſe yeares required no other cares of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing paſtimes and pleaſure, the managing their horſes, commending the ſtatelineſſe of their bodies, their ſineneſſe in careyring their brauerie in their Coruet, and excellent ſwiftneſſe in their gallop, their readines in hand, and their courage in the face of the enemie: not omitting the gallant cryes of their hounds, nor forgetting, by which and which, ſuch a bucke was ſlaine, and ſuch a Stag puld down, paſſing not, without high commending the ſoring of their hawkes, nor forgetting their ſtatelineſſe in flight, with their fearce ſeazing on their game. And then for variety, as occaſion is miniſtred, Carowſe a health to their Miſtreſſe and Loues, in their country.</p>
            <p>The Prince as louely as the beſt, &amp; in his health as wel able to performe whatſoeuer, had his greateſt comfort in liſtening to the talke of <hi>Cariolus</hi> and <hi>Octauius,</hi> two noble men of <hi>Thrace,</hi> which accompanied of pleaſure <hi>Atlautus,</hi> the chiefe in commiſſion for their king. <hi>Dionicus</hi> earneſtlie noting theſe two Nobles of <hi>Thrace,</hi> as moſt delighted with their perſons and pleaſant parlie, heard <hi>Cariolus</hi> carowſe a health to the Princeſſe <hi>Nutania:</hi> whoſe name the diſtreſſed Prince no ſooner heard vttered, but the remembrance of that ſwéet obiect, his liues ſole health, and miſtreſſe of his fancies, ſo reuiued his dying ſpirits, that ſuddenly the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders might wel perceiue his wan cullour, which argued a troubled ſhirit, to vaniſh, and thoſe vermilion died roſes, the woonted badges, &amp; ornaments of his ſwéet face, challenge their former intreſt, and for a time poſſeſſe them, reſtoring vnto Nature her due, making his louelie countenance as chearfull to the beholders, as the glorious Sun to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued, whoſe liberty being depriued, haue long bin debarred of al worldly delights, &amp; ſeldom receiued comfort from that heauenlie eſſence. This chearful alteration in the Prince was noted of diuers, whoſe eares, albeit buſied in liſtening to the diſcourſes of theſe ſtrangers; yet the eies of his own attendants, with dutiful care, gaue héede vnto the Prince.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Octauius,</hi> who was wiſe and well demeaned, perceiuing this parlie begun in ieſt, likely to end in quarrell, noting likewiſe, how the reſt of the company ceaſed their ſerious talk, to attend them, with a ſmiling countenance, as one not poſſeſt with choller, brake off his talke thus.</p>
            <p>Why (my Lord) ſhall matter of ſo ſmall moment cauſe friends to iarre? What is beauty, whereof we haue ſo long diſputed, and ſo highly of vs regarded? nothing but a fading pleaſure, an ornament of the face which maketh the heart proud, and draweth the mind from euery good motion, to manie odious offences, whereby the honorable in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diſhonourable actions, are ſo blemiſhed, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a common by-word to the verieſt drudge that Nature hath framed. <hi>Helena</hi> was faire, and accounted the onely of her time, yet who ſo much ſcorned? <hi>Creſſida</hi> beautiful, yet who more falſe? If beautie be attended on with ſuch ſhame as theſe two famous women gained, why ſhould wee care who is beautifull? My ſwéet <hi>Cariolus</hi> miſtake me not, if I haue paſſed my iudgement raſhly, for neither care I whoſe fame in that caſe is eſtéemed or defamed, but paſſe them by as things of no regard; onely for argument I haue ſpoken more then either I regard or account of: therefore let not this be any breach of our friendſhip, for I proteſt, if thou

ſhouldſt ſay, the white Swanne were as blacke as the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Ocean drie, and ſhippes floting on the maine, I would affirme it, rather than our friendſhip ſhould bee for ſuch a matter diſcontinued.</p>
            <p>Well <hi>Octauius</hi> (quoth <hi>Cariolus</hi>) I finde your kindneſſe great, &amp; wil thank you for it, but truſt mee, this gloze may not ſerue your turn, for as you haue ſpoken hereſie againſt Beauty, and maintained a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger before your home-born Ladies, you ſhal either recant your Iudgment, before our ſoueraigne Princeſie <hi>Nutania,</hi> or receiue ſuch penance, by your queſt aſſigned, which I promiſe thée ſhall be all hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ladies. Oh my Lord (anſwered <hi>Octauius</hi>) I hope I ſhal find your H. more kinde, then for ſo ſmall an offence to deliuer your friend priſoner at the bar, where the parties ſhal be Iudges, &amp; my Iurie ſuch, as all lawes allowe me to appeal from, if you ſhould, &amp; my fault ſuch, as if my life were in their trial depending, I might wel make my teſtament, &amp; diſpoſe of what I poſſeſſe, hartily deſiring God to receiue my ſoul, for ſure I am, my body ſhuld not long inioy breath; for no greater corraſiue can be offered that Ser, then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the honor of ſuch a prize to any one particular, they all ſtanding on tearmes of beauty, as the Crowe which thinks her owne birds faireſt: ſo women how ill-faced and wrinkled ſoeuer they be, may not endure to hear any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, if happily they ſhuld hear it ſpoken by ſuch as they dare not in ſpeech diſpleaſe, yet wil their countenance ſhew their hearts diſcontent, by ſcrowling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> browes, hanging the lip, or ſetting a ſwéet face, as ſugred as the galle, or by ſome ſuch outward action or other, ſhal you find where that nipt her, for which offence looked ſhe neuer ſo highly, with Bell, Booke and Candle, you ſhall bée curſſed, and neuer more come in <hi>Paternoſter,</hi> how déepe ſoeuer you haue bene in her <hi>Creed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hold, hold, <hi>Octauius,</hi> quoth <hi>Cariolus,</hi> too much of one thing is good for nothing: Thou haſt plaid the excellent Orator. Who had thought your Lordſhips experience had bin ſuch,

Farre was it from my thought, that euer you woulde with ſuch earneſtneſſe haue defended our faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but ſince I ſée you are ſo great an Aduocate, I will cauſe you to haue thanks for it at our return, other reward I dare promiſe none.

            <p>A Nouice art thou <hi>Dionicus,</hi> and neuer came to knowe what many a hardy man at armes hath endured, hiſtories are diuers, which ſhewe the extreames of Princes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conquerors, that they endured through loue, yet haſt thou neuer read of any that euer wooed by ſilence, courted their miſtreſſes with imaginations, or obtained their loue being mute: Longer maiſt thou ſmother thy griefe, which may cureles, conſume thée: fire ſuppreſſed, burneth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more vehemencie, and loue concealed, conſumeth the intrals, and ſlayeth remedileſſe.

I, thus <hi>Dionicus</hi> ſhould be thy thoughts, holde thée there, and no doubt of good ſucceſſe: <hi>Nutania</hi> is but a woman though a Princeſſe, thou ſonne to a King, and no way her inferiour.

            <p>Scantly had hée ended this his tedious premeditation, when worde was brought vnto him by one of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that the Lorde <hi>Cariolus</hi> was come to viſite him, which did put him from all further imaginations at that time.</p>

Thus when long time was ſpent betweene them, diſcourſing of manie matters, to both their contentes, <hi>Dionicus</hi> called for meat; where to accompanie <hi>Cariolus,</hi> he receiued more ſuſtenance than he had in manie dayes before, to the great ioy of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Barnardine,</hi> who by meſſengers certified the King and Quéene thereof, who ioyed, and were not a little comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at this report.</p>

was vnto melancholy, vndertaking on his faith and honeſt reputation, how euer the occaſion grew, it was not in mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: aſſuring him, the Prince when he ſhould call to mind this vnkind action, would with griefe lament it, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for the ſame, ſubmit himſelfe, crauing hearty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe for his raſhneſſe.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Dionicus,</hi> whoſe paſſion had not it left him, albeit in his health none might more perſwade him then <hi>Barnardine,</hi> yet hearing him preach repentance, being in this humour, forgate their paſſed friendſhip, and moued with his talke, albeit it was vſed for his good, with a looke as gaſtly, as a ghoaſt riſen from the graue, drew neare <hi>Barnardine,</hi> and laying hands on him, had like to haue miſchieued him, had he not made the more ſpéed away.</p>

            <p>The Nobles whoſe griefe was not little, with hearts ouer charged with ſorrow, thinking it not conuenient to leaue him alone, doubting ſom worſe matter ſhuld happen vnto him, went to viſit the Prince chéerfully, enquiring of his welfare, which with ſo good countenances as he could vſe, was kindly anſwered of the Prince: who hauing paſt the extremitie of his fury, calling to minde thoſe notable

In this furie, reſoluing to haue miſchiefed himſelfe, his Nobles taking him in their Armes, with ſuch comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpéeches as they could, pacified him, who ſéeing his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfulneſſe, were partakers of his grief, and much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his extremitie, as men might for their Soueraign. Yet caſting of care, ſeeking the beſt for their quiet they could, they laid him in his bed, where, with ſolemne muſicke they procured him to ſléepe. Where for a time I leaue him.</p>
            <p>Time that finiſheth all things, hath now wrought an end of the Kings affaires, for the diſpatch of the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, whome the King with great entertainment and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of high eſtéeme, ſo rewarded, as they all had cauſe to ſpeake of his royall bountie. The Embaſſadors receiuing their Letters, and the time appointed for their departure, their ſhips with victuals at the Kings coſt repleniſhed, and all other neceſſaries, <hi>Cariolus</hi> who had bene often ſolicited by <hi>Barnardine,</hi> to viſit the Prince, and by his report whoſe word was of account with all that had knowledge of his ſimple dealings, was perſwaded of the Princes ſorrow, for the wrong offered him. Wherefore that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto <hi>Dionicus,</hi> he departed not in diſpleaſure, but that he had forgotten all wrongs offered, kindly, before his departure, came to take his leaue. Where, vpon the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous demeanour of the Prince, who manifeſted his griefe by the aboundance of ſighes which he powred foorth, they were reconciled, and an inuiolably league of friendſhip vowed betwéene them: which with ſolemne oathes they proteſted, ſhould neuer quaile in either of them.</p>
            <p>The haſt of the noble Embaſſadors who deſired to be with their Loues at home, is more now then <hi>Cariolus</hi> wiſhed: But what muſt be, ſhall be, how loth ſoeuer. Wherefore after many friendly gratulations betwéene them, and great gifts of the Prince, on his new <hi>(Amico)</hi> beſtowed, they take leaue each of other, <hi>Cariolus</hi> ſolemnely praying for the Princes health, and <hi>Dionicus</hi> wiſhing him all happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus all thinges fitted by the King commaund, they
<pb facs="tcp:26186:21"/>
were honourably conducted vnto the Porte, where their ſhippes readie furniſhed, attended their comming: where they had not long ſtayed, but a faire winde to ſerue their turnes, God ſent them; and they embarqued themſelues, each one for his ſeuerall country, and the Nobles returned to the Court; where to their carefull regard of their king, Countries benefite, we leaue them, to let you knowe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prince; whoſe is troubled, as you ſhall heare.</p>
            <p>The Prince, whom Nature had formed ſo exquiſite in lineaments of body, as could be required, hauing wiſdome and valour enferiour to none, when he had conſidered with great wiſdome from poynt to point, the extremitie of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and found that his diſeaſe was grieuous, and ſo great, that he rather deſired death, than life, in that agonie to bée continued; weying all dangers which might befall him, in ſéeking ſecretly for ſuch helpe, as by his owne induſtrie he could procure: with the pleaſures and hearts content, the obtaining of his loues delight, would bring him; reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie determined, as much as he might, to cheriſh himſelfe: and diſguiſing himſelf in habite of a traueller, vnknowne of any man, ſo ſoone as his ſtrength would permit him, hée departed his Countrie towards <hi>Thrace,</hi> and either gaine his Ladie, or trie in ſhorte time the fickleneſſe of fortune: hazarding all on this reſt, he ſecretely procureth all his Iewels, and ſuch ſummes of money as hée coulde: and by little and little recouering himſelfe, vſed his woonted familiarity amongſt the Nobles, and Courtiours; which did cauſe no ſmall content and heartes ioye in the King, Quéene and Commons; yea, ſuch was the generall reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the whole people in the Realme, for his recouery, that there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not one, which ſhewed not ſome ſigne of gladnes by his outward appearance.</p>
            <p>As there is not the cleareſt day which is not ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſome cloud, ſo laſted this ioy amongſt theſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſubiects not long: for <hi>Dionicus</hi> continuing his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed his ſummes of mony and Iewels into a

groue within the Parke neare the Court, at ſuch ſeuerall times as he would chuſe to be ſolitarie, wrought ſo cloſe, and with ſuch diſcretion, that he was altogither vnpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of any man.</p>
            <p>Each thing wrought to his content, ſecretly in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, his companions by him appointed to kéep the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers from idleneſſe, by ſuch paſtimes as he had deuiſed, as Maſking, Barriors, Dycing, and other recreations, whom he refuſed to accompanie, alleaging that he might not be long abſent from the King, and that his ſport determined, was to recreate the Quéene, who ſince her ſickneſſe was verie melancholie, which coyned excuſe paſſed for currant, as what was it they would not credit which hée ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus politikely fitted all things, ſupper ended, and euerie one attending the beginning of the ſportes and paſtimes, <hi>Dionicus</hi> who had more ſtringes to his Harpe then one, had no care but how to conuey himſelfe from their preſence, which hée tooke opportunitie to doo, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Quéene mother hée had giuen his word to be one of the Maſkers, which ſhée being glad of, as reioycing to remooue his melancholy by anie meanes, ſuffered him to depart.</p>
            <p>But too ſoone alas, gaue ſhée credite to his feined ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which turned them all to great ſorrow and heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for <hi>Dionicus</hi> minding leaſt what they ſuppoſed he moſt ioyed in, conueyed himſelfe with all the haſt he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could into the Parke, where his footeman attended his comming with his horſe, on which hée was no ſooner mounted, to driue ſuſpition or iealous thoughts of his late trauaile from his man, hée commaunded him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, to ſpéede him with all the haſte he might, vnto the houſe of a Knight dwelling not farre off, with a deuiſed meſſage, pretending the buſineſſe to be of great waight and importaunce, and ſtraightly charging him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thence before his comming, which ſhould be the
<pb facs="tcp:26186:22"/>
next night. With this commaundement the ſeruaunt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, leaſt ſuſpecting the loſſe of ſo bountifull a maiſter was ſo neare. But the Prince whoſe chiefeſt content was in beholding the <hi>Idia</hi> of that Paragon whom Fame had ſo extolled, had his heart fired with deſire, that he thought euerie day a yeare, and euerie minute a moneth, vntill hée beheld the excellencie of Natures worke, the onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed worke of Bewtie, and the ſoueraigne goddeſſe of his thoughts: of which <hi>Dionicus</hi> hauing no ſmall regard, doubting to be miſſed of the King, and loth to loſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, poaſteth with all ſpéed vnto the groue where his coyne and Iewels laie, where the better to eſcape the ſuſpition of Officers in his paſſage, croſſing the ſeas, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himſelfe in the habit of a marchant, which he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die prouided for that purpoſe: and ſo making ſmall ſtaie, he ceaſeth not his coriours pace, nor ſpareth any horſ fleſh, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he came to the port where he pretended to imbarke him ſelfe. No ſooner arriued he at that ſo long deſired place, but Fortune who had bent his thoughts to trauaile, entending after her many croſſes to ſauce his ſowre with ſome ſwéets, and like a comfortable Phiſition, after many bitter Pilles miniſtred for cloying the ſtomacke of his Patient, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him with ſome conſarue or other more pleaſing his appetite, ſo the Prince now in the beginning of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, found this fauour, to arme him with the better hope of enſuing good: for at his firſt comming to the Citie, after enquiry made for ſome ſhip bound for <hi>Thrace,</hi> he had intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of a Barke alreadie haled out of the harbourgh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the roade, her yardes croſſed, and her Marriners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the comming a boord of the maiſter and her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts, and ſo to depart. Which newes how pleaſing it was to the prince, ſuppoſe you gentils, that haue your harts ſo full fraught with deſire as this noble <hi>Dionicus,</hi> who no ſooner was informed hereof, but diligently went himſelfe to ſearch the maiſter &amp; marchants of this ſhip, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he found in an Oſtria, carowſing healthes to their good voyage, and
<pb facs="tcp:26186:23"/>
taking leaue of their friends in the citie: to whoſe company the Prince being come; albeit nothing acquainted with the conditions of thoſe people, yet he ſo framed his behauiour to his habit, that it might haue bene admired amongſt the Courtiers, his quaint behauiour, had they bene beholders thereof; pleaſing ſo well theſe humorous companions with his carowſing, curteſie, and bountifull expences, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he could require was denyed him. A woonder it were to tell you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he required paſſage, with what willingnes they graunted it, and what large proffers were made him of their cabbins, and other ſea curteſies: all which he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch kindneſſe, and none more welcome than <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus;</hi> who ſtanding on thornes to be cleare of his land, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue enforced without regard of father, crowne, or ſubiects, to leaue, he haſteneth the reſt aboord: of whoſe company the Mariners were not a litle ioyfull, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the wind ſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſuch pleaſing maner, to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their deſired hauen, whither (following the Maſters direction for their courſe, ſailing with a faire gale, we leaue them for a time, to tell you of the griefe of <hi>Manpelius,</hi> the <hi>Numedian</hi> king, for the loſſe of his ſon, of whom no maner of news might be heard.</p>
            <p>You haue heard Gentles, with what pollicie the prince wrought, the better to bring his purpoſed intent to paſſe, and what ſeuerall paſtimes, were by him deuiſed: in which ſeuerall actions, it was ſuppoſed by the Courtiers, himſelf would haue bene a chiefe, or at leaſt, a beholder of their ſportes. But hée which had more hammers working in his brains than one; taking that time as fitteſt for his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, gaue them a cauſe of great ſorrow, as you ſhall heare. Whoſe ſportes ended, and euerie thing with great credite to the actors, and pleaſure to the beholders finiſhed, the King and Quéene, whome age nowe called to reſt, after kinde countenances, and manie thanks to the Noble men &amp; Gentiles, bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good night, who were in all humblenes and heartie loue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to their reſts, wher let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſt, vntil the newes of their ſons departure be brought them,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:23"/>
by the wofull <hi>Barnardine,</hi> whoſe hearts ſurcharged with ſorrow, could hardly be comforted, but that through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of his griefe, he had reſigned his lateſt gaſpe to him who firſt gaue him breath.</p>
            <p>This wofull newes was two whole dayes and more kept from the king, by that mirrour of fidelitie <hi>Barnardine,</hi> who by all meanes either Art or trauell could imagine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after the Prince, but of him could heare no tydings, whereby many ſuppoſed hee was ſlaine: ſome coniectured one thing, ſome another. But moſt of al the King &amp; Quéen, their happineſſe was ſuch as may not without great effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of teares be remembred, which cauſed a generall griefe throughout the whole Regiment. But neither ſorrow of the ſubiects, nor lamentation of their King, might recall him who they all ſo much deſired to ſée, which cauſed the King ouercharged with melancholy, rather deſiring death then life, breathe out theſe ſpéeches.</p>
            <p>Vnhappie <hi>(Manpelius)</hi> and more vnhappie, in being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſo graceleſſe a childe, (oh <hi>Dionicus</hi>) why haue I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſée thée growne a man? tenderly caring to bring thée to that eſtate? and now my chiefeſt hope was in thée to haue comfort, thus by thy vnkind demeanour, to cauſe my grief: how happie be thoſe parents whoſe children liue in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but thriſe accurſed thoſe fathers which giueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bridle of youth into their hands, who ought to be held in, as the Colt vntamed, with the hardeſt bit. Though wiſedome preſageth lawes of gouernment to fathers, and experience of the Auncient which haue liued in elder times giueth aduiſe, crying out of ſuch as giueth libertie to yonglings, yet law of nature whereunto we vnhappie parents are too much tyed, forgetting all counſels, are ſo beſotted on thoſe careleſſe yonglings, that if they deſire any thing, whether it be profitable for their inſtruction, or haleth them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, it may not be denied them: how many of high eſtate by the careleſſe regarde of their vntoward children, haue bene brought to great heauineſſe? Or who taking
<pb facs="tcp:26186:24"/>
pleaſure in his ofſpring, can ſée him reſtrained, (I but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie man) haſt thou not heard the learned Surgion often tell his tender Patient, that it is better to ſmart once, then endure griefe euer. And thou that mighteſt haue kept thy deare ſonne vnder his Tutors cuſtodie, wherein he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in obedience, might ſo haue had him ſtill, if thy owns fooliſhneſſe had not bene ſo careleſſe of him. Then ſince thou haſt bene the cauſe of thine owne ſorrow, blame thy ſelfe, and ſigh to think on thy follies: and as thou haſt bene the originall of this miſchiefe, not onely robbing thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of a towarde braunch to ſuccéede thée, but haſt loſt to thy ſelfe the ioy of a father, in wanting thy ſonne, thy lifes ſole happineſſe. Perſwade thée, that as many Countries haue bene puniſhed for the Princes offences, ſo this plague is laide vppon thy ſubiects for thy miſſe. Wherefore in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for thy ſinnes, and that God may ſhewe his mercy vpon thy kinde Countrey men, ſorrow for thy foppery, and abiuring thy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelfe from kingdome, wife, and Countrey, betake thée to ſome vnknowne place, where thou maieſt ſpende the remainder of thy ouer worne yeares, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation for thy ſinnes, ſo may that God of all mercie, which neuer turneth his face from the penitent, receiue thée to his grace, and reſtore thy ſonne, calling him from his youthfull deſires, to become a comfort vnto thoſe which with manie fault teares, and hearts full gorged with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, bewayle his abſence. Thus powring foorth his griefe with ſighes and manie briniſh teares, vttering his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, hée reſolued to leaue all his earthly poſſeſſions, and altogither forſaking the companie of all mankinde, liue ſollitarie in ſome vnfrequented place, vntill it woulde pleaſe God ſome tydings ſhould be ſent him of his ſonne, or elſe by death call him to thoſe ioyes which neuer ſhall haue ende. Thus for this time he ended his ſorrowfull ſpéech, vttered in great griefe of minde, whome carefull for to eſpie time and opportunitie fit for his departure, we leaue for a time. And ſhall tell you further of the
<pb facs="tcp:26186:24"/>
Prince <hi>Dionicus,</hi> who long before this time, is arriued in <hi>Thrace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince whome deſire ledde to gaine the loue of <hi>Nutania,</hi> not otherwiſe knowne but for a marchant, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded now in ſafetie, after a friendly welcome giuen to his fellow paſſengers, the Maiſter and Owners, with boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull rewardes beſtowed on the Marriners, was lodged by the Maiſter in a Marchants houſe of great reputation, where vnknowne to be any other then he ſéemed, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his ſtocke by Brokers, to great benefite, whiche bountifully hée ſpent, whereby he gained the loue of all men that euer had any acquaintance with him, ſo that in ſhort time his fame was ſo bruted throughout the Cittie, that none of anie account, but tooke great pleaſure in his company, and ioyed to recount his many vertues. This amorous Prince whoſe heart was on his halfepenny, loth to acquaint any man with his ſecret loue to the Princes, doubting ſome further perill to his perſon then hée was willing to hazard, would oftentimes intrude himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the companie of yoong Courtiers, amongſt whome hée ſo demeaned himſelfe, and ſo Courtly in all thinges, that all men might iudge from what trée ſuch branches ſprung. By this often frequenting of the Court, in the companie of thoſe to whome he was moſt welcome, hée atteined the ſight of his Ladie, whoſe beautie, when he had ſéene, ſo amazed him, that if he were before paſſionate, he was now more perplexed, iudging her excellent perfection to bee without compare, yet not knowing how to make knowne his loue vnto her, ſmothering in ſilence his affection, hée daily deſired ſome occaſion might be offered, wherein for her ſafetie, and honour of his beloued, he might ſhew ſome act worthie honour, and to deſerue her liking, which by Fortunes aſſiſtaunce thus happily came to paſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muſtopha Corienia,</hi> yongeſt ſonne to <hi>Sutton Corienia,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> burning in loue of this

Princeſſe, onely by the rare report of her ſingular perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had by Embaſſadors from his father, craued the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in marriage, who diſdaining his loue being a Pagan, although honourable, might not be wonne by any entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to fancie him, how great ſoeuer his offers and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of loue were; which refuſall, the Prince brooked ſo ill, being of ſuch might, that determining to gaine her by force for his concubine, which in friendſhip he had ſo often required to marry, he leuied a power of one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, both on horſe and foote, and ſhipping them in warlike maner, in Gallies, Frigattes, Foyſtes, and Brigandioces, he arriued by the hard labour and painfull bowging of his ſlaues, before the Citie of <hi>Lemonia,</hi> where <hi>Philarchus</hi> kept his Court, landing the greateſt part of his men and horſe ſuddeinly, and beleagared the ſame, both by land and ſea: vnto which he gaue many fierce and hote aſſaults, &amp; were as valiantly reſiſted, by the courage of thoſe gallant Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who fighting in right of their Countrey, feared not the hugeneſſe of their Armies, nor their force of ſhipping, yet as the extremes of forrain force cauſeth many troubles, ſo did the Army of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> driue theſe braue Thracians to many wants, whoſe courage through the lacke of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls began to quaile: that hauing no meane of reliefe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſea nor land, loth to famiſh, came daily to the court, humbly beſéeching the King to take pittie of them, and not with famine to ſuffer them die. But conſidering that the Princeſſe was the marke whereat he aimed, would rather deliuer her, who ſhould be honourably entreated, then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo many thouſands to periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philarchus,</hi> vexed in mind, was driuen to a <hi>non plus,</hi> ſo diuerſly perplexed, he could not ſuddeinly anſwer, his child who was his onely comfort and heire, either to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, whoſe name was odious vnto him, or his ſubiects who loued him no leſſe then their owne ſoules, muſt periſh in this extreame. Thus doubtfull what to anſwere, he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued reſpite for two daies, which they willingly yéelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:25"/>
albeit their want of victualles was ſo great they might hardly endure.</p>
            <p>The report of this dolefull ſute of the commons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the eares of <hi>Dionicus,</hi> who with his attire, wee change to <hi>Pheander,</hi> who was not a litle mooued there, and the greater was his heauineſſe by how much the more his loue was encreaſed towards the Princeſſe, for whoſe reléef he ſought many deuiſes, eftſoones determining one thing, then another preſents it ſelfe, which ſeemeth better: at length reſoluing leaſt delayes ſhould bréede danger, hée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in that action which was honorable, to ſhew him ſelfe, and eyther by his proweſſe frée the King and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued from the tyranny of the vſurping Infidell, or yeeld his lateſt gaſpe in their defence.</p>
            <p>In this reſolution he came to the kings preſence, vnto whome doing his humble duty, prroſtrating himſelfe, he ſaith.</p>
            <p>Moſt gracious Soueraigne, and liege Lorde, pardon the bold attempt of a rude ſtranger, whome dutifull zeale hath bound to your ſeruice, and of your gracious fauour to all men, vouchſafe me that honour in this extreme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your woorthy citizens ſtand, diſtreſſed by this faithleſſe infidell, who doeth ſéeke your ſubuerſion and their vtter decay: whoſe preſumption, if it pleaſe your Excellence to giue me leaue, ſhall by mée, and ſuch as I can by loue and money drawe vnto me, be chaſtened, and made to knowe your Highneſſe can expell at your pleaſure, the power of a more ſtrong and mightier enemie, who though you haue of curteſie ſuffered, it hath not bene of cowardize, as hée ſhall well vnderſtande.

            <p>The King, which during his long tale, had earneſtlie noted the countenance, and his grace in vttering the ſame, aſſured himſelf, that the honour of his houſe, which ſhewed
<pb facs="tcp:26186:26"/>
in his courage, or the power of the eternal Deity wrought this motion in him, and therefore without any longer pauſe, taking him curteouſlie from his knées, determining to trie the fortunes of this ſuppoſed Merchant, hee ſaith.</p>

            <p>Know renowmed Lord (quoth the Prince) <hi>Numedia</hi> is my countrie, my father a Gentleman profeſſing martiall Diſcipline, my name <hi>Pheander,</hi> the youngeſt of manie of my fathers ſonnes, vnto whom my minority denyed ſuch reuenewes and liuinges as might ſufficiently maintaine my eſtate, which cauſed me to employ my ſtock in trade of merchandize, by which in time of peace I gained in your countrie wealth ſufficient, which with my body I offer in your highneſſe ſeruice, and doubt not but to frée thy prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daughter from this vſurper, whoſe vertue the worlde ſo much renowneth for, by that faith which I receiued at the Font-ſtone, ſo long as I may breath life, neuer ſhal vnha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Cur, triumph in your Graces ouerthrow, nor in her diſhonor.</p>

But to our matter, thou ſéeſt (my déer <hi>Pheander</hi>) the millions of cares heaped vppon my gray head, through the oppreſſion of this heathen Prince, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I am made more miſerable than the meaneſt ſubiect in my dominions; and the more is my miſerie, by recounting the wretched eſtate of my louing ſubiects, whom I hold as deare as my life, and with that by reſigning my life and crowne, I might frée them from bondage, were it nothing els the tyrant required.

<pb facs="tcp:26186:27"/>
the zeale of the merchant vnto her, who had not onely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his goods, but alſo his proper life, to trie in battel his fortunes againſt their enemie: wherefore <hi>Nutania,</hi> quoth the king, for that he hath ſo voluntarily offered the ſame for thy ſake, and I relying on my God, and in his prowes haue accepted him for my Champion, by thy hand he ſhall receiue the honour of knighthood, his title, <hi>The maiden Knight,</hi> and ſo proſper he in his honorable action, and in all others as we wiſh, and himſelfe deſireth.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe, which diuers times had noted the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie behauiour of <hi>Dionicus,</hi> was not a little pleaſed at her fathers motion, as one that in hartie good wil, wiſhed him better then modeſtie would ſuffer her to vtter; yet harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her fathers ſpeaches, ſhee behelde him with more gracious countenaunce, and vewing the lineamentes of his perſon, each grace well regarded, ſhe inwardly bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his hard hap, that the goddes had framed him of no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reputation than a marchant, who might well deſerue the title of a king, put from her <hi>memento,</hi> by recounting her fathers wordes, pauſing thereon ſometime, with modeſt bluſhing countenance ſhe ſaid.</p>
            <p>Kind ſir, whoſe honorable ſeruice offered for my fathers good, and all our weales, his ſubiectes; if I yéelde you not ſuch recompence as your deſertes doe merit, blame me not of diſcourteſie, which haue no better knowledge of you, but accept the hartie thanks of a Virgin, vnto whome I holde my ſelfe ſo farre indebted, as I can no other way recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, then wiſhing your good; yet in earneſt of better good, refuſe not at my hand to receiue the honour of Knighthood, ſéeing my Lords pleaſure is ſuch: and drawing his rapier, the Prince knéeling, ſhee inueſted him with the order, by name of the <hi>Maiden Knight,</hi> &amp; pulling a iewell of rich price fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her gowne, ſhe tied the ſame in a moſt beautiful ſcarffe, beſéeching him to weare it for her ſake, wiſhing all happie fortune in his attempts.</p>
            <p>The new adopted Knight, whoſe heart ouer ioyed for ſo

great a fauour receiued from the ſaint his heart wholy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, with manie thankes dutifully rendered, kiſſed the Princeſſe hand, vowing himſelfe her humble ſeruant, and in all places to maintaine her modeſt bewtie &amp; Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, with his deareſt bloud.</p>
            <p>The time thus paſſed, word was brought the King, that dinner was readie, whereby they were interrupted, whome for a time we leaue to their repaſt, diſcourſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly at table, of the valour of the Mayden Knight, whoſe towardneſſe the King admired; which made his hopes the greater: not doubting but his Champion would proue no leſſe valiant in Armes then they exſpected. At which the Princeſſe gloried not a litle, and the Nobles pleaſed at both their comforts, paſſed the time with more content then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes before, whome we leaue to their mirth, and the Mayden Knight, to the ordering of his affaires.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Numedian</hi> King, exiling himſelfe from his Court, in habite of a Pilgrime, trauelled many vncouth places in ſearch for his ſonne, of whom he could hear no tidings, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could <hi>Barnardine</hi> for all the induſtrie he could vſe, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to any knowledge of him his heart ſo much deſired: through which the heauines both of the Péeres &amp; Comons, were daily increaſed. And no maruel, when their ſoueraign the mirror of all princely curteſie, had thus vnknowne, in the declining of his age, when his yeares required reſt, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed himſelfe his countrey, louing ſubiects, and what elſe he enioyed: the griefe of which ſo oppreſſed the heart of the Quéene, that nothing might yéeld her any comfort.

<pb facs="tcp:26186:28"/>
was to learne knowledge, vſed ſo kinde perſuaſions to the whole eſtate, in a parlement holden of purpoſe, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment was deliuered by conſent, vnto ſixe of the chiefeſt nobles, who were ſolemnely ſworne to maintain the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Crowne, in abſence of the king &amp; his ſonne, vnto whom, being lawfull heires to the ſame, they ſhuld reſigne their titles, whenſoeuer they ſhould chalenge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Now Gentiles leaue we theſe diſtreſſed people, lamenting their kings abſence &amp; the quéenes death, to tel you of the Maiden Knight.</p>
            <p>This gallant Prince, the hope of <hi>Thrace,</hi> carefull of his honor, &amp; not vnmindful of his new miſtres, whoſe loue was the marke he aimed at, hoping by accompliſhing this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie againſt the Souldane, to gaine that place of reputation with her that hée deſired: for the better accompliſhing of which, he proclaimed by ſound of Trumpet, that all ſuch as would in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> action aduenture their liues with him, ſhould bountifully be conſidered, all eſtates from the Cauileare, to the Mercenary, cauſed many to offer him their ſonnes, ſo that in ſhort time, he had gathered more able men the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer in ſo ſmal warning were ſéene; ſuch was the loue his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had gained among all eſtates, that of their kindnes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny repaired, more then for of money, although the thought therof is able to draw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coward to fight, ſo highly was this ſtranger honored. The diligence was ſuch of this Prince, that in ſhort time he had his companies, which were ſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as he liued not in thoſe territories that euer ſaw the like. Al things furniſhed for the field, he became an earneſt ſutor to the Princeſſe his miſtreſſe, to procure the king to view his army, which with ſmal ſute ſhe obteined for him, gracing him with all the fauours ſhe might, more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in him then in all the men that euer ſhe ſaw. The time appointed for his muſter, after he had giuen directions to all ſuch Leaders &amp; other Officers, what courſe to take with their ſeuerall charge, they were conducted to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by himſelf, who mounted on a ſtately Courſer, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:26186:28"/>
on through the Citie, his Captaines attired in Gaſcoin coats of watchet veluet, hauing on the breaſt &amp; back emboſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with goldſmiths work, a Mayden head, according to his deuiſe on his armes, with the colour of his miſtreſſe ſcarfe: euery vnder officer in like ſutes of ſatten, his mercinary men in Iackets, hoſe and hats coloured alike, which cauſed the beholders, to admire the ſtranger more then their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. When the king beheld this mirror of honor, leaſt thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king he was ſonne to his louing frend the <hi>Numedian</hi> king, and had with great delight viewed each ſeueral officer and their charge, with their order of march, and ranging in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, all accompliſhed in ſuch warlike maner, as ſildome he had ſéen: and withall noted his perſon, with his brauery in armor, his gallant ſitting a horſe, and manuring the ſame, his charging, running, and other ſignes of enſuing good, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him great thanks, he cauſed him to diſmiſſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies for that time, to attend his pleaſure at the Court, which he cauſed ſuddeinly to be done, attending the kings pleaſure at the Court, as he was commanded: the newes of his arriuall being brought to the Princeſſe, who had ſéen with what coſt and rare deuiſes, each thing by her ſeruant was performed, iudging likewiſe his loue to her was ſome cauſe, by his cullours and deuiſes, willing to let him know how graciouſly the ſame was accepted, ſhe came into the Preſence, where finding her Knight, after ſhe had with a kinde and louing <hi>Conge</hi> ſaluted him, calling him to a baye Windowe, with a modeſt and comely grace ſhée ſaid:</p>
            <p>Syr, how much I finde my ſelfe indebted vnto you, for your preffered ſeruice, and forewardneſſe in performing the ſame, I will not ſay, that in time what wants in me to accompliſh, my kingly father wil recompence, who hath ſéene and well noted your diligence vſed for his ſafetie, with your coſt and great charge, which he wil not forget. In the meane time good ſeruant, for ſo I will hencefoorth call you, ſo you will vouchſafe to accept of the tytle;
<pb facs="tcp:26186:29"/>
I will pray for your good ſucceſſe and happie victory, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by your renowne may paſſe the fartheſt parts of the earth, and our Country by your proweſſe deliuered from heathen thraldome.</p>
            <p>Vertuous Princeſſe anſwered the Mayden Knight, might it pleaſe your exellence to conceiue of my well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as my deſire is to deſerue, my fortune might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the happieſt that liueth. For on the faith of a Souldier, and by the Maieſtie of that ſaint my heart moſt adoreth, there is none breathing life vnder the celeſtiall globe, that ſhall commaund the ſimple ſeruice of <hi>Pheander,</hi> but your Maieſtie, bound thereunto by your Princely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. Inough my good ſeruant, quoth the Princeſſe, I take your word, hauing great cauſe to beléeue you, ſéeing your forwardneſſe: But good ſeruant, if I might vnder <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,</hi> know the ſaint vnto whom your deuotions are bent, I would be ſo bolde to offer a virgines prayer at her ſhrine for your good ſucceſſe. The King ouer hearing their talke, brake them off thus.</p>
            <p>How now Madame, what haue you that Gentleman at ſhrift, (if ſo) and that his confection deſerue a ſharpe pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet be good to him, he may in time amend.</p>
            <p>Your grace (quoth the Princeſſe) miſtakes your ſelfe, your highneſſe knoweth I neuer tooke orders, therfore my authoritie is not to abſolue, and if by preſumption I offend therein, I doubt the Fathers of our Church would reward me thereafter. But to let your maieſtie know the truth, perceiuing the deſire he hath to do you ſeruice, I was bold to giue him thankes: further recompence, I leaue to your exellence, who at your pleaſure may better reward him.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt well ſaid daughter, quoth the King, putting me in minde what I ſhould do, leaſt forgetting my honour to ſuch as well deſerue, I be reckoned amongſt the number of thoſe Princes who with faire words and kind lookes féed their ſubiects, ſo long as they haue either Patrimony or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do them ſeruice, to the vtter ouerthrow of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities
<pb facs="tcp:26186:29"/>
for euer, and they ſo farre in debt they dare not ſhew their heads, then ſhall they get (perhaps) ſome ſuite worth a hundred pounds a yeare, that haue conſumed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands, maintaining a braue port, for his Princes honors. What ſaid I? a hundred pounds a yeare, nay, not that, without the fauour of ſuch as be chéefeſt in authority, and are néere the prince, whoſe good will if they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure (it may be) they ſhall obtaine ſome ſmall thing, ſcarce able to maintaine the porte of a good yoman: for I tel thée, ſuch muſt be pleaſed, or els let the princes mind be forward to reward them, and by their bountie reléeue their wantes, their good natures by perſwaſion of ſuch as thinke all too much which goeth from themſelues, &amp; ſuch as they pleaſe to beſtow it vpon, ſhall be abuſed. Thus haue I heard gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Knight, and gréeue, that honour ſhould ſo vnkindly bée rewarded; or that any ſubiect, ſhould forget his dutie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo much, as for his owne lucre, cauſe thoſe that ſpende their bloud in their countries defence, their landes and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with emptie purſes and heauie heartes, like men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne to walke the ſtreets: exclaiming on them that ſhould ſée their ſeruice better rewarded to the diſhonor of the ſtate they liue in. This my Pheander, I often recount, leaſt in forgetting it, I fall to infamie by committing the like; but he that gaue me reaſon to know good, and to follow it, wil neuer ſuffer me to fall into ſo great folly, nor let me liue, to forget thoſe maimed braue men, that venture for my good and my countries weale: for while I may breath, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſhall be honored in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and ſhall reape the reward of his merites, neither ſhall theſe Drones, which in ſuch times of perils, hide their heads, ſuck the hony off my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Like mindes I wiſh all princes, with carefull eies to looke into the doinges of ſuch, who as the moth deuoureth the fine cloth, conſumeth their princely reputation, &amp; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the commons, who by dutie are bound to loue, from their alleageance. While the king was in this ſpeach, worde was brought him, that a Heralde from the campe attended
<pb facs="tcp:26186:30"/>
his pleaſure at the gate, requiring parlie, which he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie granted, commanding him to be broght to his preſence: this vnhallowed pagan, who neuer feared God, nor was endued with any humanity, come vnto the kings preſence, with a ſhameles countenance, vſed this peremptory ſpéech.</p>
            <p>King of <hi>
                  <hi>Thrace,</hi> Muſtaffa Cela,</hi> great commander of the empire, &amp; general of thoſe royal armies, ſendeth thée by me, thy choyce either of wars or peace (peace) if thou deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thy daughter vnto him whom he hath ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> required, yet wheras his loue vnto her hath bene ſuch, to make her his wife, his noble mind diſpiſeth her ſo much, as his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wil neuer ſo much honor her, but in deſpite of thée, and to abate the pride of that diſdainful dame, he wil vſe her as his concubine; &amp; when he ſhal haue taken the flower of her virginity, giue her to the baſeſt villain in his camp. Thou knoweſt my embaſſage: deliuer her, &amp; liue; or by me return thy reſolute anſwere, for it ſhal not be many dayes ere thy citie ſhal flame with fire about thyne eares.</p>
            <p>The king vexed at this vnexſpected meſſage, could not anſwer him, ſo mooued was his choller, yet with as much patience as nature would permit, he ſaide: Pagan, I haue heard, &amp; with great paine endured thy Lordes peremptorie meſſage: and that thou, &amp; that Cur, from whome thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt, ſhal know the great difference betwéen a Chriſtian &amp; him, &amp; that he vnderſtand how honorable we hold the lawe of arms, I pardon thée thy life, which thy preſumption doth require ſharply to be puniſhed. For anſwere to thy Lord, this briefly ſay, his threates I regarde not: for my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as God hath giuen her me, and for ſhe is the onely ioy of my aged life, I wil ſhield her, &amp; in deſpite of the Pagan and his greateſt power, defend her chaſtity: therfore depart and ſay to thy Lord from me, his threates Iwey no more than the words of a child: it is not his multitudes can dant me, were they ten times more then they are, my daughter I wil hold in deſpite of his beard, proud vſurper that hée is. Thou knoweſt my wil, make no ſtay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26186:30"/>The Herald noting the ſtern countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> king, and hearing his reſolution, thought it not good to ſtay a replie, leaſt his tongue ſwelling in his mouth, might not be eaſed without loſſe of his head; but glad to eſcape his furie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed him from his preſence with al ſpeed he could, poſting to the pauilion of the prince, vnto whome he deliuered the kinges reſolute anſwere, which hee no ſooner heard, but like one beſides himſelfe, he vowed in three dayes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> old churle, who ſhould faſt the bitternes of his youthful furie. Litle knoweth this proud enemie, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made to bid him welcome, or that his own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was ſo néere as after it prooued. The <hi>Maiden Knight,</hi> which with no ſmal grief had endured this proud demaund of the herald, whoſe whole requeſt was for diſhonor of her, he ſo much honored, awaked from melancholy, as out of a ſound ſléep, proſtrating himſelf before the king, he ſaith: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Soueraigne, with what grief I haue endured the preſumption of this vſurper, my heart denieth my tongue to vtter, neither ſhal I haue ioy of any thing, til I reuenge the wrongs offered your M. &amp; your princely daughter, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dog. Wherefore dread Lord, grant me licence to iſſue out of the city with my companies, in the ſilent of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night, &amp; I hope ere long to returne his proud challenge, with my ſword in his throte. Thanks good knight, quoth the King, I accept thy offer as much as if thou hadſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me the whole world in poſſeſſion, yet would I not ſo forward a man ſhuld aduenture himſelf without my company, whoſe cauſe it is, my ſelfe will accompany thée in the fight, and by my herald bid him battell, in which I doubt not of ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>The Knight was not a litle mooued, to hear his ſuit take no better ſucceſſe, yet not willing to endure any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor in the honour he hoped of, humblie beſought his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of the honour he bare to Armes, in this attempt to giue him leaue, &amp; the rather for the reputation of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, which had geuen him his firſt honor.</p>
            <p>The king which ſaw by his countenance how malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:31"/>
he reſted at this deniall, howe loth ſo euer he were to graunt the ſame, yet yéelded to his deſire: and taking him from his knée, louingly embracing him, he ſaith. Braue man at armes, take not in ill part, that I haue denyed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke that it was in any ſort to diſparage you, or the hope I haue of your forwardnes, but for maintaining my owne honour; yet ſéeing your will is to aduenture for mée, goe in Gods name, and he be your defence, that euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth his diſtreſſed: and ſo pulling his ſignet from his finger, he gaue it him, willing that it bee deliuered to the Gouernour of the citie, &amp; let him vnderſtand, his Highneſſe pleaſure was, that he with his armie paſſe at his pleaſure: and ſo taking his humble leaue of the king and gracious miſtreſſe, which affecteth him more then he could conceiue, he departeth, more ioyful of this honor, then to be richlie endowed.</p>
            <p>No ſooner parted he the kings preſence, but ſlacking as litle time as was poſſible, he ſummoned his captaines, and officers, ſtraitly charging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with al the diligence he could vſe, to gather their companies, &amp; to attend him in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place: in which charge, no negligence was vſed, ſo that by ſhutting in of the euening, ech captaine with his charge both horſe and foot, attending the comming of their general; who was not vnmindful of his buſines, &amp; after thanks giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their leaders, he marched with them to the gate that led them to the camp of the Souldane, &amp; was vpon ſight of the kings ſignet let out. Thus marched the noble Prince, vntil he came halfe way betwéene the campe &amp; the city, where hée called his principall men together, and ſaid.</p>
            <p>Friends, and coparteners in armes, you are now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we haue taken in hand, for that on our weal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole eſtate of this common weal; if we preuail, what good it is to be freed from ſuch an enemy, there is not the ſimpleſt but can conceiue, hauing taſted the extremity which is incident to warres, and the pleaſure of peace.

compeld to endure that fall into their hands, you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine by their opprobious vſage of your gracious Prince, and example of other Chriſtians which haue fallen into their handes. Wherefore now is the time to ſhewe your ſelues in this battle, if you ſhewe your force, no doubt of happie ſucceſſe, to your eternall commendations, and to the benefit of your Country, and fréedome of your wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and families: with theſe and other ſuch ſpéeches hée ſo incouraged the hearts of his followers, as they vowed to follow him with the hazard of their deareſt blood.</p>
            <p>When the Knight ſawe the willingneſſe of his men, and that there reſolution by outward motions, were as hée expected, after he had giuen them many thankes, he made choyſe of fiue hundreth to beare him company. And after he had giuen directions for the Armie to follow, he with his elected company marched on as cloſely as they might, for deſcrying of the enemie, who kept a Court of guard not far from thence, vpon whom in the dead of the night they entered, and finding them at aduantage, which litle doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any aſſault, hauing neuer before bin aſſailed, were ſome ſléeping, ſome gaiming, &amp; others as ill imployed, ſurprized, and not one left to beare tydings of their ill fortune.

            <p>Who ouertaking him, gaue him ſo gréeuous a blow with his Curtler betwéene the necke and ſhoulders, as made him forget his way, ſaying, ſtaie proude vſurper, and take my Ladie the Princeſſe with thée: And pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him vehemently by all the force he could by the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, vnhorſed him, that the Knight verily ſuppoſed, he had bene ſlaine: wherefore diſmounting himſelfe, hée reuiued him againe, vnto whome he ſayd, My Lorde, this is not for your honour to braue a King in his owne Dominions and in his Court, by your Heralde, and then to haue ſo ſmall care of your worde. In faith Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane, for thy ſake ile neuer credite anie Heathen on his worde hereafter.

The Prince hearing himſelfe ſo frumped, was more gréeued there at then all the loſſe hée had receiued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore with a heart full of carefull hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaith:</p>
            <p>Braue man at Armes, what ere thou be to whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath made me thrall, ill beſéemeth ſuch wordes of diſgrace to any one whome the Fates haue ouerthrowne, but curſed my ſelfe which gaue thée this opportunitie, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that negligence, which maketh my foe thus to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in my fall. Thou Mahomet, ſuffer me not as thou art a Prophet, to liue thus diſgraced, to beholde the face of anie man ſurprized by ſo cowardly a curre, who daring
<pb facs="tcp:26186:32"/>
not to thruſt his head out of the cennell but by ſtealth, hath wrought my vtter ruine and ouerthrow, taking his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. But glorie not in this victorie, for it may be, thou ſhalt haue ſo great cauſe to repent thée thereof, as pleaſure to behold me now thy priſoner.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip is diſpoſed to be pleaſaunt quoth the Knight, but it is the vſe of Chriſtians, to giue loſers leaue to ſpeake, if it ſo happen, my fortune ſhall be the worſe: In the meane time, your Grace ſhall be my gueſt, I haue an hoſtes prouided, wil bid you welcome, who by this time I doubt not doth heare of your comming, that you néede not feare of your dinner.</p>
            <p>The Prince full of heauineſſe, could not tell what to anſwere, wherefore Arming himſelfe with all the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he could to endure it, he was by this Conquerer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to horſe.</p>
            <p>Long had they not ridden towards his Armie, but he was encountered by diuers his Captaines, who miſſing their Generall, at haphazard put themſelues in ſearch for him, and happily well they met him, who reioycing for his good fortune, taking the Prince priſoner, they recount vnto him, the ruine and ſpoyle of the whole Armie; for which their diligent courage and valour ſhewed, he yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them moſte great and heartie thankes, beſéeching them to take charge of his Armie, and diuide the ſpoyle amongſt them: which done, repaire at their pleaſures to the Cittie, while he with his priſoner, made haſte to the Kings preſence.</p>
            <p>The tydings of the Knightes ſucceſſe, was by ſome ſuch as honoured him, with ſpéede reported at the Court, in which no parte of his honours was left vnrecounted, whoſe pollicie and valiantneſſe in Armes, the King with al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Courtiers admired: Imagining him by theſe worthie déedes of Chiualrie, to be the onely man at Armes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing honour, in all that Region: of whom there was no ſmall ioye, and ſuch fame and renowne of his actions,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:33"/>
as both in Citie and Court there was no talke but tended to the honour of the Mayden Knight, which liked not the Princeſſe <hi>Nutania</hi> a little, to heare her ſeruant in theſe his firſt attempts, venturing for her to haue ſuch fortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, ſo that where ſhe had but begun to like him before, <hi>(Cupid)</hi> that commandeth the mightieſt, began moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to aſſaile her, that her tender heart vanquiſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, was enforced to yéeld her ſelfe a ſlaue to his deitie: and giuing ouer other courtlike delightes, bend her whole ſtudie in ſéeking which way to win her beſt beloued to her liking, for the accompliſhing of which, many waies were deuiſed, but none thought ſufficient; ſo that reſting in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borinth of confuſed thoughts, commanding her attendants from her, ſhe ſaid:</p>

But wretched wretch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whither wandreſt thou: theſe be no points for thée to ſtand vpon, thou haſt now vied the game, and art bound by ſuch a band as there is no remedie but ſée it thou muſt: therefore leaue to diſcourſe what he was, or hath bene. Thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt by generall report of all men, he is honorable, in wars valiant, bountifull, and endued with all maner of Gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike conditions, which argueth him deſcended of better

parentage, then he will acknowledge: And therefore ceaſe not to loue him, who by all coniectures, if outward ſhewes procéede of the motion of the heart, regardeth thy honour; then requite his ſeruice <hi>Nutania,</hi> and ſéek in time to quench that flame, which beginneth but yet to warme, leſt encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by litle and litle, it conſume thée. In extremes the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind is beſt knowne, happie are they accounted, which forewarned can eſchue a miſchiefe; If thou canſt win thy Loue, what creature may be compared with thée for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie content? Be reſolute <hi>Nutania,</hi> feare no colours, thy loue is planted on ſuch a one, who for his vertues may be mated with the greateſt Princeſſe on the earth: then ſtand not on termes of his being, but determine to loue him, faint hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſouldier neuer gained conqueſt, if he be baſe, thou maiſt aduance him. Thou art heire to the Crown of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and thy fathers ſole delight, who then ſhould gainſay thy will herein, (fathers ſole delight ſaid I) yea there <hi>Nutania</hi> lieth a block which thou canſt hardly remoue. Thy father, what will he aged King ſay? when he ſhall heare of thy loue ſo baſely planted, which haſt refuſed to be wife to two famous Kings, requiring thée with great ſute in marriage: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine fondling from this raſh determination, let thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loue be a raine to hold thy vnbrideled will, feare his diſpleaſure which gaue thée life, and ſéeke not by thy folly to bring his head with ſorrow to his graue, which if thou perſiſt, will be ſuch a coraſiue to his heart, and ſuch a ſtaine to thine honour, as the memorie of <hi>Nutanias</hi> diſobedience will neuer be raced out. With theſe and ſuch like motions of good, ſhe ſought to withdraw her loue from him, that for birth and other noble actions deſerued her better, albeit vnknowne to her: but what euer hée be, the more ſhée ſought to ſuppreſſe the flame of her loue, the more it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that without regard of fathers good, or her own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhe determined to loue him, yea the Mayden Knight with his Prize, was arriued at the Court, whom the King and Nobles welcomed with all curteſie they could ſhewe,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:34"/>
as ioyfull of his ſafe returne, who had ſo honourably borne himſelfe in that action, as if he had conquered <hi>Europe,</hi> which kindneſſe to the knight, was recompence ſufficient for all his charge and hard aduenture.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe, who was awaked from her ſtudies by report of the knightes comming, ſumptuouſly attired as ſhe could, as beſéemed her eſtate, accompanied with all her troupe of Ladies and maides of honour, came vnto the Preſence, who no ſooner approached the place where the knight was, but beholding the exquiſite perfection of her bewtie which he ſo much delighted in, was ſodeinly berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his ſences, ſo that he ſtood as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which had loſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet reuyuing, loath to make manifeſt what with great griefe hée had conſealed ſo long: humbly on his knées, preſented the glorie of his enterpriſe vnto her, ſaying, Moſt gracious Princeſſe, as by your moſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent hands I receiued my firſt ſteppe to honour, and fighting for your Graces and Kingly fathers ſakes, it hath pleaſed God to proſper me with a happy victorie, for which good, hauing nothing worthie to preſent your Grace as I deſire, yet in knowledge of my dutie to your Exellence, to whom my life and ſeruice is deuoted, I humbly beſéech you, accept this Gentleman my priſoner, and your Noble fathers mortall enemie. The Princeſſe to whom nothing could be more pleaſing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſight of the beloued knight, graciouſly accepted the priſoner, rendering great thankes for the ſame, as alſo for his valour ſhewed in their defence. And then turning to the captiued Prince, ſhe ſaid:</p>

whoſe God is their guide: neither regard we them at all as a matter of any truſt, your eyes can witneſſe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an Army able as you thought to haue vanquiſhed all Chriſtendome, is by a handfull to your multitudes ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Yet diſmay not my Lord, a Maiden is your Iaylor who wil vſe you more honourably then you can imagin, or your hard threats deſerueth. The Prince which ſaw the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Princeſſe, whom he ſo earneſtly vpon reports had deſired, was aſtonied greatly, holding the fame that was bruted, to be nothing to her worthineſſe, therfore accuſing himſelfe of great impietie, that had borne Armes againſt the onely Paragon of the earth, and not by curteſie haue continued his loue begun, aſhamed of himſelfe, he ſaith.</p>
            <p>Renowmed Lady, Fortunes darling, &amp; Bewties chiefe pride, though miſhap hath made me of a Prince and heire to the mightieſt Potentate of the earth, a captiue, and that by thy champion I am diſhonored, and my power vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, croſſes which may cauſe the ſtouteſt that euer liued, to cry out on Fortune, &amp; to curſe the Deſtinies, yet am I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſwéetnes of your words, which diſdaineth to vſe the vtmoſt cruelty you might, or take his life that had vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vſe you with more extremes, then if by the greateſt torments I could haue afflicted you withall, I had cauſed you die many thouſand deaths, if it were poſſible ſo many could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

My Lord quoth the Princeſſe, your Lordſhip is merily diſpoſed, indéed women are gods children, wonne with a toy, ſuch fooles they are, yet my Lord, I wold you did know, how litle I eſtéem the flattery of men, of what eſtate ſoeuer, they would ſpend their friuolous ſpéech elſewhere: for your Lordſhip, though you pleaſe to ieſt, I thanke God

you haue ſuch cauſe ſo to do, whom I praiſe for the victorie receiued, and next his dutie, my ſeruant for his paines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for our ſafetie. And with theſe words, ſhe gaue him ſo gracious a looke, as well might the ſtanders by ſée it was not feined, but that her ſpéech ſpoken in his praiſe, procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the inward motions of the hart, which of the captiue Prince was not vnperceiued, which cauſed him to replie thus.</p>
            <p>Madame, for auoyding of that odious ſinne of flattery, which my heart hath euer contemned, I dare not ſay what I would, yet ſéeing the deſtinies are ſo pleaſed to yéeld me a priſoner to my enemie, I reckon my vnhappineſſe the leſſe, which haue ſo gracious a Ladie for my kéeper, of whom, expecting no better then death, I am by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort quite depriued of that feare. And for this noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, how Fortune and the Fates hath fauoured him in this victorie, wherein I am ſo diſhonoured, euery man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceiue. But were the honor therof a million more, yet not to be weighed in the ballance where your Grace doth counterpeaſe the ſame, which is more to be eſtéemed then the worlds good: how you hold him in regard I know not, but if an enemies praiſe may any way honour him, I ſay; and with my blood wil auouch, that for his valour, none liueth on the confines of the earth his equall; wherefore madame, boaſt you of his worthineſſe which is péerleſſe, and worthie for all perfections, to be honoured of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt Monarke that liueth.</p>
            <p>Thankes my Lord, quoth the Princeſſe, for your good opinion of my ſeruant, I doubt not but he will ſay as much for you, when opportunitie ſhall ſerue, who I aſſure you, is as curteous, as otherwiſe honourably endued. While they were thus pleaſantly diſcourſing, word was brought the King, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> Prince of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> who by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of a cruell ſtorme, had ſuffered ſhipwracke, was found on a raft, driuen a ſhore vpon the fartheſt parts of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines: where being vnknowne to any his ſubiects, but by

The ſodaine report whereof, brake their talke, the King commanding his traine preſently to be readie horſſed to accompany him, who with diligence failed not to obey his commaund: and ſo orderly marching through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they ryde eaſily paced, vntill they méete the ſtraunger King, betwéene whom great curteſie was vſed. The King gaue thankes and louing countenance to the Gentlemen, who had to their great coſt ſo honored him, by enterteining this ſtraunger, whereby his countrey was made famous. Thus with diuerſe diſcourſes they paſſed the time till they came to the Court, where a ſtately lodging was puruayed for him, and Officers appointed to attend his perſon, as royally as if he had bene in his owne Pallace, where ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with the King and his Nobles, we leaue him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn vnto <hi>Pheander</hi> the Mayden Knight, whoſe entrailes frying with the ſcorching flames of his miſtreſſe bewtie, had ſo much changed his colour, and impaired his ſtrength, that enforced by great griefe and extremitie of his loue, he withdrew him to his chamber, where caſting himſelfe on his bed with a million of carefull thoughts, eftſoones, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to ſéeke the Princes fauour. And then by contrarie motions, fearing the ſucceſſe of his ſute, carrying the report of no better then a Merchant, which might giue cauſe of great diſlike, and diſparage his ſute, he ſaith, miſerable <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> whom the Fates continually cauſeth by their hard hap daily to complaine, curſing the time of thy natiuitie, and the ſtarres which gouerned thine aſpects, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time or place can remedie, faint hearted wretch, that ſéeking thy owne ouerthrow, encreaſeth thy griefe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſealing the cauſe.

The Knight wrapt into a heauen of ioyes, hearing the goddeſſe of his deuotion, with ſuch fauour and kindnes to vſe him, with a bluſhing countenance ſtanding at the bar, before her, whoſe ſentence pronounced, was either life or death, he ſaith: Honorable and gracious miſtreſſe, giue me leaue ſo to call your highneſſe, ſince you haue dained a captiue the title of your ſeruant, and pardon my preſumption, anſwering your demand; that I loue I cannot deny, which argueth your ſkil in phiſick great (whom) my tongue is reſtrained to reueale: but if your highneſſe could iudge whoſe loue I moſt adore, and long haue, and iudging, eaſe me, I ſhould haue cauſe to ſay, no phiſicke proferer on the earth whatſoeuer, might compare with my gracious miſtreſſe for ſkill; I dare ſay no more, fearing to offend.

            <p>It is not many yeares ſince <hi>Mantonna</hi> my father decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who left me (vnhappie I) his ſucceſſour to inherite the crowne, which I did not long enioy, before <hi>Donatia</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> required of me my ſiſter in mariage; who being beautifull, and in the flouriſhing time of her yeares, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not yet attained to the full of fiftéene, yong ynough to be beſtowed, yet of that wiſdome, that I referred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> choiſe of her loue to her owne liking, induced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereunto by the many euils happening by ſuch made marriages, wher the children are forced by the couetous deſires of their parents, to ioyne wealth to wealth, others for great patrimonies; all for lucre, fewe or none for loue.

               </gap>ut my ſiſter being made acquainted with his ſute, I craued her anſwere, for which his Ambaſſadors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in my Court, with the beſt entertainment I could giue, whome my ſiſter <hi>Phedera</hi> with her owne mouth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered (woe is me) vnhappy the tongue that pleaded deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to his ſuite, but moſt of all, vnhappy the houre when firſt of all hee determined to craue her at my handes, in whoſe power it was not to graunt: no ſooner arriued his Nobles at the Court, and he ſcarſlie had receiued the ſum of her anſwere, but as one bereft of all honour, reaſon, and gouernment, he vowed reuenge on me and my countrey. And leuying a mighty power both of horſe and foot, aſſailed me in mine owne territories, whome by the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

of the Almightie, I expelled my lande, to their great diſhonour, and no ſmall loſſe to my ſubiectes: yet how great ſoeuer his ouerthrowe was, (an honourable minde I muſt ſay) were the cauſe iuſt, he ordeined a mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by ſeas, whereof being by my eſpyalles aduertiſed of the time as neare as they could geſſe they would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, with a power well ſhipped and furniſhed, I met him neare his owne Confines, where a mortall fight was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, and moſte valiantly continued, neyther ſide gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any ſhewe of fainting. But alaſſe, too ſoone commeth that grief which meiteth my hart into thouſands of teares, to recount the Admirall of mine owne Squadron, being ſuncke, and two others forced by the cunning hand of their Gunners, to lye by the Lée, the reſt fainted: which béeing perceiued of the enemie, they boorded, and by hundreths en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my ſhippes and gallies, who were valiantly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But men can doo no more then God will giue them leaue, ſo long they continued the fight, that the ſcupars guſhed bloud, as they had often with the water deliuered by the Pompe. And here laye one maimed, and there a number ſlaine. This pittifull ſtratageme, when my heart with heauineſſe behelde, being ſo hardly aſſailed, my ſelfe, after that I was cleared from the Fléete, the winde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring mée with a happie gale, and my ſhip being good of ſaile, I forſooke the fight, in hope to haue recouered in my owne Countrey, and by a new ſupply, haue giuen him welcome thither. But my hopes herein deceiued, a boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtorm growing, the ſea who is mercileſſe, aroſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, ſwelling with ſuch outrage, that my weak barke no longer able to endure her cruelti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

With this the teares reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his ſpéech, that he could not ſpeake, which moued the King to more pittie of his eſtate, and friendly imbracing him, he ſayd; No more my Lord at this time, I am ſorie that I haue giuen you ſuch cauſe of griefe, thus by recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo lamentable a ſtate, renew your paſſed griefes. But comfort good King, when tides be at the loweſt, they ſpring againe. If the Egyptian King be ſo extreame, reaſon with curteſie will not content him, the cauſe being no other, but to force the loue of a woman vnto him, of which, perhaps he were better be without: On the word of a King, and by my honor I ſweare, I will not leaue you, vntill I ſée you ſetled in your kingdome. Thus the King whome ſorrow had ouerburthened, was by the comfort of this noble King his hoaſt, recomforted, whoſe whole ſtudie was now in preparing of an Army to ayde him, to which care we leaue them.</p>

If it be death (fondling) to ſpeake againſt the maieſtie of a Prince, what is it to contemne the powers aboue?

Entering further in conſideration of her fauourable ſpéeches, ſhaking off feare, like a hardie ſouldier, he determined in writing to let her know his loue, ſince he had no hope to méete her againe at the like aduantage.

            <p>Moſt gacious Princeſſe, how much I grieue to ſée your diſcomfort, I can not ſay, but hope your Grace will pardon me, which haue bene more bold, (preſuming on your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour) then beſéemeth mée, neyther what I haue done (gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lady) was of any intent to offend you, but to acquite my ſelfe of blame, in a matter which I haue of curteſie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, as the ſequele ſhall manifeſt, if it ſhall pleaſe your Ladiſhip to peruſe this letter, which will (no doubt) reſolue you, without further paines to me, or trouble to your Grace, what ſhe is that is beſt beloued of the <hi>Maiden Knight</hi> on the earth. This letter I receiued at his handes, who hearing of your diſquiet, deſirous (as it ſhould ſéeme) to acknowledge his dutie to you, coniured mée by many faire words, and proffrrs of good, to deliuer it vnto your hands; which albeit for modeſty I did long refuſe, thruſting that from me with my finger, which I woulde willingly haue drawne to me with all my force: in the end I conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; the rather for your Ladiſhips quiet, which as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will bid it welcome for the maiſters ſake; who if my iudgment in the Planet <hi>Venus</hi> deceiue me not, wil prooue ſhortly a coniunction, or Ile neuer truſt my ſkill again; for <hi>Venus</hi> being in the ſigne <hi>Leo,</hi> hath domination ouer both houſes, <hi>viz.</hi> he and ſhe, or hée and you.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe at her laſt ſhift, when ſhe heard <hi>Guenelas</hi> tale, voyd of all hope to enioy her beloued <hi>Pheander,</hi> after ſhée had a while pauſed, as one at length awaked from her <hi>memento,</hi> as from a ſléepe, ſhe ſaith; Now truſt me wench, thou haſt cunningly gone about the buſh, and haſt daintily ſought to enter into my déepeſt ſecretes, yet how cunningly
<pb facs="tcp:26186:43"/>
ſo euer you haue dealt, there may be a quilitie to deceiue both thée and him: but I pray thée <hi>Guenela,</hi> tell mée what ſpéeches vſed the <hi>Maiden Knight</hi> at the deliuery therof, tell me ſwéet gyrle in friendſhip.</p>
            <p>The deſpairing Knight (good Madam) for ſo I muſt call him, howe euer his vallour ſhowes it ſelfe in fielde, as no doubt woorthily; ſo ſaith report: yet in loue I ſée his daſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who loueth, yet dare not reueale the ſum of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but muſt commit it to a tell-tale paper; languiſhing to the death, wanting his delight, and prolonging his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes by ſilence, his lookes bewraying more than he can vtter: for be it ſaid, he that had ſéen not long ſince his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and gallant grace, the abilitie of his bodie, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euery particular lineament, at this time with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility thereof, ſhould ſée a metamorphoſis, which might mooue the moſt hardeſt hart to pittie; the cauſe to me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, but ſuſpected. The aſſurance I doubt not but your Grace wil ſoon vndeſtand, if you vouchſafe to teare the ſeale and peruſe the contents.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe which thought euery minute a yeare till ſhe had knowledge of the Knights minde, put her maiden from her prattle with a fained meſſage, when being all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, with a number of ſorrowfull ſighes for the Knights perplexitie, ſhe read, and manie times reade thoſe lines, which gaue her firſt comfort of enioying her heartes cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: how welcome they were vnto her, it may better bée imagined than explaned; whoſe head was wholly buſied in anſwering the ſame, for which the thought it not vnfit to vſe the help of <hi>Guenela;</hi> wherfore reſting from her former ſtudies, we leaue her contemplating on her loue, til <hi>Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nela</hi> her returne; who ſéeing her Ladies callour ſomwhat reuiued, began to ſmile. Madame (quoth ſhee) though I made a fault in detayning ſo long the phyſicke that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed you, yet I hope your Maieſtie will pardon that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, conſidering the good it doth in working; howe you diſgeſt it I know not, but hée that hath leaſt ſkill in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb facs="tcp:26186:43"/>
complexions, will ſay your mariage is mended by twentie in the hundred; if you recouer but ſo much of your loſſe euery two dayes, there are few (in one wéeke) wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you haue bene ſicke. Well wanton, well (anſwered the Princeſſe) you haue bene pretily diſpoſed to play your parte, and take your paſtime in beholding the follie of both our loues, which I am the more willing to forget, in that thou haſt ſo rightlie iudged of both our griefes. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ieſt, I pray thée ſay my ſwéet <hi>Guenela,</hi> what ſayd my ſeruant when hée deliuered theſe letters vnto thée? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, to ſay trueth; nothing touching his loue; but impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch earneſtneſſe; for the preſenting them vnto your handes, as might haue made many proude to doe ſo charitable a dée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, crauing it with ſpéech ſo pitifull, and lookes ſo ruthfull: for mine owne part, my heart imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by your affection, that the Goddes which cauſed your grief, had fettered him, and wel knowing where loue is vnited, the ones weal is the others good; though I were hardly won to the ſame, I vndertooke the hazard of your good wil, promiſing to returne to him an anſwere thereof, wherein I ſhall breake promiſe, without you graunt your conſent.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Guenela,</hi> doubts thou of my conſent for anſwering of his kinde letters, which haue endured ſo many nights of vnreſt, and carefull dayes for his ſake? No, heauens neuer graunt me good in this world, if I ſéeke not his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp; that with ſo good loue and affection, as hée offereth his loue and ſeruice to me, vnkind were I els, that louing am beloued, ſhould ſuffer my deareſt loue to languiſh, who may remedy it. Therefore <hi>Guenela,</hi> as thou haſt plaide the Aduocate, ſo make I thée my principall and chiefe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretorie: peruſe theſe lines, and in right conſider if that his griefe deſerue not to be pittied, then let me ſée thy ſkill in enditing, to the which thou ſhalt haue my helpe. Delay the time no longer, hunger (my Wench) is ſharp ſawce (as thoſe ſay which haue good ſtomackes) and I meaſuring
<pb facs="tcp:26186:44"/>
his deſires by mine owne, imagine that meate cannot bee more pleaſing to the hungry, then the vnexſpected tydings of conſent, from his new acknowledged Loue. Soft fire, Madame, quoth <hi>Guenela,</hi> makes the ſwéeteſt Mault, ſay our huſwiues: your Ladiſhip is farre wide: what? no ſooner at the ſtyle, but ouer haſte makes waſte; looke before you leape, leaſt a blocke vnthought of, chaunce to breake your ſhins. What if theſe letters impart his loue, how are you aſſured thereof? Men are ſubtil, and can caſt many cullours to deceiue women; all is not gold that gliſtereth, nor al ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar that hath a ſwéete taſte; vnder the gréeneſt graſſe lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poyſoned Adder; the Crocadile ſheadeth moſt tears, when he ſéeketh moſt to deceiue: try ere you truſt, Madam, repentance comes too late; therefore howſoeuer you affect him, conceale it: Lightly wonne, is as lightly loſt. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer that gayneth his mony by hard labour, is more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in parting therewith, then the purloyning théefe, or the ryotous youth, which by ſubtill practiſes draweth all he can from his kind parents, to maintaine his inordinate expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Let him bite on the bridle a while, yet gently line his curbe, that he galle: not a litle thing pleaſeth a childe, and a good countenance is woorth golde, to him that regardeth it, as he profeſſeth. Weigh your own eſtate, which are heir to this moſt famous crowne of <hi>Thrace,</hi> with the baſeneſſe of his calling, which was no better than a Marchant: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a corraſiue this loue of yours woulde be to your honorable father, ſhould he know it, and how your Nobles would ſtomacke him for his birth, grieuing to liue in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to one ſo farre their inferiour. The enuious regard not what vertues he is poſſeſt with, which I muſt néedes ſay, deſerue to bée accounted: the man gayning honour by vertue and valour, is more woorthy to gouerne the State then the Noble, which ignobleth his houſe by his bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor. How many ſuch there bée in this Court I grieue to ſée, who liuing licentiouſly, abuſe themſelues in ſuch odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maner, that if your Ladiſhippe heard the pitifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb facs="tcp:26186:44"/>
of the Commons, crying out on the Prince for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt them, and how by fauour of their friends, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling both the King and the State, they are ſuborned, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the cryme, and the poore Complainant, returned with a checke able to breake the heart of a ſimple man: abuſes which may be more lamented, then eaſily remedied.</p>
            <p>But touching the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> from whom I haue digreſt, I ſpeake not any thing to diſparage his loue, nor to draw your lyking from the Knight, but wiſh you temper your affection, in ſuch ſort, that you may long enioy it with content to you both, and ſo gouerne your Graces lookes and countenances, that the lightneſſe of the one, nor the liberall beſtowing of the other, giue iealous heads any cauſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition. For Princes be great markes, and haue many eies beholding them, and once perceiued, what peril it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to either part, your wiſedome can conceiue. Thus in dutie haue I ſpoken, and deliuered a groſſe aduiſe, which I referre to your Graces better conſideration. Well haſt thou ſaid, my <hi>Guenela,</hi> quoth the Princeſſe, but what auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth counſell to a deſperate minde, no more then he that ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to quench the flame, powreth Oyle to it, I finde thy loue ſo great towards me, that I cannot requite it, which with ſuch good regard balanceth each perill incident to both our ſtates, if thou canſt as well deuiſe how we may enioy our delight, without which we perplexed, cannot long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, what is it that <hi>Nutania</hi> ſhall euer enioy, but <hi>Guenela</hi> ſhall command? Then as thou tendereſt my good, bethinke thée of ſome remedie, for my loue to him is ſuch, as nothing may extinquiſh. Say my ſwéet <hi>Guenela,</hi> ſhall I by writing anſwere his Letters, or no: In this I wil be ruled by thée, how gladly ſoeuer I wiſh his comfort, in whom, of al earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creatures, conſiſteth my moſt comfort. Experience is the beſt wiſedome quoth <hi>Guenela,</hi> who would euer haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued loues power to be of ſuch effect, how imperious ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he ſéemed, had they not ſéene and heard what I doo? through which I am compelled to recant my hereſie, and
<pb facs="tcp:26186:45"/>
ſay Loue is a God, or how is it poſſible he could command Princes. But to your Graces requeſt, wheras you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the anſwere of <hi>Pheanders</hi> Letters to me, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo voyde of reaſon, nor ſo deſirous to be counſellor to your excellence, to take ſo great a matter vpon me, yet ſhal I (ſo pleaſe it you to heare me) deliuer my ſimple opinion, as I would do my ſelfe in the like action. The olde wiues ſay, they that féede with the deuill muſt haue a long ſpoone; and they that goe about to maſter Loue had néed of manie good precepts: diſſwade your Grace I will not to forget it, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſée it is vain, neither would I wiſh you to anſwere by writing; for a paper is ſoone loſt, and loſt, to whoſe finding it ſhall come, tis vncertaine; as ſoone to ſome enuious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, as a wel-willer; in which ſome word ſimplie meant of you, or me, may be conſtrued by them at their pleaſure, whereby your name may be brought in queſtion; and a ſlaunder raiſed, is not ſo eaſily ſuppreſſed; writing is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialtie, whereof the ſubtill Lawyer takes no ſmall aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: to auoyd all which caſualties, this may you doe; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome matter of conference with him, and appoint the time when hée ſhall attende your pleaſure, at your lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, comming ſecretely vnto you, and at ſuch time as the King your father ſhall bée employed in ſerious affaires, ſo may you vſe your ſpéech at your pleaſure; this would <hi>Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nela</hi> doe, your Grace may vſe your diſcretion.</p>
            <p>I like thy deuiſe wel (good wench) and giue thée manie thankes (quoth the Princeſſe) therefore faile not to méete him for thy promiſe, what els I refer to thy beſt indgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Nowe in faith Madame (quoth <hi>Guenela</hi>) you haue made a good choyce for a ſolliciter, but take me as I am, this is the firſt ſuit that euer I was retained for nor I doubt not (if I ſpéed well now) of manie elpantes. As they were thus pleaſant betwéene themſelues, they heard a trumpet ſound to horſe, which cauſed the Princeſſe to ſende her Page to enquire the cauſe, who returned her anſwer, that the king with his traine, were ſetting forward to hunt a wilde bore,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:45"/>
which his Forreſter had rouſed: this newes gaue them cauſe of ioy, hoping that Fortune fauoured them with a happy time, which they were both loth to omit, doubting the like opportunitie; the Princeſſe eſpecially, who coulde not be quieted in minde, vntill ſhée heard her Knight aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for himſelfe; wherefore a Page was preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſearch for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight, willing him with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ſpéed as hee could, to meet <hi>Guenela</hi> in the garden; the Page vſed ſuch diligence, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoone he was brought vnto the Knightes preſence, whome he found ſolitary (as a holie father) at his Orizons, whome the Page awaked with his ioyful meſſage, which was welcom vnto him, albeit doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whether of weale or woe, either to augment his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, or vtterly to extinguiſh them. The ſudden hearing of which, cauſed him to pauſe a while, when hauing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, curteouſly returned anſwere to the Gentlewoman, that he would attend her, he rewarded the Page ſo bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as he had cauſe to boaſt him of his wel employed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. <hi>Guenela</hi> hauing receiued his anſwere by the Page, aduertized the Princeſſe thereof, who commaunded her to haſte, leaſt ſhe gaue the Knight cauſe of diſcontent by her long ſtay: but for al her ſpéed <hi>Pheander</hi> was long there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding her comming; who was no ſooner of him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to enter the place, but his heart pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aging ſome good, was more delighted thereat, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the motions that could be imagined, after his curteous ſalutations done, thus ſaid:</p>
            <p>Swéet <hi>Guenela,</hi> I know not what to imagine of thy ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den meſſage, yet willing to be reſolued, as one that by thy anſwer exſpecteth his doome either of life or death, I attend thy pleaſure: ſay therfore, ſwéet Lady, what faith the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to my letters? with whom <hi>Guenela</hi> purpoſed to be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaſant, &amp; not to cloy his ſtomacke with ſuch pleſant confections, that he ſhould ſurfet therewith, and framing a countenance to her ſpéech, ſhe ſaid:</p>
            <p>Sir Knight, of all the Gentlemen in the Courte of <hi>Thrace,</hi> my good opinion was ſuch of you, that on your
<pb facs="tcp:26186:46"/>
word, I durſt haue hazarded my greateſt credit, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation thou haſt farre deceiued: and therefore not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be accounted among ſuch honorable men at Armes, which take their principall honor, holding their word with Gentlewomen. At the deliuery of which ſpéech, he that had tooke regarde to the Knightes countenaunce, might haue thought him paſt phiſickes recure: And withall, ſtanding ſo mute, it verely perſwaded <hi>Guenela,</hi> that he was readie to deliuer his intereſt of life, whiche made her alter her rough words, and with a ſmoother methode new file them; doubting that her Comedie begun in mirth, ſhould prooue a Tragidie, to the great grief of the whole Country, which generally honored him. Wherfore taking him by the hand, ſhe ſayd; Sir Knight, I am ſorie I haue charged you ſo far, what cauſe ſoeuer I had, but tis womanlike to be ſlaine with words, and no fit paſſion for a man of your profeſſion. That you may comfort your ſelfe, I firſt pardon the offence againſt me committed, (and enioyne you) as you tender your credit with the Princeſſe <hi>Nutania,</hi> that you faile not to repaire at ſuch conuenient time as you beſt can, to her lodging; where if you hold your word, you will excuſe your meſſenger.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Guenela,</hi> how haue thy ſpéeches tormented me, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my entrailes with ſuche a confuſion of comfortleſſe thoughts, as haue ouercome my ſenees. Yet <hi>Guenela,</hi> if thou be curteous, or haue any ſparke of gentilitie abide in thée, Say my good Lady, what countenance gaue the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to my baſhfull paper? Vouchſafed ſhe the reading of them? (Or how) to diſcomfort you good Knight, quoth <hi>Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nela,</hi> it were pittie, being alreadie at ſo low a <hi>datum,</hi> which pitieth me to behold. Comfort can I giue none to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires but this, thy ſute is loue, as your Letters import, in which diſpaire not, for thy miſtreſſe is a woman, though a Princeſſe, and how pitifull our ſexe is, I will not boaſt, but wiſh thée not diſpaire: If thy birth were as great as thy vertues, thou mightſt boord and bedde, as good as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb facs="tcp:26186:46"/>
Nutania, vnto whom I wil be a faithfull ſoliciter. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me not <hi>Pheander,</hi> I ſpeake as a friend, and ſo leaue thée, vntill thy comming to my Lady, which detract not, for time loſt, is ſuch a precious thing as can neuer be recalled. Before whom, when thou ſhalt come, pleade thine owne cauſe, and diſcouer thine owne grie. And ſo farewell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pheander,</hi> which had ſome greater hope by <hi>Guenela,</hi> her laſt ſpéeches, was ſo ouer ioyed, that he could not bid her farewell: yet after his <hi>memento</hi> paſt, he ſaith, farewell the faithfulleſt friend in my diſtreſſe, that euer I founde. (Oh <hi>Guenela</hi>) happy maiſt thou be in thy loues, and highly honored amongſt men, by whom my cares are thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, (faithfull <hi>Guenela</hi>) the worker of my hearts happie content, by whom paſt all hope, I am by thy faithfulneſſe and trueth in deliuering my meſſage, freed of ſo heauie a burthen, as was likely to haue torne my poore oppreſſed heart in a million of péeces. Thus vplawding <hi>Guenela,</hi> he had almoſt forgotten his word. Leauing further to deſcant on this plaine ſong, returne we to the Princeſſe, who was aduertiſed by her woman, what had paſſed betwéene the Knight and her, not omitting his heauy lookes, and pitifull ſpéeches. And then againe as glad to pleaſe the Princeſſe, whom ſhe was aſſured loued the Knight, letted not at large to ſet out his honors gained, his comelineſſe of perſon, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and whatſoeuer the world admired in him, ſhe highly aduanced: to the great content of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe, who thought euery minute a yeare vntill ſhe ſaw him, whome ſhe with hartie deſire expected, (long looked for, comes at laſt.) And <hi>Nutania</hi> who at a caſement wayted diligently his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, eſpied her beloued Knight, what ioy it cauſed, let them iudge, which better experience haue made perfit in louers delights. The Princeſſe hauing the ſight of her ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Knight, ſent <hi>Guenelia</hi> to entertaine him, and to bring him to her preſence. The Princeſſe ſtudying to frame her countenance for his welcome, bethought her ſelfe of ſundry meanes, eftſoones, doubting by her too pleaſant and kinde
<pb facs="tcp:26186:47"/>
vſage to be thought too forward in loue: then, what diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her heauy lookes might moue to him, whom ſhe moſt deſired to pleaſe. In this quandary, fitting on a Pallet, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her head on her pillowe, <hi>Guenela</hi> hath brought the Knight to her preſence, who doing his dutie, was by the Princeſſe againe ſaluted.</p>
            <p>Attending like the guiltie condemned, his ſentence from her mouth, which was to giue him either life or death, the Knight thus at an <hi>nonplus,</hi> ouercome with the beholding of the Princeſſe exellent perfection, was by her the mirror of all honor and curteſie, remoued out of his dumpes, in this maner.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Pheander,</hi> whether I ſhould chaſtice thy preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in writing ſo boldly vnto me (or no) I am not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, but before I acquainted my father therewith, I thought good to heare thée ſpeake, for that I would not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly diſgrace thée, whom I haue ſo often graced: as well to heare thy intent committing ſo great a follie, as what thou canſt ſay in excuſe thereof. Princes are not to be iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with, nor to be attempted in ſuch maner by their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and therefore thou haſt highly erred in that thou haſt done, and encurred the daunger of our ſtricteſt lawes, by which thou art already co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, were thy fact known. The Knight ſtanding at the bar, where Bewlie ſat chiefe Iudge, was ſurprized with ſo many griefes, that he might hardly vtter any word, yet reuiued by hope of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and ſwéete wordes pronounced by <hi>Guenela,</hi> hée ſaith;</p>
            <p>Gracious Lady, that I haue preſumed farre, I cannot but acknowledge, yet that I haue encurred ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as your highneſſe inferreth, I deny, vnleſſe death be the guerdon aſſigned the faithfull; (for dutifull ſeruice) and entire affection, vrged me to ſéeke thy fauour in loue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I may not liue: ſo déepely is thy vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections imprinted in my heart, which if I enioy not, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no longer to breathe. Therefore Madame, if thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine

his loue, that liuing, dieth continually for thée: doo but ſay the word, and this blade ſo often imbrued in the blood of mine enemies, ſhall ſacrifice his maiſters owne true heart before thy face, that thy cruell ſelfe, (maiſt witneſſe to thy ſelfe) how faithfully thy ſeruant hath loued thée.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe gréeued to heare theſe ſpéeches, moued with great ruth, could hardly forbeare ſheading of teares, yet modeſtie the ornament of womankinde, cauſed her to feine a counterfeit ſhow of diſpleaſure to him, whoſe teares wroong droppes of blood from her tender heart, yet that ſhe might not too ſodeinly confeſſe her hearts deſire, nor giue him cauſe of vtter diſpaire, ſhe ſaith; <hi>Pheander,</hi> that thou maiſt ſée, and ſéeing, report in all places where euer thou ſhalt become of womens pitie, I grant thée pardon for thy fault, and with my pardon, thy life, which was wholly in me to diſpoſe. For louing me as thy Prince, I heartily thanke thée, but in ſéeking to obtaine my loue as thy wife, that haue bene denied to diuerſe and ſundrie Princes, in that thou erreſt: let each eſtate frame themſelues in loue to their equall, ſo ſhall they ſooner obtaine their deſires, and their loues in more tranquilitie be mainteined. Thou knoweſt thy birth how baſe it is, and though for thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues it pleaſed my Princely father to aduance thée, who cannot of his Princely nature, but rewarde the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If for his good to thée, thou ſéeke to robbe him of his childe, therein thou ſheweſt a verie vngratefull minde, and laieſt open to the world thy baſe condition. Therefore perſiſt to proſecute thy ſute, let rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vanquiſh that brain-ſicke humor which ſo afflicts thée; in doing which, thou ſhalt ſhewe thy ſelfe, to be thy ſelfe: For no greater conqueſt can be atchieued, then conquering a mans owne effects. Doo this, and thou ſhalt finde <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania</hi> thy faithfull and aſſured friend, who will be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to aduaunce thée, as I haue found thée readie to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26186:48"/>Alas good Madame, anſwered the Knight, I haue often heard, the whole néeds no phiſition, it is eaſier far to giue counſell then to take it. The full gorged Churle litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth the ſtaruing creature at his gate, (but madame) could you conceiue the leaſt part of many thouſand griefes that afflict me, you would pitie me at leaſt, though you yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me no farther fauour: If thy heart be not harder then the Adamant, (pittie me) ſwéete Lady, and yéeld thy grace, to augment my life, or vtterly deny me your fauour for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. I exſpect but your anſwere, for my reſolution is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then I haue profeſt, (daſtards feare to die) but the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde preferreth death which endeth all ſorrowes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a life to be continued with diſcontent. The Princeſſe which was at her wits end as full of griefe, as he of ſorow, turned her ſpéeches from her matter, to queſtion him of his Country, the maner of the Court, and ſtate therof, thinking ſo to be guilde the time and put him off for that ſeaſon. But ſo long dalied ſhe, that ſhe was forced in the end to confeſſe her loue to be no way inferior to his. Thus as I haue ſaid, demaunding of the Knight many queſtions, ſhe earneſtly entreated him, to reſolue her whether the Prince <hi>Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> were ſuch as the world reported him, who had name to be a Paragon, excelling in all actions required in a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man. The Prince hearing his name called in queſtion by the Princeſſe, on ſuch a ſodaine, beléeued verily that ſhe had ſome ſecret knowledge of him, which made him with bluſhing chéekes to ſay, what reportes ſoeuer your Grace hath heard of that Prince <hi>Dionicus,</hi> I know not, a ſubiect I was to his father, and ought to ſpeake reuerently of him, (yet what is truth) and not for affection or deſpighte, to ſay other then I will with my blood auow. Wherefore Noble Lady, I will truly anſwere your demaunds.</p>
            <p>The Prince whoſe father was matchleſſe, gaining the loue of all men, with care and honor mainteined the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Countrey, which by his careleſſe ſonne is ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, who neglecting the dutie of a child, without regard
<pb facs="tcp:26186:48"/>
of father, crowne, or kingdome, exiled himſelfe, no man knowes where, or whether he reſt aliue or no: ſince which time, the king his father, who loued him too dear (if fathers loue may be too deare) hath likewiſe abſented himſelfe, and liueth in exile. The mother Quéen, hath reſigned her due to death, leauing (by loſſe of thoſe honorable perſons) their country without a head, and their ſtate by ſubiectes to bée gouerned, wherby a ruine of the kingdom is like to enſue, all procéeding from the Prince. A miſerable country is that (quoth the Princaſſe) &amp; to be lamented; but more the loſſe of ſo noble a race, the father hauing bene ſuch, and the ſonne as (report ſaith) ſo toward. But ſay (good Knight) quoth ſhe, was there neuer cauſe ſuppoſed of their departures? nor did not the father through his harſh demeanor, for youth in theſe times take vnkindly their fathers vnkindnes: &amp; age is froward, which frowardnes might miniſter great cauſe of diſcontent. Madam (quoth the Knight) to my knowledge, this I wil ſay, my father being a Courtier in ſome regard, whereby I became familiar with the Prince, and as youth will make choiſe of ſome one to participate with, ſo it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Prince, louing my father wel, to vſe my company in all his exerciſes; through which I ſaw his demeanor, with ſuch reuerent duetie to the king acknowledged, and as kindly requited of the king, as on the earth might not bee found loue more perfect til his ſpeach fayling in his mouth, he could vtter no more. The Princeſſe giuing héed to each word by him pronounced, albeit ſhe ſawe the repeating of the Princes life, was ſomewhat cumberſome vnto him, yet ceaſed he not to vrge him, to ſhew ſuch ſorrowe in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtorye ſo of her deſired. Ah Madame (quoth the knight) at his departure, began our Countries grief and my ſorrow, from whome in life, I could neuer bée ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſuch was my loue to him, which refuſed himſelfe, his Crowne, and dignities. Adolefull tale haſt thou deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (quoth the Princeſſe) which I perceiue mooueth you to impacience, wherefore, one demaund and an ende. The
<pb facs="tcp:26186:49"/>
Prince <hi>Dionicus,</hi> made choyſe of you, for his companion: Then vnder <hi>benedicitie</hi> let me craue (all law of friendſhip exempted) did he not acquaint you with his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? for me thinkes it is ſcant credible, that ſuch an vnity ſhould be amongſt men, their loues being ſo perfect, but he ſhould diſcloſe each ſecret intent whatſoeuer: many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons draweth me to ſuppoſe it, which I will omit, for I perceiue I am too tedious. Your Ladiſhip vrgeth me far, yet will I accompliſh your requeſt, who haue power to commaund me. The Gentleman who neuer offended, but in committing of this great offence, long before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hauing belike ſome motion of deſire in his thoughtes, became of a pleaſant Gentleman, the moſt melancholieſt that could be found; that quite aboliſhing all company, hée beſt contented himſelfe with his ſecrete cogitations; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing this homour ſo long, that he fell ſicke of an extream Feuer; which ſo encreaſed vpon him, as all Phyſickes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe was quite giuen ouer: ſo that ſmall was the hope of his recouerie, whoſe diſtreſſe, the kind King, with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quéene, grieued in ſuch wiſe to beholde, as in ſhorte time it was hard to be iudged which of the thrée endured moſt extreames. But God that in aduerſity ſends comfort, reſtored the Prince to ſome ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth: belike receiuing ſome comfort in his imaginations, &amp; by his recouery, the King &amp; Quéene were both ſo comforted, as in ſhort time they were raiſed from their ſicke cabinets, to frolike it amongſt their noble ſubiects, who ioyed in nothing ſo much as in their healthes. But how ſoone the Sunſhine of their happineſſe was ouerſhadowed with cloudes of comfortleſſe care, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me to recount; yet dare I not gainſay your Ladiſhips requeſt. The Prince recouered of his maladie, made ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of ſuch content, that none but himſelfe could witneſſe vy the leaſt ſuſpition, his hearts diſcontent, yet oftentimes ſhould I, being ſeldome from his company, ſighing with a number of far fetched ſobs, heare him ſay, Péerleſſe Ladie, would my loue were as wel known to thée as to mine own

            <p>The Princeſſe hearing all theſe extreams to grow from affection, knowing well her owne hearts diſcontent, with a ſigh from the déepeſt, which wroong tears from her heart, ſhe ſaid; Alaſſe noble Gentleman, whoſe ioy ſo ſoone ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, hath heaped ſo many cares vpon me, what folly was there in thée, that wouldeſt not diſcloſe thy loue which burned ſo vehementlie: was the dame ſo baſe, that thou fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thereby to ignoble thy iſſue, or of ſuch high eſtate thou doubteſt to obtaine her; if either, by perſwaſions all griefs might haue bene mittigated: if a Monarch, why thou by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port deſerueſt her; if a begger, thou mighteſt make her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; what ere ſhe were hearing thy diſtreſſe, could ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to pitie thée? No, no, were her heart more harder then the Diamond, it could not chooſe at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearing therof, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: elſe, wel woorthy were ſhe to bée ſcorned of al Ladies, and neuer to bee named amongſt the number of women.</p>
            <p>The Prince ſéeing the Princeſſe in this pitiful humour, thought it good ſtriking whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iron was hot, &amp; taking the opportunity, anſwered her thus: Is your Ladiſhips cenſure ſuch of hard-hearted Ladies, &amp; wil not be entreated of him, whoſe loue to you, is no whit inferior to the Pr. <hi>Dionicus,</hi> as himſelf wold confeſſe wer he preſent, &amp; hard me recount y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> many griefs, wherwith loue hath afflicted me: &amp; might he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:26186:50"/>
But Madame, if without offence I might demaund this; ſay <hi>Nutania,</hi> the Princeſſe of <hi>Thrace</hi> were the Saint, vnto whome this vnhappie Prince had vowed his deuotions, and that all the paſſions he hath endured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are for your loue, would you vouchſafe him loue in recompence thereof? The Princeſſe driuen to her ſhiftes at this demaund, could not tell what to anſwere, yet ſharpening her wittes (as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can doe) ſhe ſaid: <hi>Pheander,</hi> Loue is not to bée dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with, as I haue heard them ſay, which ſpeake by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; therefore I cannot directly anſwere thy que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but were I the Phyſitian that could cure his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie, and had ſo good iudgement of his affects as of mine owne, charity would I ſhoulde miniſter vnto his diſeaſe, what effect ſoeuer the potion would worke; prouided this, that he diſcloſed his griefe in time: miſtake me not <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and pardon mée if I conceale what I would vtter, my thoughtes are mine owne. Trueth Ladie (quoth the Knight) neither was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame demaunded to vrge any thing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtandeth with your good liking: yet for the prince; this I ſay, it were pittie he ſhoulde die for loue. So ſay I, (quoth the Princeſſe) for few men ther be of that condition, and as ſeldome is ſuch a one ſéene, as multitudes of blacke Swans. Your errour is great, Madam, (quoth the knight) for many haue bene with loue ſo ouercome, that Kinges haue bene enforced to ſtoop to their ſubiectes, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt conquerours, whoſe valour many volumes recorde, by loue compelled to forſake themſelues, taking ſundrie ſhapes and many toyles, to gaine the loue of their Ladies. I ſpeake now Madam for the Prince, whom I loue well, and challenge your charity may bee to him continued, for your loue is the only phyſick that muſt cure him, or els all other helps are friuolous: in hope wherof, he breaths a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring life, til your gracious conſent finiſh his griefs, yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſires, in whom it reſteth, to reſtore him; bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to his regal dignities, who is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cauſe of his exile: da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardneſſe hath cauſed him to conceale it, bearing the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie

The Princeſſe hearing her Knight pleade for the Prince with ſuch earneſtneſſe, leauing his owne ſute, to draw her to loue him of whom her thoughts were leaſt on, thought it ſome pollicy of the Knight, which imagined loue had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed her, ſwelling with anger at theſe new imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Prince hearing this finitiue ſentence, from her, whoſe tongue was to pronounce his life or death, thought it high time to ſpeake for himſelfe before ſhe departed, and ſtaying her as ſhe would haue gone, he humbly beſought her, not in diſpleaſure to leaue him, but with patience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure what he could ſay: which albeit ſhe might hardly be wonne to grant, yet her former affection baniſhed chollor

In this melancholy vttering ſuch ſpéech of diſpaire, as though ſhée ſawe the dreadfull meſſenger Death, alreadie ſeized vpon the valiant knight. The knight who could take as litle reſt, as his Lady plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, could finde content in no place, vntill hée came to the Princeſſe lodging, whome founde in this paſſion, which was more gréeuous then all the reſt, her blubbred eyes preſſyng bloud from his heart, beholdyng her in that plight, whoſe happy content, was his onely ioy. But how cumberſome ſo euer it was vnto him, with wiſdome hée aduiſedly weighed, that cares muſt be comforted in tyme, leaſt takyng déepe roote, they will conſume the heart ſubiect vnto it. Therefore after many kynde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions vſed, hée layde before her, the honour of the place aſſigned him, and what infamy woulde redownde vnto him refuſing it, with the diſhonour of him, and ſtaine to his Proginy for euer, the cauſe being right, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Princely father ſo charitable, whereon the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of a whole kingdome conſiſted.</p>

            <p>Tyme that ſtaieth not, cauſeth theſe Princes to part, <hi>Pheander,</hi> to giue directions for his iourney, his prouiſion being all to make, but ſuch care had he of the ſame, as hée was ſodeinly prouided of all néedfull things, expſecting a

faire wind for imbarquing his companies, which God ſent as they deſired, when ech one taking leaue of their friends, with many a loath departing farewell, hée betooke himſelfe to the mercy of the waues, who by his goodneſſe, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth and gouerneth all things, fauoured them with ſo happie a gale, that in ſhort time they might diſcry the high lande of <hi>Egipt,</hi> which being by his ſkilfull Pylottes knowne, they ſtrooke their ſayles to <hi>Hull,</hi> vntill a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell was called, where euery man had libertie to deliuer his aduiſe for the benefit of the action. Where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long debating, and eache perill aduiſedly weyghed, it was determined, the Fléete ſhould put againe into the Sea, leaſt they being a huge number ſhould be diſcried, and their intent thereby made fruſtrate. To bring their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to better effect, a Frygate was ſlenderly manned to auoyd ſuſpition, who in the night rowed hard aboord the ſhoare, with Commiſſion to take what ere hée were they could firſt lay holde off, that they might be the rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of the ſtate of the Countrey, and where the King was.</p>
            <p>This deuiſe ſorted to ſuch effect, thet through the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Lord <hi>Cariolus,</hi> who was appointed for the ſame, as one deſirous to gaine honour, by dawning of the day they recouered a Rocke, which opened with one of their principall port, vnder which vnſéene, they might ſhelter themſelues, and yet haue ſight of eache ſhallop, whether hée were fiſher or other, that came or went. Long had they not laine exſpecting their deſires. But Fortune, who fauoured their enterpriſe, diſcouered vnto them a a Galley bounde for <hi>Babylon,</hi> fraighted with many paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of honour, and exceeding rich, with plate, money and Iewels.

But in extreames is the Noble minde
<pb facs="tcp:26186:58"/>
beſt tried, as the Lord <hi>Cariolus</hi> in this, who ſéeing the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe of ſuch baſe companions, firſt by faire perſwaſions encouraged them to the attempt, ſhewing in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his reſolution, and arming them with hope of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, not omitting the reward of ſo honourable an action, which if they eſcaped with victorie being the beginning of their enterpriſe, deſerued more to be recompenced then all the reſt. To giue you courage my hearts (quoth he,) I ſay not to you go, but follow me your Leader, who will either winne her, or leaue my life in ſo good a cauſe. But theſe ſpéeches with thoſe daſtards preuailed not at all, who ſéeing the match vnequall, cryed ſtil to be gone, but <hi>Cariolus,</hi> who weighed his honor farre aboue all, moued with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience at their deniall, with his Rapier drawne came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, reuiling them with odious ſpéeches, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting what ere he were that ſhould in the leaſt ſort either by word or countenance, make ſhow to return, ſhould with his own hand be murdered, and ſo long as he might breath, no faint hearted villaine ſhould diſhonor him, who came to gaine honor. Therefore ſwéete blouds (quoth he,) take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and feare not, death with honor, is to be valued more then life, with a kingdomes poſſeſſion, who ſo followeth me, ſhall finde me euer his friend, and what ere I poſſeſſe, ſhall haue intereſt in it. The company how loath ſo euer they were to be wonne to ſo hard an aduenture, yet ſéeing the noble man ſo reſolute, thought it bootleſſe to refuſe him, or to make ſemblant of diſlike, holding it more wiſedome to kéepe his honorable friendſhip by their forward aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then procure his enuy by their cowardiſe, and ſeeing it high time to reſolue, the galley approaching them neare, they cried to procéed, and they would all follow him, <hi>Cario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> pleaſed with their willingnes, had ſcarce leiſure to giue directions for the fight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the galley came within hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whoſe force being ſuch and ſo wel manned as ſhe was, made ſmall account of the Frygat, who although they hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many times, yet making as if they heard not, bore vp

The Noble <hi>Cariolus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ended the fight, he kindly with words of fauour and promiſe of libertie, with great reward to the ſlaues, vrged them to apply their labor, which with ſo willing hearts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed his requeſt, that in ſhort time they had ſight of their Fléete, and beare with them all they might, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcried, they could not imagine whether the Galley were friend or no, wherefore the Generall to auoyd perill, as wiſedome with valour is requiſit, doubting that by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or other miſchiefe, they might annoy them, he called by his flage of Councell, the commanders of each ſhip, fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat and galley, aduiſing them to take great regarde, how they ſuffered the galley to boord them. By that time the whole Fléete was prepared in ſquadrons, rowing fiue and fiue, warlike and braue, <hi>Cariolus</hi> came vp with them, when the fléete halled them, they eſpied his owne cullors aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the Poope, and an other Enſigne hanging vnder her ſterne, which ſight gaue them great cauſe of ioy, to ſignifie their gladnes for his ſucceſſe, each ſhip in the foreward with their Ordinance and ſmall ſhot, according to the maner of the ſea, bad him welcome.

mortall, they regarding it as nothing, when the Generall had carefully ſéen the wound ſearched and dreſt, enquiring what they were which he had taken, he cauſed all the chief of them to be called vnto him, who on their examinations would confeſſe little, which forced the Generall to put one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inferiors, attendant on <hi>Phidamia,</hi> the Egyptian kings brother, to be tortured, who forced with the crueltie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, confeſſed what they were, and how their going for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> was to intreate a peace with the Emperour, who as they were informed, leuied a power to ſubuert their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in reuenge of the wrong offered <hi>Phedera,</hi> ſiſter to the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> King, ſlaine in a battaile fought at ſea, by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian King. This newes was not ſooner reuealed then welcome, for hereby they were aſſured of an expected frend, yet enquired the Generall, whether their King had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Princeſſe <hi>Phedera,</hi> or no, and where hée liued? Sir quoth the Egyptian, after the victory obtained, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Noble <hi>Theophilus</hi> periſhed, the King my maiſter, furniſhed for ſuche an attempt, without further ſtaie or ſuffering them to gather head, which he was ſure they would doo, hearing of their Kings ill ſucceſſe: to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent which, he framed his courſe thither, where they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly arriued, and by their power and pollicie, ſubdue the chiefeſt of the Nobilitie, who hauing them ſure, they eaſily and in ſhort time, ouercame the reſt, where he was by generall voyces (though) againſt their liking, Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King of <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> How hée puniſhed the Nobilitie, I omit, embacing them, and raiſing in their places them farre vnworthie ſuch honor and reputation, ſo that neither Gentleman or other of account, but liueth in great ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſlauery, glad to be reléeued with néedfull vyands and apparrell, at their handes, which themſelues haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fed.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe, for all the perſwaſion he can vſe, he cannot in loue obtain, yet hath he vſed the good Lady, more cruelly then I would willingly report, the ſtrangeneſſe of her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:26186:59"/>
being ſuch, as fewe but doth greatly pitie. And now as our laſt Poaſtes imparted vnto vs, he hath appointed a time wherein ſhe muſt reſolutely anſwere him to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or ende her life in fire. The which crueltie to her vſed, reported by Merchants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the vertues of the Princeſſe, and comming to the Emperors eares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the prime of his yeares, either of pollicie being mightie, to releaſe her, or whether to make her his Ladie and wife, I cannot ſay, but hée hath required her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, pretending great loue vnto her, which the King will not graunt vnto. But in words of great deſpight hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, in ſuch manner, as hée greatly diſliking, hath with fire and ſword defied him, who being a Prince of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great might and force, our nobles of <hi>Egipt,</hi> haue thought good rather to ioyne with fauourable ſhowes of friendſhip, then abide the extremitie of his furie. Loe ſir, quoth hée, thus haue I ſatiſfied your requeſt, which is all I can doo. And for the ſame quoth the Knight, receiue thy libertie, with what other fauour I may do thée.</p>
            <p>Theſe newes was as pleaſing to the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> as if he had bene poſſeſſed of the Crowne, and hauing ſuch aduantage, holding it ſmall pollicie to looſe any time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting <hi>Cariolus,</hi> emmitting the charge of his priſoners vnto his good regard, hée haſteth to his owne ſhip, where, vnto <hi>Theophilus</hi> King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> hée recounted what hée had heard, deſiring that order might be preſently taken, whereby the enemy might be ſurprized at vnawares, ſo might they finiſh their intents with leſſe danger and more honour, on which they agréeing, they ſummoned their chiefeſt, vnto whome, the Knight recounted what the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian had declared, beſéeching the King whoſe cauſe it was, to ſpeake his minde, then the reſt to giue their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe what they thought was beſt to be done, for accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing their deſires, and planting the King in his owne Countries.</p>
            <p>Theſe queſtions propounded, each particular perill,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:60"/>
with each aduantage, and occaſion which offered good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe was throughly debated, when they had each one deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered their minde, <hi>Pheander,</hi> whoſe honor was now in the Balance, as one that deſired no worldly poſſeſſions ſo much as the reputation with his miſtreſſe and the King, ſaide; Noble Gentlemen, you haue all like reſolute, braue &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die men at Armes, ſhewed in your ſpéeches the deſire you haue to do this noble King that ſeruice for which we come, if therfore you wil encline your eares to my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the reſt, I ſhall acknowledge my ſelfe greatly fauoured by you. The whole company which by curteſie was drawne to his loue, was eaſily wonne to this requeſt, and willed him ſay on, which he did in this maner.</p>
            <p>My Noble Lords, and friends in Armes, touching theſe motions made for our procéedings, it hath bin by the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian reported, whom we do credit, the King is in poſſeſſion of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> which Crowne, we know all, he doth diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably vſurpe. The Princeſſe, ſhe, in ſuch extreme, that by his cruell cenſure is not long to liue, vnleſſe againſt her will ſhe grant to loue him, who is loathſome in her eyes. To preuent which, it behoueth vs to ſearch the beſt meane that we can, and for that euery one hath giuen his cenſure, this is my aduiſe, that hauing theſe Nobles in our poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in whome conſiſteth the ſtrength of his Realme, our company being luſtie and ſtrong, we wil raunge their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, where finding place &amp; opportunitie, we may ſurprize them at vnawares, who being ſubdued, his force ſhall be the more impaired. That done, we will with all conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpéed paſſe for <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> where I doubt not but to come before the time limited the Princeſſe for her anſwere, and to reſkew her, deliuering the poſſeſſion of the Crowne, into the Kinges hand, the Knight hauing ſaid, preſently it was confirmed, and each Captain departed to his charge according to directions giuen, entered the confines of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> where they wrought by ſuch pollicie and directions of the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> that they landed in the dead of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night,

the greateſt part of their Armies, marching in warlike or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der towards the Citie of <hi>Buckelia,</hi> where the king kept his chiefe Court, and where their greateſt force was. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could recouer the walls, or come to view the ſame for any aduantage, they were deſcried, and the gates ſhut, againſt whom the Citizens made ſuch power as they could for their defence, which vnexſpected of the Knight, cauſed him to ſtaie vntill himſelfe went to knowe their pleaſures and to deliuer his owne intent. And mounting himſelfe, onely accompanied with his Herald and one Trumpet, hée came before the walles, ſommoning them to parley, which was anſwered againe by an other Trumpet, and ſuch of the nobilitie as was within, ſhewed themſelues vnto him, demanding a cauſe of his comming in Armes to diſturbe their dominions, and the ſubiects to their King.</p>
            <p>Nobles of <hi>Egypt,</hi> anſwered the <hi>Mayden Knight, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>
               </hi> lawfull King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> whoſe Crowne, your King <hi>Donacia,</hi> vniuſtly withholdeth, preſerued by heauens pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for your ſcourge, and to reuenge the bloud of thoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents ſlaine by your crueltie, is come with fire and ſword to require his right, which if you accept, and will deliuer, hée ſendes you by me mercy, if you deny and do not ſurrender your Crowne of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with all the regalties, honors, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and cuſtomes, thereunto belonging, and become his faithful ſubiects and liegemen, you ſhal all periſh with the ſword, and your Countrey flaming with fire, ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, in ſuch maner, that in time to come, there ſhal nothing be found but the ruines of your gorgious Palaces, and ſtately Cities, this hath he vowed by the honour of his name: therefore chooſe like wary Champions, and let me know your willes, for no detraction may be vſed.</p>
            <p>The Egyptian Pheres, which heard the name of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> whom they long ſithence ſuppoſed dead, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with a ſodaine feare, in ſuch manner as their ſences were depriued, and they r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

King highly wronged, yet ſhewing the Nobilitie of their mindes, ſhaking off feare, they ſayd; Syr Knight, thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for meſſage is ſuch, as we know not ſodeinly how to anſwere, neyther will we lyke faynt hearted peaſants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from our Noble aunceſtors, the honour they long mainteined, with cowardiſe to deliuer that which nature and fidelitie vrgeth vs to defend, our liues we eſtéeme as they are, vaine, and euery day ſubiect to caſualties &amp; death, nor do we enioy that ſmall time giuen vs, but onely for our Common-weale, and benefit of our Country, being pillers on whom the ſtate dependeth: you haue daſtardlyke way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted opportunitie to take vs at aduantage, our King not preſent, whoſe right and intereſt we are ſworne to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Therefore to <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſay; That as we ſerue our King, and liue by his Grace, we will with our deareſt bloud withſtand the inuaſion of any forraine Prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. If our king as you alleage, haue offered wrong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, let him reuenge it on him, and ſéeke his amendes where he may get it, for other entertainment let him not looke for here.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> hearing their reſolution, greatly commended their valour, and loyaltie to their ſoueraigne, who ſéeing their truth, pittied them, and wiſhed all men ſo faithfull mindes: yet how well ſo euer he lyked their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, their intents was to be conſidered, who came with more reſolute mindes then to be wonne with faire words, and therefore returned with all haſt to the Camp, where to the king, he briefly deliuered the ſumme of their anſwere, which the king tooke no pleaſure to heare, rather deſiring their ſubmiſſion by curteſie, then the effuſion of bloud; yet not to pitie them in ſuch maner to giue ouer the aduantage he had, wherefore that they might be aſſured of his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which came to conquere, from his vſurping foe, taking his Army which was ledde by the appoynted Generall, hée brought them before the Citie, vnto whom they gaue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſharp and fierce allarmes, and were valiantly repulſed,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:61"/>
not without great loſſe of either part. Thus continued the aſſault long and dreadfull, till <hi>Pheander</hi> noting the time of the Princeſſe <hi>Phederaes</hi> death to draw neare, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe muſt be reſcued, or dye that extreame death aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he determined to put all on fortune, to ſée the ende, and not longer to prolong time. And calling thoſe whoſe valour he had moſt aſſurance off, hée made knowne vnto them his intent, requiring their company, wherunto ſmall perſwaſions ſerued, deſirous to be a partner with him in his actions, which were in all things very honorable. The knight aſſured of his friends and followers in this action, gaue directions to all Captaines, at the going downe of the Sunne to be readie furniſhed with their companies, to bid the enemy battell, doing their beſt, before that place where their chiefe force was, in the meane time, he with his accomplices would aſſaile ſome other part which was of leſſe abilitie to defend.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe noble Gentlemen, hauing determined as they ſay, to winne the horſe or loſe the ſaddle, neglected no time, ſo that againſt the appointed houre, each man in his place was readily furniſhed, and moſt valiantly attempted with all warlike Enſignes to enter the Cittie, battering, ſcaling, and each ſeuerall wayes ſearching, that pollicie or valour would permit, to bring the Citie to ruine, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemy, which was moſt nobly defended with great courage and much loſſe of either part. While they were at their hardy fight on either part, it is not to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how the <hi>Mayden Knight</hi> with his aſſociates, ſéeking opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by chance lighted on the ſide of an old wall, which being ſomewhat decaied, they by induſtry of their hands &amp; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full toyle, eaſily made the breach ſuch, that they entered at pleaſure, and paſſyng through the ſtréetes which ledde to the aſſaulted gate, moleſted no man vntill they came thither, where entering the ſame, ſlewe the watch and opened the gate, aduancing the <hi>Thracian</hi> Kings colours on the top therof, crying euer in their way as they paſſed,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:62"/>
               <hi>Theſſaly, Theſſaly.</hi> This cry amazed the Citizens, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Thraſians</hi> to the hotter attempt, who entered to the reſt, &amp; with ſuch courage bare them, that they had ſoone vanquiſhed the defendants, who to ſaue their liues, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken themſelues to their Churches, as places of Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, from whence they ſent their wiues and Infants all diſrobed, to ſearch the King, and in their names to require his pardon, ſuch diligence made the modeſt matrones, that they were brought by <hi>Pheander</hi> to the King, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating themſelues at his féete, their face bedeawed with teares, they humbly beſought him to take compaſſion on them, their huſbands and children, that as he was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer, ſo with fauour to vſe the glory of his victory, as the poore ſubiects might not haue cauſe to complaine them of his crueltie, who had done nothing blame worthie, but as true ſubiects to their ſoueraigne the King, whoſe hart was moued with pittie at their ſute, gently tooke them vp, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring their calamitie by his owne miſfortunes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought him of their fidelitie, yet pretending a ſhow of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe, for refuſing his mercy proffered them by his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Generall, he would not be entreated ſodeinly to grant them life, which the Noble <hi>Pheander</hi> noted, and like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, waying their faith to their Prince, and weale of their Countrey, which with their liues they had ſought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he was content to remit their fault, and not onely to pardon their liues, but reſtore them to all former liberties, and places of honour, without any diſparagement to their royaltie, ſo that they would acknowledge him their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and be as faithfull to him and his, as they had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelues to that vſurper his enemy. This choyſe at firſt ſéemed hard, yet of two euils the leaſt is to be choſen, as theſe Nobles of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who ſéeing their liues, wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and what they poſſeſt, to be in the hands of ſtrangers, whom they could not withſtand, making a vertue of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, were the rather wonne to yéeld themſelues vnto the Kings pleaſure, at the interceſſion of their wiues, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:26186:62"/>
teares ſhead in abundance, moued them to ruth, in ſuch wiſe, that ſubiecting on theſe conditions to his Exellence, they proclaimed him king of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſwearing fayaltie vnto him, and deliuering hoſtages for their loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This done, the king with generall conſent Crowned, the Commons gan conceiue an eſpeciall hope of his hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loue to them, whoſe kindneſſe was ſuch, that hauing the Citie and whole kingdome at his pleaſure, would not ſuffer his ſouldiers to imbeaſell or purloyne in any ſort, but rather made choiſe to reward the Mercenary men out of his owne treaſury, which honourable beginning, gained their eſpecial lyking: when order was taken for the gouernment of the ſtate, <hi>Pheander</hi> who was mindfull of the Princeſſe <hi>Phedera,</hi> haſted the King on for <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> often putting him in mind, what daungers the good Lady was likely to abide, if ſhe conſented not to the King, who was more cruell then curteous, wherefore taking their pledges, he left the noble <hi>Cariolus</hi> his Vizegerent, to take the gouernment vpon him in his abſence, and with the next fauourable wind, they ſet ſaile for <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> where to their good ſucceſſe wée leaue them, to tell you more of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> the Heathen Prince, who was in the Princeſſe <hi>Nutania</hi> her cuſtodie.</p>
            <p>The mightie Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ill ſucceſſe of his ſonne, with the great ſlaughter of his men, was moued at the firſt to ſuch chollor, that he had determined for euer to abandone his ſonne, and neuer to haue knowne or regarded him, but being perſwaded by his nobilitie which tenderly loued the prince, he was at length by their motions, wonne to conceiue, how vnſtable fortunes chances are, and how victories ſometimes happen as well to the coward as the valiant, not forgetting to vrge vnto him, how diſhonourable it were for a Prince, to leaue the meaneſt ſubiect he had at ſuch an exigent, that ſhould aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life in his ſeruice, much more was his Maieſtie bound by natures lawes to reléeue his ſonne, and not ſuffer him as one forſaken, to remaine in the handes of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:63"/>
vpon which motion of his Baſhawes, the King cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed two Gallies to be rigged and furniſhed, appointing of his chiefeſt Nobles too, for that voyage to <hi>Thrace,</hi> as wel to aduertiſe him of his ſonnes welfare which he fauoured, as alſo to agrée vpon the ſumme of his ranſom, all things fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for the voyage, the Baſhawes hauing taken leaue of the Emperor and the reſt of their friends, fauoured with a happy gale, they ſhortly arriued in <hi>Thrace,</hi> of whoſe arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, the king by his meſſengers was aduertiſed, who being of nature honourable and curteous in behauiour, cauſed a ſumptious traine of Courtiers, with all the honorable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they could, to receiue them at their Port of landing, taking lyke order in all lodgings and places of repaſt, his Officers at his charge to attend them, which in ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit manner was performed, as the Baſhawes with their retinue, admyred their entertainment. Thus by eaſie iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies came they to the court, where the king with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, gaue them many welcomes, enquiring kindly after the good health of the renowmed Emperour their maiſter, whome hée maligned no whit at all, how hardly ſo euer he had meaſured his friendſhip with him, when the King and theſe Nobles had ſpent ſome time in diſcourſing, they enquired of the welfare of their Prince <hi>Muſtaffa,</hi> whome the King cauſed to be ſought and brought to their preſence, before whome they bowed themſelues in all humbleneſſe, as to the ſonne of their ſoueraigne, whom he againe with all kindneſſe imbraſed, paſſyng the time with much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ioying in the welfare of his friendes. The King dooing them all the honour that could bee deuiſed, paſſing the time with ſuche recreation and gentle ſportes as the Countrey affoorded, at length, a ſumme of money for the Princeſſe raunſome was agreed vpon to their content, for that it was reaſonable, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions honorable, which obteined their vittailes by the king was reléeued, &amp; all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries at his charge purueyed, in ſuch maner, and with ſo much bounty, as they had great cauſe to report honorably of
<pb facs="tcp:26186:63"/>
the kyng. Long had they not tarried, but a winde pleaſant and fauourable, preſents it ſelfe, which good time, they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected not, but taking leaue of the king, their prince, &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Nutania,</hi> who accompanied them onwards to their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, thrée whole daies iournies, they leaue them to the care of their iourny, who being imbarqued, in ſhort time arriued at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where how welcom they were to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour &amp; his Nobles, I omit, to let you vnderſtand of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable reports made of their entertainment in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and the welfare of the prince, whoſe company, there were fewe but deſired. The ſtrangenes of this report made of <hi>Philar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> was excéeding admirable in the Emperors eares, who wondered not a little, that a king whome he had ſo much wronged, ſhould vſe ſuch kindnes to his ſon, and curteſie to his meſſengers, extolling highly the honourable condition of the king, and much lamenting his owne follyes, ſo raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any occaſion offered, to iniury him ſo farre as to ſpoyle his Countrey, and to robbe him perforce of his onely child, his ſole delight &amp; comfort. To recompence all which, and to kéep his friendſhip, he preſently elected other nobles for <hi>Thrace,</hi> to be employd, which with the princeſſe ranſom, and many rich preſents to the king and his daughter were diſpatched, with Letters of loue, and deſire of amitie, all which, comming to the <hi>Thraſian</hi> king, were ſo heartily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as they could wiſh, and in preſence of the nobles, and ſtates of both Realmes, was the peace concluded, and a band of euerlaſting friendſhip promiſed, to all their ioyes. Thus with great delight at the earneſt interceſſion of the king, ſpent thoſe Turkiſh nobles ſometime in <hi>Thrace,</hi> till their prefixed time ganne drawe to ende, when receiuing their Prince with great rewardes, and many thankes for their paines they put to Sea, and were not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they recouered theyr famous Cittie of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where they were moſt royally welcommed, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Prince, for whoſe ſafetie many paſtymes was ordeined, with Iuſtings, Turneyes, Barriers, and other
<pb facs="tcp:26186:64"/>
pleaſing delights, wherein the Prince honorably bare him ſelfe, to the great ioy of his father, and pleaſure of the whole ſtate, who gloried greatly in him, which was likely to proue a moſt honorable Prince; and their enſuing comfort. But while I digreſſe, let it be conſidered, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
               <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> who thirſted to ſée the ende of his deſires, ſlept no time, but made all poſſible meanes he could, as winde and weather would giue leaue, vntil he arriued in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in ſo good time as he could wiſh, and taking that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie which was offered, he landed his companies, and neare to the ſea ſide encamped his power, vntill he might be aduertiſed of what power the King was, and where hée remained, for the atteining of which, many eſpialls was ſent out ſundry wayes, and many Ambuſcadoes layd, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept ſuch as trauelled the country: but their landing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcryed, euery one in the haſte they could make, hyed them to their cities and places of defence, where they with their ſtore of prouiſion which they brought, were receiued. The King, who ſecurely paſſed his time, taking care for nothing, and ioying wholly in the hopes he conceiued of his Ladies graunt, being aduertiſed of the arriuall of a forrein power, ouercome with ſorrow at that inſtant, as one that neuer taſted aduerſitie, was ſurprized with ſuch ſodain hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, as no words, no perſwaſions, nor any comfort, might mittigate his ſorrow, what paines ſoeuer his Nobles tooke to pacifie him, his guiltie conſcience preſaging ſome hard fortune to be at hand: the Nobilitie which had more regard to his welfare and his countrey then he could on the ſodain imagine, after they had cauſed their Rampyers to be ſhut, and their Fortreſſes to be made, doubting the worſt, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be reſolued what the enemy was, that thus daring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly durſt boord him in his own country, they cauſed the Lord <hi>Mama Bacha,</hi> ſomtime one of the chiefeſt in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> a wiſe and well gouerned Gentleman, to be ſent vnto them, to know whence they were, and their pretence, which againſt their willes, vnacquainting them with their pretence, had

The Noble man to whoſe charge this was committed, though he had ſmall care of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, liuing diſhonoured in his owne Country, where, in his Kings raigne he was the onely honoured, and amongſt his Nobles in moſt account of him, had his wits ſundry wayes imployd, and on diuerſe matters, yet amongſt all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the thought of his owne ſoueraigne was leaſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his death being ſo certain, but what ſo euer he could imagine was vncertaine, wherefore as deſirous to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of his doubts, as the King and Nobles to be thereof certified, onely accompanied with an other of the diſgraced Nobilitie, they hyed them towards the Campe, and was by the Ambuſcadoes ſoone ſurprized and brought to the Paui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the Generall, who ſaluting them with kind counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, demaunded whence they were, and what occaſions led them in ſuch ſuſpitious manner towards their Campe. The Nobles which had ſmall care which ende went fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, after they had well aduiſed themſelues, ſaid; (ſir,) if we giue not thoſe tytles your honour deſerue, pardon vs which offend not of preſumption therein, but of ignorunce: that we come as ſpyalls to view thy force, and to diſcouer them, therein you deceiue your ſelfe, but come as meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from our King, to know thy pretence, and what thou meaneſt landing thy Armies without his lycence, which is contrary to lawe of Armes? If thou come in peace and not as as enimy, reſolue vs this, &amp; thou honoreſt vs? The prince taking their wordes at aduantage, where they ſayd they came from their King, with a counterfeyt ſhewe of great diſlike, ſayd; Traytors how dare you to my face vſe thoſe colours of ſimplicitie, when you auer you come from your King, which I know is altogither vntrue? wherefore that you ſhall warne the reſt how they delude me, you ſhal haue the reward of traytors, and calling for the prouoſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, commanded him to cut off their heads. The Nobles, thinking he had bene paſt ieaſt, ſéeing their executioner ſo ready, humbly beſought him to credit what they had ſayd,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which was true, and pardon their liues, for that lawe of Armes protecteth the meſſenger of the Prince, from whom they come, therefore it would redowne to his great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to violate the hoſtilitie of all Princes. While they were thus at their ſhrift, it chanced <hi>Theophilus</hi> their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, to enter the Pauilion of his General, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence much appalled the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> nobles, who ſtanding as men paſt themſelues, had no thought but in beholding him, which ſo much reſembled their ſuppoſed dead king, the long noting of whom, cauſed them to renue their ſorrows, and with remembrance of the times they had paſt, to ſhead teares. The King imagining what they thought, knowing them well, put them from their ſtudious thoughts thus.</p>
            <p>Men of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> what meaneth your heauineſſe? think you hereby to delude this noble Gentleman, or by your fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, to procure your fauour, if either one or other of theſe cauſes, you deceiue your ſelues, and incurre you more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Wherfore to auoyd the perils incident vnto you, if you be right <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> and tender the walfare of your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, in whoſe reſcue we come, briefly declare vnto vs, in what eſtate ſhe abideth, and where the vſurping king hath his reſidence? <hi>Mama Bacha,</hi> hearing that pleaſing tongue, wherwith he was acquainted, aſſured himſelfe that it was their king, and without further ſtay, humbly kiſſyng his Maieſties féete, his face bedeawed with teares, and his tongue foltering in his mouth, as one with ſodaine ioy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, he ſaith; My gratious ſoueraigne, how glad am I that enioy breath, to behold your Maieſtie aliue, whom all the world reputeth for dead, the heauy tydings of which, with your ill ſucceſſe, moued the hearts of your louing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to ſuch extreame heauineſſe, as nothing might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that paſt comfort, and al hope of beholding your prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly face, we reckoned you amongſt the dead. In the extreme of this ſorrow, as all euils commonly fall in one, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery heart and eye was deploring the loſſe of ſo gratious a Prince, then beganne our further griefes through the
<pb facs="tcp:26186:65"/>
oppreſſion of this vſurping tyrant, whoſe crueltie to thy ſubiects hath bene ſuch, as gréeueth me to recount. Thy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter he deteineth in priſon, from whence he hath vowed ſhe ſhall neuer be freed, vntil with conſent ſhe take him for her king, or by gainſaying his demaundes, receiue that death which he hath doomed her vnto, whoſe wronges we poore men how much ſo euer we pittie, yet can we remedy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, our abilitie being litle, and our reputation leſſe, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe cruel Egyptians who hath robbed vs of what we poſſeſt, not ſuffering vs to enioy our auncient patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor what they might any way diſpoile vs of: to reuenge of which, we hope in thée and thy power, who wilt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defende thy owne lawfull right, rather offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy life amongſt vs that honour and loue thée as our liues, then leaue vs any more. To the accompliſhing of which, my ſelfe, with all thy owne Countrey borne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes that wée can procure vnto vs, will lende what ayd our weake force will ſtretch vnto, and thereof aſſure your Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>The King hearing the lamentable report of the Lord <hi>Mama Bacha,</hi> could not forbeare to ſhewe the heauineſſe of his hearts ſorrow, by his outward motions, yet to hide it as he might, imbracing them both, hée framed a feined ioy to ſée them, how ſo euer his heart was ouerburthened with grief. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had paſſed ſome time in parley about their affaires, and that ſome offers were made by theſe Nobles, of their ayde and aſſiſtance, a generall Councell was called, where, by conſent of ſuch as had gouernment, vnderſtanding the power of <hi>Donatio</hi> the vſurper, was no more but ſuch as guarded his holdes, it was determined, after the army had refreſhed themſelues two or thrée daies, to martch forewarde to the Cittie, there to beleager the King, and cut off from them all ſupply of prouiſion for victualles, whereof they had ſmall ſtore.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the Lordes of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> to giue notiſe to all their friends, (with all ſpéede) as they tendered their
<pb facs="tcp:26186:66"/>
owne liberties, to repaire with ſuch power as they could make vnto the Campe. This deuiſe was no ſooner deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on, but the Noble <hi>Mama Bacha,</hi> without returning to the King, ſpared not his paines and all others which hée could command or entreate, proclaiming in euery place as they paſſed, <hi>Theophilus</hi> their lawful king, ſtraightly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all naturall ſubiects of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> to make repaire vnto the Campe. Theſe tydings at firſt were hardly beléeued, yet ſuch was the rumour of a forreine power landed, that all which could beare Armes repaired to the King, whome they founde at the aſſault of the Cittie where the vſurper kept, ſuch was the multitudes of people, which from all countries in his Regions came vnto him, that in ſhort time he had power ſufficient to ouerrunne a kingdome. The v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper <hi>Donatio,</hi> who had leaſt thought euer to heare or ſée the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> King, when the report of his being in the Campe, was brought vnto him, his courage quailed, and his hope of enioying the Crowne, was quite extinguiſhed, ſo that diſpairing, he became lyke a man lunatike, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (whatſoeuer) might moue him to any mirth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſo that giuing ouer all, he cared not what became of himſelfe or his, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t was he carefully counſelled by his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, who regarded both his honour and their owne ſafetie: but whatſoeuer they might counſell or determine, was ill imployd, at his hands was nothing to be had, wherefore, after they ſaw his ſmall care, and that he was not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, they determined, either in field with vnappoynted battell to try their fortunes, or by ſome ſuch compoſition as might be for their Courtries ſafetie and their reputation, to giue ouer their tytle pretended to the Crowne of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Before that any thing was of them reſolued, the <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Knight,</hi> which had his minde on his Lady, as well as of other affaires, could not reſt in content, vntill he had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and either gained what they came for, or ſéene the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of fortune. Wherefore to auoyd further delaies, hée ſummoned the Citie to parley, wherein he required their
<pb facs="tcp:26186:66"/>
anſwere, whether they would receiue their lawfull King or no, if yea, they ſhould ſuffer him in peace to enter, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe vpon their anſwere, to abide the hazard incident to Armes, which he proteſted ſhould be voyd of all fauour, if he preuailed, and they refuſed this offer of his. Theſe ſummons, cauſed the Nobilitie to looke with better aduiſe into their eſtates, and with conſideration to wey each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler perill, which they found to be very many, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, eſpecially ſéeing the multitude, who were naturall ſubiects, and did rather affect their owne King, how ſo euer they profeſſed in outward appearance, then the vſurper, which made them the more earneſt with their King, vnto whom they declared the offers made by the <hi>Maiden Knight,</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doubts they had of his ſucceſſe, who were nothing in number to the Kings power, which daily increaſed, and contrary, his decreaſed: wherfore they aduiſed him to yéeld vnto ſuch Articles of honour as they would require, which ſhould be both for his honour, and ſafetie of him and his. The vſurper hearing theſe perſwaſions from them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his chéefeſt hope conſiſted, forgetting all former friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and loue to any of them, with moſt odious words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiled them, calling them traytors, daſtards, and vpbraiding them with cowardiſe, which were neuer founde but euer forward in all his actions, onely this excepted, wherin was no hope. Theſe ſpéeches moued his Nobles to ſuch furie, that departing from him in diſcontent, they reſolued for their owne ſafetie, to ſéek what means they could, and not by delaies to incurre his diſpleaſure whoſe friendſhip they were by all meanes they could vſe, to intreat. Wherfore in name of all the reſt, the Lord <hi>Philiago,</hi> principall Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror vnto the King, by whoſe direction the reſt would be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, ſent for the Princeſſe <hi>(Phedera)</hi> from priſon, whom he vſed with honorable ſpéeches, comforting her with hope of her kingly brother, who liued, and was in perſon come with a ſtrong power, to deliuer her from that captiuitie which ſo long ſhe endured, humbly beſéeching her grace, to
<pb facs="tcp:26186:67"/>
become a fauourable ſoliciter to his Highneſſe, for them, who were to be commaunded by their ſoueraigne, whoſe ſubiects they were, proteſting that neither for enuy to him or his, they vndertooke the action, but at commaundment, and to auoyde the ignomious tytle of cowardize, which all of honorable birth or mind, ought to deteſt. The good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe which could not tell, whether ſhe might giue credit to his words or no, anſwered him thus.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Philiago,</hi> vnder the gréeneſt graſſe lurketh the moſt perillous poyſon, and experience hath taught me, in my durance, the knowledge of friends, theſe ſodeine offers of loue to my brother, whom you all know, is long ſithence dead, cauſeth me the more to dread, I am going to him, and that your proffered friendſhip is but to that end to bereaue mée of that which long ſince I wiſhed to leaue, if it bée ſo, good my Lorde, hyde not the truth thereof from mée, for therein ſhall you ſhewe your charitable minde to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Captiue.</p>
            <p>Farre be it from my thought, Noble Ladie, quoth <hi>Philia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> that I ſhould any way delude you, or moue you to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit any thing other then truth, whom I haue my greateſt hope of good, to aſſure you of which, ſo pleaſeth your Exel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, I will my ſelfe bring you to his Maieſties preſence. When the Princeſſe heard him make theſe proffers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and perceiued by his ieſture he did not counterfeyt, ouercome with ioy, ſhe was in a traunce, from which, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued by the carefull induſtry of the Lady <hi>Vrania,</hi> wife to the Lord <hi>Philiago,</hi> ſhée gaue the Noble man great thanks for his tydings, aſſuring him on her word, that ſhe would ſo recompence that good, as hée nor his, ſhould haue any cauſe to complaine of her vngratefulneſſe.

But tell me <hi>Phedera,</hi> what are theſe that accompany thée, ſtrangers to me they are, how frendly ſoeuer they haue vſed thée?</p>

The <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> willing to hold her honor in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, ſayd; Madame, how his Maieſtie on the ſodaine may be wonne to fauour your ſute, I cannot ſay, hauing had ſuch great cauſe to reuenge him on their crueltie, but for his life, let him thanke your grace, if he enioy it. The King, whoſe heart pittie moued to tender the ſute of the princeſſe, comming towards the noble <hi>Philiago</hi> and his Lady, with great curteſie tooke them from the earth wheron they knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, accepting them to his maieſtie, vſing them with ſuch honor &amp; curteſie, that they admired him. After he had reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with his kinde confections theſe ſorrowing ſuters, hée ſaid; <hi>Philiago,</hi> as I haue pardoned thy life, ſo faile not to tell me, thy Kings determination, whether he will yéeld, or in battell try the euent of our fortunes?</p>

To their recreation we leaue them, and paſſe on with the Lord <hi>Philiago,</hi> who made no ſtaie vntill he came to the gates, where diuerſe of

No ſooner entered hée the Cittie, but ſommoning the Nobles and Gonernors of the Citte togither, he deliuered vnto them, what fauour he had receiued of the King, and how willing he was to ſhew lyke clemencie vnto them all, vpon thoſe conditions ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, whereunto he perſwaded them to yéeld, not omitting any thing to make them mindfull of the litle hope they had of the vſurpers ſucceſſe, for which they had no reaſon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline vnto him, who had ſo ſmall regard of them, but rather let him endure the reward of his owne follies, then that ſo many ſhould periſh for one mans wronges.

At which offer of grace, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, wearied with the oppreſſion of the vſurper, in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes aſſembled themſelues, and guided by <hi>Philiago,</hi> they fiercely aſſailed the king in his Court, fleying as many as they could reach vnto, and reſkued their fellowe Nobles, whoſe death by the Tyrant was determined, had not the valour and policie of this noble <hi>Philiago</hi> preuailed. In this exployt, many of the company of the vſurper was ſlain, him ſelfe with ſuch as eſcaped, betooke them to the mountaines, where they encamped themſelues, exſpecting aide of thoſe he had preferred. But they more regarding their owne weale then his honor, and ſéeing no comfort or hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery, ſubmitted themſelues vnto the kings mercy, and was of him receiued.

great brauery behaued themſelues, but the beſt and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt honor in each ſeuerall action, was giuen the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> who lyke himſelfe ſo behaued himſelfe, as there was no talke, throughout Court and Countrey, but tended to the generall commendations of this noble Prince. Thus as all things hath end, ſo ended theſe tryumphes, and the King in peace enioyed his kingdome, which through the <hi>Thracian</hi> Kings aſſiſtance, and the valour of this honored knight, he obteined. Al things quieted, the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> after he had a ſmall time repoſed himſelfe from his trauels, humbly beſought his highneſſe, to ſuffer him with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies to depart, which fauour, he could not by any intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie obtaine. Wherefore to ſatiſfie the King with his owne longer ſtaie, he diſmiſſed his Army, whom the King ſo roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rewarded, as no man had cauſe to complain of his time ſpent, but euery one to ſpeake of his honor and bountie. The conduct of whome, after hee had with great care puruaide them victualls, with all things neceſſary, he committed to <hi>Vrelia,</hi> a noble man of <hi>Thrace,</hi> by whom the knight aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed the king of his ſtaie, which was chiefly for the Lorde <hi>Cariolus,</hi> whom they left Vizeroy in <hi>Egipt,</hi> recommending alſo his ſeruice vnto the Lady <hi>Nutania,</hi> he preſented by this noble <hi>Vrelia,</hi> the vſurper vnto her, as her priſoner, (and his conqueſt). Thus all things carefully puruaide, the winde blowing a fauourable gale, they imbarqued themſelues, and ſayling with a winde as they could wiſh, they ſhortly arriued in ſafetie at their deſired Port, where their welcom was ſuch of the king, as they might ioy to receiue it, where friend with friend, ioyed for their returne, onely the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe endured the greateſt penance, miſſing the returne of her knight, who could not be perſwaded of his welfare, wanting his preſence, yet accepted ſhe the vſurper his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and through the great proteſtations of the Lord <hi>Vre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> had hope to ſée him againe, whoſe heart enioyed ſmall content, wanting his company.</p>

But hée whoſe heart was fixed on his Lady, had no motion of any other, onely wiſhed to bee with her whome hee ſo much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whoſe preſence, he more deſired, then all the riches the worlde could offoord.

<pb facs="tcp:26186:71"/>
aire, and contagiouſneſſe of thoſe Confines, was nothing agréeing with his body, and that his longer ſtaie, might be by his confuſion.</p>
            <p>The king which loued him as his owne ſoule, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his welfare more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the wealth of his kingdome, whom he had found ſo kinde and forward, aduenturing his life for his good in many broyles, though loth to leaue him in whome ſo much he delighted, yet noting his melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like humours, which had much altered his complexion, imagined it was no excuſe, and therefore the rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to his requeſt, appoynting a time as he deſired, when if God ſent winde and weather, to be readie with their ſhipping, to conduct him to <hi>Egypt,</hi> whither the king promiſed with his ſiſter and nobles to accompany him, for which iourney, a ſtrict commaund was giuen to all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to ſée each thing neceſſary puruayde, which with ſuch diligence was performed, as in ſhort time all things was as they could wiſh or deſire furniſhed, onely attending a faire winde to ſet ſayle, which they ſtayed not long for. But a gale fitting their purpoſe, the kyng with his ſiſter, the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> and their train, embarqued themſelues for <hi>Egipt,</hi> where by the good furtherance of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth all, they ſhortly arriued in ſafetie, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, being knowne vnto the Vizeroy <hi>Cariolus,</hi> with ſuch prouiſion as they could make on the ſuddaine, repaired vnto the place of landing, where the king ioyfull to ſée the good recouery of <hi>Cariolus,</hi> in moſt kinde maner imbraced him. And ſo generall welcomes being giuen on all ſides by the Nobles, they paſſe on towards the Pallace of the king, who with a generall loue of his Commons, was to his great delight welcommed, with ſuch ſhewes of ioy as on the ſodaine they could prepare.</p>
            <p>Thus after ſome time ſpent in banquetting and other paſtimes for their welcomes, to beguile the time the better, the <hi>Mayden Knight</hi> ſtanding on thornes, vntill he might
<pb facs="tcp:26186:72"/>
behold the ſwéete content of his liues comfort, finding <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolus</hi> in place where they might diſcuſſe at large theyr mindes. The knight not forgetting his promiſe made to <hi>Cariolus</hi> in his own country, and willing to make amends for the wrong he had there, thus ſaid:</p>
            <p>My Lord, what I haue to impart vnto you as one that wiſheth your good, is ſuch, as becommeth a friend, vowed to do your Lordſhip what ſeruice my abilitie can ſtretch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, onely I beſéech you, promiſe on your honor to conceale what I ſhall diſcouer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cariolus,</hi> who both honored and loued the knight, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to what theſe ſpéeches tended, relying on the fidelitie of him whome he neuer had heard or ſéene to commit any diſhonorable action, gaue him his word and honor, to be as ſecret in all things as he could deſire, which the knight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, thus ſaid:</p>
            <p>My Lord, firſt I humbly beſéech your fauourable loue, to be continued, and pardon my great offence committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, in <hi>Numedia,</hi> where not being my ſelfe, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a moſt hainous offence and diſhonorable, for which I am willing to make ſuch ſatiſfaction, as you can require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cariolus,</hi> hearing the knight vſe theſe ſpéeches of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, noting them well, and bethinking himſelfe what had fortuned, being in <hi>Numedia,</hi> could not call to minde any vnkindneſſe offered him by any inferiour perſon, neither did he well remember the princes diſcurteſie, yet leauing nothing vnſought, calling his wittes togither, bethought him of the prince, whom they forbeare to anſweare, vntill he had with earneſtneſſe noted the phiſnomy of the knight, whoſe face with long ſickneſſe, wherewith he was at that time poſſeſt, was quite altered from the forme it now had, which made him more to admire. But calling to mind the reſemblance of the aged king, he conceiued by ſome ſignes of his fauour, that it was doubtleſſe the prince, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he was, for that being ſo nobly borne, he came to the <hi>Numedian</hi> Court, with no better countenance then a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.
<pb facs="tcp:26186:72"/>
After many thoughts, not willing to offend through raſhneſſe, or to offer any vnkindneſſe, he humbly beſought him in true friendſhip which he had found, to pardon him, which could not call to minde no wrong done him, nor any familiaritie that euer had bene betwéene them.</p>
            <p>Well my Lord, quoth the knight, I ſée your minde is frée from reuenge, that know not thoſe that haue endaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered your life, and therefore am the more willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale my ſelfe to cleare you of this doubt. Know that I am <hi>Dionicus,</hi> the vnhappy Prince of <hi>Numedia,</hi> who in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court ſo much abuſed you, whereof I repent me, and haue ſorrowed for it. But pardon me good <hi>Cariolus,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that friendſhip I vowed vnto you, which wil endeuour to deſerue thy loue in all occaſions wherein true loue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. To giue you ſome cauſe to credit what I ſay, I haue thought good to find this opportunitie, not onely to reueale myſelfe to you, whoſe fauour I deſire, but to doo my beſt indeuour to deſerue the ſame, and to aduance thy eſtate, if ſo you can lyke of my offer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cariolus,</hi> amazed at theſe ſpéeches, after he had with more aduiſed eyes beheld the Prince, was aſſured it was he, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating himſelfe on his knée, humbly beſought his grace of pardon, which had ſo vnreuerently behaued himſelfe. But gratious Prince quoth he, faultes vnwillingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, deſerue the leſſe puniſhment, I ſpeake for my ſelfe which am ready to make amendes in performing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Here Gentlemen, the ſtory telleth vs, that the <hi>Thracian</hi> King, (as fleſh is mortall) vexed with an extreme ſicknes, was ſo oppreſſed therewith, that nature failing through weake age, all phiſicke helpes were friuolous, ſo that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force he muſt pay his due to death which commandeth all, whoſe breath failing at the ſommon of this tyrant, which may not be intreated, his ſoule departed this earthly trunk, to ſée the ioyes of the euerlaſting kingdome, whoſe death his ſubiects ſo with pittious plaintes bewailed, as might haue changed the moſt hardeſt heart into a <hi>Caos</hi> of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſorrowes, beholding their teares, whoſe bodie was moſt royally intombed amongſt his Anceſtry. But among thoſe which ſorrow ouerwhelmed, and had like to haue drowned in deaths gulph, the Princeſſe, whom nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſome ſort to lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as a child hauing loſt her father, was ſo weakened with her plaints and hearts ſorrow, that long time it was not to be thought ſhe could recouer it, ſo much was her tender heart touched, eftſoones bewailing her fathers death, and then againe, gréeuing for the want of her Loue and Lord the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> of whoſe ſafetie whom ſhe more deſired then to be Lady of the whole earth, could not be perſwaded.

likewiſe, neuer to grant her loue or liking to any one, but onely to him. This reſolution ſo much gréeued her nobles, that nothing could breed more diſcontent, yet as dutie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, framed themſelues to her gouernment, who with ſuch wiſedom directed all things for the benefit of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, that it was admirable to behold that wiſdome in one of her ſexe.</p>
            <p>But to return to our matter. The <hi>Theſſalian</hi> King, who minding his honourable word with the noble <hi>Pheander,</hi> finding opportunitie, ganne queſtion his ſiſter in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phedera,</hi> ſince the deceaſe of our deare parence, thou haſt bene left vnto my gouernment, for whom, (without boaſt) or deſire of benefit of thée or any, I haue had that care as of mine owne good, and euer will, ſo thou be ruled by me. And for I ſée thy yeares requireth to be linked in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that thou maiſt participate in loue with thy huſband, and ſpend the prime of thy yeares as is fitting thy eſtate, I haue found a Gentleman of honor and valour, ſuch a one, as on my word loueth thée, and I haue cauſe for his paines in my ſeruice imployd to honor. Therefore good ſiſter, if thou loue me as a brother, and haſt not beſtowed thy loue elſewhere, in this matter be ruled by mée, and in dooing whereof, thou ſhalt finde mée thy brother, and moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red friend, who will euer be as carefull of thy well doing and honor, as of mine good. Say therefore thy minde plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let me knowe whether thou doeſt loue, or canſt loue?</p>
            <p>The Lady, whoſe wiſedome was ſuch as balanced her honor, not knowing whether her brother were in in ieſt or earneſt, thus modeſtly ſaid; Gracious Lord, and my dread ſoueraigne, pardon I humbly beſéech you, your ſubiect, and ſuffer mée not through my fond anſwering ſo friuolous a queſtion, which you vrge but for my triall, to procure your diſpleaſure, or mine owne ſhame.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Phedera,</hi> quoth the King, you miſtake me, if you
<pb facs="tcp:26186:75"/>
thinke I ieaſt, for on my honor, I meane what I ſay, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dally not with mée, if you hope of my good. But tell me if thou doeſt loue, or wilt loue my friend?</p>
            <p>The Ladie hearing the King in earneſt, although ſhée could be well content to haue enioyed the ſwéet pleaſures of loue in marriage, thus ſayd; Dread Lord, and my moſt gracious ſoueraigne, ſithence it is your pleaſure I ſhould anſwere your demaunde, Know, that as modeſtie is the ornament of Maydes, and chaſtitie, the garland that bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth all our ſexe, ſo haue I carefully weyed mine honor in ſuch manner, that I neither loue, nor as yet euer made choyce of any in loue, but haue eſchewed all ſuch friuolous motions of the fleſh, to my greateſt power, as beſéemeth a Lady of ſuch honor. That I may loue, I doubt not, becauſe it is the commandement of our maker, and incident to all creatures, who in their kindes make choyce of ſome one to participate with: yet ſhall my loue neuer be ſuch, as may diſparage your highneſſe loue towards me, but ſuch as ſhall be to your content. And for your graces pleaſure is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow me on a man ſo honorable, ſo ſtandeth it with your will to let mée knowe him, I will anſwere more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>God a mercy for that wench, quoth the King, then I doubt not but wée ſhall haue a match, or elſe thy wiſedome is not ſuch as I wiſh it were. But tell mée vnfeinedly my <hi>Phedera,</hi> canſt thou loue the Lord <hi>Cariolus,</hi> a man for birth honorable, for valour, to compare with moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturing Knightes in the worlde, in perſon comely, and ſo dibonire in his behauiour, as for curteſie hée is to bee matched with the beſt? Hée is the man Madame, whom if you can fancie, thou honoureſt mée in thy loue, and thou ſhalt finde mée a brother, nay a father, if fathers loue may excéed the brothers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Say therefore thy minde, and let me know thy anſwere?</p>
            <p>The Ladie whoſe hope was, her brothers ſute had
<pb facs="tcp:26186:76"/>
bene for the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> with whoſe loue ſhe was a little touched, yet modeſtie maſtering ſuch fond motions, would not let affection take ſuch roote but that ſhée could at her pleaſure expell it.</p>
            <p>After the Lady had heard her brother, whom ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his earneſtneſſe in vttering his ſute, would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be denied, ſhe ſaid; Pardon me my good Lord, if I paſſe modeſtie, conſidering your great praiſe of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, beléeue me, he is much beholding vnto your Grace, who could haue thought you would haue prooued ſo good a ſoliciter? had your ſtudie bene the Lawes of this Realme, no doubt, but you ſhould haue had many Clyants: were the Gentleman here himſelfe, he could not haue ſayd thus much, and therefore he may thinke himſelfe beloued and honored of your highneſſe. But for anſwere, as I would not haue you in your firſt wooing diſgraced, leaſt it diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you in your owne enterpriſes being a batcheler, ſo can I ſay little of my ſelfe, who is to be gouerned by you, to, whom in all humbleneſſe I referre me, and ſhall ſo you be pleaſed, be content, if it were with one not ſo worthie as the Lord <hi>Cariolus.</hi> (And yet)</p>
            <p>Nay Madam, quoth the King, leaue not off ſo abruptly with an aparentizes, your words are doubtfull. Tell mée therfore, is there any other before me? if there be, and thou haſt made choyce, (and you both agreed) I will not gainſay it, nor tye thée to any other then thy owne content in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Therefore ſay, what thoſe words (and yet) imported?</p>
            <p>Pardon my ouer boldneſſe, gracious Lord, anſwered the Lady, which vnaduiſedly ouerpaſt thoſe ſpéeches, and credit my word, which haue no loue fixed in my heart, but will endeuour my ſelfe to the liking of him whom you ſhall commaund me, yet will I anſwer your demaund, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe words, taken ſo by your grace at rebounde, though I muſt and will, frame me to the loue and liking of the Lord <hi>Cariolus.</hi> Yet had the noble Generall bene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and with that, a déep ſigh ſtaid her tongue, in ſuch wiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:76"/>
as ſhe could go no farther.</p>
            <p>The King vnderſtanding which way the winde of her deſire blew, though he could haue bene better content with her choyce, yet to put her from other thoughts, and to haue his ſute take effect, he perſwaded her to let ſlip ſuch fonde imaginations, for that he had placed his loue on a Ladie of his Country, whom he would not leaue for all the world. With theſe happie tidings for the Lord <hi>Cariolus,</hi> after ſome other kinde ſpéeches to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lady, the King departed, ſo ioying in his good ſucceſſe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he could not reſt vntill he had comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lord <hi>Cariolus</hi> with his anſwer, whoſe mind egged on by the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> was ſo fixed on the Lady, that ſhe was become the miſtreſſe of his heart, and he ioyed in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in contemplating of her loue, thinking euery day a yeare, and euery houre a month, vntil he heard the Kings anſwere, muſing thus on his Loue, toſſing with a minde diſquietted, from one ſide the bedde to the other, his Page brought him word, that a Gentleman from the King, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſpeake with him, which ſodaine newes, reuiued ſo his ſpirits, as made his heart more light, then long time before it had bene, hoping to here ſuch happie tidings as his louing ſute required. The Meſſenger hauing deliuered his meſſuage, iudge you that be louers, whether you could ſlack any time vntil you heard the doome of your miſtreſſe, which he was aſſured to do by the King, vnto whom he haſteneth with ſuch ſpéed as he could. To whoſe preſence being come, the king as ioyful for his good ſucceſſe and his ſiſters grant, as the Lorde <hi>Cariolus</hi> to heare it, with a ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which ſhewed the ioy of his heart, ſaid;</p>
            <p>My Lord, though my ſkill in wooing be but ſmall, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuer accuſtomed my ſelfe to any ſuch practiſe, yet haue I playd the cunning Aduocate for your Lordſhip, and will aſſure you, ſo you holde your word and promiſe, the Princeſſe ſhall be yours, and thereon take my word of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cariolus,</hi> ſo ouer ioyed at theſe tydings, could not well
<pb facs="tcp:26186:77"/>
tell whether he heard the King ſpeake, or dreamed of this happineſſe. But ſtanding a while in an extacie, his ſences being come againe, with eyes gaſtly beholding the King, thus ſaid; My honourable and gracious Lord, what may I doo to requite your Princely fauour, who hath vouchſafed me ſo great honor, not onely to beſtowe your onely ſiſter on me, but to become my honorable ſoliciter, what I would ſay, modeſtie compelleth me to conceale. Only this I aſſure your Maieſtie, my loyall ſeruice ſhall euer be ready at your commaund, in ſuch dutifull maner, that your Maieſty ſhall haue no cauſe to repent you of ſo great a good done vnto a ſtranger. Inough my Lord, fewe words doth ſuffice among friendes, wherefore forbeare theſe ſpéeches, loue my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and for her ſake, thinke of me as a friend, which will be euer ready to do you what pleaſure I can. To giue you ſome intereſt of my faith, appoint the marriage day at your pleaſure, and for her dowry, accept this kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which ſhall remaine to you and your heires for euer, onely this homage ſhall you yearely tender in my Court of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly,</hi> two ſwift running Courſers of this Countrey, and ſo God make you happie in your loue, and a ioyfull father of many children. With this the <hi>Mayden Knight</hi> entered his preſence, vnto the King what man ſo welcome, his dutie done, the King louingly imbracing him, ſaid;</p>
            <p>Sir Knight, I haue not long ſithence comforted your friend with my happie tydings, and not onely aſſured him of a wife, which I hope will prooue louing and kinde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but haue inueſted him with the tytle of King of <hi>Egipt,</hi> of both which, I wiſh him ſo much ioy, as I deſire to haue ioy, his wedding day let him appoynt at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which ſhall with the greateſt honour I can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Moſt gracious and dread Lord quoth the Knight, how this your honourable curteſie haue tyed mee vnto your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, I omit, that at my requeſt hath thus fauoured my deare friend, whoſe good I eſtéeme as mine owne, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

will be readie with my beſt endeuour to ſerue, at all times and places where my force or ſeruice may do either your Maieſtie or my Lord <hi>Cariolus</hi> good. And ſéeing it is wrought to his content and your Graces good lyking, let mée intreate this fauoure of you both, that the wedding may ſodainly be ſolemnized, for that my ſtaie may not be long here, ſuch deſire I haue to ſée my ſoueraigne Lorde, who I am ſure exſpecteth my return long before this time. Sir quoth the King, did you knowe how diſpleaſing thoſe ſpéeches of your departure were to me, that deſire nothing in the whole world ſo much as your company, you would neuer harpe ſo much on that ſtring. But how long ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your ſtaie ſhall be, this day eight dayes I doo appoint for the wedding, ſo my Lorde <hi>Cariolus</hi> be agreed, and ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neuer quoth <hi>Cariolus,</hi> let him be allowed for Clarke, which refuſeth to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to ſuch a parſon, the Orizons bringing ſuch content, ſéeing your Maieſtie referres it to me, <hi>Amen</hi> ſay I, and humbly thanke your Grace for your honourable fauour.</p>
            <p>The wedding day appoynted and aſſigned, the King ſent for the Princeſſe, who that night ſupped all togither, which being ended, the Princeſſe, in preſence of many of the Lordes of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> was betrothed vnto the Lord <hi>Cariolus,</hi> and the marriage day appoynted, againſt which time, were all the nobles ſommoned to be at Court to attend the King, by whoſe commandement all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for honour of that day might be deuiſed, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, the time of night being ſpent, ſommoned their watchfull eyes to ſléepe, wherefore after many ſolemne adues, taken one of the other, they haſtened on all ſides to their reſt, onely <hi>Cariolus</hi> and the Princeſſe beſt content, ſhée ioying in her Loue, and kingly brothers lyking, and he bleſſing a million of times the day wherein he firſt ſaw the Prince, procurer of his ſo great good.

Oppreſſed with great griefe we leaue the Princes for a while, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto <hi>Cariolus.</hi> whoſe wedding day being come great was the ioy on his ſide, but more the preparation of al cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who were ready with many coſtly ſhewes, at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Tilt, Turney, and Barriers, to try their valour and fortunes in Armes. But as the faireſt day is ouercaſt with cloudes, ſo was their mirth chaunged to great and gréeuous lamenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their ioy to ſorrowfull complaints, which thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell.</p>
            <p>The King now in prime of yeares, deſirous to try his force at the Tilt, with his preſence to honour his Nobles and do the Princeſſe fauoure at her marriage in theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:78"/>
made choyce of the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> to encounter him, as the worthieſt in Armes, who being of all others moſt vnwilling to deale againſt him, humbly beſought his grace of pardon, and accept of ſome his Nobles who was more worthier of that honor. But the King with whom no intreaties might preuaile, wold not be denied, which made the Knight with great heauineſſe of heart to wiſh hée had not Armed him that day, ſuch was his diſcontented minde, which doubtleſſe preſaged ſome enſuing euill, as to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great griefe of all the whole company hapned them. Thus when no denials might preuail, the trumpets ſounding a charge, they ſet forward with ſuch ſwiftneſſe, as the earth trembled vnder their horſes, both breaking their ſtaues in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as all the company with ioyful ſhoutes applauded their excellent ſkill in that exerciſe. But alaſſe, in midſt of this pleaſing practiſe, how ſuddainly their ioyes were eclipſed, woe is me to recount. The King and his elected compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the trumpets ſound, ſetting with courage forward to encounter one the other, in braue maner brake again their ſtaues, but in an vnhappie time, a ſplinter of the knights ſtaffe, by moſt vnfortunate chaunce, entered the ſight of the Kings Beauer, which pearced the head to the brain, in ſuch wiſe, that with the heate of his trauaile, and griefe of the wound, he was enforced to forſake his horſe. This ſuddaine miſhap, to the company brought ſuch diſcontent, that all their mirth layd apart, ſorrow was made Lady of the feaſt. But amongſt thoſe that moſt lamented this vnfortunate chaunce, the <hi>Maiden Knight</hi> had his part, whoſe griefe was ſuch, that had not the Lord <hi>Cariolus</hi> bin by fortune preſent, in the extreame of his melancholy paſſion he had ſlain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſuch was the wiſedome of the Noble <hi>Cariolus,</hi> as his reaſonable perſwaſions preuailed ſo with him, as he cauſed him forſake his dolefull Lodge, to accompany him to the preſence of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> king, whoſe maſters of Chirurgery, had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ended their trauaile of dreſſing his woundes, them the Knight queſtioned of the danger therof, and beſought them
<pb facs="tcp:26186:79"/>
in curteſie to acquaint him therewith, whether hée held it mortall or no, which how vnwilling ſo euer they were, as loath to diſcomfort the King or thoſe which loued him, ſuch was the curteous entreatie of the Knight, as he could not conceale the daunger thereof, but reuealed vnto him the little hopes they had of his life, and the reaſons that induced them thereunto, which newes, was little pleaſing vnto the Knight, who with many teares lamented that miſhap, but griefe miniſtreth no phiſicke to the diſeaſed, nor ſorrow auaileth not to mittigate extreames. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Cariolus</hi> comforted, hée ceaſeth in ſo excéeding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to lament, determining to abide the Kings doome, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he purpoſeth to reconcile himſelfe, and to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent awaiteth the waking of his Maieſtie, who was after his dreſſing fallen a ſléepe, whoſe griefe was ſuch, as hée could take ſmall reſt. But rowſing himſelfe, awaked from his ſlumber, called for the Lord <hi>Cariolus,</hi> who was way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the ſame purpoſe, vnto whome being come, hée ſaith;</p>

The omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power of the Almightie, hath laid his croſſe on me for my greater good, to call me from theſe worldes vanities, to ſéeke his euerlaſting kingdome: Yet ere I leaue this fraile life, ſwéete <hi>Cariolus</hi> let me ſée that honourable Knight, by whoſe hands death ſent his ſommance, deare he was vnto mée, and his loue worthie to be imbraced of the mightieſt Monarke.

Moue no rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor be mainteiner of euil, for ſuch faults, how ſecret ſo euer, God will to your ouerthrowes reueale. Remember his word, which hath commanded you to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient without murmuring, and feare him which gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all. I can ſay no more, my ſpéech faileth me, therefore generally my Lords, farewell, and ſo turning his weak bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the wall, ſurrendered his ſoule to the heauens, from whence it had his being, to the intollerable griefe of all his ſubiects, who with many briniſh tears lamented his death, but eſpecially the Knight <hi>Pheander,</hi> and <hi>Cariolus,</hi> whoſe marriage, the louing King honoured, with his funerall, which in the moſt honourableſt maner, Art or honor could deuiſe, was ſolemnized, lamented generally of all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, but eſpecially the Egyptians, who more dearly loued him for his clemency, then their owne naturall King.</p>
            <p>The funerall finiſhed, a Parliament was ſommoned, in which time, the <hi>Mayden Knight</hi> ſo preuailed with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Egipt,</hi> that by common conſent of the whole aſſembly in both houſes, temporall and ſpirituall, the regiment of both kingdomes, was deliuered vnto the Lord <hi>Cariolus,</hi> and the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> reſigned his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for euer vnto him and the Lady, who was lawfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritrix vnto the ſame. The Parliament proroged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the cuſtome of the Country, great preparation was made for the Coronation, which in moſt ſolemne and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable manner was accompliſhed, with ſo many ſundry ſhowes and delightfull pleaſures, as might weary you to reade. Let it ſuffice to the great ioy of both Realmes, all things to ſo honorable an action was ſo exquiſitely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as no man but tooke great delight in beholding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, praying with an vniuerſall voice for their long liues, to be in happineſſe amongſt them continued.</p>
            <p>Thus all things to the ioy of the noble <hi>Pheander</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, and to the high content of the King <hi>Cariolus</hi> and his Quéen, by the aduiſe of the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> an election was made of a Vizeroy to goe for <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> the King making choyce of two euils the leaſt, conceiuing this opinion of the naturall ſubiects of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> that they would liue in their dutifull obeiſance, when a conquered nation gathering hed vppon many light occaſions, was eaſily drawne to reuolt. Theſe conſiderations with great wiſdom weyed, the Lord <hi>Fardinand,</hi> one of the priuy Councell of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> was elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that gouernment, vnto whome, the King after his Commiſſion ſigned, and honorable gifts giuen, ſo wiſely exhorted to obedience, and care of his loue and dutie, that as many of the nobles as were preſent, and noted the ſame, admired him, reioyſing that God had prouided ſo for them, to leaue them in the gouernment of ſo toward a Prince, of whom ſo much enſuing happineſſe was exſpected.</p>
            <p>Order taken for his affaires of waight, the Vizeroy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued for <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and his Nobles departed, each one to their ſeuerall mantions, ſauing ſuch of his priuy Councell which were attendant at Court.

            <p>After leaue taken of the Princeſſe, who with many bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh teares bewailed the ſame, the King with his Pheres accompanied him to the water ſide, where his company ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to attend him, awaited his comming, where after heauy parting on both ſides, and many teares ſpent of the commons which beheld their ſorrowes, he imbarqued him ſelfe, and by the good fauour of the windes, and diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of his Marriners, ſodainly loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When the Admirall ſaw the Knight <hi>Pheander,</hi> whoſe welfare they greatly doubted, betwéene them was much reioycing and many imbracings, as friends ioyfull to ſee one the other. Paſſing in pleaſant parley the time, they came to Ancor, at which time, according to directions giuen by the Knight, all their ordinance was diſcharged, with their ſmal Artillery, reioycing according to the ſea maner, for their ſafe arriuall, to the great admiration of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, which could imagin no certaintie what they were: no ſooner was the Ancors ground, but the Lord Admirall cauſing his Frygot to come aboord, entered the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> and other Nobles of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> which came to accompany him, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from the King, who were all moſt royally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temed of the Nobles, which attended their landing, and were conducted to the Court, where according to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates they were ſumptuouſly lodged in the Court, and like order taken for purueying for their traine.</p>

            <p>My Lord, quoth ſhe, had I not held thy loue in regard, I could not haue denied the many ſutes of my Pheres and Commons, which haue beſought me, and with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe entreated me to marriage, but ſo deare hath thy loue bene vnto me, that I deſired death, rather then falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my faith to your grace, for whom, and through whoſe vnkindneſſe, I haue endured much hearts diſcontent.</p>
            <p>No more of that quoth the Knight, good Madame, expel from your minde paſſed griefes, and thinke vpon the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſures which wil excéed all the diſcontent hath bene: to heare your diſcontent, is litle pleaſing vnto me, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cloſed theſe eyes, nor neuer beheld the riſing of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sun, without millions of times remembring your grace, whoſe preſence I more deſired then I will explaine. <hi>Guenela</hi> ſéeing ſome of the Councell entering the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, gaue them intelligence thereof, breaking off their ſpéech thus.</p>
            <p>Sir, if you haue taken orders in holy Church ſince your departure, it is more then is expected of all the court, which in time paſt haue ſhewed your ſelfe ſo worthily in Armes, to your laſting honor. If you haue, and her grace haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you for her ghoſtly father, enioyne I beſeech, her maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, to ſome eaſie penance, for her long ſicknes is not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure much faſting, beſides, here is of the Councel, who hath waited to ſay ſomthing, either to the Quéene or your grace.</p>

The Knight framing his talke to <hi>Guenela,</hi> who finding him alone, thus ſaid; Sir, experience of mine owne diſcontent, hath taught me, what a corifiue melancholy is, to a pleaſant minde, who in your abſence, haue endured many ſharpe wordes, yea, and oftentimes, thoſe thundering ſpéeches, lighting with blowes either on my ribbes, head, or face, (in reuenge of which,) had you bin preſent for whoſe ſake I endured them, I ſhould haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured the cracking of a ſword with your grace, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue wanted of my will.</p>

            <p>The Quéene gathering ſome ſtrength, was loath to detaine the ſtraunge Nobles longer from her Preſence, wherefore by her Nobles ſhee limitted a time to heare them, againſt which day, was all her nobles ſummoned to be at Court, with her Ladies and women of account to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her Maieſtie, who with the Lorde Stewarde of her houſhold, had taken ſuch order for all diuerſitie of vyandes that might be prouided. The day appointed come, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exſpected of the ſtraungers, who prouided themſelues as ſumptuous as they could, apparrelled after their countrey maner, attended the time of her Maieſties comming forth, who being come, and in her Chaire of Eſtate ſet, word was brought vnto the ſtraungers, who marching with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Thrace</hi> through the Court, was in moſt honourable maner preſented vnto her Maieſtie, who with countenance <hi>debonaire,</hi> and grace magiſticall, as became her royaltie, bad them all welcome, in ſuch curteous and Princely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the ſtraungers at this firſt fight were driuen to great admiration, beholding that grace and honor in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which they would neuer haue beléeued, had not their eyes bene witneſſes. The Quéen hauing giuen them theſe hononorable welcomes, each man taking his place, <hi>Orma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the chéefeſt in Commiſſion from their King, thus ſaid;</p>
            <p>Magnificent Prince, our King, your highneſſe late ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, acknowledging his humble dutie to your Exellence, hath ſent vs his liegemen and ſworne ſeruants, to ſignifie the ſame, who in faithfull loue voweth, neuer to be alliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in minde from that dutie, which becommeth each natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſubiect to owe his Prince and country.

Letters ſhal import, which humbly kiſſing, on their knées they deliuered into her Princely handes, who returned many thanks to their King for his loue, with lyke to them, which had vouchſafed that trauaile; to ſée her Court and Preſence, beſéeching them to take in worth a maydens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, in doing which, ſhée ſhould thinke her ſelfe much beholding vnto them.</p>
            <p>With pleaſant parley, and diſcourſing of ſundry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and queſtions by the Quéene propounded, touching their Countries, they paſſed the time vntill dinner, not without great admiration of the ſtraungers, which beheld her ſtately grace, her ſumptuous attire, the dutie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done by her nobles and Ladies, which with their coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparrell and rare exellence in bewtie, greatly deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. The time of dinner drawing neare, the tables couered, and all things prepared for the ſame, the Quéene taking her place, the Embaſſadors were likewiſe placed at another table in her preſence. The maner of her ſeruice, with the diuerſitie of vyands of all ſorts, was ſuch, as they could hardly beléeue, ſo many ſundry kindes of ſowle, fiſh, and other, chéere for them prepared, were to be found in the limits of the earth. Thus with wonderfull delight, chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtill by her highneſſe, they paſſed the time vntil the end of dinner, neuer forgetting the maieſtie of her grace, which ſo honorably bare her, as no Prince could in her time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with her. Dinner ended, the Quéene curteouſly bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe ſtrangers welcome, ſhée was conducted by her Nobles into a Gallery, which for bewtifull ſhowes with rare pictures, and deuiſes of rich price, was ſo adorned, as the ſtrangers had neuer ſéene the lyke. Not long had they paſſed the time in noting thoſe glorious deuiſes, but the Courtiers, who had prouided themſelues to doo her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe honor, and cauſe her delight, which had ſo long time withdrawne her ſelf from all pleaſures, armed in al parts, with each man his ſeueral deuiſe, they entered the yard, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of cuſtome for the Tilt, where a window opening
<pb facs="tcp:26186:87"/>
from the gallery, the Quéene with the ſtrangers were ſet to behold thoſe paſtimes. The whole company come, each one for honor of hir grace, deliuered his Scuchion of deuiſe, vnto her Princely hands. Where Gentiles ſuppoſe you, that know Ladies praiſes, or diſpraiſes, what happened. Where to beguile the time, was each deuiſe by the Quéen and her Ladies, ſurueyed with ſuch vigilant eyes, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was vnremembred, euery one giuing their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to that affection they beare the preſenter. While they were thus deſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nting, and the Marſhall with the Iudges, appointing each man in his degrée to try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, behold, a prettie Page, mounted on a light running Courſer, with his guide before him, winding his horne in poaſting manner, comming neare the place where y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> quéene was, lighted from his horſe, and being not of heigth anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to deliuer his Letters with his hand, putting them on his wande, (after his dutie done) humbly kiſſing them, he deliuered them vnto her maieſties hand, which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> quéene peruſing, queſtioned the Page if he had ought elſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? Who anſwered, Moſt famous Prince, my Lord and maiſter, hearing of this aſſembly which fame hath bruted, to the honor of this royall company, and high commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe nobles, hath ſent, as not daring to approach the place without their lawfull fauour obteined, who for honor of his miſtreſſe, which he affirmeth, and will maintaine, to be the moſt exquiſit Lady for all perfections in the confines of the earth, he offereth at the Tilt, with each gain-ſayer, to breake ſixe ſtaues. If there be any ſuch that will accept his challenge in mainteining his miſtreſſe honour, let mée know him, who ſhall ſoone be anſwered. The Page being vnknowne, the nobles wondred what he might be, which without exception had made this chalenge, imagining that he was ſome man of valour, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it were diſcurteſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man at armes whatſoeuer. Theron generally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they returned him by the Page, this anſwere.</p>
            <p>Page, though thy maſters peremptory chalenge, deſerue
<pb facs="tcp:26186:88"/>
rather to be maligned, then accepted, yet ſuch is the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Thrace,</hi> as honouring Armes, and all profeſſors ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, accept the ſame, and where we had appointed euery one his companion, we are content to remit that election, and to bind all our force to his diſhonor, and ſo to him vnknowne, commend vs, whom we intreat to Arme ſodeinly, and ſpéed him hither. The Page receiuing his anſwer of the nobles, the Quéene calling him which mounted was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ſaid;</p>
            <p>Sir Boy, to thy vnknowne Knight commend vs, whom we thanke, for vouchſauing vs that honor his Letters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which our nobilitie haue without any ſute of mine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, of whom he ſhal finde men endowed with courage. The Page departed, ſundry were the imaginations what the Knight might be, who had offered them this proud cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendge, in midſt whereof, a trumpet ſounding, they expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the challenger, who entered armed in all partes, with blacke armour, which was garniſht with many wounded harts, on the breſt, a Lady with a cloth of fine lawne whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them, ouerſpreading as many as ſhe could reach with a ſcarfe, carnation coloured, his word (in <hi>Greeke</hi>) diſpaire not,) pacing on with eaſie paces, according to the vſe of the place, comming neare that ende of the Tilt which was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite with the Quéenes window, vayling his head to her Maieſtie, ſhée graciouſly hadde him welcome, ſhaking her hand. Long had he not ſtaid, but the Lord Marſhall in lyke maner, with ſhow of great curteſie bad him welcome, and deſired him to prepare himſelfe, for the defendants atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. My Lord, quoth the Knight, at their good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, when they ſhal put themſelues forward at the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſound, I wil méete them. Thus warning giuen them, without longer ſtay, the Lord <hi>Vrelia,</hi> his copartner in <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly,</hi> ſet forward, whom the <hi>Mayden Knight</hi> met with ſuch force, as his féete were too big for his ſtirropes, and he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue taken a more diſgrace being vnhorſed. This firſt encounter was noted of all the nobles, who commended his
<pb facs="tcp:26186:88"/>
ſtrength regarded him nothing, but with ſuch valour met him, that he made him to his great diſgrace, forſake the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, at which a generall ſhowt to the Knights great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations was giuen. The Lord <hi>Vrelia</hi> hauing had his part, another came in place, who went not away without ſome diſgrace, ſo generally behaued he himſelfe, and with ſuch honour and valour bare him, that the Iudges, fathers of Armes, gaue the honor of the day to him, whom they all, though a ſtranger, highly commended. The Knight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before the Quéen, humbly doing his dutie, was with his Trumpet ſounding ready to depart, whom the nobles would not ſuffer, without his knowledge, beſéeching him, not ſo much to diſhonor them, of whome he had deſerued honor, in ſuch maner to leaue them. The <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> who would as willingly haue reuealed himſelfe, as they deſired, though he made ſhow of ſome diſcontent, yet wold not deny their requeſt, but calling for his Armourer, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Beauer, who béeing knowne to be the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> they were all the more honored, taking no diſgrace to be foyled of him, by whoſe hands ſo many had loſt their liues, which were honorable and expert in Armes. Being diſcouered, he preſented himſelfe to her maieſtie, who not a litle ioyfull of her ſeruants good fortune, whom the graced in this maner. Seruant quoth ſhe, thanks for your paines, and honoring vs at this time, for which I enſure you, I thinke my ſelfe much beholding, it had bene pittie, truant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like you ſhuld haue left theſe honorable Lords your frends without hauing acknowledged your ſelfe vnto vs &amp; them, who you ſhall ſée, will be carefull to procure a Surgion, who doubtleſſe ſhall cure thoſe bleeding hearts, if any ſuch there be ofſkill in <hi>Thrace.</hi> Honored Lady, quoth the knight, the well ſpring of curteſie &amp; nobilitie, moſt humble thanks I yéeld your maieſtie, for this grace, without whoſe fauour and grace, to whom in dutie I am ſo bounden, I deſire not life. This ſaid, the Quéene and the ſtraunge nobles depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſupper being readie and they ſet, their table talke was
<pb facs="tcp:26186:89"/>
of the braue behauiour of the Knight, who had all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor attributed to him, that was to be required, wherin the ſtrangers were ioyed, louing him dearly, and to encreaſe the fame which generally was giuen him, they in preſence of the whole aſſembly, declared the honors her maieſties Champion had gained in <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Egipt,</hi> with the death of their King, who of a wound by his hand at the Tilt, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: leauing nothing vnſpoken which might any way ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him, whereof the Quéene ioyed not a litle, though ſhée concealed the ſame.</p>
            <p>Supper ended, and ſome part of the night ſpent in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, maſking, and other Courtlike paſtimes, the Quéene commending the nobles to their reſtes, bad the company good night, who entering her lodging, it might haue ioyed the heart of any Lady in loue, to heare the generall laude of the Ladies, giuen to the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> of whom no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talke was to be heard, each honourable part in him commended to his deſert, and of his valour in Armes, no praiſe was ſufficient: wherewith the Quéene was not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſed, nor <hi>Guenela</hi> diſcontent, to heare the onely Prize of honour giuen her Lord, by whome ſhée had hope for her paſſed ſeruice, to bee preferred. Thus ioying on all parts, wée leaue the Quéene with her company to their reſts, and returne to the Nobles ſtraungers, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations and honorable reports of the Knight was ſuch, that nothing could be more pleaſing vnto them, applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the wiſedome and noble demeanour of the Quéene, whoſe lyke in her time, was not as they ſuppoſed to bee found: with ſuch ſundry diſcourſes, paſſed theſe Nobles the night, to which wée leaue them for a time. Theſe Princely paſtimes ouerpaſt, the care of the Quéene was for diſpatch of the Nobles of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> whom ſhe was loth to detaine from that deſire they had to ſée their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Wherefore, after ſome two or thrée dayes ſpent in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of their countries, and ſtate of their realmes, with the commodities therof, eftſoones enterlacing their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:89"/>
with ſome pleaſant parley, wherein the Nobles were much delighted, the Quéene tooke order with her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell for their anſwere, limitting a time therefore, to the good content of the ſtrangers. Againſt which prefixed time, the Quéene hauing care of her honorable word, had their Letters all written and ſigned, when omitting them to a banquet, ſhée in ſuch honourable manner deliuered their anſwere, with ſuch words of loue, and deſire of good to their King, as ouercome with ioyes thereof, the ſtrangers were not able long time to anſwere, preſenting their King and Quéene with gifts of high eſtéeme, and highly rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their honourable pains, which they gratefully accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, taking order for Gallies with victualls, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to be purueyed with ſpéed and beuntie.</p>
            <p>This honourable entertainment of the Quéene to thoſe ſtraungers, being in the prime of her gouernment, gained her ſuch honour through their reportes, that thoſe which heard the ſame, admired her, whom they imagined was péerleſſe, for wiſedome, bountie, and curteſie, not omitting the fauour and loue of the Nobilitie, of whoſe worthineſſe, they could neuer ſpeake ſufficient.</p>
            <p>As time finiſheth the greateſt affaires, ſo the carefull trauaile of thoſe to whome the prouiſion of the Fléet was commended, was ſuch, that there was no wants in ſhort time left vnfurniſhed, that lacking nothing but a faire winde, which hée that commaundeth winde and ſeas, ſent in ſuch happie time, as they could with, which not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to looſe, they commend the health and happie gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Quéene, to him that ruleth all. And ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> who was loath to leaue them, and many other Phéeres of the lande, they were conducted each one to his ſeuerall Gally, where being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued, their Sayles cut, and they affore the winde, they gaue their farewell, with ſuch a braue ringing peale of great Cannons, and then likewiſe their ſmall Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, as wonderfully reioyced the beholders, which by the
<pb facs="tcp:26186:90"/>
Gunners from the Quéenes Forts a ſhore, was as worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered. Thus parted theſe nobles, who in ſhort time arriued in ſafetie in <hi>Egipt,</hi> with their King, vnto whome, hauing deliuered the Princes Preſents with their letters, they omitted no reports of their honorable entertainment of the Quéene and her nobles, in ſuch maner, that where they or any of their traine long time after became, their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble talke, was onely of their honorable welcoms in <hi>Thrace,</hi> euer applauding the magnificent grace, wiſedome &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Quéene, whome they gaue the Prize vnto, of all that liued in her time, leauing nothing vnremembred, which might any way impaire the honourable reputation of her nobles, which vſed them with al the curteſie &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie becomming their eſtates: but eſpecially the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> the diſcourſe of whoſe valour and maner of behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, bred more delight then the reſt, for that the nobles and commons had knowledge of his valour and worthineſſe. Theſe honorable commendations of the nobles, ioyed the King, who in his ſecret thoughts applauded her highneſſe fauour and curteſie, that for his ſake and honour, had vſed thoſe his ſubiects in all Princely manner. But amongſt thoſe which tooke pleaſure in hearing thoſe diſcourſes of the nobles, the Quéene enflamed with their reports, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with deſire to ſée this péerleſſe Princeſſe, as the ſecond part of this hiſtorie ſhall ſhew you. Till when, leauing the King with his Phéers to their ſolace, return we to <hi>Thrace,</hi> Where the Knight imboldned by the fauour of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lady, was not ſo great a ſtranger with her highneſſe, but that he might at pleaſure repaire to her preſence, with whom by his earneſt ſute, and deſire to be poſſeſſed of her whom he ſo much loued and honoured, he egged her on ſtill to marry, which for ſhe would not do, without a generall conſent of her nobles and ſtates of the realme, ſhe cauſed a Parliament tobe ſommoned, at which time, finding her fit opportunitie, ſhe imparted her determinations in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26186:90"/>Honourable Lordes, and you our louing Commons here aſſembled, let not thoſe fewe words I haue to ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, bréede any diſcontent, that will deliuer nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable to my ſtate, and your diſparagement: to withhold you from the ſame long, were more niceneſſe then wiſdom, wherefore briefly thus.</p>
            <p>Sithence I was by permiſſion of him that exalteth and pulleth downe Princeſſe, at his will, I am by your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable &amp; generall conſents, Crowned Quéen of this realme, to whoſe gouernment you haue as lawfully deſcended from him whom you al loued and feared, committed your ſelues, ſithence which, you haue all with ſhows of honorable loue, and care of our ſtate and realmes, by ſundry examples per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to marriage, which you ſay, may bréede your happineſſe, whoſe good, he that ſearcheth my harts ſecrets, knoweth that I more preferre then my life, on whoſe ſutes ſo often made, I haue aduiſedly conſidered, and noting the many perils incident to our ſexe, which rather require to be gouerned, then to gouerne, the name of King being fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, honored and loued, through feare, when they hold our ſexe in contempt. All which conſidered, with your former ſutes, if I grant to your requeſt, I doubt not, but I ſhall find that fauour, which the pooreſt of my ſubiects haue, frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to chooſe, where their loues and likings leadeth them, which if you grant, I ſhall hold my loue well beſtowed on you, and ſhall haue cauſe to thinke your requeſt in times paſt hath bene honorable, and not to tye me to any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, aſſuring you, that whateuer he be that I ſhall bend my liking vnto, ſhall not diſparage my eſtate, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor you, but be worthie for wiſedome, valour, and what elſe is required in honorable perſons, to mate the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of moſt renowne on the earth. You haue heard what I haue to ſay, and wherefore chiefly this Parliament was ſommoned, of which I craue your anſweres.</p>
            <p>The Nobles and Lords, both ſpirituall and temporall, with the Commons of both houſes, hearing the Quéenes
<pb facs="tcp:26186:91"/>
motion, were all mute, not knowing ſodeinly in a matter of ſuch waight, what to anſwere. But remooued from their dumps, the Speaker being both wiſe and well demeaned, as befitted his place, humbly proſtrating himſelfe, thus ſaid;</p>
            <p>Moſt gracious Princeſie, albeit your Maieſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to this honourable Houſe, is no more then wée haue earneſtly ſought, yet pardon our ſodaine anſwere, and giue vs reſpite of time vntill to morrow, the remaine of this day, ſo it ſtande with your Princely fauoure, ſhall be ſpent to heare the cenſure of all eſtates in theſe Preſence, whoſe loue and dutie is ſuch, as they will deny nothing, wherein your royall and honourable eſtate is not diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but in all thinges, will with all humbleneſſe ſubiect themſelues to your highneſſe pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Quéene loath to require ſuch haſte in anſwering her queſtion, graciouſly commanded him to riſe, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting moſt willingly to his demaunds, for which the whole aſſembly with a vniall voyce, gaue her Grace moſt humble thankes.</p>
            <p>The Quéene hauing deliuered the ſumme of her deſire, graciouſly commending them to his will that frameth all things, accompanied with many of Phéeres, departeth.</p>
            <p>The Quéene departed, all matters in queſtions laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, the Phéeres and moſt chéefeſt of both Houſes, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues in Councell, where you muſt ſuppoſe, no matter for benefit of the ſtate, was omitted. The requeſt made by their Quéene, with great aduice conſidered, which amongſt them was admired, where many imaginations aſſailed them, deuiſing of each ſide, what he ſhould be that is in ſo highe eſtéeme and fauour with her Grace, and of ſuche worthie reputation as ſhée hath reported him, eftſoones naming one, then ſome other, yet the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall obiect of her loue neuer remembred, which draue them all to an <hi>non plus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what euer hée were, time of their owne deſire to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:91"/>
craued ſome diſpatch of what they had in queſtion. Wherefore leauing friuolous queſtions, they procéede to their begunne action, gladly would they haue bene certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of their elected King, but in vaine it was for them to require it. Wherefore conſidering their owne deſires, they thought it would be taken in euill part of her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to gainſay what with ſuch humble and earneſt ſutes they had required, aſſuring themſelues of her wiſedome, gouernment, and care of their goods, which was ſo wiſe, and euery way ſo honourably demeaned, which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, thereuppon relying, it was generally determined, to referre all to her owne will, pleaſure, and good lyking. On which reſolued, the chéefeſt of the Nobilitie, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with diuerſe of the Cleargy, in hope of the Quéens good acceptance, ſpéedeth them to the Court, who ſodeinly was aduertiſed of their being, with their requeſt, which was, to haue acceſſe to her highneſſe. No ſooner was her highneſſe therof certified, but leauing her Chamber where ſhe was buſily imployed about thoſe buſineſſes which ſhée had in hand, deuiſing of the anſwere of the Commons, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all, ſhée ſpéedeth her vnto them, where taking her place, their duties in all humbleneſſe done, and ſhée with all honourable curteſie requited it, the Speaker in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the whole aſſembly, thus ſaid;</p>
            <p>Dread Soueraign, the Lords both ſpirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, with commons in this honourable Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, weying with care and wiſdom, the honor of your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and carefully tendering the weale publike, haue with great care of both, (the premiſes) conſidered, with your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties requeſt, albeit, they haue no knowledge of his hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſon, vnto whom your royall liking is vnited, yet relying on your Princely wiſedome, and care of your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, by whoſe welfare their happineſſe is to be maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with one vniall conſent, they willingly ſubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto your highneſſe will and pleaſure, aſſuring your
<pb facs="tcp:26186:92"/>
grace, that whom you ſhall vouchſafe to endue with tytle of Lord and huſband, they will accept for their ſoueraigne, and will in all humbleneſſe, acknowledge with louing hearts their duties vnto him, as to their lawfull King, by your maieſties election. Thus my gracious Lady, haue they willed me to ſay, in behalfe of them all, and moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſéech your highneſſe, to make knowne vnto them the name ſo honored, which you haue vouchſafed to like, to the end they neglect not that dutie which is due vnto him by your good grace.</p>
            <p>The Quéene hearing this anſwere of her Commons, was more ioyed, and in heart contented, then euer ſhe was ſince the death of her father, her louing countenance ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the content of her heart, ſo long diſcontent, which made her, with moſt louely grace and curteſie, to ſay;</p>
            <p>My Lords all, and you of the Communaltie, you haue in yéelding to theſe honorable motions by me made, highly contented her, whoſe deſire in loue, made me not ſo head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong to conſent without your generall lyking, my choiſe being ſuch, as may be mated with the onelieſt Lady of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſtéeme in the worlde, as I doubt not your ſelues will confeſſe, when he ſhalbe knowne vnto you, my high eſtéeme of him laid apart, for that you may ſay, affection is blinde. And as the Prouerb ſaith, The <hi>Negro</hi> by nature, black and loathſome in our eyes, eſtéemes her Infant faire, ſo Loue, which commandeth all creatures, cauſed many Princes and Ladies of worth, to ſubmit themſelues to baſe eſtates, Imperious loue ſo ouer maſtering their hearts, to aſſure you that my lyking is not ſuch, and to ſatiſfie you, which with your curteous conſent hath contented me, know your ſo elected ſouaraigne, and he that I haue ſubiected my loue vnto, is of no leſſe worth then a Prince, royally borne, and deſcended from the loynes of a King famous, and a Quéene endowed with much honor, himſelfe ſhewing his royall deſent by his demeanour, which is valiant, wiſe, and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſuch a one, I know your deſires is to chuſe for your

Where breaking off your ſpéech, with other words of curteſie, yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them great thankes, ſhe called <hi>Guenela,</hi> whome ſhée commanded, to ſend ſome truſtie meſſenger for the Prince, willing him, all buſineſſe ſet apart, to repaire vnto her, which done, framing pleaſant diſcourſes which delighted the nobles, ſhe ſought to their contents, to beguile the time vntill the meſſenger returned, which made ſuch haſte, that he found the Knight, vnto whom he imparted the Quéens pleaſure, which albeit, the ſodeineſſe thereof, was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto him, cloying his head, deuiſing of ſundry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which her haſtie ſending for him ſhould import, yet neglecting no time, he ſpéedeth him to the Preſence, where to the Quéene he was the welcommeſt man liuing, as her countenance declared; who calling him vnto her, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a chair to be brought, and ſeating him on her left hand, to the admiration of all the beholders, which done ſhe ſaid;</p>
            <p>My Lords, and you our louing ſubiects, muſe not at this vnwoonted fauour vſed to this Gentleman, nor repine not, for that it is your owne choyſe. This is my choyſe, and hée that I haue ſworne my loue and loyall affection vnto, who albeit hath thus long ſubiected himſelfe to our ſeruice, doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs many high fauours, as your owne eyes can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, enduced vnto it by that high commander of men, who hath procured many Princes to the lyke: for our loue, as I am aſſured, he abandoned his Kingly ſeate, diſguiſed in the baſe attire of a Merchant, came to our Court, where what honors he hath gained by his valour and curteſie, not one of you but know <hi>Numedia,</hi> being his natiue ſoyle, and the kingdome his by lawfull deſent from the King his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let it not diſmay you my friends, nor iudge my words ſpoken of him for his honor, to be more then truth, ſo ſhall you wrong him whoſe woorth you may be by my reports aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured off, and iniury her which had neuer intent, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue well of you all. Therefore as you haue your deſire
<pb facs="tcp:26186:93"/>
knowing him, in token of your loue and generall conſents, by whom hée is your adopted King, ſhewe by your ſignes of content, howe pleaſing my choyce and lyking is vnto you.</p>
            <p>The Nobles amazed at the Quéenes ſpéech, although they could hardly be enduced to beléeue what ſhée had ſayd, yet ſuch was the loue they honored her with, that giuing credit vnto her words, without longer pauſe of the matter, that the Quéene might the rather be wonne to credit their former ſpéech, with a vniuerſall voyce, proſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before him, they cryed, God ſaue the King &amp; Quéene, vowing vnto him loyaltie and failtie, as vnto their King and ſoueraigne.</p>
            <p>Thanks good my Lords, quoth the Prince, for your good conſents, and doubt not of my loue to you, which with ſuch heartie affection ſhall be ſhewed, that my deareſt bloud ſhal be ſhead, ere the leaſt haire of the baſeſt of your heads ſhall periſh. Which ſaid, the Quéene ſtanding vp, requeſted the Nobles, that as they had with conſent elected him their King, ſo they would appoynt the time for ſolemnizing the marriage with the Coronation, chaunging his name from <hi>Pheander</hi> the <hi>Mayden Knight,</hi> to <hi>Dionicus,</hi> the lawful heire of the <hi>Numedian</hi> Crowne, for that was his right, and the name of <hi>Pheander,</hi> but vſurped.</p>
            <p>Which requeſt of her Maieſtie, they eaſily granted, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting the marriage thrée dayes following, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation preſently to follow, which to their great ioyes was accompliſhed, with all the honour might be done by their ſubiects, the coſtly ſhowes, and all maner of delightfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes there vſed, I omit, albeit it was pleaſing both to their King and Quéene, and brought great ioy and comfort to all beholders. The marriage with the Coronation paſt, the Commons delighted with their King, aſſured his grace, to be ſo honorable as the Quéene had reported him, and they found, who in that Parlament to honor the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> the more, and let them know, his loue was no whit
<pb facs="tcp:26186:93"/>
inferiour to theirs, he entailed the Crowne of <hi>Numedia,</hi> to the lawfull heire of <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſuccéeding, aſſuring them, that his Nobles and Commons, ſhould confirme and aſſure the ſame.</p>
            <p>Which curteous fauour, the Nobles ſo gratefully accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they returned him for the ſame, many gracious thanks, the Parliament proroged, according to cuſtome of the Country, their dutie in all humbleneſſe done, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, with the chéefeſt of all parts in the land, wiſhed the Quéene and King many happy dayes, to their ioy and harts content: which they requited with ſuch ſhewes of loue as might delight them, and giue them cauſe to ioy in their Princes election, of whom their comfort was great, &amp; their aſſurance of tranquillitie with forraine Princes, through his magnanimitie, to be ſuch, as al true ſubiects might haue pleaſure to recount. Their leaue taken, euery one departs well content, to his home.</p>
            <p>Thus the King and Quéene, enioying hearts content, their loues more and more encreaſed, that there was no talks but of their faithfull loue and hearts lyking, through which, the Commons liued in peace, praying for their long liues to be continued. To which content in loue, the ſtory leaueth them, recounting the arriuall of the aged <hi>Barnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> who with his long trauaile came vnto the Court, where wandering Pilgrimelike, liuing by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of bountifull people, he ſpent ſome time in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, others in viewing the bewtie of the Court, and maners of the people, eftſoones commending their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſeruing their creature, taking much pleaſure in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with ſuch Pilgrime ſtrangers as he méete, of the diuerſe conditions of thoſe Nations, whoſe Countries hée had ſéene, which being many, he affected no Princes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as this Country of <hi>Thrace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26186:94"/>The aged father ouer worne with griefe and long trauell, was ſo much altered in his face, as he that had wel known him, might very well haue miſtaken his feature, which made the King, who oftentimes had noted his comely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his Pilgrimes attire and other ornaments, to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous belonging, greatly to affect him, litle ſuſpecting it was the aged <hi>Barnardine.</hi> But as time reuealeth greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and bringeth friends to knowledge, ſo the King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pleaſure, beholding this Pilgrime, noted him ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that his phiſiognemy to his memory, preſented the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his beloued <hi>Barnardine,</hi> which imagined thought, began to take ſuch roote in the King, as he greatly deſired to haue ſome conference with the Pilgrime, euermore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading himſelfe that it was his noble Tutor, and carefull Phiſition. To aſſure him of that doubt, he determined to haue knowledge of the aged man if he might, and for that intent, cauſed his Pages to giue diligent héed, if they ſawe him in the Court, to bring him tydings thereof, which they did according to his Maieſties commandement, attending with ſuch care, at that vſuall time he was accuſtomed to come, that he paſſed not of them vnperceiued, whereof they gaue the King intelligence, by whoſe commaund, hée was ſommoned to his Preſence.</p>
            <p>The aged Pilgrime at this firſt ſomance of the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, was in ſuch dread of wrong to be offered him, as hée greatly feared ſome ill to betide him, knowing that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue many eyes, and ſtrangers are markes, how poore ſo euer their eſtates are, ſpecially frequenting the Court as he did, yet he whoſe conſcience could not accuſe him of any euill intent againſt the King, had this hope, that God whom he ſerued, doth protect the innocent, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him. Thus caſting his care on him that commandeth Kings, not without many imaginations what ſhould be the cauſe he came vnto the Kings Preſence, vnto whom, as one that knew his good, he proſtrated himſelfe, praying hartily for the Kings proſperitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26186:94"/>The King which ſaw the old man bowing before him, kindly tooke him from the ground, tendring his age, which he honored, whom the more he noted, the more the louely face of his beloued <hi>Barnardine,</hi> preſents it vnto his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the thought of whom, cauſed his heart to much ſorrow, yet ſhaking off griefe, of father, kingdome, and friend, he ſayd; Aged father, in whoſe face appeareth grauitie, tel me, of that dutifull loue thou oweſt thy moſt beloued friend, of what Countrey thou art? and what fortunes hath brought thée to this region? that honoring thée, whoſe age requireth the ſame, I may further thy ſutes if thou haue any, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wealth, I may leléeue thée.

            <p>Renowmed Prince, the mirror of honor, of whoſe fame the world is filled, to ſatiſfie your Exellence, know, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of importance thereunto mouing me, I forſooke my natiue Countrey, in ſearch of thoſe whom my fortune was neuer yet to méete, yet haue I trauelled many kingdomes, and in my trauell, haue ſéene many Princes Courts, and noted their ſeuerall demeanors, yet moſte gracious ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, neuer tooke I pleaſure in any, as in this Countrey of <hi>Thrace,</hi> the nobles eſpecially giuing me cauſe to admire them whoſe minds ſhew their true Gentilitie, as the frute maketh the tree knowne, in which taking delight, I haue, though more then beſeemeth a ſtranger, ſo often frequented thy Court, wherewith, if your grace take any offence, I humbly beſéech your pardon, which am now readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
            <p>The King, which had heard that tongue ſo often reade him many Lectures, and giuen him inſtructions of honor, was not deceiued him, though albeit he forbear to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him, whom he deſired ſo hartily to ſée, vnto whom he was more welcom then any man liuing, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing himſelfe, he ſaid;</p>
            <p>Father, thanks for thy loue, and honorable report of our realme and people, for which I reſt thy debter. But ſay me,
<pb facs="tcp:26186:95"/>
aged man, of what Countrey art thou? and what account were thoſe friends with thée, whom thou with ſuch trauell haſt ſought? whether thyallies, or thy friends by adoption. At this motion of the King, the old man ouercome with the thoughts of thoſe of whom his pittifull tale was to be told, could not forbeare teares, which with ſuch aboundance of ſobbes and heauy ſighes were vttered, that it moued the King to great ruth, ſéeing thoſe ſiluer haires which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, bedeawed with ſault droppes, the witneſſe of his his diſcontent. Wherefore like the carefull Phiſitian, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing miniſtred bitter Pilles to his Pacient, ſeaſoneth the ſame with ſome ſwéeter taſt, he comforteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aged <hi>Barnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> with words ſo pleaſing, that it cheared the old man, yet would not pardon his report, which cauſed him ſay;</p>
            <p>Famous King, if pittie of my age may any way mooue you, vrge not my faltering tongue to vtter a tale of ſuche ruth as it importeth, the remembrance whereof, ouercloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me with ſorrow, and will bring your Exellence ſmall delight. Therefore ſoueraigne Prince, pardon me, which cannot reueale the truth of ſo pittifull a tale, (as yet) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hazard of my life, my heart ſo ouercharged with griefe, that to thinke thereon, halleth me neare to death, then pardon me. But how loath ſo euer, the King might not be entreated, whom with ſuch pleaſing ſpéech he hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on, that comforted by his maieſties kind words whom he would not gainſay, he ſayd, ſithence nothing may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your Exellence to pittie mée, accept in woorth my rudeneſſe, and pardon it. Which ſayd, humbly doing his dutie, as one that could his good, he thus procéeded.</p>
            <p>Dread Lord, know <hi>Numedia</hi> is my natiue ſoyle, where through the grace of my thriſe noble Prince, I conſumed my youth in that happineſſe, fauoured by his fauour, with the beſt of account in that Region, &amp; ſo graced by the King, that he committed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gouernment of his deare ſonne, more deare to him then his life, to be trained vp by me, of whom, as dutie willed me, I had that care as is required of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

Here teares reſtrained his ſpéech, that he could not vtter a word, ſtanding ſo aſtonied, that he rather repreſented the Image of death, then a liuing creature, whom the King put from his heauy paſſion thus.</p>
            <p>Father, thou haſt filled my heart with a worlde of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at thy ſtrange talke, which I coniure thée, of that loue thou oweſt the Prince whom thou ſorroweſt ſo to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not to leaue in ſuch abrupt maner, but procéed, dyed the King, and the Prince ſo of thée honored, and through their deaths gan thy trauaile. Say ſwéete father?</p>
            <p>Though the reporting of this dolefull hiſtory, more grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto me then death, ſhould finiſh my dayes, yet ſuch is the penance by your maieſties coniuring ſpéech enioyned me, that what griefe ſo euer I endure, I will ſatiſfie your grace.</p>
            <p>The Prince, oh my Lord, that it would pleaſe you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the reſt, growing to yeares of diſcretion, I know not through what meanes, neither could I for all the diligence I vſed, attain vnto it, but ſicke he was, and ſo oppreſt with ſuch a ſtraunge agony, that no phiſicke could miniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léefe vnto him, or yéeld him any eaſe, ſo that there was ſmal hope of his recouery, the ſtrangeneſſe of each maledy being ſuch, as ſometime faring lyke a man frantike, no perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reaſon night preuaile with him, who in his health was to be ruled in all things. This paſſion ſo long aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prince, and ſo little hope of his recouerie, that
<pb facs="tcp:26186:96"/>
the extremitie thereof, gan touch the King and Quéen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe carefull loue was ſuch, as nature could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more in parence whatſoeuer. The continuall griefe of the prince, wrought ſuch care in the aged King &amp; Quéen, that it was not to be founde which of them was moſt grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or whoſe lot it was to giue his due to death, firſt, yet as no care is ſo great but hath ſome comfort, ſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of men, when all hope of life, was paſt hope of men, reſtored the Prince to health, and by his health, recouered the King and Quéen, for whoſe weale, the Commons more reioyced, then of their owne good, ſo that a general ioy was throughout the realme, tryumphing at this happy recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Prince, the King, and Quéene. But as the faireſt day is ouerſhadowed with cloudes, ſo was the ſunſhine of their ioy eclipſed, through the great folly of the Prince, who vnknowne of all men, or acquainting any with his pretence, left his father, Crowne, and ſubiects, and liueth no man knoweth how, or where, for whom the King felt a million of woes: griefe ſo aſſailing his aged corpes, as he was like to reſt with death, but reaſon ſubduing affection, he recouered his ſickneſſe, and leauing his land without a gouernour, likewiſe departed, whither no man knoweth. The mother Quéene being of nature weake, reſigned her due to death, whom as dutie commands me, I entombed with ſuch honor as beſéemeth the perſon of a Quéene, and ſo perſwaded with the Commons in a Parliament for the ſame intent called, as the gouernment of the Realme was committed to ſix of the nobilitie, who are bound to reſigne their authoritie when the lawful ſuccéeded ſhall require it, which done, I forſooke all I enioyed, and Pilgrime like as your highneſſe ſées, haue trauelled many Countries in ſearch of my ſoueraign the Prince, but for all the diligence I can vſe, of them can learne no tydings. Thus with teares ſtanding in his eyes, he ended his lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table hiſtory, which the King was aſſured to be true, but leaſt was the thought of <hi>Barnardine,</hi> that he had deliuered this dolefull tale to the

Prince, which had likewiſe ſome cauſe of griefe, which ſo neare touched him, as he could not for teares vtter what he would, yet putting by his paſſions as he could he ſaid:</p>
            <p>Aged father, matter of great ruth haſt thou deliuered, which to heare is moſt lamentable, and may touche that careleſſe Prince neare, by whom this chance hath chanced, his parence and ſubiects: but tell me father, all griefe layd apart, in what ſtate liueth the ſubiects of thy King, vnder their gouernment which hath the charge, yet is your grace not ſatiſfied quoth the Pilgrime, but will exact on mee more to encreaſe my griefe, which ſéeing you delight in, I ſhall vnfolde that which in recounting, will finiſh all, yéelding my breath to him that gaue it mee, therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
            <p>Not long ſithence, vnknowne, I chanced to accompany in my trauaile, a Gentleman of <hi>Numedia,</hi> to mée well knowne, which for I ſawe I was out of knowledge with him, I queſtioned him of many matters, as your grace hath done me, which amongſt other his newes of diſcontent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that thoſe elected gouernors, whoſe hearts broyling with ambition and deſire of the whole authoritie, as the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of King, to the ambitious is ſwéete, ſo theſe couetous wretches, taking part one with the other, ſome enclining one way, ſome to the other part, that ciuill diſcention was raiſed, where the father beare Armes againſt the ſonne, the ſonne againſt the father, and kinſman againſt kinſman, one imbruing their hands in others blood, through which, many a woman is left a widow, and many a ſwéete Infant fatherles, which makes me greatly feare, without his help, that ſendeth all help, to the helpleſſe, the land will be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueriſhed, and our King and Prince returning, ſhall from their proper right be debarred, by theſe vſurping vilaines, whoſe hearts, my aged téeth in reuenge of their treachery, and wrong done the Commons, I could teare.
