            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

An Account of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Sufferings and Perſecutions of <hi>B. B.</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN my Youth and Tender Years, I feared the Lord, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to offend him; and was zealous and diligent in the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I was in, and ſought the Lord earneſtly, although I knew not where to find him, until I was directed by Friends that came from the North, <hi>John Audland</hi> and <hi>John Camm</hi> by Name, whoſe Behaviour and Deportments were ſuch, that it preached before ever they opened their Mouths; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38182:3"/>
it was then revealed to me, That they had the Everlaſting Goſpel to Preach in this City: And when they did open their Mouths, I was made to bleſs God that I had lived to hear the everlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preached; and they directed my Mind unto the Light of Chriſt, therein to wait, which I was dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to do, and found the Vertue of it; and as the Evil was made manifeſt, I departed from it, and willingly took up the Croſs, and yielded Obedience unto it, in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Speech and in my Habit: &amp; the People were ſo offended with it, when I went into their Publick Places and Steeple-houſes to ſpeak, that they took away their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from me, ſo that I loſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all my Imployment; and they kept me in Priſon a quarter of a Year at a time: And great was my Sufferings in that Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Lord ſo filled me with his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38182:3"/>
Power, that I was preſerved through it all: And the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Faithful did proſper then, and ſo they do now.</p>
            <p>And therefore my Counſel to <hi>Friends,</hi> is, that they keep in God's Power; for there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to be preſerved, nor to receive Life and Salvation; its my Teſtimony for God: For whoſoever ſhuns the Croſs, and goes out of the Power, they loſe their way, and diſhonour God; but whoſoever keep in the Faith, and abide in the Power, they are in Safety: I have had living Experience of it, therefore I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, and it has been with me a pretty while to publiſh it, for the benefit of thoſe that are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through, and are yet to paſs through the Sufferings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do I declare my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38182:4"/>
And ſo, <hi>dear Friends,</hi> the Croſs is the Way to the Crown of Life, and to the Crown of Glory; and they that continue Faithful and Obedient, they obtain the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Crown, which they that are diſobedient, loſe. I ſpeak my Experience of the Dealings of the Lord with me, in my Travels and paſſings through my Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Journey, for the benefit of thoſe that Travel rightly after. And I can ſpeak it to the glory of God, he never moved me to any thing, but that he gave me Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to perform it, and made it effectual, although I paſt through much Exerciſe in the performance of it. And the Power of God wrought in me long before I knew what it was; and when Friends came, that my underſtanding was opened, I ſoon took up the Croſs and came into the Obedience, and the Lord cleanſed me by his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38182:4"/>
Power, and made me a fit Veſſel for his Uſe.</p>
            <p>And when I had laboured pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much at home, he called me forth to labour abroad, and I ſtood ſo in the dread, awe and fear of the Lord, that his Spirit ſtrove much with me, before I could open my Mouth; and the Word of the Lord came unto me in a Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>That the Lord would have War with</hi> Amalek <hi>from Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Generation:</hi> And the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Spirit of the Lord was ſo ſtrong in me, that it ſet me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Feet, and conſtrained me to ſpeak the words; for I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver haſty nor forward.</p>
            <p>And then the Lord cauſed me to abſtain from all Fleſh, Wine and Beer whatſoever, and I drank only Water for the ſpace of a whole Year; and in that time the Lord cauſed me to grow and to proſper in the Truth: And then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38182:5"/>
I was made to go and to call the People forth from among the dumb Idols, and ſuffered much Impriſonment for it; but yet I was made to go till the Lord gave me dominion, ſo that I could go into their Places, and ſay what I had to ſay, and come forth again quietly. And as <hi>Mary Prince</hi> and I was coming Arm in Arm from a Meeting, that was at <hi>George Biſhop</hi>'s Houſe, there was a Rude Man came and abuſed us, and ſtruck off <hi>Mary Prince</hi> her Hat, and run ſome ſharp Knife or Inſtrument through all my Clothes, into the ſide of my Belly, which if it had gone but a little farther, it might have killed me; but my Soul was ſo in love with the Truth, that I could have given up my Life for it at that day.</p>
            <p>And then I was moved to go to <hi>Marlborough,</hi> to the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38182:5"/>
and Steeple-houſe, where I had pretty much Service, where they put me in Priſon for ſix Weeks, where I Faſted ſix Days and ſix Nights, and neither eat Bread nor drank Water, nor no earthly thing; then I came to a feeding upon the Word, and had experience that man doth not live by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of the Lord. And when I was releaſed, I went to <hi>Iſaac Burges,</hi> the man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me, and diſcourſed with him; and he was really Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth, but could not take up the Croſs; but was afterwards very loving to Friends, and ſtood by them upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and never Perſecuted a Friend any more: and when he came unto this City, he came unto my Houſe to ſee me, and confeſt, That he could not take
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38182:6"/>
up the Croſs, although he knew it was the Truth.</p>
            <p>And a while after I was made to go into <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> to <hi>Molton,</hi> and <hi>Baſtable,</hi> and <hi>Bediford,</hi> where I had a Priſon in all thoſe Places: and I went to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Bathes,</hi> where I had formerly ſpent much time in Vanity, to call unto them to come out of their Vanity; and I asked to ſpeak with the <hi>Counteſs,</hi> and they refuſed to let me in, but one of the Servants that knew me, bid me go to the Back-Door, and their Lady would come forth that way to go into the Garden; and they ſent forth a great Wolf-Dog upon me, which came fiercely at me to devour me, and juſt as he came unto me, the Power of the Lord ſmote the Dog, ſo that he whined, and ran in crying, and very Lame; ſo that I ſaw clearly the Hand of the Lord in it for my preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38182:6"/>
bleſſed be his Name: and then the Lady came forth, and ſtood ſtill and heard me all that I had to ſay unto her; and when I had done ſhe gave me Thanks, but never asked me to go into her Houſe, although I had eat and drank at her Table and lodged there many a time.</p>
            <p>And then I was moved to go to <hi>Great-Torrington</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> unto the Steeple-houſe there, where was a very bad Prieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though I had little to him, but to the People; and when I had ſpoken in the Morning, I went to my Lodging, and what I had not room to clear my ſelf of, I went to Writing, and the Conſtables came and took away my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and commanded me to go along with them to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and I anſwered them, That they would not ſuffer me to ſpeak there, and that I knew
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38182:7"/>
no Law would compel me to go twice in a day, and they all knew that I was there in the Morning; and ſo I would not go. So the next day the Mayor ſent for me, and when I came the Prieſt was there, and the Mayor was moderate, and loath to ſend me to Priſon, but the Prieſt. was very eager, and ſaid, <hi>I ought to be Whipt for a Vagabond.</hi> And I bid him prove where ever I askt any one for a bit of Bread; but he ſaid, <hi>I had broken the Law by ſpeaking in their Church.</hi> So he was ſo eager with the Mayor, that he made him make a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and ſend me to <hi>Exeter</hi>-Priſon, which was Twenty Miles diſtant, where I remained for ſome time, and was commanded of the Lord to Faſt fourteen Days and fourteen Nights, without taſting Bread or Water, or any earthly thing, which I performed for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38182:7"/>
againſt that dark profeſſing People; and there I was until the Aſſizes, and was not called forth to a Tryal: but after the Aſſizes was over, a petty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſent for me forth, and read a Law, which was quite wrong, and did not belong to me at all, and put me to lodge one Night among a great company of <hi>Gyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> that were then in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and the next day the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff came with a Beadle, and had me into a Room, and Whipt me till the Blood ran down my Back, and I never ſtartled at a blow; but the Lord made me to rejoyce, that I was counted Worthy to Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his Name's ſake, and I Sung aloud; and the Beadle ſaid, <hi>Do ye Sing; I ſhall make ye Cry by and by:</hi> and with that he laid more Stripes, and laid them on very hard. I ſhall never forget the large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Love and Power
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38182:8"/>
of God which I had in my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and therefore I can ſpeak to his Praiſe, and glorifie his Name: for if he had Whipt me to Death in that ſtate which then I was in, I ſhould not have been terrified or diſmayed at it; <hi>Ann Speed</hi> was an Eye Witneſs of it, and ſhe ſtood and lookt in at the Window, and wept bitterly. And then the Sheriff, when he ſaw that the envy of the man could not move me, he bid him <hi>forbear, for he had gone beyond his Orders already.</hi> So when he had left me, <hi>Ann Speed</hi> came in and dreſt my Wounds; and the next day they turned me out with all the <hi>Gypſies,</hi> and the Beadle fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us two Miles out of the City; and as ſoon as he left us, I returned back again, and went up into the Priſon to ſee my Friends that were Priſoners there at the ſame time: So I took my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38182:8"/>
leave of them, and went to <hi>Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,</hi> where there was a fine Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Friends, among whom I was ſweetly refreſhed, and ſtaid there one Night, and then I came home to <hi>Briſtoll;</hi> and in my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels I went ſeveral Miles upon long Downs, and knew nothing of the way, but as the Lord was with me, and did direct me; and in all this I have experience of the Love and Power of the Lord to me wards, bleſſed be his Name for ever: I cannot forget his Loving-kindneſs to me in my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
            <p>And in my Travels near <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> I went to ſpeak to a Prieſt that I had formerly known, one <hi>Edward Piggot;</hi> and when I came back to the Inn, where I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke my Lodging, they would not let me come in; ſo I lookt about for ſhelter to keep me from the fierceneſs of the Froſt, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38182:9"/>
I found the Pig-ſtye ſwept very clean, and the Trough turned up, and never a Pig in it, and I ſate me down on the Trough, and that was my Lodging all that Night: and the next Night I could get no lodging, but was fain to lodge in a Barn: and in all this the Lord exerciſed me in the Patience.</p>
            <p>Then I went to <hi>Bediford,</hi> and there I was put into the Town-Hall and they ſearched me to ſee whether I had Knife or Sciſſers about me; and the next day they brought me before the Mayor for ſpeaking in a private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he diſcourſed much with me, and had a ſence of what I ſaid unto him, and received it; and at laſt he ſet open two Doors, one right againſt the other, and ſaid, <hi>He would give me my choice which I would go forth at? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would go to Priſon again,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:38182:9"/>
               <hi>or go home?</hi> And I told him, that I ſhould chooſe Liberty ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Bonds: So I went homeward, and then he took his Horſe and came and followed me, for there was ſome tenderneſs in him; and he would have had me Rid behind him, but I found that when any Body which he knew did meet us, then he would draw back and lag behind, and as ſoon as they were gone, he would come up to me again; ſo therefore I would not ride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, but he rode three or four Miles with me, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed me all the way; and when we parted, I was made to kneel down and pray for him, in which time he was very ſerious; and afterwards he grew very ſolid and ſober, and in a little time he dyed, but I writ to him once before he dyed, a little after I came home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:38182:10"/>
And then I was moved of the Lord to go to <hi>Bazing-ſtoke,</hi> to endeavour the Liberty of two Friends, <hi>(viz.) Thomas Robiſon</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe Riggs,</hi> which were taken up at the firſt Meeting that Friends had there; and when I came, they would not let me come in to them; and I having a Letter from <hi>John Camm</hi> unto them, put it in at a Chink of the Door to them; and then I went to the Mayor to deſire their Liberty, and he told me, <hi>That if he ſhould ſee the Letter which I brought them, they ſhould have their Liberty;</hi> and I told him he ſhould, ſo I went and fetcht it to him, and he read it, and could fee no hurt in it: So he told me, <hi>I ſhould have my Brethren out, but he would not let them out preſently.</hi> Nevertheleſs we had a fine Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the next day, being Firſt Day, and coming from the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38182:10"/>
Meeting, I met with the Prieſt, and told him his portion, and in a few days the Friends had their Liberty: and thus the Lord made my Journey proſperous.</p>
            <p>And then the Lord moved me to go for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I went in a Veſſel bound for <hi>Corke,</hi> and the Lord ſo ordered it, that the Ship was carried about to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and we had much foul Weather, ſo that the Sea-men ſaid, That I was the cauſe of it, becauſe I was a <hi>Quaker;</hi> and they conſpired to fling me over-board; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made known to me, I went to the Maſter and told him what his Men had deſigned to do, and told him, that if he did ſuffer them to do it, my Blood would be required at his Hands. So he charged them not to meddle with me: And afterwards we were in a Storm upon a Firſt Day,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38182:11"/>
and I was moved to go upon Deck, and ſpeak among them, and Pray for them; and they were all made very quiet, and ſaid, <hi>They were more beholding to me then they were to their Prieſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did Pray for them, and he could not open his Mouth to ſay any thing amongſt them.</hi> We were ſix Days and ſix Nights at Sea, and the Maſter himſelf did not know where he was, nor which way he was going, until we were put into the Harbour at <hi>Dublin;</hi> and although we had abundance of very Stormy Weather, yet we ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no manner of loſs nor dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; ſo that the Maſter ſaid, He could never ſay before that he was in ſo much foul Weather, and received no hurt: And we were put into <hi>Dublin</hi> the very ſame day that <hi>Francis Howgill</hi> and <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> were Baniſht from thence. And then I ſaw my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38182:11"/>
there, and was moved to go to the Deputy, and when I came there, the People ſaid, their was no ſpeaking with him for me; for did I not know that he had Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht two of our Friends out of the Nation but yeſterday. But in the Faith I went, and the Power of the Lord had great weight upon me, and I met with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, and I deſired him to help me to the Speech of the Deputy. And he anſwered me, <hi>That he did think he could not.</hi> And I told him, if he would be ſo civil, as to go up and tell the Deputy, that there was a Woman below that would ſpeak with him; and then if he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I was anſwered. So he went up, and their came a Man to fetch me up into the with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Room; and after I had been there a while, their came a Man out of the Deputy's Chamber, and they all ſtood bare-headed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38182:12"/>
him, becauſe they knew I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw the Deputy; but I had a ſence it was a Prieſt; and there was almoſt a whole Room full of People, and they askt me, <hi>Why did not I do my Meſſage to their Lord.</hi> And I anſwered, When I do ſee your Lord, then I ſhall do my Meſſage to him. So in a little while he came forth, and ſate down on a Couch, and I ſtood up and ſpake to him that which the Lord did give me to ſpeak, and bid him beware, that he was not found fighting againſt God, in oppoſing the Truth, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Innocent, but be like Wiſe <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> To let it alone, and if it be of God, it will ſtand; but if it be of Man, it will fall; and the Enmity did not lie ſo much in himſelf, as he was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to it by Evil Magiſtrates and bad Prieſts; and that God's People are as dear to him now as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38182:12"/>
ever, and they that toucht them, toucht the Apple of his Eye. But in his Name, and by his Power their was much hurt done to the People of God all the Nation over, and it would lie heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at the laſt; and that the Teachers of the People did cauſe them to Err, and he knew the Prieſts portion; and when I toucht upon that, he would ſay, <hi>There's for you Mr Harriſon,</hi> to the Prieſt that ſtood there. And the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Preſence of the Lord was ſo with me, that it made the Man to be much concerned. And when I had done, he asked the Prieſt, <hi>What he had to ſay to that which I ſpake:</hi> And the Prieſt ſaid, <hi>It was all very true and very good, and he had nothing to ſay againſt it, if we did ſpeak as we meant.</hi> Then I told the Prieſt, that the Spirit of God was true, and did ſpeak as it meant, and meant as it ſpoke;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38182:13"/>
but men of Corrupt Minds did pervert the Scriptures, by putting their own Imaginations, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings, and Apprehenſions upon it, and ſo did deceive the People: but holy men of God ſpake the Scriptures, and gave them forth as they were Inſpired by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and they are of no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interpretation; but none underſtood them, but thoſe that read them by the ſame Spirit that gave them forth. So I returned to my Lodging, which was at one Captain <hi>Rich</hi> his Houſe, and he came home, and ſaid, <hi>That the Deputy was ſo Sad and Melancholly, after I had beed with him, that he would not come forth to Bowls nor no Paſtime at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This my Service for God was great, and he made it to proſper; And then I went to <hi>Corke,</hi> where my Motion was at firſt, and great
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38182:13"/>
were my Sufferings there, for I had a Priſon almoſt where-ever I came; and I was made to call to my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Acquaintance, by the Word of the Lord, and was made to follow them into ſeveral Steeple-houſes; and great were my Sufferings amongſt them, but where-ever the Lord opened my Mouth, there were ſome that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me, and would plead my Cauſe againſt my Perſecutors; and I was in Jeopardy of my Life ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, but the Lord prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. And I was made to ſpeak in a Market-place, and there was a Butcher ſwore he would cleave my Head in twain; and had his Cleaver up ready to do it, but their came a Woman behind him and caught back his Arms, and ſtaid them till the Souldiers came and reſcued me. And thoſe that were my former Acquaintance, with whom I had formerly been very
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38182:14"/>
converſant, and ſpent much time, and lodged at their Houſes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, even thoſe now were afraid of me, and would not come near me, but the dread of God was upon me, and it made ſome of them to Tremble; and ſome ſaid, I was a Witch: and when I would go to their Houſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, they were ſo mad that they would run away, and then their Servants would come and hale me out; and when I would go to ſit down, they would drag me along upon the Stones, and hale me out and ſhut the Doors: So I came to witneſs that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is not without Honour, ſave in his own Country. So when I found my ſelf pretty clear there, I returned home to <hi>Briſtoll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in a while after I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go for <hi>Ireland</hi> again, and then I was in great Perils by Sea, where I ſaw the Wonders of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38182:14"/>
Lord in the Deep; and there was one man Friend, and one woman Friend then in the Ship beſides me, and the Ship was broken near <hi>Dungarvan,</hi> and it foundred in the Sea, ſomething near the Shore, and we were all like to be caſt away; and I was ordered of the Lord to ſtay in the Ship, until they were all gone out of her, and the Maſter and the Paſſengers got into the Boat, (all ſave one Man and one Woman, which were caſt away) and they got to Shore, and ſtood there to ſee what would become of me, who was ſtill in the Cabbin, and the Waves beat in upon me in abundance, almoſt ready to ſtifle me: And ſo when I found freedom I went and ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a piece of the Deck that was left, and then the Maſter of the Veſſel &amp; the Man Friend called to me, and told me, <hi>If I would venture to leap down, they would venture to come</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:38182:15"/>
               <hi>into the Water to ſave me:</hi> So they came into the Water up ſo far as their Necks, and I leaped down to them, and they caught hold of me, but I being intangled in the Ropes in leaping down, was drawn from them again; but as the Lord ordered it, a Wave came and beat the Ship out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if it had beat in, it would have killed us all three, but beating out, they recovered me again, and drew me to Shore: So the Lord's Power and Mercy was wonderfully ſhown at that time for my preſervation; I cannot but bleſs his Name for it.</p>
            <p>So then I went to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where I ſpake in the High-Court of Juſtice amongſt the Judges; and then they put me in Priſon, where I lay upon Straw, on the Ground, and when it Rained, the Wet and Filth of the Houſe-of-Office ran in under my Back: And they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38182:15"/>
Arraigned me at the Bar, and bid me plead Guilty, or Not Guilty: And I anſwered, that there was no guilt upon any ones Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for what they did in Obedience unto the Lord God: And the Judge could not ſpeak to me, but ſpoke to another Man that ſtood by him, to ſpeak to me. So I could not ſay as they bid me, and they returned me to Priſon again, where I had very hard Exerciſe. And there was a Man that could not injoy ſome Land, except he could prove that his Brother was dead; and he brought a Man into Priſon, that ſaid, <hi>he would prove that he was killed at ſuch an Inn, and buried under a Wall.</hi> He accuſed the Inn-keeper and his Wife, and their Man, and Maid, and a Smith, to be guilty of this Murther. So I went to him, and ſate down by him, and ſpake a few Words to him, and askt him,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38182:16"/>
how he could conceal this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo long, when he was as guilty of it as either of them, if it were true. He trembled, and ſhook exceedingly, and his Knees ſmote one againſt another, and he confeſt, That <hi>he never ſaw the People with his Eyes, nor never was at the place in his Life, nor knew nothing of it, but only he was drawn in by the Man that was to have the Land, and was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Witneſs it.</hi> And the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners heard this his Confeſſion to me; ſo I ſent to the Deputy, to ſend down his Prieſt, that he might hear his Confeſſion: So he came, and he confeſt the ſame to him as he had done to me: and the five Perſons which he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed was then in Priſon, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Maid in the Priſon with me; and the Man confeſt the ſame once before the Judge: But the Man that brought him in,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38182:16"/>
came to him every day, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Head with Drink, and cauſed the Goaler to lock me up, that I might not come at him: So I writ to the Inn-keeper and his Wife, and the Coach-man; and I writ to the Judge alſo, and told him the Day of his Death did draw nigh, wherein he muſt give an Account of his Actions; and bid him take heed how he did condemn ſo many Innocent People, having but one Witneſs, in whoſe Mouth their were ſo many Lyes found; (and they all ſaid they were Innocent.) They called him Judge <hi>Pepes</hi> who Condemned them all. Then a Prieſt came to ſpeak with the Maid that was Condemned, which was with me in the Priſon; but ſhe would not ſee him, but ſaid, <hi>Nay, he can do me no good; I have done with Man for ever:</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:38182:17"/>
               <hi>But God, thou knoweſt that I am Innocent of what they lay to my Charge.</hi> So they were all Hanged, and the Man that accuſed them was hanged up firſt, for fear he ſhould confeſs when he ſaw the reſt hanged: And a heavy day it was, and I bore and ſuffered much that day. Then there were ſome Friends of mine, namely <hi>Sr. William King,</hi> Colonel <hi>Fare,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Browne,</hi> theſe hearing I was in Priſon, came to ſee me, and they would needs go to this Judge, to get me releaſed; ſo when they came, he told them, that <hi>he was afraid of his Life.</hi> And they laughed, and told him, <hi>they</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:38182:17"/>
               <hi>had known me from a Child, and there was no harm in me at all.</hi> And they were all very earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to get my Liberty, and at laſt they did obtain it. And then I was moved to go to the Steeple-houſe, where this Judge was, and the Lord was with me, and I Cleared my ſelf of him; and he went to Bed and Died that Night: And one of the Priſoners had writ the Letter which I ſent to him, and when they heard he was dead, they all ſaid, <hi>that I was a true Propheteſs unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus as an Inſtrument in the Hand of the Lord, to do his Work, I was faithful and obedient unto his Power,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38182:18"/>
and he cauſed me to grow and proſper through my great Sufferings; bleſſed be his Name for ever, that I had great experience of his love and power. <hi>Elizabeth Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and <hi>Rebecca Rich,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Clareges</hi> Wife knew all this to be true.</p>
            <p>And then I went to <hi>Limrick,</hi> where I had ſome Service, and they put me in Priſon. So in a while I was releaſed, and then I took Shipping for <hi>England</hi> again, and then there was a great Storm took us at Sea, and the Lord moved me to go to Prayer; and I went to Prayer, and in a little time the Storm ceaſed, and we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38182:18"/>
were preſerved; And coming towards <hi>Mineyard,</hi> we met a Pirate, which had abundance of men on board, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider, whether there was any Service for me to do among thoſe Rude People, but I found little to them: ſo they came on Board us, and took away all that I had, and one of my Coats from off my Back; but they were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to do me any further harm. So they took away the Maſter with them, until he ſhould pay them a ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the Ship and Goods. And ſo we came home to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:38182:19"/>
But in all my Travels, I Travelled ſtill on my own Purſe, and was never charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any, but paid for what I had. And much more could I declare of my Sufferings which I paſſed through, which I forbear to mention, being not willing to be over-tedious.</p>
            <closer>
               <hi>And I have written theſe Things that Friends may be encouraged, and go on in the Faith, in the Work of the Lord: For many have been the Tryals, Tribulations and Afflictions the which I have paſſed through, but the Lord hath delivered me out of them all; Glory be given to him, and bleſſed be his Name for ever, and evermore.</hi>
