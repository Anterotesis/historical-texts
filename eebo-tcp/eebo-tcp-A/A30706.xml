            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Draw a line of what length you pleaſe, (according to your occaſion) as the line A B, then open the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes to what diſtance you pleas, or as your occaſions require, and ſet one foot of the compaſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> towards one end of the given line, as at A, with the other foot make a piece of an arch of a circle, over or under the given line, as the arch C, keeping the compaſſes then at the ſame diſtance, make ſuch another arch towards the other end of the line, ſetting one foot in B, and with the other deſcribe the arch D, then laying a Ruler to the outſide of theſe two arches, ſo that it may exactly touch them, draw the line C D, which will be parallel to the given line A B, or equidiſtant, for ſo ſignifieth the word Parallel, to be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtance.</p>

               <p>BEing perfect in the raiſing and letting fall of perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars, and in the drawing of Parallel lines, you may proceed to draught: but firſt I will unfold unto

you the uſe of a Diagonall Scale of Inches and Feet, whoſe uſe is to repreſent a foot meaſure, or a Rule ſo ſmall, that a Ship of 100 foot by the Keel, may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated on a common ſheet of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, really and truly to be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foot long, and ſo many foot broad, of ſuch a depth, and of ſuch a height between the Decks. And therein, the firſt thing to be conſidered is, the length of the platform, and of the Veſſel you intend to demonſtrate, to the end you may make your Scale as large as you can, becauſe the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Scale is, the larger will the draught be, and ſo the meaſure of the demonſtration will be the larger, and more eaſie to unfold. The Scale adjoyning conſiſteth (as you ſee) of 12 feet in all, 11 thereof are marked with figures downwards, beginning at 1, 2, 3, 4 and ſo to 11: the firſt at the top is ſub-divided into inches by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agonal lines, as the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt line of the Scale and the firſt diagonal line is one inch, the ſecond is 2, and the third 3 inches, and ſo to Six. The way to demonſtrate the Scale, you ſee, is very eaſie: Draw Seven lines parallel to each other, and of what length you pleaſe, to retain what number of Feet you pleaſe, then beginning at the top, ſet off with the compaſſes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60949:8"/>
the length of your Feet both allow and aloft, then draw lines thwart the parallel lines, to every foot of the Scale, and ſet numbers to them, beginning at the ſecond foot 1, and to the third 2, to the fourth 3, and ſo forward, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Foot to be divided into Inches by the Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lines, as you ſee in the foregoing Scale.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Concerning the drawing your Draught upon Paper.</head>
               <p>HAving fitted your Scale ready, draw a line to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Keele of the Ship, as you ſee in the draught following of 60 foot long by the Keele, and 20 foot broad: the ſtreight line that repreſenteth the Keele is marked with A B. Then draw a line underneath of equall length to ſignifie the bottome of the Keele. Then next you may proceed to the Stern-poſt, as the line A C will ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the foreſide or the inſide thereof, racking the one quarter of his length aft, and for the length of the Stern-poſt it muſt be directed to the built of the Ship, as whether ſhe be to be a deep Ship or a ſhallow Ship, ſo that the draught of the water ought to be reſpected firſt, and then the lying of the Ports for the convenience of Ordnance, for that the upper tranſome of the Buttock, commonly is juſt under the Gun-Room ports, to the upper edge of the ſaid tranſome we underſtand the length of the Stern-poſt, although if the Stern-poſt were continued to the height of the Tiller, and another Tranſome fard there for the Tiller to run on, it would ſteady the quarters of the Veſſel very much, and do good ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60949:8"/>The Stern-poſt being drawn, we may proceed to draw the Stem, which in the following Draught is not ſo much racked as was the old proportion of <hi>England,</hi> which was the whole breadth of the Ship, for then it ſhould be 20 foot, but it is no more then 15 foot, juſt ¾ of the breadth, for too much racke with the Stem doth a great deale of damage to any Ship, if we conſider that in this ſmall Veſſel, had we given 5 foot more Racke, all the weight of the Ships Head, and Boltſpreet, Foremaſt, Manger, Halſps, Breſt-hooks aloft, had been ſo much farther forward, where there would have been want of Bodie to lift it, ſo that it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be detriment to the Veſſel when ſhe ſaileth againſt a head ſea, and a great ſtrain to her. Now it will be very good to ſpend as much of this racke as we can under the water, for it will help the Ship to keepe a good Winde, by giving her ſomething more Body in the water.</p>
               <p>Next draw the Water-line, in the following draught ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the pricked line; it is drawn to 9 foot height afore, and to 10 foot height abaft from the upper edge of the Keele, and higher abaft then afore, for the moſt Ships ſaile by the Sterne, and alſo for that the Guns ſhould lie ſomething higher abaft then afore from the water.</p>
               <p>Then proceed to hanging of the Waals, and here you ſee the lower Waalle drawne from the head of the Sterne-poſt, to ſignifie that it ſhould lie againſt the end of the Tranſome, that the Tranſome Knees might be bolted to the Waals without board to one foot and an halfe under the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, a little before the middle of the Water line, and at 9 foot high on the Stem, and the next Waale parallel to the lower Waale, one foot and an half aſunder, ſo that the upper Waale will lie juſt at the waters edge, in the mid-ſhips, the upper edge of the Gun-deck will lie one foot aboye the water line abaft, and halfe a foot above water on the Stem;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60949:9"/>
ſo then letting the lower ſell of the Ports be two foot from the Gun-decks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the lower edge of the Ports wil be three foot from the water abaft, and two foot and an halfe afore, in the middle of the Gun-deck 2 foot 9 inches, ſufficient for ſo ſmall a Veſſel, a greater Veſſel would require to have the Guns ſomething farther from the water, then if another Waale be required, firſt ſet off the Ports in their places, that the Waale may ly above the Ports, or elſe he would be cut with the ports in pieces, the upper Deck with height reſpecting the bigneſſe of the Ship, having reſpect to not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver building ſmall Ships, to damage their bearing of Sail.</p>
               <p>Then for the Head, the length of the Knee would be two thirds of the breadth, ſo then the Knee of the Head in this Draught will be 12 foot 8 inches long, and for his place, as low as conveniently he can, provided that the Rails of the Head, fall not fowl of the ha<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſhols, becauſe that in placing of the Knee low, giveth room to round the Head, and ſteeve it to content: The place of the Knee will be at, or very neer, the upper Waal, the upper edge of the Knee againſt the upper edge of the uper harping, which will be very well for the lower Cheeks of the head to be faced againſt, for by that means they wil be clear of any Seame to avoid Leak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and will very well bolt the end of the harping, if a Breſt-hook be faſtned alſo within board againſt them, will very well faſten all together.</p>
               <p>Then for the ſteeving of him, and rounding the Knee, a regard muſt be had to the lying of the Boltſpreet, leaving room enough for the Lyon and Scrowl under the Boltſprit. Then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the rounding of the Rails, round them moſt at the after ends.</p>

               <p>FIrſt, draw a line, as the line AB, then in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thereof, as at the point C, raiſe a perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as is the line CM, perpendicular to the line AB; then ſet off the halfe breadth, on either ſide, at the Points AB, and draw the two lines IA, and KB, parallels to CD, ſignifying the breadth of the Veſſell 20 foot; then draw the two lines EF, and HG, ſignifying the breadth of the Floare thwart Ships, 8 Foot, more then one third part of the breadth, which was formerly an old Proportion; ſo that according to that it ſhould have been but 6 Foot 8 Inches.</p>
               <p>Herein any may do as they pleaſe, give more or leſs; my judgment is, rather more then leſs: for, that it maketh a Veſſell to carry more in Burden, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it may, if it be well ended forward, it will not damage the Sayling: I alſo think, it doth ſtiffen a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell on this account. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſells have been uſed to have their breadth lying at the height of the Halfe Breadth, then obſerving 1/3 breadth for the length of the Floare Thwart Ships, it maketh the Veſſells Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be very neare a Circle, as is a Cask, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuch Veſſells to be eaſie to ſlew in the Water; yet I would not exceed neither, or run into extreams here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but if I were to make a Veſſell ſtiff, I would that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60949:12"/>
the Halfe Breadth be more then the draught of Water, which cauſeth that the Body be ſtronger in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will not Slew ſo eaſily. Now to ſweep out the Sides under Water, I draw the <hi>Diagonall</hi> lines DA,
<figure/>
and DB; then I divide the <hi>Diagonall</hi> lines into 9 parts, and ſet off 2 of them from the Corners A and B, to the points <hi>e,</hi> then I ſet off the Dead Riſing, which is 4 Inches, one Inch to a Foot, for halfe the breadth repreſented in the Figure above, by the little line paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to FG: from which Dead Riſing, take with the Compaſſes the Diſtance that will draw a piece of an Arch from <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>DRaw a Hanging line on the Draught, from the Keele, from the middle of the Keele to the height of the Water line, on the Poſt which will be the Riſing line, as the line DE; this line DE is ſuppoſed to be ſweept, or drawn by a <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of a Circle, extended on a Perpendicular raiſed at the point E, for if it be ſhorter then ſuch a <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of the true Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, it will make a fuller line then it ſhould be, and ſo muſt not be ſo long, or elſe it will make a breach at the beginning of the line; this, if the Centre be ſuppoſed to be Abaft ſuch a Perpendicular, that ſhould draw a Riſing line Abaft, I ſay, that it will ſhorten the Riſing line, and make it fuller then it ſhould be; or then if it be farther forward, it will be ſtraighter then a Circle, and alſo be a breach at the beginning of the Riſing line; therefore it ſhould be a Circle, I ſay, whoſe <hi>Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> will be on the Perpendicular line, at the beginning of any ſuch Riſing line, on the Heele, either Afoare, or

Abaft, and the like ought to be for all other crooked lines, as the narrowing lines Abaft, or Afoare, or at the Narrowing of the Floare, or other Circular lines, as Hanging of Waals, and the like; the way whereof I ſhall deſcribe, to finde the lengths of all ſuch Sweeps by Arithmetick; as alſo the true Riſing, Narrowing of any Timber, according to exact peeces of Circles, very uſefull for the ſetting of Bows, to trie whether they hang to a true Sweepe or no: I ſhall demonſtrate it, I ſay, in the following diſcourſe, and in this place end what I intend to ſay. For Demonſtration then, At ¾ of the Keele forward I draw a Riſing line forward to the height of the Water line, forward on the Stemm, as you ſee the line <hi>op;</hi> and the little line, between theſe two lines, parallel to the inſide of the Keele, marked <hi>Eo,</hi> is the dead riſing 4 inches high, as in the bend of Moulds it is parallel to FG, the height of the breadth from the Mid-Ship forward is the lower Edge of the upper Waale; but afterward on it is the pricked line, between the Water line and the lower Waale, on the Post, which runneth forward to the edge of the Waale, and hath Figures ſet to it, to ſignifie the places of the Timbers marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, to 15; as you ſee anſwers to the Figures on the Keele: and the Letters ſet to forward on, ſignifie the places of the Timbers forward, marked ABCD to L, in the middle of the Veſſel: the places marked with a Cipher ſignifie the Flats, which have onely Dead riſing, although they ought to have, ſome of them, ſomething more Dead riſing then each other; and thoſe that have leaſt, to be placed in the middle of the reſt, that ſo there be no Clings in the Buldge, but that it have alſo a little Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60949:14"/>
in it, it will ſeeme the fairer: Then I draw a ſtraight line, parallel to the bottome of the Keele, as is the line FG, parallel to the line AB, the Keele, and diſtant 10 foot by the Scale, which is the halfe breadth of the Veſſell; for this line ſignifieth a line ſtretched from the middle of the Sterne-Poſt to the middle of the Stem, called by <hi>Ship-wrightes,</hi> a Ram-line: Parallel to this Middle line I draw another line ſtraight, marked <hi>nm,</hi> and is 4 foot aſunder from the Middle line, to ſignifie the halfe length of the Floare thwartſhips, as in the Bend of Moulds EF is diſtant from DC 4 Foote: then I draw a Crooked line Abaft, within this line <hi>nm,</hi> to ſignifie the narrowing of the Floare, to bring, or forme the Veſſels way Abaſt, as you ſee the line <hi>ik;</hi> Abaft and Afoare it is repreſented by the line <hi>lo:</hi> then here in this Draught I draw a Sweepe, or a piece of a Circle, from the point G, the marke of the Timber G, on the Keele, to the halfe breadth of the Stemm, to the point G on the Stemm, ſignifying the Sweep of the Harping, and is Sweept by the breadth of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell 20 Foot; the piece of the Pricked Circle Abaft at the Starne, which is drawn by a Centre on the line FG, is the length of the Tranſom thwart the Starne, as is the Arch FS, the length whereof is 8 Foot, which doubled is 16 Foot, for the whole length: which is ⅘ of the breadth 20 Foot, the length of the Sweepe that ſweepeth it is the length of the Starnpoſt to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Keele 14 Foot ⅓, then the Crooked line, from the end of the Tranſom, or from the point S, and toucheth the Keele at the point <hi>p:</hi> this Arch <hi>Sp,</hi> is the narrowing line Abaft at the breadth, and the Crooked pricked line within the Keele, marked with TR, is a

Floare Mould, and another on the foot of the Navill Timber Mould, at the ſame place, to ſignifie, that thoſe two marks put together, they are in their true places, and will compare ſo when any Timbers are Molded by them: thoſe Sirmarks muſt alſo be marked off on the Timbers, and ſo in putting the Timbers up in the frame, a regard being had to compare Sirmarks with Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, each Timber will finde his own place, and come to his own breadth, and give the Veſſell that forme aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned her by your <hi>Draught,</hi> if it be wrought by it, and ſo for all the other Moulds.</p>
               <p>In making your Moulds, that they may be ſmaller and ſmaller upwards, and not all of a bigneſs, you may meaſure the depth of the Side in the Mid Ships Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as it goeth from the Keele to the top of the Side, as here the Side, as it Roundeth, is 26 foot, and in depth at the Rounheads, or at the end of the Floare, is one Foot, as <hi>m m;</hi> and at the other end, at the head of the Timber is but halfe a Foot, as at <hi>n n,</hi> ſo then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two lines, as the lines <hi>n m,</hi> repreſents the diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Moulds in thickneſs upwards, as thoſe two lines repreſenteth; as if you would finde the thickneſs of the Timbers at the breadth, take your 2 Foot Rule, and meaſure the length from the end of the Floare at the point F to I, at the breadth in the crooked body, and it is 11 Foot 9 Inches, ſignified at the Sirmarks there, thoſe two lines ſhew the thickneſs to be 9 Inches; and ſo thick ought the Moulds to be at the breadth of the Veſſell.</p>

               </head>
               <p>KNow then that a ſquare number hath its ſides equall every way, as are the ſides of 4, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by ⸬ pricks; and you ſee that every way of all the 4 ſides it containeth 2, and ſo 2 times 2, make 4, which is the ſquaring of a number, ſo you ſee ⋮⋮⋮ 9 pricks is a ſquare, or 9 is a ſquare number, whoſe ſide is 3, and 3 times 3 make 9, but 2 times 3 is not a ſquare number, as you ſee :::, being but 2 one way, and the other way 3, that make but 6; ſo then all the numbers between 4 and 9, are not ſquare numbers: by the like reaſon, a ſquare, made of the Next ſquare number 4 is 16, for 4 times 4 is 16, as by the Pricks you may ſee it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented here, every of the 4 ſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 4, make a ſquared number of 16, and all the numbers that are between 9 and 16, as 2 times 4, or 3 times 4, are not ſquares, but have a fraction annexed to them; ſo alſo any number betwen 16 and 25, are not ſquares, as 4 times 5, or 2 times 5, or 3 times 5, theſe are not ſquare numbers, but 5 times 5 is a ſquared number, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 25, where note, that to ſquare a number, and to extract the ſquare root, is two different things; for when we ſay, to ſquare a number, is to multiply it in it ſelf, or by it itſelfe; or</p>
               <figure/>

when we ſay, or ſpeake of a number ſquared, it is a number multiplied in it ſelf, but to extract the ſquare Root, is to finde the ſide of the ſquare in a number gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the extracted ſquare Root is the ſquare Root found in any given number.</p>
               <p>Thus you may conceive of the Squares of 6, for 6 times 6 make 36; 7 times 7 make 49; 8 times 8 make 64; 9 times 9 make 81; 10 times 10 make 100: there is all the ſquares made of the 9 Figures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by this little Table annexed, as againſt each Figure is the ſquare made of them, as 2 times 2 is 4, ſo is 4 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt 2, as you ſee.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60949:27"/>
hand, which is 154; now if you take the next ſquare lower to the left hand 35 line, it is 24025, 250 too much, ſo you may ſee it is nearer to the 34th line, becauſe there it was too little but by 59, ſo that you may ſee it will be ¾ of an inch leſs then the number of inches, belonging to the 35th line, and about ¼ of an inch more then the numbers in the 34th line; ſo that you ſee it is anſwered, the third ſide D 0 is 154, and ¼ of an inch, which Subſtracted from the whole Sweep 203, leaveth 48¾ inches for the Riſing, ſo you have no need of extraction of the Rootes by theſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, it is already done to your hand; the Columne that is between the inches and the ſquares, and written feet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the head, is to ſhew you, how may feet, and inches of the foot any number of inches is; as here, the number 203 inches ſought, and found in the Tables, in the ſecond page, and third line, juſt againſt it, in the ſame line, between that and the ſquares, is 16—11, ſhewing that it is 16 feet and 11 inches; or if the ſquare were given, as 41209, found at the ſecond page, and third line, next toward the left hand, you have 16 foot, 11 inches; and if you ſeek for it in inches, in the third Columne toward the left hand, and the ſame line, you have 203 inches: Thus is it very ready to reduce inches into foot meaſure, or feet into inches.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Shewing, how to Hang a Riſing line by ſeverall Sweeps, to make it rounder aftward, then at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſame.</head>
               <p>IF any be deſirous to have a Riſing line rounder aft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then it is at the foar part of it, they muſt proceed thus; firſt Work by the Sweep that they would have firſt, and then begin again, and finde the other Sweep, that they would have the roundeſt; An <hi>Example</hi> of this will make it more plain, as in the following Figure will appear.</p>
               <p>Let D E repreſent the length of a Riſing line E I, the height thereof 8 foot, on the after end thereof; firſt I finde the Sweep that Sweepeth it, by Multiplying of 20 foot the length, which is 240 inches: for if you look in the Tables, under the Title of Feet-Inches, for 20 feet, you will ſee in the next Columne, toward the left hand, 240, over head is written Inches, ſignifying, that in 20 feet is 240 inches; and juſt againſt it, and in the ſame line, toward the right hand, under the Title of Squares, you will ſee written 57600, ſignifying, that the ſquare of 240 is 57600, theſe numbers you will finde in the ſecond Page of the Tables, and the laſt line, the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth Columns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:60949:34"/>This ſquared number 57600, made by the Multiplication of D E, 240 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, muſt be divided by the height of the Riſing line aſſigned E I, 8 foot, or 96 inches, ſo remaineth in the quotient 600, to which muſt be added the height of the Riſing, as is afore taught, and they make 696, which is the Diameter of the whole Circle: the half thereof is 348 inches, which is 29 foot, as you may ſee by dividing it by 12; or elſe, if you turne to the Tables, and ſeek under the Title of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> for 348, you will ſee in the ſame line, toward the left hand, 29 feet, which you will finde in the third Page, and the 28th line, the ſeventh and eighth Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn; then I Work by that Sweep to 3/5 of the length of the Riſing line, or 12 foot of the ſame, at the point C it is repreſented, at which point I ſeek the Riſing C B, I ſeek in the Table for the <hi>Square</hi> made of 144, and I finde it in the ſecond Page, 24 line, at the firſt Columne; and toward the right hand, under the Title of <hi>Squares,</hi> I finde 20736, which is the Square made of 144: then I ſeek for the Square made of the Sweep, or ſide A B, 348 inches, and I finde it in the Tables to be 121104, from this 121104 I Subſtract the other Square, made of the ſide D C, 144 being 20736, and there remaineth 100368, whoſe Root I finde in the Tables, in the third Page, and the 37th line, and the ſixth Columne, 100489, which is too much by neare 121; but the other number afore it being much more too little, the number anſwering hereunto is 316 inches, and near ¼, Subſtracted from 348, the whole ſide lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth 31 inches ¼, or two foot 7 inches ¼ for the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</p>

               <p>I Shall ſay ſomething concerning it; the Shipwrights have to themſelves a cuſtome of meaſuring at <hi>London,</hi> or on the River of <hi>Thames</hi> thus, they multiply the length of the Keel into the bredth of the Ship, at the broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt place, taken from outſide to outſide, and the product of that by the half bredth, this ſecond product of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication they divide by 94 or ſometimes 100, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that diviſion, the quotient thereof; they are paid for ſo many Tuns; as ſuppoſe in the former draught being in length 60 foot and 20 foot broad, 60, being multiplyed by 20, the bredth, produce 1200, that 1200 being again multiplied by 10, the half bredth produce 12000, if you divide by 100, you need do no more than cut off the two laſt figures toward the right hand, which ſhall be the anſwer and rendreth the Ship to be 120 Tuns, but if you divide the ſum 12000 by 94, you wil have 127 2/3 of a Tun very neer, but this cannot be the true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the ſhip to carry or lift, becauſe two ſhips by this rule of equall breadth and length ſhall be of equall burthen, notwithſtanding the fulneſs or ſharpneſs of thoſe Veſſels, which may differ them very much, or the one ſhip may have more timber than the other in her building, &amp; ſo ſhall carry leſs than the other: But the true way of meaſure muſt be by meaſure of the body and bulk of the ſhip underwater, for if one ſhip be longer in the floor than another of the ſame bredth and length, ſhe ſhall be more in burthen than the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60949:37"/>
other; as a Flemiſh ſhip ſhall carry more than a French or Italian Veſſell of the ſame length and bredth; Therefore I ſay the meaſure of the ſhip being known by meaſuring her, as a piece of timber may be meaſured of the ſame form, to the draught of water aſſigned her, the weight of the ſame body of the ſame water that the ſhip ſwimmeth in ſhall be the exact weight of the ſhip; and all things therein; load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rigging, victuals included therein: then if the ſhip be meaſured to her light mark as ſhe will ſwim at being lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the weight of ſo much water being taken or ſubſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the weight of the water when ſhe is laden, the reſidue ſhall be the weight that muſt load her, or her abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of carrying, called her burden, by this means you may know the weight of the ſhip light, and what ſhe will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to every foot of water aſſigned to her, which cannot be done by no general rules in Arithmetick becauſe of their great irregularity, according to the differing minds of Shipwrights; you may if you pleaſe firſt meaſure the content of the Keel and Poſt and Stem-rudder, all of it that is without the Plank, and under the water line, and note it by it ſelf, then meaſure the body of the ſhip in the Midſhips, made by the ſquare made of the multiplying of the depth of the water line, and the bredth, then you may find; the content of the want by the circular part of the ſhip under water, being narrower downward, and ſubſtract this from the whole content of the ſquared body of the depth of the Water-line and bredth of the ſhip, and this ſhall be the ſolid content of that part of the ſhip, I mean in ſolid foot meaſure of 1728 inches to the foot, then proceed to the fore part or the after part of the ſhip, and to 3 or 4 Timbers more, find the mean bredth at the narrowing aloft at the water-line, and alow at the floor and the mean depth, and meaſure that piece of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60949:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſhip, as I told you of the middle part of the Ship, and ſo meaſure the whole Ship by pieces and add them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo many feet as it maketh, ſo many feet of water ſhall be the weight of the ſaid ſhip; and the reaſon may be conſidered thus; there is a ponderoſity in warer, but there is a greater in the ayre, onely to the heavieſt of things; and there is a ponderoſity in water it ſelf, but not ſo much as in other things more ſolid as in Iron: Suppoſe a Gun or an Anchor of Iron, it ſinketh in the water, but yet it is not ſo heavy in the water as in the ayre, by the weight of ſo much water as ſhall make a body of the ſame water equal to the body of the Gun or Anchor in magnitude; which weight ſubſtracted from the weight of the Iron bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy weighed in the ayre, and ſo much muſt be the weight of it in the water.</p>
               <p>Again, if a body be lighter in weight, than water of the ſame bigneſs, it hath an ability of lifting in the water, and can lift or carry ſo much as is that difference, as a piece of cork or wood of firr-trees, being lighter than water, it ſwimmeth on the face of the water, and refuſeth to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed without more weight added to it.</p>
               <p>Thus a ſhip being a concave body, is made capable of lifting according to the greatneſs or littleneſs of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity, reſpect being had to the greatneſs of the Timber put into it, or the nature of it, all which maketh a ſhip ſwim deeper or lighter in the water.</p>
               <p>I have proved by the <hi>Thames</hi> water, that freſh Water is lighter then ſalt water, ſo then ſalt water being heavier than freſh, cauſeth that a ſhip ſwimmeth deeper in the freſh water than in ſalt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to ſay any thing more concerning the meſauring, for it will be underſtood by thoſe that have any
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60949:38"/>
Judgment in the meſuring of triangles, the matter it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a nicity rather than uſefll: I only touched it to ſhew thoſe that are ſo curious minded, which way they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their deſires; I ſhall forbear to give examples, becauſe it will much increaſe my Treatiſe, and augment the Price, which might prove more prejudicial to youngmen than advantagious.</p>

               <p>FRom the length and bredth is gained the Mainmaſts length, and all the other Maſts as wel as yards, is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thence, and there is different proceedings in this caſe, according to the largeneſs of the Ships, thus, the main Maſts of ſmall Ships to be three times as long as the Ship is in bredth; as a ſhip of 20 foot broad, by the ſame rule muſt have a Maſt of 60 foot long.</p>
               <p>Others for greater Ships, add the bredth to the length, and to that the half bredth, which ſome they divide by 5, and the quotient is the number of yards, as a ſhip 114 foot long and 34 foot in bredth, as the bredth added to the length, and the half bredth added together, make 165, that divided by 5, yields 33, and ſo many yards is the length to be of that Maſt, the fore-maſt muſt be a yard ſhorter at the head, that is to ſay beſides the height of the ſtep, which commonly in moſt ſhips the ſtep of the fore-maſt ſtandeth higher from the bottom of the ſhip than the ſtep of the Main-maſt; the foremaſt muſt be ſhorter by that difference, and one yard more, or the bigneſs of the ſhip conſidered, 4 foot ſhorter at the head, or beſides the difference below,</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Concerning Rowing of Ships, when they are becalm'd.</head>
               <p>I Have here invented a meanes of Rowing of a Ship, by the heaving at the Capſtane, where will be many benefits; Firſt, of a greater purchaſe of ſtrength, for it is evident, that 10 Men at a Capſtane ſhall heave a Ship a Head, when 30 Men ſhall not Haall her a Head by hand, nay 50; neither ſhall they be ſo ſoon tired, for that Owers are a great wearineſs to the Armes, beſide a double motion of the body, as when the ſtroak is fetched, to way down the Ower, that the blade may be elivated out of the Water, where it muſt be kept ſo, untill another</p>
               <p>

ſtroak be fetched, and then great ſtrength put to the Ower by the Armes, or elſe heavy bodies, will not be moved: beſide, if you have never ſo many Owers as you can put, they all fetch their ſtroak at once, but when Rowed by hand, one is likely to fetch a ſtroak before another, ſo that much of the ſtrength is loſt by a diſagreement in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: But to proceed to the deſcription of this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Let the two lines, C D, and C D, repreſent the ſides of the Ship, 16 foot broad, as is the line C C, 16 foot long, by the Scale of the <hi>Draught;</hi> and let the two long ſquares, <hi>d d,</hi> and <hi>d d,</hi> repreſent the two Bitt-pins, with the Croſs-piece <hi>of,</hi> let the Black, between the two Bit-pins, repreſent a Roule, or Windleſs, with a Surdge in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, as is the Surdge of a Crab, or Capſtane; in the two ends of this Roule let there be placed two Winches, as you may ſee repreſented by Cranks, <hi>a</hi> and <hi>a;</hi> let there be made a hollow place in the Head of the Bit-pins for theſe two Winches to reſt in, that they may turne round in them, and bide in them: then let there be two pieces of Timber, equall in length, to the ſpace of the Ship you would have filled with Oares, repreſented by the two black liſts, marked <hi>b b,</hi> and <hi>b b;</hi> then let there be fitted two ſmall pieces, made of good Aſhe, or ſome good ſtrong Wood, of equall length as is the two black Liſts, <hi>n</hi> L, <hi>m</hi> L, faſtned into the pieces of the frame, as at the points L and L, by a Boult, but ſo, that they may play on that Boult, and the other ends muſt be with a Hoale made in the ends, put over the handles of the Cranks, at <hi>n</hi> and <hi>m,</hi> then in the two long pieces for the frame let the Oares be fixed, as at the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, of each ſide of the Ship repreſenting 7 Oares of a ſide, they may be faſtned in the Frame, by a Mortis made therein, and a Tenent on the Oar, made to go ſlack, in that the Oar may play, and have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to fetch a Stroak, in the middle whereof muſt be placed a Iron bolt, to faſten him, and keep the Oar from launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and out, and on the Roughtre, or ſide of the Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in C D and C D, muſt be placed Thoule pins to each Oare, as in Boats that Row; then muſt you have a Halſer ſpliſed together, in manner of a Viall, that muſt take two or three turnes about the Roule, in the Surdge, as you may imagine, at the middle of the Black Roule, or notch therein, and paſs from thence to the Capſtane, with two or three turnes there alſo; then this Viall alſo, reeved thorough ſome other Blocks, as in manner of Snach block, and theſe blocks placed between the Capſtane and the Roule, you may thereby increaſe that purchaſe ſo, as that it may heave very eaſie, and with great ſtrength, ſo as to be able to Row a Ship a Head in a calme, or in little winde, two, threee or four leagues, a watch or more, according as the Ingine ſhall be better or worſe fitted; for if you marke in the Figure of the Work, and ſuppoſe the Viall Reeved, and by heaving of the Capſtane, ſhall turne the Roule, as the Crankes goeth round, it ſhall carrie with it about, and then the ſmall pieces ſhall cauſe the frame to paſs forward to and again, to fetch a ſtroake with the Oares.</p>
