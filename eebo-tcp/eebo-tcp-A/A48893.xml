            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Author says, <hi>Silver yielding the propos'd</hi> 2 d. <hi>or</hi> 3 d. <hi>more by the Ounce, than it will do by being Coin'd into Money, there will be none Coin'd into Money; and matter of Fact shews there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61293:2"/>
plain words at the bottom of the Leaf, that <hi>an Ounce of Silver uncoin'd, is of</hi> 2 d. <hi>mor<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> value, than after it is Coin'd it will be</hi> which I take the liberty to say, is so far from being true, that I affirm it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be so. For which I shall only give this short reason, <hi>viz.</hi> Because the Stamp neither does nor can take away any of the intrinsic value of the Silver and therefore an Ounce of Coin'd stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Silver, must necessarily be of equal value to an Ounce of uncoin'd standard Silver. For example; suppose a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith has a round Plate of standard Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver just of the shape, size and weight of a Coin'd Crown-piece, which, for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's sake, we will suppose to be an Ounce this Ounce of standard Silver is certainly of equal value to any other Ounce of unwrought standard Silver in his shop; away he goes with his round piece of Silver to the Tower, and has there the Stamp set upon it; when he brings this numerical piece back again to his shop Coin'd, can any one imagine that it is now 2 <hi>d.</hi> less worth than it was when he carried it out smooth a quarter of a<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hour before, or that it is not still of equa<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> value to any other Ounce of unwrough<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> standard Silver in his shop? He that can say 'tis 2 <hi>d.</hi> less worth than it was before
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61293:2"/>
it had the King's Image and Inscription on it, may as well say, that 60 grains of Silver brought from the Tower, are worth but 58 grains of Silver in <hi>Lombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Author very warily limits this ill effect of Coinage only to <hi>England;</hi> why it is so in <hi>England,</hi> and not every where, would deserve a reason.</p>
            <p>But let us grant it to be true, as our Author affirms, that Coined Silver in <hi>England</hi> is 1/30 worse, or of less value than uncoin'd, the natural Consequence from this, if it be true, is, that it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that the Mint should be employ'd in <hi>England,</hi> where it debases the Silver 1/30; for if the Stamp lessens the value of our Silver this year, it will also do so the next, and so on to the end of the world, it always working the same way. Nor will the altering the Denomination, as is propos'd, at all help it.</p>
            <p>But yet he thinks he has some proof for his Proposition, because it is <hi>matter of Fact</hi> that there is <hi>no Money Coin'd at the Mint.</hi> This is the great Grievance, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd is one indeed, but for a different <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The matter in short is this; <hi>England</hi>

He might have said disorder to all People in their Trade, though he says it will be but a <hi>little trouble to Merchants,</hi> and without any <hi>real damage to Trade.</hi> The Author would have done well to have made out this and a great many other Assertions in that Paper; but say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is much easier, if that may pass for Proof.</p>
            <p>Indeed he has, by a short way, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd the Book abovementioned, in the conclusion of his Paper, in these words: <hi>And he that so grosly mistakes in so materials Points of what he would assert, 'tis plain is not free from mistakes.</hi> It does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he who published that Book, ever thought himself free from mistakes;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61293:6"/>
but he that mistakes in two material Points, may be in the right in two others, and those will still need an Answer. But one of these material Points will, I think, by what is already said, appear not to be a mistake; and for any thing the Author of the Paper has said, or can say, it will always be true, that an Ounce of Silver Coin'd or not Coin'd, is, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally will be of equal value to any other Ounce of Silver. As to the other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, concerning the rate of Coinage, 'tis like he had his information from some disinteressed person whom he thought worthy of credit, and whether it be 3 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> as he was told, or only 16d½ <hi>per</hi> pound Troy, as the Paper says, whether the Reader will believe the one or the other, or think it worth his more exact enquiry, this is certain, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ought not to be at that or any other Charge where there is no advantage, as there will be none in this propos'd Coinage, but quite the contrary.</p>
            <p>In his Answer to</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. He says from <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Silver has from time to time (as it grew in esteem) been by degrees raised in all Mints.</hi> If an Ounce of Silver now not exchanging or paying for what 1/10 of an Ounce would have purchased in <hi>Edw.</hi> III's time, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61293:6"/>
so being ten time less worth now than it was then, be <hi>growing in esteem,</hi> this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is in the right, else Silver has not since <hi>Edw.</hi> III's. Reign, <hi>from time to time grown in esteem.</hi> Be that as it will, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs a wrong Cause <hi>of raising of Silver,</hi> as he calls it in our Mint. For if <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in request, i. e.</hi> by lessening its value, had been the reason of altering our Money, this change of Coin, or raising the denomination of Silver in ours and other Mints, ought to have been greater by much since <hi>Henry</hi> VII's. time, than it was between that and <hi>Edw.</hi> III's. because the great change of the value of Silver has been made, by the plenty of it pour'd into this part of the World from the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd till <hi>Henry</hi> VII's. Reign. So that I think I may say that the value of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from <hi>Edw.</hi> III. to <hi>Henry</hi> VII. changed not 1/10, but from <hi>Henry</hi> VII. till now it chang'd above 7/10, and yet Money having been raised in our Mint ⅔ since <hi>Edw.</hi> III's. time, the far greater part of the raising of it was before <hi>Henry</hi> VII's. time, and a very small part of it since; so that the cause insinuated by our Author, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, was not the cause of lessening our Coin so often, whatever was it: and 'tis possible there wanted not men of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61293:7"/>
in those days, who for private ends, by wrong Suggestions, and false Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, cover'd with mysterious terms, led those into mistakes, who had not the time and will nicely to examine, tho a Crown piece three times as big as one of ours now might, for its size alone, deserve to be reformed.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Object.</hi> 2. He says, <hi>The raising the Denomination of Money in</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, <hi>was making it go for more when Coin'd, than its true value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I say, is impossible, and desire the Author to prove it. It did in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> just what it will do here and everywhere, it made not the Silver Coin'd go for more than its value in all things to be bought, but just so much as the Denomination was raised, just so much less of Commodity had the Buyer in exchange for it: As it would be here, if you should Coin Six-pences into Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, if any one went to Market with this new Money, he would find that whereas he had a Bushel of Wheat last Week for Eight Shillings of the former Coin, he would have now but half a Bushel for Eight of the new Shillings, when the same Denomination had but half the quantity of Silver. Indeed those
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61293:7"/>
who were to receive Money upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Contracts, would be defrauded of half their due, receiving in their full tale of any Denomination contracted for, but half the Silver they should have; the Cheat whereof they would find, when they went to Market with their new Money. For this I have above proved, that one Ounce of Silver is, and eternally will be equal in value to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Ounce of Silver; and all that can possibly put a difference between them, is only the different value of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship bestow'd on one more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which in Coinage our Author tells us in this Paper is but 16½d. <hi>per</hi> pound <hi>Troy.</hi> I demand therefore of our Author, to shew that any sort of Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or, as he calls it, raising of Money, can raise the value of Coin'd Silver, or make it go for more than uncoin'd, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the charge of Coinage, unless it be to those who being to receive Money up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on former Contracts, will, by receiving the tale agreed for, receive less than they should of Silver, and so be defrauded of what they really contracted for.</p>
            <p>What effect such a raising of their Money had in one Particular, I will tell our Author. In <hi>Portugal</hi> they count their Money by Reys, a very small, or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61293:8"/>
rather imaginary Coin, just as if we here should count all our Sums by Farthings. It pleased the Government, possibly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told that it would raise the value of their Money to raise in Denomination the several <hi>species,</hi> and make them go for a greater (let us suppose double the) number of Reys than formerly. What was the Consequence? It not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Property of the Subject, and disturbed Affairs to no purpose; but Treaties of Commerce having setled the Rates of the Customs, as so many Reys on the several Commodities, the King immediately lost in value half his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms. The same that in proportion will happen in the setled Revenue of the Crown here upon the proposed change.</p>
            <p>For tho' our Author in these words, <hi>Whereas all now desir'd by this Act is, to keep Silver when Coin'd of the same value it was before,</hi> would insinuate, that this raising the Denomination, or lessening our Coin, as is propos'd, will do no such thing; yet 'tis demonstration, that when our Coin is lessen'd 3 <hi>d.</hi> in 5 <hi>s.</hi> the King will receive 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> less in value in his Customs, Excise, and all his setled Revenue, and so proportionably, as the quantity of Silver in every <hi>species</hi> of our Coin shall be made less than now it is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61293:8"/>
Coin'd in those of the same Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>But whatever our Author means by <hi>making Money go for more when Coin'd than its true value, or by keeping Silver when Coin'd of the same value it was before;</hi> This is evident, that raising their Money thus by Coining it with less Silver in it than it had before, had not the effect in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which our Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses from it here: For it has not brought one Penny more to the Mint there, nor kept their Money or Silver from Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation since, tho' forfeiture and death be the Penalties join'd in aid to this trick of <hi>raising</hi> to keep it in.</p>
            <p>But our Author tells us in Answer to <hi>Object.</hi> 4. This <hi>will scarce ever at all be perceived.</hi> If of 100 Guinea's a man has in his Pocket, 5 should be picked out so as he should not perceive it, the fraud and the loss would not be one jot the less; and tho' he perceived it not when or how it was done, yet he will find it in his Accompts, and the going so much back in his Estate at the end of the year.</p>
            <p>To the 3d <hi>Objection</hi> he says, The <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> your Coin <hi>(it may be) may raise the price of Bullion here in</hi> England. An Ounce of Silver will always be equal in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61293:9"/>
value to an Ounce of Silver everywhere, bating the workmanship. I say it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be otherwise, and require our Author to shew it possible in <hi>England,</hi> or any where, or else hereafter to spare his <hi>may be's.</hi> To avoid Fallacies, I desire to be understood, when I use the word <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> alone, to mean nothing but Silver, and do lay aside the consideration of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Metals that may be mixed with it: For I do not say that an Ounce of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Silver that has almost 1/12 of Copper in it, is of equal value with an Ounce of fine Silver that has no alloy at all, but that any two Ounces of equally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loid Silver, will always be of equal value; the Silver being the measure of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, 'tis the quantity of Silver that is in every piece he receives, and not the Denomination of it which the Merchant looks after, and values it by.</p>
            <p>But this raising of the Denomination our Author would have pass, because 'twill be <hi>better for the Possessors of Bullion,</hi> as he says <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. But who are they who now in <hi>England</hi> are possess'd of so much Bullion? Or what private men are there in <hi>England</hi> of that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that for their advantage all our Money should be new Coin'd, and of a less weight, with so great a charge to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61293:9"/>
the Nation, and loss to His Majesties Revenue?</p>
            <p>He farther adds, Answ. 3. <hi>It doth not thence inevitably follow, it will raise the price of Bullion beyond Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will as inevitably follow, as that 19 Ounces of Silver will never be equal in weight or worth to 20 Ounces of Silver: So much as you lessen your Coin, so much more must you pay in tale as will make up the quantity of Silver the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant expects for his Commodity, under what Denomination soever he receives it.</p>
            <p>The Clothier thus buying his <hi>Spanish</hi> Wooll, Oil and Labour at 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more in Denomination, sells his Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture proportionably dearer to the <hi>English</hi> Merchant, who exporting it to <hi>Spain,</hi> where their Money is not changed, sells it at the usual Market rate, and so brings home the same quantity of Bullion for it which he was wont, which therefore he must sell to you at the same raised value your Money is at: And what then is gain'd by all this? The Denomination is only chang'd to the prejudice of the Publick, but as to all the great matters of your Trade, the same quantity of Silver is paid for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities as before, and they sold in

taking any care for that? The making a new standard for your Money, cannot do less than make all Money which is lighter than that standard unpassable, and thus the Mill'd and heavy Money not coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to payment, and the light and Clipp'd not being lawful Money, according to the new standard, there must needs be a sudden stop of Trade, and, 'tis to be fear'd, a general confusion of Affairs, though our Author says, <hi>it will not any ways interrupt Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The latter part of this <hi>Section</hi> about raising the value of Land, I take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to say is a mistake; which though a sufficient Reply to an Assertion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proof, yet I shall not so far imitate this Author, as barely to say things: And therefore I shall add this Reason for what I say, <hi>viz.</hi> because nothing can truly raise the value, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Rent of Land, but the increase of your Money; but because <hi>raising the value of Land</hi> is a Phrase which, by its uncertain sense, may deceive others, we may reckon up these several meanings of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The value of Land is raised, when its intrinsick worth is increased, <hi>i. e.</hi> when it is fitted to bring forth a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of any valuable Product. And thus the value of Land is raised only by good Husbandry.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61293:12"/>
2. The value of Land is raised, when remaining of the same Fertiliy, it comes to yield more Rent, and thus its value is raised only by a greater plenty of Money and Treasure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or it may be raised in our Author's way, which is, by raising the Rent in tale of pieces, but not in the quantity of Silver received for it, which, in truth, is no raising of it at all, no more than it could be accounted the raising of a man's Rent, if he let his Land this year for 40 Sixpences, which last year he let for 20 <hi>s.</hi> Nor would it alter the Case, if he should call those 40 Sixpences 40 <hi>s.</hi> for having but half the Silver of 40 <hi>s.</hi> in them, they would be but of half the value, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Denomination were changed.</p>
            <p>In his Answer to the 5th <hi>Objection,</hi> there is this dangerous Insinuation, That Coin in any Country where it is Coin'd <hi>goes not by weight,</hi> i. e. has its value from the stamp and denomination, and not the quantity of Silver in it. Indeed in Contracts already made, if your <hi>species</hi> be by Law Coin'd a fifth part lighter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same denomination the Creditor must take 100 such light Shillings, or 20 such light Crown-pieces for 5 <hi>l.</hi> if the Law calls them so, but he loses ⅕ in the intrinsick value of his Debt. But in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61293:12"/>
to be made, and things to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, Money has and will always have its value from the quantity of Silver in it, and not from the stamp and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as has been already proved, and will some time or other be evidenced with a witness in the Clipp'd Money. And if it were not so, that the value of Money were not according to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Silver in it, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it goes by weight, I see no reason why Clipping should be so severely punished.</p>
