            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>NOvelties, and their Introducers, have generally most need of powerful Patrons: Yet while I make bold to Dedicate to You a Dramatic Entertainment, that may be said to want a precedent, I dare not presume to recommend it to Your Protection. There are some ill Customs in the Business of the Pen, as well as in that of the Sword. Methinks a Dedicator, who strives to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a Man of Honor blindly to take his Part against those that tax him with Faults, resembles a mad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>llow, who would draw in a Gentleman to be his Second, upon a trivial quarrel, in which 'tis great odds but he is in the wrong. In either Duel, instead of getting satisfaction, both Principals and Assistants are often wounded, and many times the latter most. Neither the Fondness of a Parent, nor even the Vanity of an Author, can make me think any thing that may be call'd mine in the following Sheets worthy the honor of Your Patronage; and
<pb facs="tcp:104585:3"/>
the rest, for which I am oblig'd to others, its Merit will, I hope, secure it a kind Reception.</p>
            <p>Yet be pleas'd, Sir, to permit the whole to appear grac'd and countenanc'd with Your Acceptance: I will not say, it will fright Envy and Ill-nature from using this as ill as they do better Pieces; for I find, they are no respectors of persons, and far from being so fearful as some Writers wou'd have them be thought by their Patrons, they make nothing of a Breach of Priviledge, misusing even what claims the Protection of Lords, nay, Majesty itself. But this I dare affirm that Your Name will advance the Reputation of these Scenes; for those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are acquainted with your Character (and there are but few of the better sort but know and respect it) will not be able to imagin that any one durst presume to Dedicate to You an undeserving Piece; and shou'd they mislike this in the reading, they will, I fancy be inclin'd to suspect their own Judgment, rather than that of the Writer.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, while this may protect me from the Severity of others, it cou'd never secure me from Your juster Censure, were not Your Goodness as celebrated as Your Judgment, and Your indulgent Disposition to pardon Faults as great as Your Skill to discover them. You pity those unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Men upon whom the Curse of Poetry is entail'd, kindly considering, that a Muse, like a Mistress, tho pleasing at first, is seldom long so to the man that's wedded to her, or indeed to any others, especially when he's forc'd to reduce her to be a Houshold Drudge This, Sir, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens me to hope, that if You condemn the weakness of my Performance, You'll at least approve my Zeal; since I do not offer this to You as a Thing worthy Your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; but merely as an opportunity to publish the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb facs="tcp:104585:3"/>
I have for your extraordinary Merit. Were it not much more difficult to commend than it is to admire, I wou'd now, like some modern Writers, assume a Poetic Licence to turn an Epistle Dedicatory into a Panegyric; Conscious that what is Flattery in some, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued just praise when said of You. Neither shou'd I be stinted to the Encomium of Generosity, tho that's the Soul of every noble endowment, and a virtue seldom forgot in Dedications. Yours; like the Sun's kind influence, is still dispens'd, even while the power that exerts it is unseen; and therefore a bare hint of so diffusive and known a Good wou'd be sufficient; the rather, because I shou'd have a large field for praise in Your other Virtues; many of which are naturally inseparable from that. But shou'd I enlarge on the sweetness and evenness of Your Temper, on Your engaging and discreet behaviour with Your Equals, Your condescending affability to Your Inferiors, Your Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Your Moderation in a flourishing Youth, and what's more difficult in an ample Fortune, Your knowledge of Men as well as of Books, and every accomplishment that gains You the esteem of our Sex, and the Love of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Your friends might yet justly accuse me of having said too little, while Your Modesty alone wou'd tax me with having said too much.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgot its strict injunctions, and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise not to make You uneasy with Your Praises; so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is to be silent when a pleasing Theme and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity combine to make us speak. Yet what I must deny my self, will, I hope, be the task of better Pens. Why may not <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s and <hi>Pyrrha</hi>'s being safe upon <hi>Parnassus,</hi> when the rest of the world perished by the Deluge, be thought
<pb facs="tcp:104585:4"/>
to imply that the Muses friends will be preserv'd, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shall be swept away by inundations of ignorance and oblivion? if so, your Name shall live, and may even trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this faint essay to posterity.</p>
            <p>But tho I must curb my fancy, I may give a loose to my wishes, for a long and happy Continuance of that more real Life which you so wisely know how to use. May your Years still rowl on smoothly, and attended with new pleasures; may your Desires be crown'd, and may I still be happy, in being thought,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Hope several things will induce you to pass gently over the Defects in this entertainment. I was put on this bold Attempt, being hinder'd from giving you a better Play, which, waiting its Turn, cannot appear till next Winter. Most of the best Actors being engaged on ther Plays, I could not expect they would study mine. This made me think of something that might be got up by the by.</p>
            <p>I writ the Masque of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eccles</hi> having set it with his usual Success, and yet more masterly than my <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> if possible, I prevail'd with the ingenious Mr. <hi>J. Oldmixon</hi> to give me a short <hi>Pastoral,</hi> while I scribbl d over a <hi>Farce</hi> after the Italian Manner, and an Imitation of part of a diverting <hi>French</hi> Comedy of one Act. (for such Plays are very common in Foreign Parts.) Then I wanted nothing but a <hi>Tragedy</hi> to have something of every kind. But, as I said already, the best <hi>Tragedians</hi> were engaged in other Plays.</p>
            <p>At last bethought my self of one already studied, called <hi>The Unnatural Brother,</hi> written by an ingenious Gentleman, and acted <hi>6</hi> Months ago, tho not with the success it deserv'd.</p>
            <p>Yet the latter Part was extremely applauded: So I was perswaded to make bold with it, as I do, with thankful Acknowledgement; the rather, because I could easily contract the most moving Part of the Story into the Compass of one Act, with some Additions; yet without mutilating my Author's Sense, for which I have all the Veneration imaginable.</p>
            <p>All this was done in a very short time, the warm Season threatening me with your Absence: And I got those Actors I could to study and rehearse for me by the by: But among them I must particularly mention Mr. <hi>Bowen,</hi> who has been singularly diligent in getting by heart a large Part, while he was studying several others.</p>
            <p>I will only add, that you are not to expect a Plot in the <hi>Pastoral</hi>; That's chiefly to amuse you a while by its Innocence, and the softness of the Verse. As for the Masque, if it should be said that I have not altogether kept close to the Story of <hi>Hercules</hi>; the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious know, that a Poetic Licence will bear me out.</p>
            <p>The foregoing Lines were published as a Preface to that Masque, some few Copies of which were printed for the use of the Audience, the first day of the <hi>Novelty</hi>'s being Acted. I have nothing to add, but that altogether it has met with better success than I cou'd expect, since, (thanks to my friends) it was not only beneficial to me on the third, but also on the sixth day, and that in a Season when the Town is most empty. I know I ought to make amends, and I fancy I am not without hopes of doing better, since I have not the vanity of some, who think they have written well, when their bad Plays have succeeded better than they deserved.</p>
            <p>You have here the Farce as 'twas Acted the first day; the latter part being left out afterwards; some few of the Audience having been offended at it, but more at the length of that Act. I have seen most of the things that were mislik'd, much applauded when Acted by <hi>Harlequin</hi> and <hi>Scaramouch.</hi> But it must be own'd, that many fooleries pleas'd when grac'd by those incomparable Mimics which may not suit with the Genius of our Stage. The whole will I hope, at least be thought inoffensive, as is all that I have written hitherto; for I have always been of Opinion, that a Writer cannot be too careful in public Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho we live in a licentious Age.</p>

                  <p>I know it — But a pox o' Fortune I say, she deals us good or bad luck as she does Stations, or we Cards; Knaves, and Kings shuffled up together. I'm afraid there were Sharpers in the Company.</p>

                  <p>That's not unlikely; they get now into the best: for there are some of all Ranks. For this, I my self have now forsworn play; tho that's the way to find the days tedious, and lose one'-interest with half the <hi>Beau monde?</hi> But I find that playing on the square is like dealing on the square, the ready way to be undone. Yet do not curse Fortune, my friend; you should rather pray to her, she has been, and may be kinder to you.</p>

                  <p>Well, I'm made for ever. My Lord Mammon is like all the World, and is kindest to those that keep Mony by them; and I'll keep mine so, that 'tis not not Forty in the Hundred Discount shall decoy me to part with it. I've a great Mind to turn, and make my Court to the Spirits, that they may bring me more hereafter. But I must not. Wou'd they were come! Methinks they out-stay their Time.—What if this damn'd Fiend that haunts me, has chang'd Shapes to plague me more? What need they have taken the Chest? There my Deeds are, and ten thousand Ducats! Oh! I'm in a cold Sweat—Shall I look back? What shall I do?</p>

                  <p>For nothing, my Lord: Only for thinking too well of the World. I cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as every Body does; I was cheated again, and so suspended my self.</p>

                  <p>Come, Sir, you've enough left: You've parted with nothing but what was not yours; and 'tis to your Niece, and to me, to whom you owe more; since you owe me your Life; for, had I not cut the Rope, you had been dead, and damn'd as you thought your self just now. Thank Providence, and learn to make a better use of what you enjoy.</p>

                  <p>Well, the Advice is good. Heav'n forgive me, and bless you together! Since you have sav'd a Life that stood between an Estate and your Mistress, you show you deserve it, and you shall have all, when I die: For now I'll right those I've wrong'd, and, tho' late, begin to lead a new Life.</p>

                  <p>Look you, Master of mine, so wou'd I too. I borrow'd some Plate of our Neighbour, Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Steward, and sold it you; then chang'd it and the Cloth, thinking you'd fancy the Devil had don't in this Hurly-burly: Since that they brought me into this Plot here, for I knew nothing on't before; but take your Muck again, 'tis Usurer's Mony, the Widow's and Fatherless's Blood, and the poor Man's Curse; 'twoud not thrive with me.</p>

            <head>EPILOGUE,</head>
            <byline>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </byline>
            <l>KIngs send Embassadors; so Poets do.</l>
            <l>I from the French, to the Confederates, You,</l>
            <l>Am sent Plenipotentiary; for Peace to sue.</l>
            <l>To treat with me, pray think it no Disgrace!</l>
            <l>You may read my Credentials in my Face.</l>
            <l>Besides, I'm told, the silliest Women are,</l>
            <l>Able to deal with the best of you here:</l>
            <l>You're fierce at first, but tamely end the War.</l>
            <l>The Pow'r that sent me offers to restore</l>
            <l>All he took since he treated here before,</l>
            <l>Or else Equivalents. What wou'd y' have more?</l>
            <l>Not want at Home from others made him take:</l>
            <l>He only took for sweet Convenience-sake.</l>
            <l>Agree! Faith, once I thought, as he does use you,</l>
            <l>This talk of Peace was only to amuse you.</l>
            <l>But now he finds his Treasury grows low;</l>
            <l>Tho' yours he fancies now is but so so.</l>
            <l>Thus, tir'd like you, he's willing War should cease,</l>
            <l>Because he hopes he may get more by a Peace.</l>
            <l>All you he'll spare, whom pointed Satire hits,</l>
            <l>From those who crow'd us here, to yonder peeping Wits;</l>
            <l>Ev'n Criticks, Masks, and Beaux; nay Cuckolds, Squires and Cits.</l>
            <l>He'll let the Critick for good-natur'd pass;</l>
            <l>The Mask for fair and modest, while she hides her Face.</l>
            <l>The Fair, who scarce dares ogle at <hi>Hide-Park,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Shall safely meet in t'other, when 'tis dark,</l>
            <l>And keep Time with the Music and her Spark.</l>
            <l>The Wits for Beaux shall pass; for Wits, the Beaux,</l>
            <l>And if they please, wear Periwigs to their Toes,</l>
            <l>And Shoulder o' Mutton-Flaps in Gawdy double Rows.</l>
            <l>The Squire shall be well bred, old Matron pretty,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Cuckold's-point</hi> no Scandal to the City.</l>
            <l>Why, thus you'll all be safe! Then kindly bless</l>
            <l>This my first Embassy, with fair Success.</l>
            <l>Ladies, let your Mediation end the War!</l>
            <l>He never trespass'd yet against the Fair.</l>
            <l>And, Sirs, till we your Hearts t' a Peace induce,</l>
            <l>Pray let me have your Hands, and grant at least a Truce,</l>
            <l>We'll ratify't on <hi>Thursday</hi> at this Place:</l>
            <l>But then be sure you ben't in <hi>Needmore</hi>'s Case.</l>
