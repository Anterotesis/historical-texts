         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is a precious Seed among you, in love to which several
of the Lords Servants have been drawn to come, and visit
the Seed, &amp; preach the Everlasting Gospel thereto, which
is the power of God unto Salvation; and the Seed hath been reached,
and we have been made manifest in your Consciences, the witness
of God in your Consciences hath answered our Testimony that we
are of God, and that which we declared unto you, was not a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
devised Fable, but the living Truth of the Living God, which
hath been revealed to us, and which we have learned from the Spirit
of Truth, and our Testimony among you hath been, that the Son
of God is come, and his Kingdom revealed with power and great
Glory, even the Kingdom of God, which is Righteousness, peace
and joy in the Holy Ghost, and now hath the Sun of Righteousness
arisen with healing under his wings, and the glorious light thereof
hath shined forth upon the Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof, after
the long dark night of Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stacy that hath been; wherein many poor
things who have had true breathings and desires after the Lord, have
lamented after him, and sought him whom their souls loved, and
longed for, but could not find him; and the thick <hi>Egiptian</hi> darkness
hath choaked them, and the living breathings in many hath been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated
and killed, and <hi>Babylon</hi> the mother of Fornications hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
the whole Earth with the cup of her Sorceries, who hath
given her self forth to be the Church and spouse of Christ, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Harlot; and her Merchants who have handed forth the Cup
of her abominations have past in this time of darkness and ignorance
for the Ministers of Christ, and Pastors of the flock, now it pleased
the Lord out of his rich mercy and love a hundred years ago, or
thereby, to send forth some beams of his Heavenly light into the
Souls of people, whereby the more gross abominations of the
Whore were disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vered and quit; and no question many have been
accepted of the Lord in that day according to their faithfulness:
But alass, there hath been a great backsliding, and defection since,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40713:2"/>
which some of the Lords servants then saw, that it would come, and
that Christ should be again crucified in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and now its my
Testimony, and the testimony of hundreds and thousands that he is
again arisen in this <hi>Island,</hi> and in other parts of the Earth, and all the
wit and policy of Sathan and his Instruments shall not be able to
hold him from the setting up of his Kingdom in the Earth, Truth
is planted and taken root in the Earth, yea even in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and it
shall grow and prosper, and spread and fill the Earth, and every
Plant which is not of the Lords planting shall be rooted out, and
their folly shall be made manifest to all, who set themselves against
the truth. And Friends, think it not strange that truth hath such
opposition from many who have even had a great profession thereof,
this day hath abundantly discovered them, that their glorying hath
been but in the flesh, and that they are not come to live in the truth,
but have had the form of Godliness, and denyed (yea been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strangers unto) the power thereof; now they not being
in the truth, which is living, and gives the discerning but in the
form of it, which is but a dead thing, how could they but
<note n="‖" place="margin">Or not Know.</note> misken truth in its appearance, and the children and vessels
thereof, and yet there is a pretious seed even in many hundreds,
which the Lord will raise up in his own appointed time, who may be
for the present through ignorance, and their being deceived with

the faithful testimony of such whom the Lord hath gathered, and is
gathering into the truth, shall have a shril and loud sound even to
the awakening and quickning of such, and they shall be made to build
up, that which once they were endeavouring to destroy. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

this I testifie unto you, that its such, and such only, who are of that
spirit (whereof honest <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> were) to follow the Lord
fully even in all things to the least circumstance of his requirings,
who shall get an entrance into the blessed Land of promise, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

(among whom I am one) even into that good Land that floweth
with milk and honey, yea with streams of joy, peace, and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,
and this you shall all come to witness in your selves in the Lords
good time, as you keep faithful to him, and grow up more and
more in a resignation to his will in all things, sparing nothing, against
which the Lords controversie and indignation is, but giving up all to
a hope that's contrary to his will, that it may be burnt up, and slain
by the judgment of the Lord, and you delivered therefrom, for this
is only that which stands in the way, and lets your entrance into
Gods Kingdom, even somewhat more or less, that is contrary to
the holy and pure nature of God, and against his will cleaved unto,
and lived in, which till ye be rid of; the flaming sword will turn
every way against you, so that ye cannot get into the Paradice of
God, though ye should never so earnestly desire it. And such of you
whom the Lord hath in some measure perswaded to quit many
things, and ye purpose to quit more, as he shall discover them to
be evil unto you; faint not in your minds, though ye cannot get the
desires of your minds and souls accomplished, and though ye cannot
see the good Land, nor get so much as a tast of the Wine that grows
there: I say faint not, nor be discouraged, for a day of blessed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
from the Lord is abiding you, wherein ye shall see the
King of Glory in his beauty, and ye shall be made to drink of the
river of his pleasure, and to eat of the feast of fat things upon the
mountain of the Lord, and the Wine well refined from the lees shall
be given unto you, even the new Wine in the Fathers Kingdom, and
ye shall eat and drink, and praise the name of the Lord, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto you not of my self, but of the Lord, who hath brought
me (through the riches of his goodness) to know such a state in a
measure, and hath shed abroad his love in my heart, in the which love
I have felt the bowels of the Lords compassion flowing forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you also, and the blessings of Gods heavenly Kingdom ready

that which lets shall be taken out of the way, for ye must pass through
the judgment of the Lord, and be rid of all that cannot dwell with
everlasting burnings, for our God is a consuming fire, and the throne
of iniquity can have no fellowship with him, and the Lord is to try
you with a Wilderness, even a dry and barren Land, wherein is no
water, whereby your desires after him may be the more enlivened
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40713:3"/>
and enlarged, and your faith and patience must be tryed (which hath
been the Lords dealing with us also, for which be endless glory and
praise unto his Name) and there in the Wilderness he will allure you,
and speak comfortably unto you, and give you Vineyards from
thence, and the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> for a door of hope: Therefore,
think not strange of the fiery trial, which shall try you, wherein the
Lord will plead with all that is of Flesh within you, and ye must be
brought down to the Valley of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> which is as much as the
Valley of <hi>decision,</hi> or off-cuting, wherein ye must come to know the
Circumcision, even the cutting off of that which is but flesh, before
you enter the promised Land, and the Sun must be turned into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the Moon loose her light before the notable day of the
Lord come, and all that hath been the delight of your eyes must be
taken from you, and you left stript and naked, as in the day ye were
born, and then will the Lord cast the skirts of his love over you,
and say unto you, <hi>live,</hi> and ye shall live, and ye shall become beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with his comeliness, that he shall put upon you, even the robes of
his unspoted Righteousness, and the garments of his Salvation,
wherewith ye shall be cloathed, and in that day ye shall understand
the sence and meaning of these Scriptures, that <hi>blessed are the poor, for
their's is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God,</hi> and <hi>that God is truly good to Israel, even to such as are
upright in heart.</hi> And dear Friends, as I have spoke unto you, so it
is in my heart to put you again [by writing] in remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
though ye may know it, how that the Lord is making a narrow
and deep search in this day, even beyond what hath been these many
ages ago, he is now arisen to take vengeance upon the many inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with which he hath borne long, and hath winked at them (so to
speak) in the dayes of ignorance, and hath suffred many even of the
faithful in former dayes to keep many things, against which the Lord
hath pronounced his indignation in this day, for now is the day bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up, and the Sun arisen, and the more refined garments of the
Whore, which formerly past for upright in the twy-light, are now
discerned to be but counterfeit, and blessed are they, and shall be
who are made willing to see, and seeks not to cover or spare what the
Lord requires to be given up, and parted with, though it be a hard
thing for flesh and blood, but I can assure you the love of God when
ye come to feel it shed abroad in your hearts, will a thousand fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense
all that ye can forsake for his names sake, &amp; the reproach of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40713:4"/>
Christ shall become unto you more pretious then all the treasures
of <hi>Egipt.</hi> And as I have formerly told you, so it is with me again
to remind you, even to exercise all forbearance in all things, but in
so far as it lies upon you from the Lord, according to the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his light and spirit in your hearts; ceasing, ceasing, forever
from every thing, but what ye manifestly know to be agreeable with
the Lords will, not hazarding to be found in any thing whatsoever,
because ye see it not evil or sinful; nay, that is not enough, the
path and way of God is yet narrower, though large and broad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to the children of God, even to let things alone, but as you
see them in the openings and manifestation of the Spirit of life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you to be good, innocent, profitable, suitable to truth, so that
you savour a good savour in them, and others of the Lords children
with you, this ends all disputations and reasonings, and here is peace,
joy, liberty, even true Christian liberty and freedom, yea, victory
and Dominion; whereas to do things not knowing the Lords will
and approbation therein, is but at best to do doubtingly, and such
are condemned, and weakness and confusion enters them, and the
seed of God is burdened; yea, I say it again, blessed are they who
are come here even to be afraid to medle with any thing though
never so plausible in the eyes of men, but as they find and feel in
themselves the approbation and allowance of the Lords Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
else to forbear, and let alone, even to take up the cross to every
work and word, yea to every desire and thought of the heart, which
is not manifestly known to be of the Lord, the blessed experience
whereof, I have often found, and daily finds, waiting and earnestly
desiring of the Lord that the mystery of his Cross I may more and
more learn, that I may become crucified even to all that is of the
World, and alive to him, ceasing from my own works, not being
able to do, nor daring to do any thing without him, which is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
my testimony, but the testimony of all that are come to live in any
measure of truth. And dear Friends, keep to any measure of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
ye have attained unto, for I can say it, the Lord regards the
same, and it hath a good savour before him, and grow up in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and resignation to the Lord in all things; for this is it which
makes your testimony strong, and valid, and acceptable to God,
that it be universal in every circumstance, that the enemy have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wherewith to charge you, and this is it which will make you
able to stand it out in the day of tryal, the having your loynes girded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40713:4"/>
about with truth, having truth to encompass you round, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found in the truth in all things, but who are out of truth in any
thing though never so small, heere there is an open to let in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and it will be hard for such to stand. And Friends, let not the
terror of your enemies afright you from keeping your Meetings, but
sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and let him be your fear, and
this will put away the fear of man that shall die, and become as the
dust of the earth, and as you assemble together in Gods fear and
name, and in true love one with another, the Lord will be among
you, and ye shall be made to feel his living presence, and he will shew
you where he feedeth his flock, and makes it rest at noon-day, and
he will bring you into the banqueting house, and display the banner
of his love over you, and make you a terror to your enemies. And
I have felt the sweet blessing and presence of God among you, and I
can assure you his Salvation is near to come, and his Righteousness to
be revealed to the upright and single hearted: And keep your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the silence of all flesh, and the shout of the King the Lord of
Hoasts shall be heard among you, and he will give in due time the
opening of the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

love in the bowels of Jesus Christ is towards you all, and with a
sweet measure of his blessed presence have I largely written unto
you, and the Lord is with me by night and by day, and makes my
Prison very acceptable to me, Farewell dear Friends.</p>

            <p>BLessed, blessed is the opportunity, the Lord is putting in your hands to
bear a Testimony for his Name, and living glorious Truth in this day.
O be faithful to him, and rich shall be your reward, rich, unspeakably
rich, even beyond what eye can see, or ear hear, or the heart be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
the love of God, which passeth knowledge, the peace that passeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
the joy unspeakable, and full of glory, the por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion of such: the
joy as in the time of harvest, or as when the strong divide the spoile. Oh who
can declare the blessed lot and inheritance that shall be given them who give up
all, sparing nothing, nothing to a hoof, or Pin point, which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
to be delivered, and parted with, assuredly they shall obtain an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fold in this life, and life eternal for ever more. Dear Friends, thus I
write who in this day, and dayly do witness, the hundreth fold, do possess it,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40713:5"/>
even the love, the joy, the peace of God, which is my strength, my portion, my
crown, which none can take from me, so that I am made to sing in a Prison, even
in a Prison the Lines are fallen to me in a pleasant place, I have a good heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
And this is the doing of the Lord, and it's wondrous in mine eyes, I am
even as one that dreames, Glory to his Name for ever, for his unspeakable gift,
and rich mercy, and free love, which hath visited my poor soul, shut up in the
blackness of darkness, the region and shadow of death, the Pit wherein is no
water: the hand of love hath reached me, and brought me out of the woful Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and loosed my bands, and delivered my soul, and given me to drink of the
Cup of Salvation, and now hereto do I set my seal: worthy, worthy is the Lamb;
to suffer for, ignominy, reproach, hatred (even of the dearest relations) perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
prisonment, killing, tortering, or what ever the cruelty of Man can be
permitted to inflict: Worthy is he for his sake to be killed all the day long, and
counted as Sheep for the slaughter, his Love will sweetly recompence all: and
worthy is he to be waited for, to be credited and trusted, and believed in, and in
and through the faith, and hope, which entreth through the dark and thick vail,
which may be over for the time, so that little or no sensible enjoyment is pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

yet even then, in and through the faith (the believing when there is not

be sinful. Oh this will be a mountain on the seed, yea, the being but found in
