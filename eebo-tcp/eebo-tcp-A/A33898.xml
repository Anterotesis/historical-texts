            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE Animadversions ON TWO PAMPHLETS Lately Publish'd By Mr. <hi>COLLIER,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I engage the <hi>Argument,</hi> it may not be amiss to premise one Word concerning the <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</hi> This <hi>Author</hi> has rallyed the <hi>Old</hi> Objections against the <hi>Absolution</hi> of Sir <hi>William Perkins,</hi> drawn them up in a new Figure, and proposed them in a Method of Advantage. And to do him justice, in the first part of his Undertaking, He may be said to have done something more. He seems to have reinforced the Bishops <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> with some <hi>New</hi> Observations, and Reasonings of his own.</p>
            <p>His Objections against my Conduct in the <hi>Absolution,</hi> are branched into two general Heads. The one relates to the <hi>Church,</hi> the other to the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48584:2"/>I shall begin with this Gentleman in his own Method.</p>
            <p>His first Attempt is to take off the Testimonies of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, from which I had sufficiently proved that Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> was the general Practice of the Antient Church. The <hi>Animadverter</hi> grants the Proof of this Point, but disputes the Application. <hi>The Absolution</hi> (says he) <hi>in which those Antients made use of Imposition of Hands, was not such an Absolution as that in which Mr.</hi> C — <hi>was concern'd:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Animad. p. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>But an Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Persons Excommunicated, and given them at their Reconcilement to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To disarm this Objection, I shall endeavour to make good three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>First, That upon the <hi>Animadverter's</hi> own Principles, <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> could not be confined to the Occasions he mentions, without great Reflection upon the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, That supposing all my Instances of Antiquity did relate to <hi>Excommunicated Persons,</hi> &amp;c. this does not make them unserviceable to the Purpose they were brought for.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, That in Fact, <hi>Absolution,</hi> with <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> was given in other Cases besides the <hi>Reconcilement</hi> of <hi>Offenders.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1st, That upon the <hi>Animadverter's</hi> Principles, <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> could not be confin'd to the Occasions he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without great Reflection upon the <hi>Antients.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Animadverter</hi> affirms, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> look'd upon those to whom this <hi>Ceremony</hi> was applyed, as <hi>deprived of the Holy Ghost.</hi> But that the Antient Church did not always suppose This, will appear, if we consider that, as the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter</hi> observes, <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> was given after the Point of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> was adjusted. This <hi>Ceremony</hi> in the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter</hi>'s Opinion, was a Ratification of <hi>Articles</hi> between the <hi>Penitent,</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> It supposed the <hi>Peace</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48584:2"/>
and gave an Admission to the Priviledges of the former <hi>Allyance.</hi> Now in many cases this <hi>Satisfaction</hi> could not be made without running through a long Course of Pennance, without extraordinary Abstinence, and a great many other Instances of Discipline, and Mortification. They were abridged in almost all the Entertainments and Conveniencies of Life, and passed their Time worse than common Poverty could have used them. Their Habit and Devotions, their Retirement and publick Appearance, were all of them apparent Signs of unusual Severity, and Sorrow, and Submission. And these Exercises of Humiliation were sometimes continued for several Years. A Humiliation, which had admirable effects upon the Christians of those Times. And as the Apostle speaks in a like case; <hi>What Carefullness did it work in them? What clearing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? What Indignation? What Fear?</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. vii. 11. And can a Man practise all these Rigours upon himself, and subdue the Powers of Custom, and Inclination, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Assistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> Is it possible to begin Repentance, and carry it on through to many Stages of length and difficulty, by the pure Abilities of Nature? Can a Man practise so many prodigious Instances of Self-denyal, and not be under the Conduct of a Divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? This is to deny the necessity of Grace; to make the Soul <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Vertue, and to give away the <hi>Antients</hi> to the Heresie of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> 'Tis true, the Antient Church did use <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> as a Mark of Authority, and a Circumstance of Paternal Benediction: She believ'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt this Application a Recommendation to God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and that the Communications of his <hi>Spirit</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon such an Expedient. This Perswasion is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Doctrine and Practise of the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> And upon this view I suppose it is that our Church lays on <hi>her Hands</hi> at <hi>Ordination.</hi> But as our Church is far from sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing those who appear for <hi>Orders</hi> to be no <hi>true Christians</hi>; So neither did the <hi>Antients</hi> always look upon those they Absolved with <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> under such an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48584:3"/>
Notion. They could not look upon them as entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandoned by Heaven; or if they had believed them in this unsupported Condition, they would never have defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Assistance so long, nor refus'd them the releiving <hi>Ceremony,</hi> till Pennance was over, and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made, as the <hi>Animadverter</hi> asserts.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Supposing all my Instances from Antiquity did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to <hi>Excommunicated Persons,</hi> &amp;c. this does not make them unserviceable to the Purpose for which they were brought.</p>
            <p>To take off the force of these Authorities, the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter</hi> ought to prove, That the Antients forbad <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> or at least forbore it, in all other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Absolution,</hi> besides those above-mentioned: But this he has not in the least attempted. I have sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that giving <hi>Absolution,</hi> with <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> was the general Practise of the Primitive Church. Does it not therefore lie upon the <hi>Animadverter</hi> to prove, That this <hi>Ceremony</hi> was appropriated to the more solemn and publick Cases of <hi>Absolution</hi> by him recited? Ought he not to make good this Point by some Fact or Doctrine, by some Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or Instance of Antiquity? All the <hi>Precedents</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced are on my side, and many more might be alledged to the same purpose. So that unless the <hi>Animadverter</hi> can show that <hi>Absolution,</hi> in the more ordinary Cases, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally given without <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi>; and that, in the Opinion of the <hi>Antients,</hi> the Necessities of <hi>Dying Persons</hi> were reckoned among ordinary Cases: unless he can show this, it must follow in contradiction to what he asserts, That I have the practise of the Primitive Church for my Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>If he insists, That the Cases ought to have been proved exactly parallel: To this I answer (at present) that there is no necessity for such a Performance. For we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That the <hi>Remains</hi> of the Primitive Church, with Relation to <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> are very imperfect. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48584:3"/>
antient <hi>Liturgies</hi> are most of them lost. That little which stands upon Record, was in all likelyhood most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; by which we have reason to believe the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Instances were regulated. Churches don't use to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Solemnities of an <hi>Office</hi> upon every diversity of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. To do this without weighty Considerations, would argue Inconstancy, weaken the Notion of Authority, and introduce Disorder and Neglect. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, I shall produce some direct Proofs, That <hi>Absolution,</hi> with <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> was given in other Cases besides those of the <hi>Reconcilement of Offenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Assertion I shall endeavour to make out by three Arguments.</p>
            <list>
               <item>The first, That <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> was given <hi>before Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> made to the Church, as well as <hi>after.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, That it was applyed to those who were not under <hi>Censure.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, That <hi>private</hi> Pennance was perform'd with the same <hi>Rites</hi> with that which was <hi>publick.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1st, That <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> was given <hi>before Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> as well as <hi>after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was used at the beginning of Pennance, as a <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of <hi>Entrance</hi> into that State.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Optat.</hi> contr. <hi>Parmen.</hi> lib. 1.</note> To mention some Authorities. <hi>Optatus</hi> will afford us two Instances very full to our Purpose.</p>
            <p>This Father tells us, That the Bishops of the <hi>Donatists</hi> Faction pretended that the <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Caecilian</hi> was null because his <hi>Ordainer Foelix</hi> was a <hi>Traditor. Caecilian</hi> being willing to stifle the <hi>Schisme</hi> before it became too flagrant, very frankly offers himself to be re-ordained. Upon this <hi>Purpurius,</hi> a <hi>Donatist</hi> Bishop, out of his customary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as <hi>Optatus</hi> observes, breaks out into this Expression: <hi>Let him come, (</hi>says he<hi>) as if he was to receive</hi> Imposition of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48584:4"/>
Hands, <hi>in order to be made a Bishop, and then we will put him under Pennance with this</hi> Ceremony.<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> This Father elsewhere complains of these <hi>Schismaticks, for pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Clergy under Pennance, by</hi> Imposition of Hands: <hi>That herein they contradicted the Practise of the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>and inflicted those Punishments upon a lower Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which were not imposed on Bishops, tho' guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> And here we may see <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for <hi>Pennance,</hi> and sometimes for <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> as the Reader may be informed if he pleases.</p>
            <p>That it was given at the beginning of Pennance, may be farther proved from all those <hi>Canons</hi> which forbid <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Hands</hi> at the <hi>Degradation</hi> of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> And here I might cite several <hi>Councils</hi>; but to avoid length, I shall only produce the 11th <hi>Canon</hi> of the 5th <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage:</hi> by which 'tis decreed, <hi>That if any Priests or Deacons are convicted of any great Crimes, for which they must be Degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>: Non eis manus tanquam poenitentibus, vel tanquam Fidelibus Laicis imponatur, i.e. <hi>Let not Hands be laid on them, either as Penitents, or as Faithful Laicks.</hi> From hence I shall observe two things.</p>
            <p>First, That <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> was introductive to a Course of <hi>Pennance</hi>; and not always a Mark of Privilege and <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> as the <hi>Animadverter</hi> affirms. 'Twas sometimes the Beginning of Discipline and Sorrows, and of Exclusion from Church-Communion. So that the reason why the <hi>Canon</hi> forbids laying on of Hands upon the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy at their Degrading, is, because this <hi>Ceremony</hi> would have put them under <hi>Pennance</hi>; and Pennance, besides the rigour of the Discipline, would have barr'd them the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Communion. Now this would have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing twice for one Fault, which was contrary to the Apostles Canons, and the Practise of the Primitive Church. And therefore those Crimes which were <hi>Excommunication</hi> in the <hi>Laity,</hi> went no farther than <hi>Degradation</hi> in the <hi>Clergy.</hi> The loss of <hi>Orders</hi> being then reckon'd a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48584:4"/>
as it were, equivalent to <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I observe farther from this <hi>Canon,</hi> and bring it as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argument for the Point, That <hi>Imposition</hi> of <hi>Hands</hi> was given to the <hi>Faithful.</hi> Now the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and the <hi>Penitents,</hi> both in the Language of this <hi>Canon,</hi> and in the known sence of Antiquity, are two ranks of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians contradistinguish'd, and opposed to each other. They were distinctly plaeed in the Church, and the first were admitted to the Blessed Sacrament, and to all the Prayers and Advantages of Communion, which the other had not. Now that <hi>Imposition</hi> of <hi>Hands</hi> usually receiv'd by the <hi>Faithful,</hi> was an <hi>Absolution-Imposition,</hi> and had some <hi>Confessionary</hi> reference, I prove thus in a word. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>Imposition, &amp;c.</hi> must relate to <hi>Absolution</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation:</hi> To <hi>Confirmation</hi> it cannot, because 'tis prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Canon,</hi> by way of Moderation and Abatement of Rigour: But <hi>Confirmation</hi> was always thought a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, not a Punishment. 'Tis plain therefore by the Supposals and Implication of the <hi>Canon,</hi> that <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> was customarily given to the <hi>Faithful,</hi> that is, to those who were under no <hi>Censure</hi>; and Given them at their <hi>Absolution,</hi> upon their <hi>Confession</hi> of those <hi>Sins,</hi> which were thought too light for <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly, Private</hi> Pennance was perform'd with the same <hi>Rites</hi> with that which was <hi>Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The difference between these two consisted only in the Abatement of the Solemnity: In some circumstances which were to be perform'd by Assistance:<note place="margin">Morin. <hi>de Adm. Sacr. Poenitent.</hi> lib. 9. cap. 31.</note> But the Priest's Office was the same in both. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the first must have <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> no less than the later. Now, private Pennance was transacted between the Priest, and the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,</hi> and therefore there could be no precedent <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> to make way for such a <hi>Reconcilement,</hi> as the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48584:5"/>
               <hi>Animadverter</hi> supposes: I say, there could be no <hi>precedent</hi> Excommunication; for such a <hi>Censure</hi> does not use to be made a Secret, but passed in the Face of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Indeed, without publick notice the Censure could not be executed; the <hi>Excommunicated</hi> Person could not be treated with that Distance, not refused in Church-Correspondence, as the Punishment required.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>De Poenit. li.</hi> 8. <hi>ca.</hi> 15.</note>The Learned <hi>Morinus</hi> above-mention'd, cites <hi>Marianus Victorius,</hi> to prove, that no one was <hi>absolved</hi> without <hi>Imposition of Hands.</hi> And for this, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus</hi> quotes a <hi>Synod</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. And in his Book <hi>de Poenitentiis publicis,</hi> He affirms, That <hi>every Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution consisted of two things,</hi> i. e. <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> and <hi>Prayer. That this Imposition of Hands was twofold, Publick and Private. That is called Publick, which is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly perform'd in the Church before the Congregation. That is called Private, which is given at Home, or at any private place. Morinus</hi> brings several other Authorities to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Animadverter</hi> may please to take notice, that <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> in <hi>Absolution,</hi> was practis'd in other Cases besides those which relate to the publick <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement of Offenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Animadverter</hi> goes on, and endeavours to shew, that the Plea of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> tho' never so well furnish'd with resembling Cases, will not justifie <hi>my Proceedings in Absolving with Imposition of Hands.</hi> (Animad. pag. 6.) His Reasoning stands upon this Ground. That <hi>Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are not unalterable in their own nature, but are liable to be chang'd or abolish'd, as Circumstances require, at the discretion of every Particular or National Church.</hi> For this he cites <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the 34<hi>th Article</hi> of our own Church. I grant the <hi>Animadverter</hi> all this; but which way 'twill affect me, is not so easie to determine. I never asserted the Necessity of <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> or that <hi>Absolution</hi> was imperfect without it: Neither does
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48584:5"/>
my Practise suppose any such thing. Well! But <hi>this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is not retain'd in the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Practise of the</hi> African <hi>Church,</hi> tho' never so Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, <hi>is no sufficient Warrant; — For good Order and Vniformity require, that Particular Ministers should not make use of any Ceremonies, but what the Church and Law amongst us prescribe.</hi> (Animad. p. 7, 8.)</p>
            <p>In answer to this, I can't help taking notice of his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a <hi>Minister of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is not to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himself by the Church of</hi> Carthage,<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Sentence looks somewhat artificial, and seems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to mislead the Reader into a Belief, That <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> in <hi>Absolution,</hi> was only the Custom of St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Jurisdiction, or at most of the <hi>African</hi> Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he may please to remember, I proved the Practise <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and could have cited many more Testimonies had it been necessary. His affirming that <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> is not <hi>retained</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will not hold gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally speaking. For this <hi>Ceremony</hi> is retained both in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi>; which is a sufficient Argument of its being approved by the Church. But the Church does not retain it in her <hi>Absolutions.</hi> I grant 'tis not in the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> for that purpose. And therefore had it been used at the <hi>Daily Service,</hi> or upon any <hi>Solemn Occasion</hi> regulated by the Church, there might have been some pretence for Exception: But the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Vniformity</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the <hi>Animadverter,</hi> provide only against <hi>Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in stated, and <hi>publick Administrations.</hi> 'Tis in <hi>Churches,</hi> and Church-Appointments, that the <hi>Rubrick</hi> condemns <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> or <hi>diminishing.</hi> But this is none of the present case. For the Church has not prescrib'd us any <hi>Office</hi> for <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Every Priest is here left to his Liberty, both as to <hi>Office</hi> and Gesture, to Substance and Ceremony. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion may be all private Composition if the Confessor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And when out of respect to the Church, he selects any part of her <hi>Liturgy,</hi> tho' the Form is publick, the Choice and Occasion are private, which makes it fall under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48584:6"/>
Denomination. The selected <hi>Office</hi> in this case, is like Coyn melted into Bullion. The publick Impression is gone; and with that, the Forfeitures for Clipping, and Alloy, are gone too; and the honest Proprietor may add to the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or alter the Figure as he thinks fit. I confess, had the Church excepted against <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> in Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; Had she condemn'd the <hi>Ceremony</hi> thus applyed, and laid a <hi>General</hi> Prohibition upon it; her Members ought to govern themselves accordingly, and not to use it so much as in private: But since the Church prescribes this <hi>Rite</hi> in her <hi>Rubrick,</hi> and takes notice of it only by way of Practise and Approbation: When Matters stand thus I say, her <hi>Non-prohibition</hi> implies <hi>Allowance</hi> in private Ministrations; and in cases no ways determined by her self. For pray what is Liberty, but the Absence of Command, the Silence of Authority, and leaving things in their natural Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency? Thus the Point was understood, and practised by the famous Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> upon one of the most Solemn Occasions, and in which himself was most nearly concern'd. This eminent Casuist <hi>about a Day before his Death, desired his Chaplain Mr.</hi> Pullin, <hi>to give him Absolution: And at his performing that Office, he pull'd off his</hi> Cap, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Pullin <hi>might lay his Hand upon his bare Head.</hi>

Animad.</hi> p. 11, 12.</note> The <hi>Animadverter</hi> therefore had no reason to spend two <hi>Pages</hi> against me, as if I left too much to the Direction of the Inferiour Clergy, and paid too slender a regard to the <hi>Bishops.</hi> Did this Gentleman expect I should apply for Advice to the Bishops who set forth the late <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> He could not imagine this, if he considered what he had said himself, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. If I consulted the <hi>Heads</hi> of my own Communion, I hope 'twas sufficient. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing I did not trouble any of our <hi>dispossessed Holy Fathers</hi> with this Matter, where was the harm on't? Had I not both <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi> Precedents to direct me? Had I not the Authority of the celebrated Bishop <hi>Sanderson?</hi> Pray is the Priest obliged to consult the Bishops for Directions at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48584:6"/>
an <hi>Execution?</hi> Does the Church either in her <hi>Rubrick,</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> require such an Application? Nothing of this can be pretended. And since this Point is left to the Discretion of the Priest, and there are no stated <hi>Ceremonies</hi> prescrib'd, nor any <hi>Liturgical</hi> Forms to govern the <hi>Office</hi>; where lies the Offence of having recourse to <hi>Primitive</hi> Usage? Why may not the Confessor officiate with an antient <hi>Gesture</hi> (practis'd in other cases by his own Church;) as well as draw up a private <hi>Office,</hi> or make use of an extemporary Prayer? What reason can be assign'd why there should be less of liberty in the former, than in the latter Case? 'Tis well known the Regulation of the <hi>Penitents</hi> Conscience is left wholly to the <hi>Priest</hi>'s Conduct, both in <hi>Prison,</hi> and at the place of <hi>Execution.</hi> The Church interposes in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. Advice, and Discipline, and Devotion, lie all at dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Now the Success of the Administration depends much more upon the management of these Points, than upon any Latitudes of <hi>Gesture.</hi> And since the weightier Circumstances go at large, and are resign'd up to Trust, and Prudence, by what reasoning can we put a restraint upon the lesser? The truth is, the Church determines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the case; and <hi>where there is no Law, there can be no Transgression.</hi> If 'tis said the general Law of <hi>Decency</hi> is to be regarded: I grant it; and affirm that this Rule was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well observ'd. For the <hi>Animadverter</hi> cannot deny that <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> in <hi>Absolution,</hi> is a significant, solemn, and antient Ceremony. Besides, had there been any thing exceptionable in point of <hi>Decency,</hi> it could amount to no more than a Defect in Conduct, and a Mismanagement of Liberty. But as for any Crime, or Disobedience to <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> it can never be fairly swell'd to such an <hi>Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; because there was no breach made in any publick <hi>Order</hi> or Constitution. I don't mention this, as if the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise needed an Excuse, but only to shew the Right to such a Plea, if there had been occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48584:7"/>The <hi>Animadverter</hi> proceeds in his <hi>Articles</hi> of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and objects, That 'tis <hi>against the Practise of the Church in general, and against our own</hi> Rubrick <hi>in particular, to Absolve or assist in the Absolution of a Person, whose Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Repentance are known no otherwise than by the Testimony of others.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Animad. p. 8.</note> The first part of this Charge is only bare <hi>Affirmation,</hi> and that which brings no proof, needs no confuting: But it may be the second At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack will be better maintain'd. Here he tells us, That <hi>by the</hi> Rubrick <hi>in the Visitation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>special Confession of Sins is required, and after that, the Priests Absolution is to follow.</hi> This is all true, but I think little to his purpose. The Church advises <hi>Confession</hi> should precede <hi>Absolution:</hi> She does so, and with good reason. And here was a <hi>previous</hi> Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Instance debated. Which way then does my Practise clash with the Directions of the <hi>Rubrick?</hi> The Church for the right Application of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to the Priest the Condition of Absolution. But does she oblige the <hi>Penitent</hi> to confess to more than one? Does she make the Office of <hi>Absolution</hi> single and solitary, or forbid the Concurrence of a plurality of <hi>Presbyters?</hi> Of Presbyters invited to an Assistance by the Confessor, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with general satisfaction at the first hand? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; Silence it seems is a perpetual Equivalent to Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that which is never so much as mention'd is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways condemned! This is extraordinary arguing! Under favour, we may much better collect the sense of the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> by the Practise of resembling Cases. And here I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd both the <hi>Antient,</hi> and our <hi>own</hi> Church in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. My Instance from the Antient Church, was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Custom of admitting Strangers to <hi>Communion,</hi> by Vertue of a <hi>Certificate</hi> given by the Bishop from whence they came. To this the <hi>Animadverter</hi> makes two Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48584:7"/>First, He thinks the Proofs insufficient, because they are not particular to the Business of <hi>Absolution.</hi> Suppose they are not: If the Resemblance holds, the Proofs will do so too. Parallel Cases, and proportion of Inference, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to be thought good arguing. It stands upon this plain Ground: That all Conclusions regularly drawn from a Principle, are equally certain. And that when two Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have the same Reasons to plead, they must be equally defensible. To apply this Reasoning. Admittance to <hi>Communion,</hi> includes admittance to <hi>Absolution:</hi> And since I made it appear the Antients did the first upon the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of others, there was no need of any distinct proof for the latter. Those who were received to <hi>Communion</hi> had all the Priviledges of Church-Society. They were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Blessed Sacrament, which was always count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the highest, and most intimate Acts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Of this the <hi>Animadverter</hi> may inform himself if he pleases to consult <hi>my Albaspinaeus.</hi> Now since the Bishop's <hi>Letter</hi> gave Strangers a Right to all these Priviledges, it gave them by consequence a Right to <hi>Absolution</hi>; If <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> was made preparatory to the Sacrament, and given in other cases besides the Relaxation of <hi>Censures,</hi> which I suppose by this time the <hi>Animadverter</hi> will not deny. However,</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is loath to grant the Instances Parallel. Why so? Because the Antients <hi>never gave Certificates to such as were not personally known to them, or whose Case they were not privy to</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (Animad. <hi>p.</hi> 9.) And what follows? Why that the <hi>Animadverter</hi> has lost himself. I beseech him was not Sir <hi>William Perkins</hi> personally known to me, and was I not acquainted with his Case? Did not Sir <hi>I. Friend</hi> stand in the same Circumstances of Intimacy with Mr. <hi>Snatt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook?</hi> And if so, why might not the Testimonials be <hi>interchangeably</hi> given, and the <hi>Penitents</hi> receiv'd to <hi>reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Absolution?</hi> He must not say that our being no more than <hi>Priests,</hi> unqualified us for this Privilege. An Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Character is not always necessary for Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48584:8"/>
The <hi>Animadverter</hi> himself observes, That <hi>our Laws and Canons require, That the Person to be Ordain'd should be recommended by some approved Presbyters.</hi> So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing my improvement of his Argument, my Instance from Antiquity remains parallel to the Case in hand, and stands in full force against him. Farther. That some of the highest Functions of the Clergy might be discharg'd upon Confidence and Recommendation, I proved from our own <hi>Ordination-Office:</hi> This he is pleased to call a <hi>gross mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake</hi>; tho' no Sunshine can be clearer than the Evidence of what I affirm'd, as the <hi>Reader</hi> may see by perusing the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Animadverter</hi> is so unlucky as to confess thus much in his very Endeavours of Disproof.<note place="margin">Page 9.</note> He tells you, That <hi>Orders amongst us are never confer'd upon such as are not personally known.</hi> Pray by whom must they be personally known?<note place="margin">Animad. p. 10.</note> 
               <hi>By the Clergy who give them their Testimonials, and by the Arch-Deacon too as far as Enquiry and Examination.</hi> But what is all this to the Point? Here is no contradiction to any Assertion of mine; nor anything that condemns my Practise. To put the Question home. Is the Bishop, or the Clergy assisting at the <hi>Ordination,</hi> bound to <hi>immediate</hi> knowledge of the Life, or sufficiency of the Person <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd?</hi> This I deny: And unless the <hi>Animadverter</hi> can prove the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> he says nothing. But here he is si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and when he does speak, 'tis against himself. <hi>The Arch-Deacon</hi> (says he) <hi>is to enquire of the Candidate's Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>and to declare publickly to the Bishop, That he believes the Person presented, apt and meet for the Ministry.</hi> Now I would gladly understand, why the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> should tell the Bishop all this, if he knew it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Information always supposes Ignorance in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son inform'd, or at least that 'tis lawful for him to be so. To acquaint the Bishop with what he was bound to know by immediate Tryal, and Experiment, would be extreamly untoward. The Church don't use to trifle at this rate in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48584:8"/>
her solemn Offices. In short, the Functions of the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> are Demonstrations, that the <hi>Ordainers</hi> are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to personal Knowledge of the <hi>Ordained.</hi> This is so plain, that I'm amaz'd the <hi>Animadverter</hi> shou'd venture upon Contradiction, and entangle himself so unhappily in the Argument. Sure this Gentleman presumes very much upon the Favour, and implicit weakness of the Reader, otherwise he would never dispute in this manner! The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverter</hi> fortifies himself, and adds, That <hi>there was no Necessity for this manner of Absolution:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> For if the <hi>Confessary had given it without any Assistant it had been sufficient.</hi> This Argument stands upon a false Bottom, and supposes nothing lawful but what is necessary, than which nothing can be a greater Mistake. 'Tis true, what is not necessary <hi>may</hi> be omitted, but it does not therefore follow that it <hi>must.</hi> Religion, and common Life would make but a lean Appearance, were they stinted to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Necessity. But there needs to be no more said about this matter. A</p>
            <p n="3">3d Thing which the <hi>Animadverter</hi> fancies to be <hi>irregular,</hi> is <hi>the pronouncing Absolution in publick, when there was not any publick Confession.</hi> I am surprized the <hi>Animadverter</hi> should object this to me: Have I not told him I was deny'd the Liberty of visiting Sir <hi>William Perkins</hi> for two or three of the last Days, and that he desired to receive <hi>Absolution</hi> at my Hands? I'm sorry he forces me upon the Repetition of these Things. Farther. As to Sir <hi>William</hi>'s being privy to the intended <hi>Assassination,</hi> there was both <hi>publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> too, if he will believe the <hi>Committee.</hi> And for this Point I refer him to the <hi>Votes</hi> of <hi>Apr.</hi> 2d, and to what I have observed upon them, in my <hi>Reply to the Absolution of a Penitent,</hi> &amp;c. This is a sufficient Answer to what is objected. But because the <hi>Animadverter</hi> is so tragical and triumphant in this Paragraph, and charges me with unheard of Singularity; I shall observe to him in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48584:9"/>
the 3d place, That <hi>Absolution</hi> was sometimes <hi>publick</hi> among the Antients when <hi>Confession</hi> was <hi>private.</hi> I have already proved, That <hi>Absolution</hi> was frequently given at the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of Pennance, and the <hi>Animadverter</hi> grants it at the <hi>end</hi> of it. The proving therefore <hi>publick</hi> Pennance assign'd to <hi>private</hi> Confession, proves <hi>Absolution</hi> was publick, tho' <hi>Confession</hi> was not so. Because without <hi>Absolution,</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance could not be regularly compleated, nor the Person restored to the Peace of the Church. Now that those who confessed <hi>privately</hi> were order'd to do <hi>open</hi> Pennance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being obliged to <hi>publish</hi> their particular Miscarriages, appears from the 34th <hi>Canon</hi> of St. <hi>Basil</hi> to <hi>Amphilochius. Adulterio pollut as Mulieres &amp; confitentes ob pietatem — Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licare quidem patres nostri prohibuerunt, eas autem</hi> Stare <hi>sine Communione jusserunt donec impleretur Tempus Poenitentiae.</hi> And from the 58th <hi>Canon</hi> of this <hi>Father</hi> 'tis plain, that these Women were dispensed with in the three first Stages of Pennance. They were excused the Discipline of the <hi>Flentes, Audientes,</hi> and <hi>Substrati,</hi> and immediately ranged among the <hi>Consistentes</hi> to prevent the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Crime.<note place="margin">

I had given him several Reasons why it needed no excuse. Upon what account are they all passed over? If they are defective, he should have shown it. The <hi>Animadverter</hi> grants that this <hi>joynt</hi> Absolution, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps carries nothing of ill with it.</hi> How comes it about then to be no small <hi>Presumption,</hi> as he calls it? Is it so great a Presumption to do that which carries nothing of ill in't? Yes. In some Peoples Opinion a greater than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But the Presumption lies, it may be, <hi>in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to do a thing so unusual in the Church, without any Church-Rule,</hi> &amp;c. I have already shown this Practise not to be unusual, and justified it from <hi>Precedents</hi> of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and <hi>Parallel Cases</hi> in our own Church; and till the <hi>Animadverter</hi> can answer what I have brought, I think he <hi>presumes</hi> too far in making his Exceptions. As for any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Precedent</hi> at home, there is no necessity for that. 'Tis true, we officiated as Priests of the <hi>Church of</hi> England; but we were not tyed up to any <hi>Liturgick</hi> Rites, nor acted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any <hi>Church-Rule.</hi> The Office was private, and left at liberty. In such Circumstances, Parallel Reasonings and Warrants from Primitive Practise, are sufficient Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Where Matters are <hi>undetermined</hi> by Authority, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Opposition</hi> can make a Fault: In these cases, <hi>he that is not against</hi> the Church, <hi>is for Her.</hi> All this while I argue only for my self, tho' if any thing I have offer'd proves serviceable to Mr. <hi>Snatt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cock,</hi> I am glad of it. However I can't help thinking the <hi>Animadverter</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair in saying,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 27.</note> I <hi>speak for the rest:</hi> Since I have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared the contrary;<note place="margin">

I had rather do so, than fall short. But I mistook the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's <hi>Declaration.</hi> For they <hi>never denied that the laying on of Hands was oftentimes used by the Antients in Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>But they understood,</hi> (<hi>I presume.</hi>) And thus he presumes, and conjectures the Sense of these <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelates</hi> for a Page together: And writes more upon their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> than their <hi>Declaration.</hi> But the <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> does but <hi>presume</hi> all this while I'm glad to find he is not <hi>positive.</hi> A <hi>Parenthesis</hi> of Conscience, is better than none at all. However; with this Gentleman's Favour, I had reason to prove the <hi>Absolution</hi> unexceptionable, both with respect to <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> and the other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances mentioned in my <hi>Defence.</hi> For the Bishops were pleased to make a kind of general Assault, so that 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to guard at all Quarters. And that I did not defend my felt without an <hi>Aggressor,</hi> will appear by considering the <hi>Declaration.</hi> Here, these <hi>Reverend Prelates</hi> condemn the <hi>Absolution</hi> upon two accounts. They are pleased to say,'<hi>Twas both irregular in the Thing, and insolent in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Declar. <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>without Precedent either in our Church, or any other that we know of.</hi> To be clear. What is the <hi>Thing</hi>? The Thing, is the Absolving Sir <hi>William,</hi> and Sir <hi>John,</hi> precisely and <hi>irrespectively</hi> consider'd, without relation to Place, Ceremony, or <hi>Words.</hi> This I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd elsewhere, and so I shall leave it. But what is the <hi>Manner?</hi> The <hi>Declaration</hi> will tell you. 'Tis <hi>Absolving at the place of Execution;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Declar. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>by laying all three their Hands upon their Heads, and publickly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Form of Absolution.</hi> The <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> the joynt <hi>Absolution,</hi> the publick pronouncing <hi>a Form,</hi> are all Branches of the <hi>Manner,</hi> in the Bishop's Description. This,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48584:10"/>
these <hi>Reverend Prelates</hi> are pleas'd to condemn without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction of Censure, Distinction of Case, or Particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Circumstance. Had I not reason then to suppose their Exception <hi>general,</hi> and defend the <hi>whole?</hi> With sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, why was <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> censured in the gross, if it was not altogether disliked, or thought at least too much for any Churchman, but a Bishop? And as for the <hi>Form</hi>; if it was not a Fault, why does it appear in ill Company? Why is it brought to the <hi>Bar,</hi> and placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other exceptionable Circumstances? It wears a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected Livery, and stands with the <hi>Articles</hi> of Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any mark of Innocence, or Distinction. Yet after all. To do these <hi>Reverend Prelates</hi> justice, I don't think them averse to a <hi>Form of Absolution</hi>; neither did I affirm it. I said no more than that 'twas mention'd with <hi>seeming Coldness, and Abatements of Expression:</hi> And with submission, so I say still; and the wording of the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> proves it. So that this Remark of mine has neither <hi>Disingenuity,</hi> nor <hi>false Accusation</hi> in't, as the <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> pretends. 'Tis only a gentle <hi>Reprizal</hi> on the <hi>Declaration</hi> when it lay fair. And this I perswade my self the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelates</hi> will not take amiss, if they please to reflect on the unexpected Language I had been treated with.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Animadverter</hi> is now come to the</p>

               <hi>He would rather excuse, than aggravate my Crime,</hi> as he phrases it. Nay, for once, to be courteous, <hi>He will even force himself against his Reason.</hi> What can be more Tender and Melting, than such Expressions as these? What! Deny his Judgment out of Good Nature, and be Civil against Sense, and Reason? Who could desire a Friend to go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

And can you imagine a Gentleman of all this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony should charge me with <hi>impertinent Allegations,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce me guilty of a <hi>during piece of Insolence</hi>; call me a <hi>new-fashion'd Guide,</hi> and that <hi>I am nearest of Kin to a Church beyond the four Seas,</hi> which without doubt is some terrible one, if there be not more of them. But this is not all. He makes me an Abettor of <hi>Assassinations,</hi> and <hi>prays God I may be the last Confessary that may trouble the World in this kind:</hi> And lastly, endeavours to menace my Brethren of the Clergy, into a <hi>Protestation against my Proceedings:</hi> Which if they refuse to make, it seems they must not be allow'd to have any <hi>Honour, Conscience,</hi> or <hi>Protection</hi> either,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 7, 16, 22, 28.</note> if he can help it. Here is stark Love and Kindness for you! Was ever any Treatment more engaging, or good Humour set off with better advantage?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 16.</note> This is the gentle <hi>Animadverter,</hi> who <hi>does not love to use hard words, who hates it in others,</hi> &amp;c! This Gentleman puts me in mind of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>An Engine for</hi> Executions, <hi>in the Figure of a</hi> Woman.</note> 
               <hi>Maid</hi> of <hi>Presbourgh,</hi> who makes you a very decent Honour, and is strangely Caressing in her Gesture, when she is just going to dispatch you. 'Tis well the <hi>Animadverter</hi> has not <hi>Force</hi> for such a Complement, for he has shown his <hi>Inclination</hi> enough in all Conscience. But the best on't is, the Cause has made him kinder in his <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,</hi> than in his <hi>Language.</hi> To engage him a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 17.</note> He fancies <hi>the Absolution was intended to be publick.</hi> How does the <hi>Animadverter</hi> make out this? Because <hi>I</hi> had <hi>inform'd him that Mr.</hi> Ashton <hi>was publickly Absolved at the same place, and in the same manner</hi>; and as he adds, <hi>by a Non-jurant Minister.</hi> Granting all this, what follows? It seems it follows, That <hi>he that seriously considers this, will be very apt to believe that it was the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Non-jurant Clergy to Absolve their Friends in that manner.</hi> Some People are very apt to <hi>believe,</hi> and to <hi>say</hi> too, more than is necessary: And 'tis not always either E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48584:11"/>
or good Nature that makes them so forward. Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi> was publickly Absolved by a <hi>Non-jurant</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man, therefore all the Clergy of that Perswasion, have concerted a Resolution to Absolve their Friends in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! Where is the Consequence of this? <hi>One</hi> did it <hi>once,</hi> therefore <hi>all</hi> must do it <hi>always!</hi> Are all these <hi>Non-jurant</hi> Churchmen of a Mind in everything? Are they so much resign'd to any single Authority, or so unalterably bound up to <hi>Precedent,</hi> as not to leave themselves a <hi>Latitude</hi> for Time and Occasion? Such lame Conjectures as these, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into Accusation, are no generous Indications. He that charges so high as the <hi>Animadverter,</hi> certainly ought to prove his point a little more home. The <hi>Animadverter</hi> asks me,<note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Why I will not reveal any part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession?</hi> I conceive he might have given himself an Answer. I had told him, I was not obliged to reveal it; and what I was not obliged to <hi>reveal,</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me not to <hi>reveal.</hi> Had I done otherwise, I had been pronounced <hi>Irregular,</hi> been false to Trust, and Confidence; betray'd and discouraged <hi>Confession:</hi> I had been guilty of a Practise both dishonourable, and unconscientious, and deeply censured by <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as well as our <hi>own Church.</hi> This Plea,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 21.</note> 
               <hi>had it any thing to support it,</hi> the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter</hi> owns <hi>would be the best Argument.</hi> He means, I suppose, 'twould be a good one, and justifie the whole Practise. And which way does he prove it unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported? Why, he wonders at it, and makes a strong Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and asks a foreign Question or two, and falls into a fit of Satyr, and so takes his leave: But as for engaging the main difficulty, and proving the Case <hi>exempted</hi> by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> he desires your Excuse. This is the <hi>Animadverter</hi>'s gentle way of confuting the <hi>best Argument</hi>; and you may guess at the reason of his <hi>Civility.</hi> And, tho' the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter</hi> has not answer'd what I offerd in my two first <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>; yet if he pleases to see this matter treated more at large, he may consult my <hi>Reply to the Absolution of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48584:12"/>
&amp;c. Which, tho' written before, was published some few Days after his <hi>Animadversions.</hi> The <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is offended,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 23.</note> because we <hi>did not conceal the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution from the People.</hi> How could that be at a publick <hi>Execution?</hi> Would he have had us <hi>Whisper'd</hi> over the <hi>Office,</hi> as if it had been <hi>Treason,</hi> as 'twas in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Time, to pray to <hi>GOD Almighty?</hi> Had this Method been taken, the Charity of some of the Audience might have said we had <hi>mutter'd</hi> a <hi>Charm,</hi> or at least, made use of a Form of <hi>that Church on the other side the four Seas.</hi> But we were to blame for letting <hi>all the Hearers know it to be an Absolution.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That's strange! He supposes the People to <hi>hear</hi> the Form pronounc'd, and yet they must not <hi>understand</hi> it! I perceive the <hi>Animadverter</hi> is for <hi>Prayers</hi> in an <hi>unknown Language,</hi> otherwise his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient is impracticable. After all; why so <hi>private</hi> in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and warrantable Action? Why should Innocence and Regularity be <hi>afraid</hi> of <hi>Notice</hi> and <hi>Observation?</hi> I have shown the Office in all respects defensible: And had no reason when I was in a <hi>publick</hi> place, to perform it in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious</hi> and <hi>clancular</hi> manner.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But <hi>by pronouncing the Absolution, we look'd upon the Fact as no Sin:</hi> Just on the contrary. He may be assured if we had not believ'd some <hi>Facts</hi> of those Gentlemen to have been <hi>sins,</hi> we had never <hi>Absolv'd</hi> them. For Innocence stands in no need of Forgiveness. But what these <hi>Facts</hi> were, I can never tell him. He insists farther; That <hi>if Sir</hi> William <hi>died a Penitent, and I A<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Page 27.</note> I have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied this point in my <hi>Reply,</hi> &amp;c. and thither I refer the <hi>Animadverter.</hi> There the <hi>Reader</hi> also may see his <hi>State-Objections</hi> answer'd more at large; my Adversary in that <hi>Paper</hi> having proposed the chief of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
