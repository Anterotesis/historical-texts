            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Intend, God willing, to publish in a
little time, a full Answer to <hi>J.S.</hi> his
<hi>Catholick Letters,</hi> so far as I am
concerned in them. In the mean while, <hi>I</hi>
thought it not unfit to Print this Sermon
I lately Preached, that I might give a
General View of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as to the Way of conveying Matters
of Faith, before I come to the particular
Debate with <hi>J.S.</hi> Wherein I do not
doubt, but I shall be able to shew that we have
ry good Grounds for the Certainty of our
Faith, and that they have none either
as to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Tradition,</hi> as to the
main Points in Controversie between us.</p>

            <p>nestly as he doth to them? Must we think, as some do,
that he uses these Expressions as gentle <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
and commends them for that, which he would
perswade them to? But this doth not seem agreeable to
the Apostles <hi>simplicity and godly sincerity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> which he else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
sets such a value upon. But it is far more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that hitherto they had been very <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>stedfast:</hi>
but <hi>Epaphras</hi> going to St. <hi>Paul</hi> had informed him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their condition, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were like a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
closely besieged on all sides; and although hitherto
they had held out with great Courage, yet he did not
know what earnest Sollicitations, and fair Promises,
and tempting Motives might do with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle writes this Epistle to encourage
them in their <hi>stedfastness,</hi> and to warn them against
Temptations. Which he doth in such a manner, as shews,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That he had a more than ordinary Apprehension of
the danger they were in.</hi> And this I say, <hi>saith he,</hi> lest any
man should beguile you with enticing words, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and beware
lest any man spoil you with Philosophy and vain deceit, after
the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the World, and
not after Christ, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Let no man beguile you of your reward
in a voluntary humility and worshipping of Angels, <hi>&amp;c. v. 18.
All which expressions do imply, that he had just reason
to fear and to give them caution in time, that while they
did yet</hi> think that they stood, they should take heed lest they
fall.</p>
            <p>And this is that which the Apostle aims at in the words
of the Text; <hi>As ye have therefore received Christ Iesus the
Lord, so walk ye in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Receiving Christ Iesus the Lord, <hi>doth not here relate
to his</hi> Person, <hi>but to his</hi> Authority, <hi>and to his</hi> Doctrine;
<hi>so the Apostle himself explains it in the next verse,</hi> rooted
and built up in him, and established in the Faith, as ye have
been taught.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97983:3"/>
               <hi>Walking in him</hi> is an Eastern way of speaking and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
both an adhering to that Faith they had then
received, and living according to it, looking on Christ
and his Doctrine, as their <hi>only way</hi> to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as ye had received him, so walk ye in him,</hi> implies that
the manner of their receiving Christ and his Doctrine at
first was different from that which the false Apostles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to bring in among them, and that they were
bound to keep close to that pure and Primitive Doctrine
which they at <hi>first</hi> received.</p>
            <p>From hence we may consider a double Obligation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>To keep stedfast to that Faith which they first received,</hi>
without being seduced from it by the Arts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
who were then busie among them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To live according to it,;</hi> by making that <hi>Faith</hi> the
Principle of a Christian Life; and so <hi>walking in him, as
they have received him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to the former, the Reasonableness of it cannot
but appear from the supposition here made, <hi>viz. that they
had received Christ Iesus the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, thereby they declared, that <hi>they received him as the
Christ, i. e.</hi> as him who was anointed of the Father to
Teach and Instruct his Church; and therefore they were
bound to adhere to his Doctrine; there being no other,
whom <hi>the Father hath sealed</hi> and appointed to declare
his Will;<note place="margin">Col. 2. 3.</note> and <hi>in him were hid all the Treasures of Wisdom
and Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They received him <hi>as Christ Iesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 14.</note> that is, they <hi>hoped
for Redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveness of sins.</hi>
And if their hopes of Heaven depended upon his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they had the greatest Reason to adhere only to
him.</p>
            <p>They received him <hi>as Christ Iesus the Lord,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought to submit to his Authority, to obey
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97983:4"/>
his Commands, and to observe his Institutions, and in
all Circumstances of Life to keep stedfast to the Doctrine
which he delivered.</p>
            <p>But here arises the great Difficulty, how they should
know by any Certain Rule, what was the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Doctrine of Christ, which himself delivered? For,</p>
            <p>1. The false Teachers among them pretended to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the true Doctrine of Christ as well as the Apostles.</p>
            <p>2. That which they at first received was no certain
Rule. For the false Teachers might have been before
them. And first Possession gives no Title in Religion.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not put the whole Tryal meerly
upon their Judgments or Memories, or Capacities; <hi>viz.</hi>
What they thought, or remembred was at first taught
them for the Doctrine of Christ.</p>
            <p>For, it was very possible for them to have mistaken,
or to have mis-remembred, what was at first delivered.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more weak than to imagine that the
Judgments of People in matters of Faith, must be
formed according to the skill and excellency of their
Teachers. For the hearers of Christ himself; <hi>although
he spake as never Man spake,</hi> yet did very often mistake
his meaning. Aud at one time so remarkably, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he took care to rectify their misapprehension,
yet it is said,<note place="margin">John 6. 66.</note> 
               <hi>From that time many of his Disciples went back
and walked no more with him.</hi> So that the highest infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the Teachers, doth not prevent the possibility,
or the danger of mistaking in the hearers. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
any vainly pretend, nothing can do it, but <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing</hi>
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> into all.</p>
            <p>If we look over the <hi>Apostolical Churches</hi> while they were
under the Care and Conduct of an <hi>Infallible Spirit;</hi> yet
this did not prevent their running into great errours and
mistakes, as appears by the Account we have of them,
given by that Spirit which cannot deceive in the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Writings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97983:4"/>
In the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, even at that time, when
<hi>its Faith was spoken of throughout the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note> yet there
were dissensions and differences there, and such as were
<hi>contrary to the Doctrine</hi> which was delivered. And
St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids them <hi>to mark such which caused them;</hi>
               <note place="margin">16. 17.</note> he doth
not say, it was impossible for them to introduce any
thing <hi>contrary to the Doctrine</hi> which they had learned by
<hi>Tradition</hi> from the Apostles; but he not only supposes it
very possible, but he bids them have a particular Eye to
them, lest they should be deceived by them.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was <hi>planted by</hi> Paul, <hi>and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by</hi> Apollos; and there were Disciples of <hi>Cephas and of
Christ himself.</hi> And yet in the midst of so many Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Teachers, they had like to have lost all their Faith;
as one of them tells them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>How say some among you there
is no Resurrection of the dead?</hi>
               <note place="margin">12. 14.</note> 
               <hi>And if Christ be not risen,
then is our Preaching vain, and your Faith is also vain.</hi>
Could not they remember to day what was taught them
yesterday, and so what the Apostles at first preached to
them?</p>
            <p>The Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> had such an opinion of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 14.</note> upon his first preaching the Gospel among them,
<hi>that they received him as an Angel of God, even as Christ
Iesus;</hi> yet presently after he saith, <hi>am I therefore become
your Enemy beause I tell you the Truth?</hi>
               <note place="margin">16.</note> What! <hi>Of an Angel
of God,</hi> or of one received <hi>as Christ Iesus,</hi> to <hi>become their
Enemy,</hi> and that <hi>upon</hi> the most unjustifiable account, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he told them the Truth!</hi> But, where truth can make
Enemies, errours may easily gain Friends. And so we
find it was in the Apostolical Churches, even under the
Conduct and Teaching of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Colossians</hi> were not yet so far gone; but they were
in such danger, that the Apostle writes this Epistle with
great concernment for them. He tells them <hi>v. 1. he had</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97983:5"/>
a sharp <hi>Conflict</hi> in his own mind about them.<note place="margin">Ch. 1. v. 7. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 12.</note> 
               <hi>They had not
yet seen his Face in the Flesh,</hi> being converted by some
sent by him, of whom <hi>Epaphras</hi> is most taken notice of;
but he was present <hi>with them in Spirit, v. 5. i. e.</hi> He was
deeply affected with their Condition; for he understood
the Designs and Artifices of the Seducers among them.
He knew what fair and plausible pretences they had;
<hi>viz.</hi> that they went about not to undermine Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but to advance it, by taking in some Jewish Customs,
and some Gentile Observances, and Modes of Worship
which might easily be Accommodated to the Christian
Doctrine; and so a great deal of the Ammosities both of
the <hi>Iews</hi> and Heathens would be removed; and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
would thereby gain more Friends, and meet with
fewer Enemies.</p>
            <p>The Apostle finding how necessary it was at this time,
if possible, to keep them <hi>Stedfast in the Faith,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He assures them, that the Christian Doctrine was
of it self so sufficient for the good of Mankind, that it
needed no Additions, either from the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or
the Philosophy of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which might introduce
several things, with a specious Appearance of <hi>Wisdom,
Humility</hi> and <hi>Mortification;</hi> but they ought to be assured,
that from Christ they had all that was necessary or useful
for Salvation;<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> 
               <hi>For in him are hid all the Treasures of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That this Doctrine was at first truly delivered to
them, and they ought to be stedfast in it; which is the
design of the Text.</p>
            <p>But they might object, that <hi>Epaphras</hi> was no Apostle of
Christ himself; and if he were, yet there were many
Apostles, and the false Apostles pretended to be true
ones; and although St. <hi>Paul</hi> interposed his Authority;
yet he was but one, and the <hi>Iudaizers</hi> would not yield to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97983:5"/>
it, but were ready to suggest, that the other Apostles
were more favourable to the Jewish Customs than he;
and therefore it was necessary some more general and
common Rule be found out, whereby to distinguish the
Original and Genuine Doctrine of Christ from that of
Pretenders and Seducers.</p>
            <p>The clearing of this is in it self a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
and not only was to those of that Age, but is so
in every Age of the Christian Church, where the same
Question may be put: What was the true Primitive
Doctrine of Christ; and by what means may we come
to it? which concerns us this day as well as them.</p>
            <p>And the Answer lay in two particulars, which I shall
endeavour to clear.</p>
            <p>1. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>2. That which they have left in their Writings, after
it came to be contested which was the true Doctrine of
Christ.</p>
            <p>3. That which the Apostles did in common deliver to
the Churches planted by them. For, we have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the World to believe, that the Apostles delivered
one and the same Faith to all the Churches; having the
same Infallible Spirit to direct them. There was no need
for them <hi>to meet together before their dispersion, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
upon some common Articles of Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Russia. in Symbol.</note> as <hi>Russinus</hi> imagins,

the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as to matters of Doctrine: And if
there had been, it would have rendred the Faith they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
more suspitious, in that they durst not trust par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Persons with delivery of it, without an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

cerning him; and <hi>the Disciples</hi> when they first heard him
<hi>were amazed;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9. 13 21.</note> after this, he took a course by himself,
and did not go up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the College of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
there resident,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 17.</note> but went into <hi>Arabia;</hi> so that, if any
one might be thought to set up another Doctrine, it was
he; but he was so far from it, that he established and
confirmed the truth of what they delivered, and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
successful in his Apostleship in all places. And when
there had been some whispers concerning him, as though
he proceeded not in the same way with the rest, he went
up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there upon full examination, James
<hi>and</hi> Cephas,<note place="margin">2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>who were the leading Apostles, gave
him the right hand of Fellowship;</hi> in token of their full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the same Faith.</p>
            <p>2. The truth of the Gospel was the more plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>All this while, the <hi>Apostles</hi> only preached and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their Doctrine to the several Churches by verbal
Instructions; but after these had been received in the
hearts of such multitudes, that there could be no suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that a false Representation of Christs Doctrine or
Actions could be received by those Churches, then the
Wise Providence of God took care for Posterity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
several Persons in distant Places and Times to write
the History of our Saviour. And there was this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Church that the <hi>Gospels</hi> were written no
sooner. For all the Churches planted by the Apostles,
were then made Judges whether the Gospels written
were agreeable to the Doctrine which the Apostles had
taught; and if not, there would have been just reason to
have question'd either the Truth of what had been taught
them, or what was delivered in the Gospels.</p>
            <p>But when they found the main to be fully consonant
to what they had been taught, the Testimony of every
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97983:6"/>
one of these Churches did shew the concurrence of all
the Apostles, as to the Doctrine contained in the several
Gospels.</p>
            <p>And that which adds to the strength of this proof is,
that when the true Gospels were written, there were
several false and counterfeit <hi>Gospels</hi> dispersed abroad, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Names of the Apostles themselves. As of St. <hi>Peter</hi>
St. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euseb. Hist. l. 3. c. 25.</note> St. <hi>Matthias,</hi> and others; as <hi>Eusebius</hi> informs
us; and as we have the genuine <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> so
there were the pretended <hi>Acts of</hi> Paul, <hi>of</hi> Andrew <hi>and</hi>
John, and the other Apostles. How came these to be
rejected, and the other to be carefully received? Here
lies the true Advantage of <hi>Original Tradition</hi> before the
<hi>written Gospels,</hi> that by it the several Churches were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to pass a true judgment concerning them when
they came to be dispersed among them. For they could
presently tell, whether what they read were agreeable
to what they had heard and received from the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
As suppose the Gospel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> being published
in <hi>Iudea,</hi> were carried into <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> or <hi>Persia,</hi> where
many Christian Churches were very early planted; these
being throughly instructed by the <hi>Apostles</hi> in all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Life, Death, Resurrection and Doctrine of
Christ, could presently judge whether St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
agreed with what they had heard or not, and the
like holds as to all the Churches in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.
So that the Consent of the Churches so soon, while the
memory of the Apostles Doctrine was so fresh in their
minds, is in effect the consent of <hi>all the Apostles</hi> who
taught them.</p>
            <p>And this is very different from the case of particular
Persons in some Churches, who might mistake or forget
what was taught; for this is a concurrent testimony of
all the Apostolical Churches, who could not agree to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97983:7"/>
an error in the Gospels contrary to the Faith deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to them. And that while some of the Apostles
were still living. For the other Gospels were received
and approved, before St. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his.</p>
            <p>The case had been far otherwise, if no <hi>Gospels</hi> had
been written in that Age; for then it might have been
suspected, that either the Impressions of the first Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
were worn out, or they had been by degrees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
from their first Apprehensions by the cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
of those who lay in wait to deceive them.</p>
            <p>After the decease of the Apostles, the common Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Apostolical Churches</hi> was useful in these
cases;</p>
            <p>1. To convey down the Authentick Writings of the
Apostles or Evangelists, which were delivered to any of
them.</p>
            <p>2. To bear Testimony against any pretended Writings,
which were not first received by the <hi>Apostolical Churches</hi>
to which they were said to be written. For there can
be no Negative Testimony of more force than that; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
improbable to the utmost degree that such a Church
should not know, or not make known any true <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Writings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To overthrow any pretence to a secret Tradition
from the <hi>Apostles</hi> different from what was seen in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Writings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iren. l. 3. c. 3. 4.</note> And to this purpose <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
make very good use of the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical
Churches</hi> against the pretenders to such a <hi>Tradition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul. de Praescript. Haer.</note> which
those Churches were not acquainted with.</p>
            <p>But they agree that the Apostles committed <hi>the same
Doctrine to Writing which they preached, and that it might
be a Foundation and Pillar of Faith;</hi> that this Doctrine
was contained in the <hi>four Gospels;</hi> and that the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Churches did receive them from those who first
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97983:7"/>
wrote them, and that within the compass of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Age.</p>
            <p>It was therefore most agreeable to the Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God in providing for a constant Establishment
of the Faith of his Church in all Ages, neither to permit
the Gospels to be written till the Churches were planted,
nor to be put off to another Generation. For, then it
would have been plausibly objected; <q>if these things are
true, why were they not recorded, when there were
Persons living who were best able to have either proved,
or confuted them? Then we might have been satisfyed
one way or other; but now the <hi>Iews</hi> are dead, and
the Apostles are dead; and although there are many
left who believe their Doctrine, yet this can never
reach to the Testimony of those who saw and heard
the things themselves, or whose Doctrine was attested
by those who did so.</q> And this is now the mighty
Advantage of the Church ever since that the things
concerning Christ were written by such Persons. With
what another kind of Authority do those words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
our Assent,<note place="margin">1 John 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>That which was from the beginning,
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,
which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of
the Word of Life; For the life was manifested, and we have
seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that Eternal Life,
which was with the Father, and was manifest unto us, that
which we have seen and heard declare we unto you;</hi> then if
all the Testimony concerning Christ were to be resolved
into those who heard some say, that others told them,
they had it from such, who saw those who conversed with
them who saw Christ in the Flesh? At such a distance
the Authority of a Testimony is extremely lessen'd;
which is not like a River which grows greater by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97983:8"/>
but like a Mineral Water which loses its strength
by being carried too far. We find in the time of <hi>Papias</hi>
who lived but in the second Century, the Authority of
bare Tradition was mightily sunk;<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist l. 3. c. 39.</note> For, <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith,
<hi>he conversed with the Disciples of our Lord and his Apostles,</hi>
he saith of himself, <hi>that he went up and down to them to
get what he could from them, having a greater esteem of
what he could learn from them than of what was written.</hi> And
what Advantage did this bring to the Church? <hi>It brought
some idle opinions into reputation,</hi> saith <hi>Eusebius;</hi> for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they thought it enough to fix them upon <hi>Papias.</hi>
But how was it possible for him to mistake? <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith,
<hi>that being a Man of mean capacity, he might easily misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the meaning of what was spoken.</hi> But if Tradition might
fail after such a manner so near the Apostles times; then
we must be assured of the <hi>Capacity</hi> as well as <hi>Integrity</hi> of
those of every Age through whom a Tradition passed,
or else they might deceive, or be deceived about it.</p>
            <p>But God was pleased to provide better for the security
of our Faith, by causing the Gospels to be written ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Apostles themselves, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> or by the Disciples of the chief Apostles, while
the others were surviving, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke;</hi> and
the latter gives this account of his undertaking to write
it,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 4.</note> viz. <hi>That thou mighest know the certainty of those things
wherein thou hast been instructed.</hi> His instruction was by
an Oral Tradition; but that it seems wanted something
to strengthen and confirm it; and that was by St. <hi>Lukes</hi>
writing his Gospel. How could they add any assurance
to him, if all the ground of his certainty were to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from Tradition? St. <hi>Luke</hi> thought it necessary then,
that those things which concerned the Life and Doctrine
of Christ should be put into Writing, that they might
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97983:8"/>
be more certainly convey'd; and that while they had
the Testimony of those, <hi>who were eye-witnesses and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And so I come to the second Rule of discerning the
Primitive Doctrine of Christ; <hi>viz.</hi> The Writings of the
Apostles, when matters of Doctrine came to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
were the Infallible Rule, whereby they were to
judge, which was the true and genuine Doctrine of
Christ.</p>
            <p>There are some who pretend, that the Apostles Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
were meerly <hi>Accidental and Occasional</hi> things, but that
the main design was to lodge the great Assurance of the
Doctrine of Christ in <hi>Tradition</hi> from one to another;
and what they wrote was not to make any <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi>
but only to give some good Advice to those Churches
they wrote to.</p>
            <p>But I shall now prove that the Writings of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
were intended by the Holy Ghost to be a <hi>standing
Rule,</hi> whereby the Church was to judge which was the
true and genuine Doctrine of Christ.</p>
            <p>1. From the Reasons and Occasions of writing the
<hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to the <hi>Gospels,</hi> we must distinguish the <hi>General
Reason</hi> of writing them, from the <hi>particular Occasions</hi> as
to the several Gospels. The <hi>General Reason</hi> is to be drawn
from the Divine Wisdom which inspired and guided
them; the particular <hi>Occasions</hi> relate to the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of writing them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97983:9"/>
               <hi>The</hi> General Reason <hi>is that which</hi> Irenaeus <hi>gives,</hi>

That the Gospel which they had first preached, was by the

of it, <hi>which</hi> Fevardentius <hi>yields, and thereby over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the Infallibility of</hi> Oral Tradition; <hi>but that so it
may be a certain Rule of Faith to all Ages. The</hi> Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists

Evangelists,<note place="margin">l. 2. c. 53.</note> as to the order and manner of their Writing.
<hi>Which varied according to the particular Occasions, but

Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 31.</note> 
               <hi>the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life
through his Name.</hi> Why <hi>written that ye might believe?</hi>
Did the Apostle in his old Age mistrust the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
or the Memories of Christians? Was not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Teaching sufficient to keep up the Principles of the
Christian Faith in the hearts of the people; no, not
while St. <hi>Iohn</hi> himself was yet living? He had certainly
a very mean Opinion of Tradition, that thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for him to write that they might believe that <hi>Iesus
is the Son of God.</hi> For there was no point of Faith more
necessary than this, which was required of all Persons to
be owned before Baptism.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, and whatever else can be said, St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
thought it necessary <hi>that these things be written that
they
might believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He lived the longest of any of the Apostles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saw how little Tradition was to be trusted; for it
was already corrupted in so weighty a point as the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and his Followers allow'd the general Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, that <hi>Iesus was the Son of God;</hi> but
then they gave their own sense of it, by extraordinary
Favour and Adoption.<note place="margin">Hierom. Proem. in Matth. De Script. Eccles.</note> And from hence the Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> took occasion to write his Divine Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
to clear this Fundamental point of the Christian
Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:97983:10"/>

chiefly on the Actions of Christ for one year,<note place="margin">Epiph. H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

that so the Church might be furnished with a full Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the Faith of Christians.</p>
            <p>2. As to the <hi>Epistles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first <hi>Epistle</hi> we read of in the Christian Church,
(and in probability the first writing in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
was the <hi>Decretal Epistle</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>What should make the Apostles put these Decrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Writing? They were very short, and concerned the
practices of Men, and withal were sent by <hi>Barnabas</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Silas.</hi> Were not these sufficient to
deliver the Apostles sense to the Churches, without Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from them? What a pitiful thing did they take
Oral Tradition to be, if they thought such Men could
not by it give full satisfaction to the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi>
and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> unless they sent it under their hands?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> was written by St. <hi>Paul</hi> on
purpose to clear some main points of the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which were then warmly disputed between the
Jews and the Christians, and between the Judaizing
Christians and others, as about <hi>Iustification, Rejection of
the Iews,</hi> the <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>Meats,</hi> &amp;c. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> took
very needless pains in writing that excellent Epistle, if
he knew of Christs appointing a <hi>Iudge of Controversies</hi>
there; or if he thought Writing were not a certain way to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97983:11"/>
make a Rule of Faith, whereby they were to judge in
those matters.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was written not
meerly to reprove their Factions and Disorders; but to
direct them, and to establish and prove the Faith of the
<hi>Resurrection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 2.</note> which was then contested among them. The
<hi>Epistle</hi> was sent by <hi>Stephanus</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> who could
have carried the Apostles sense without his Writing; but
there are many weighty things, besides the particular
occasions which are of lasting concernment to the Church
in all Ages; as there are likewise in his second Epistle to
them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians</hi> was written on occasion
of one of the greatest points of controversy at that time,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Use and Obligation of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And
St. <hi>Paul</hi> sound by sad experience among them, that it
was very possible for those who had the best Instructions,
either to forget them, or to grow out of Love with them,
and to be fond of a change; else he would never have
said,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> O <hi>foolish</hi> Galatians, <hi>who hath bewitched you that ye
should not obey the Truth?</hi> And <hi>I marvel that ye are so soon
removed from him that called you into the Grace of Christ
into another Gospel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. 6.</note> How was it indeed possible for
them to be <hi>removed,</hi> and to be soon <hi>removed,</hi> who had
received the Faith by the Delivery of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself?
Then, for all that I can see, human Nature taken with
all its Advantages and Motives, and Evidences, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sallible thing; and if then it might be deceived, and
that so easily and grosly; then much more in any follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Age of the Church; unless human Nature be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
changed for the better, since the Apostles times; or
any Teachers since be more effectual, than the Apostles,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10.</note>
and especially than <hi>St.</hi> Paul, <hi>who laboured more abundantly
than they all.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>The</hi> Epistle <hi>to the</hi> Ephesians, <hi>though written upon a
general Argument, yet doth suppose that they were in
continual danger of being deceived;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 14.</note> and tossed up and
down, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the
sleight of Men, and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
wait to deceive.</p>
            <p>And therefore he advises them to be upon their guard,
and to have their Armour about them, and one choice
part of it,<note place="margin">6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>is the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word

            <p>The <hi>Philippians</hi> were assaulted by a rude, violent,
head-strong Faction of Judaizers;<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 2.</note> which the Apostle
bids them to beware of; and writes his Epistle to them
for that purpose, and he exhorts them <hi>to stand fast in
one Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. 27.</note> 
               <hi>with one mind striving together for the Faith of
the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and in both
Epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 3.</note> he gives notice of a great Defection
from the Christian Faith; he describes the manner of it,
<hi>that it shall be with signs and lying words, and with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveableness
of unrighteousness in them that perish,</hi>
               <note place="margin">10.</note> 
               <hi>because
they received not the love of the truth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>that they shall speak
lies in hypocrisie, and forbid to marry, and command to abstain
from meats,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>being evil men, having a form of godliness, and
denying the power of it.</hi> I meddle not now with the time
when this Apostacy began; but from hence, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> supposed, that those who at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Christian Faith by Tradition from the Apostles
themselves, might notwithstanding through their own
weakness and folly, and the Artifices of Deceivers be
drawn from it; and that to prevent such mischievous
consequences, he knew no better means than a Written
Rule,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16, 17.</note> which he tells <hi>Timothy was able to make him wise to
Salvation; and to make the Man of God perfect, throughly
furnished to every good Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97983:12"/>
And to name no more, the <hi>Colossians</hi> were set upon by
some who thought to refine Christianity; or at least to
make it more passable in the World, and therefore would
have introduced into it some Rites of the Jews, some
Austerities of the Gentiles, some ways of Worship which
would recommend them to their Adversaries; and upon
this occasion he writes this Epistle to them to convince
them that Christianity alone was far beyond any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Fancies or Traditions of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could give them no better Advice, than as they
had first received the Doctrine of Christ to continue in it,
or in the words of the Text, <hi>As they had received Christ
Iesus the Lord so to walk in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The design of what I have said is, that although the
<hi>Gospels</hi> and <hi>Epistles</hi> were written upon particular <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi>
yet those <hi>occasions</hi> were so great and considerable;
and the Assistance of the Holy Ghost did so direct the
Hands and Pens of the Evangelists and Apostles in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, that what they have therein delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a compleat Rule of the true and genuine Faith, as
it was at first delivered to the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But against this, it is objected,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself
charged the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> to stand fast and hold the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they have been taught either by word or by his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 15.</note>
From whence it appears, that there were other Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be held, that were not written.</p>
            <p>The force of all this will be taken away, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
when that Epistle was written; <hi>viz.</hi> one of the first
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, and soon after the former Epistle
to the <hi>Thessalonians;</hi> which was some time before
St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel, which was first received in the Churches
of <hi>Greece</hi> planted by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Therefore all the proper
Doctrine of Christ himself, and all that relates to his
Life and Actions were then but Traditions among them;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97983:12"/>
and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> had great Reason then to require
them <hi>to stand fast to the Traditions they had been taught;
i. e.</hi> to the Doctrine of Christ they had received in that
manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is urged,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bell. de verbo. l. 4. c. 5.</note> that he mentions before, something he
had said about Antichrists coming when he was with
them, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>If this be allow'd, it will be more against than for
<hi>Tradition.</hi> For, what is become of that <hi>Tradition?</hi> If it
be lost, then it follows that <hi>Tradition</hi> is no <hi>Infallible Way</hi>
of conveyence; and therefore we have more Reason to
adhere to a written word.</p>
            <p>2. Which leads us to the second Reason from which
I designed to prove, that there ought to be a written
Rule for discerning true primitive Christianity; and
that is from <hi>the notorious uncertainty of meer Tradition.</hi> I
say, <hi>notorious,</hi> because there never was any Tryal made of
it, but it failed, even when it had the greatest Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>I might insist upon the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the first Ages of
the World; when mens Lives were so long, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Natural Religion so few; and yet both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after the Flood, mankind was strangely dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
from them.</p>
            <p>I might insist on many instances in the first Ages of
the Christian Church; so many, that scarce one can be
produced wherein they pleaded meer Tradition, but they
were mistaken in it; As about the <hi>Millennium,</hi> the <hi>Age of
Christ,</hi> the <hi>time of</hi> Easter (on one side or other) the
<hi>Communicating Infants.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. de Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat Meritis. l. 1. c. 4.</note> For St. <hi>Augustin</hi> quotes <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Tradition</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>But I shall wave all these, and only mention a very
necessary and important thing, which was a long time
trusted to <hi>Tradition,</hi> and yet they differ'd so much about
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97983:13"/>
it, as evidently proved, that meer Tradition was no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Means of conveyance. And that is about the
<hi>Apostles Creed</hi> which was to be repeated by all that were
to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>We have many plain Testimonies to prove, that this
was not to be written; but to be conveyed from one
to another, by an <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>These things I mention, not in the least to shake the
Faith of the Articles of the <hi>Apostles Creed;</hi> which<note n="o" place="margin">De Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo ad Catech. c. 1.</note> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
saith <hi>was gathered out of Scriptures,</hi> and is agreeable
to them; but to shew what an uncertain way of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
meer Oral Tradition is, when a thing so easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
so constantly used, of so much weight and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97983:14"/>
consequence fell into such varieties in the greatest. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
while they were so scrupulous about the writing
of it.</p>
            <p>What cause have we then to be thankful to God, that
hath taken so much care of his Church, as to provide us
an Infallible Written Rule in the Holy Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we certainly know, what the true Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
was, which was delivered by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</p>
            <p>But here is a great difficulty to be removed, as to the
Written Word.</p>
            <p>How can we be certain, we have it, if not by Tradition?
and if Tradition be so uncertain, how can we be made certain
by it, that we have that written Word which the Apostles deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered?
For might not that fail in this, as well as the Creed?
And then what security can we have for our Faith?</p>
            <p>In Answer to this, I shall shew,</p>
            <p>1. What Advantage things that are written have, as
to the certainty of conveyance above things meerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Memory and Tradition.</p>
            <p>2. What Advantage the Scriptures have, above any
other things committed to Writing as to the certainty of
their conveyence.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Advantage things Written have above
those committed to Memory and Tradition only. Which
will appear by these things,</p>
            <p>1. It was the way God himself made choice of, where
the Reason for Tradition was stronger; I mean as to the
Ten Commandments, which were short and plain, and
easy to be remembred, and very agreeable to the Sense
and General Interest of Mankind; yet the Wise God
who perfectly understood the Nature of Man, would not
leave the Ten Commandments to an Oral Tradition, but
God delivered to <hi>Moses</hi> Two Tables of Stone written
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97983:14"/>
with the Finger of God;<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 10. 10. 4.</note> and on them he wrote the Ten
Commandments. What a vain and superstuous thing
were this, if Oral and Practical Tradition were Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
But Gods own pitching upon this way, after so long
a Tryal of Mankind in the other; is a Demonstration of
the greater certainty of it, if we suppose that God aimed
at the benefit of Mankind by it.</p>
            <p>2. When Religion was corrupted among the Jews,
the only way of restoring it was by a Written Book of
the Law.</p>
            <p>As we find in the case of <hi>Iosiahs</hi> Reformation, which
was made by the Book of the Law,<note place="margin">2 Kings 22. 8. 23. 2, 3.</note> which was found in
the House of the Lord.</p>
            <p>This was the Rule by which <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the High Priest,
thought it necessary for <hi>Iosiah</hi> to go by; and not by any
Tradition left among them concerning the Law which
God had given by <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This was that which our Saviour appealed to in all
his Disputes;<note place="margin">John 5. 39.</note> 
               <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> saith he to the <hi>Iews;</hi>
not run to your Traditions, for those were then very
corrupt, especially about the Messias, as that he was to
be a Temporal Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was then a dangerous
and fundamental mistake; and therefore Christ appeals
from them to the Scriptures; <hi>And they are they which tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
of me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">46.</note> 
               <hi>Had ye believed</hi> Moses, <hi>ye would have believed
me, for he wrote of me; but if ye believe not his Writings, how
shall ye believe my words?</hi>
               <note place="margin">47.</note> And our Saviour severely checks
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> for regarding their own Traditions more
than the Written Law.<note place="margin">Matt. 15. 3. 9.</note> And yet they pretended to an
Oral Tradition down from <hi>Moses;</hi> as the Jews do to
this day; and none are more grosly deceived than they.</p>
            <p>4. The general Sense and Experience of Mankind agrees
herein, that all matters of consequence are more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preserved by Writings than by meer words. There is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97983:15"/>
no Invention hath been more valued by the Wiser part
of Mankind than that of <hi>Letters;</hi> because it is of such
excellent use for conveying the sense of our minds at a
distance to others. All men have so great a mistrust, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the capacity or memory, or fidelity of others;
that what they would have done with security they
commit to Writing. And whatever we truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
of the Ages before us, we are beholden to Writing
for it; all those memorable Actions, and Institutions,
either of <hi>Philosophy</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> which were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
are long since buried in Oblivion, without possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a Resurrection.</p>
            <p>But where they have been committed to Writing they
are preserved after so many Ages; and by it we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know the History of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and the strange
Revolutions that happened from the beginning of the
World. By it, we converse with the Wisest persons of
former times; and were able to justifie the Scriptures by
the concurrent Testimonies of other Writers. By it, we
are enabled to interpret Prophecies, and to make plain
their accomplishments, which without it, we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make out. Yea by it, the Wisdom of those is preserved
for the benefit of mankind, who thought fit to write
nothing themselves, as <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> but their
Disciples took care in time to Write their Doctrines. So
that we have the general Consent of the wisest part of
mankind, that writing is a far more certain way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
than meer Tradition.</p>
            <p>2. And especially in our case where there are so many
particular advantages, as to the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> above
any other Writings.</p>
            <p>1. From the special Providence of God, with respect
to them; for since it is agreed by all Christians, that
these were written by Divine Inspiration, it is most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97983:15"/>
to believe, that a more than ordinary care would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to preserve them.</p>
            <p>And therefore to suppose any Books of Scripture to be
lost, which contained any necessary points of Faith is
a great Reflexion on Divine Providence. For, if God
watches over his Church, he cannot be supposed to let
such Books be lost which were designed for the universal
and lasting Benefit of his Church.</p>
            <p>2. From the mighty esteem which the Church of God
had always for them; for, they built their Hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the promises contained in them. The Book of
Scripture was their Evidence for their future Inheritance;
the Foundation of their Hope, and Rule of their Faith;
their Defence against Assaults and Temptations; their
Counseller in cases of Difficulty; their Support, under
Troubles; and their surest Guide to a happy Eternity;
and therefore the Primitive Christians chose rather to
endure any Torments than basely to betray it, and give
it up to their Enemies.</p>
            <p>3. From the early disputes that were about them.
Which shews that they were no Invention of after times;
nor were brought into the World by Stealth and Art;
for, they endured the greatest shock of Opposition at
first, while the matters of Fact concerning them were
the most easily proved. And having passed the severe
Scrutiny of the first Ages, when so many counterfeit
Writings were sent abroad, the following Ages could
have no Reason to call their Authority in question.</p>
            <p>4. From the general consent of divided Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them. It might have pleased God to have kept his
Church from those unhappy Breaches which have been
in all parts of the Christian World; but the East, and
the West, the North and the South can all bear Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the sad Divisions of Christendom; and those
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97983:16"/>
of many Ages standing. But yet, we have this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Advantage by them; that we can have no Reason
to mistrust a conspiracy where the several Bodies are so
much divided.</p>
            <p>5. From the great internal satisfaction which the minds
of good Men have concerning them; and which no other
writing can pretend to give. For here we read of the
Promise of Divine Assistance to sincere and humble minds.
And that Assistance carries a <hi>Lumen Fidei</hi> into the mind;
as <hi>Aquinas</hi> calls it 2. 2. <hi>a 3 ad 2. and by that</hi> he saith,
<hi>the mind is united to Truth, that its assent is only fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; and therefore there is no danger of Damnation to those
who are in Christ Iesus, and are thus illuminated by Faith in
him.</hi> Not that this is an Argument to convince others,
who have not that inward sense which they have; but
the same Holy Spirit which did at first indite them, may
give such an inward and effectual Testimony as to the
Truth of the matter contained in them; that from thence
they may firmly conclude these Books to contain the word
of God. And that Assurance which the minds of good
Men have from the Influence of Divine Grace, may be
more effectual and powerful in them, than all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Infallibility or Demonstration in the World. It
is certain those cannot be deceived whom the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
teacheth; and the best and wisest of the Antient
Schoolmen did make the great firmness and certainty of
Faith not to depend on outward Motives, but on inward
Grace; which so inlightned the Mind, and fixed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of the Soul, that nothing is able to remove it.
This sort of Faith is no blind Assent; but after all the
Evidence which it hath to make its Assent Reasonable;
it takes so fast a hold of Divine Truths by discerning the
excellency and value of them, that he that hath it is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to let go any thing rather than that; and although
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97983:16"/>
the Apprehension of Faith be not so clear as that of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
yet the <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> as the Apostle calls it, may be so
firm,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> that no Temptations may be able to shake it. And he
that can die for his Religion hath a stronger and better
Faith, than he that thinks himself never so Infallible in
the Grounds of it. That is a true Divine Faith which <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15. 9.</note> and thereby enlightens the mind; which
<hi>works by Love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> and not by cavilling and wrangling about
the Grounds of it;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>which overcomes the World,</hi> and not
that which overcomes the Temptations of it. And such
a Faith, and only such a one will carry us to Heaven;
when, if it were possible for us to have the utmost Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
in the Act of believing; yet if it did not work
effectually on our Hearts and Lives, we might go infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to Hell.</p>
            <p>And so I shall conclude this Discourse with the second
sense of the Obligation which lies on those <hi>who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Christ Iesus the Lord so to walk in him: i. e.</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their sound Faith into the Practice of a good Life.</p>
            <p>For alas! What advantage will it be to us, to have the
most Primitive and Apostolical <hi>Faith,</hi> if our <hi>Works</hi> be not
answerable to it?<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord,</hi> saith Christ,
<hi>and do not the thing which I say?</hi> Why do we pretend <hi>to
receive Christ Iesus the Lord,</hi> if we do not observe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?
<hi>It is good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 18.</note> saith S. <hi>Paul, to be zealously affected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a good thing.</hi> And no doubt our <hi>Faith</hi> is such;
but then let us be <hi>zealous of good Works too,</hi> that we may
shew our selves to be <hi>that peculiar people who are redeemed
by Iesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> So that our Obligation arises every way
from <hi>Christ Iesus the Lord, to walk in him;</hi> if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him as <hi>our Lord,</hi> so we are to obey him; if as <hi>Christ
Iesus,</hi> so he died for us <hi>to redeem us from all iniquity.</hi> We
can have no pretence to live in our sins, if we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him who commands us to forsake them; for then
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97983:17"/>
we receive and reject him at the same time.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Let every
one that names the name of Christ, depart from iniquity,</hi> saith
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> what should those then do that profess <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him as their Lord,</hi> who are thereby bound to yield
obedience to his Laws? one of the great causes of the
Degeneracy of the Heathen World was the separating
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morality;</hi> when this was left to the Schools
of Philosophers to instruct men in, whereas their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
consisted only of some Solemn Rites and Sacrifices.
Let us have a care of as dangerous a Separation between
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> or which is all one, between <hi>receiving
Christ, and doing his Will.</hi> For those are the proper
<hi>Works</hi> of the Gospel, wherein we own <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>our Lord,</hi>
and do them because he commands us. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
hath summ'd up the <hi>whole Duty</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> in those
comprehensive words,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Teaching us that denying ungodliness
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this present World;</hi>
               <note place="margin">13.</note> 
               <hi>looking for that blessed hope, and
the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour
Iesus Christ.</hi> To whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
