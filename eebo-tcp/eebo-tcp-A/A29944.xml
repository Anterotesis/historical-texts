            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Treaſon (being derived from <hi>Trahir</hi>) which is treacherouſly to betray,<note place="margin">1 Petit Treaſon.</note> 
                     <hi>Trahue</hi> betrayed, and <hi>Trahiſon per Contractionem,</hi> Treaſon is the betraying it ſelf, it is divided into two parts, into High Treaſon, and petit Treaſon: It is called High, or Grand Treaſon in reſpect of the Royal Majeſty againſt whom it is perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Comparatively it is ſtiled petty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">Co. 3.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104039:5"/> mentioned by the Statute of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. C. 2. <hi>de prodicionibus;</hi> and likewiſe by <hi>Britton Cap. 8. &amp;</hi> 22.</p>

E. 4. 7.</note> Or Homicide by miſadventure is when a man without any evil intent doth a lawful thing, or that is not prohibited by Law, and another is ſlain or cometh to his death thereby, as if one ſhoot at Butts, or at pricks, and kill a man, by ſwarving his hands,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bract. l. 3. c. 4. n.</hi> 3.</note> this is no felony; The ſame Law is of tiling an Houſe, and a tile fall, and killeth one. So if one train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souldier hurteth another in skirmiſh, of which hurt he dies, this being by miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture is no felony. But in any of theſe Caſes before put if a man be hurt or maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, an Action of Treſpaſs lieth againſt him that was the cauſe of the hurt, or maime, though it be done againſt the parties mind and will; becauſe in Civil Treſpaſſes and injuries, that are of an inferior nature, the Law doth rather conſider the damage of the party wronged, then the mind of him, that was the wrong doer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vide Hobarts</hi> Reports Weaver againſt Ward f. 134. But to return from whence I have made a digreſſion: It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether he that commiteth this Homicide by miſadventure in doing a lawful
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104039:19"/> Act, and likewiſe without an evil intent; for if the Act be unlawful, or done with an evil purpoſe, it will prove murther.</p>
                  <p>1. Touching an unlawful Act: If a man ſhoot at a Cock or Hen, or any fowl of another man, and the arrow by miſchance kill a man, this is ſaid to be murther, for the Act was unlawful. So if a man doth beat another, and with intent not to kill him, yet if the party be killed by this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, it is felony.</p>
                  <p>So if two are fighting together, and a third cometh to part them, and is killed by one of them two, without any malice fore-thought, yet this is murther in him,<note place="margin">11. H. 7. 23. a.</note> and not Homicide by Chancemedley, or miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, becauſe that they two that fought together, were in doing of an unlawful Act. And if they were met with prepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed malice, the one intending to kill the other, then it is murther in them both.</p>
                  <p>2. Touching an evil Intent; If a man knowing that many people come in the ſtreet from a Sermon, throw a ſtone over a wall, intending only to fear them, or to give them a light hurt, and thereupon one is killed, this is murther, for he had an evil intent, though that intent extended not to death, and though he knew not the party ſlain.</p>
                  <p>Note, though the killing of a man by miſadventure,<note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. f. 57.</note> or by chance, be not felony, <hi>Quia in maleficiis voluntas ſpectatur, non exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. D.</hi> 48. 8. 14. yet the party guilty ſhall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104039:19"/> forfeit therefore all his Goods, and Chattels, to the intent that men ſhould be cautious, as they tend not to the effuſion of mans blood: I ſhall conclude this learning touching Homicides, with ſomewhat appertaining to Phyſicians and Chirurgians.</p>

                  <head>1. Of Larceny.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Larceny,</hi> by the Common Law, is the felonious and fraudulent taking, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away by any man or woman,<note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. 107.</note> of the meer perſonal goods of another, neither from the perſon, not by night in the houſe of the owner: This Larceny is twofold, the one ſo called Simply, and the other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit, or Little Larceny.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is where the thing ſtollen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104039:23"/> the value of 12. pence, and that is felony.</p>
                  <p>The other (which is called little, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit Larceny) is where the thing ſtollen doth not exceed the value of 12. pence, and that is not felony.</p>
                  <p>From the Deſcription and Diviſion of Larceny, I proceed to propoſe theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Queries, with Reſolutions on them.</p>
                  <p>Whether Larceny can be committed,<note place="margin">Quaeſt.</note> where there is a Bailement, or Delivery, by the owner of the thing?</p>
                  <p>Larceny is perpetrated by an actual taking:<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> for an Indictment, <hi>Quod felonice abduxit</hi> is not good, becauſe it wanteth <hi>coepit.</hi> By taking, and not Bailement or delivery, for that is a Receipt, and not a taking: and therewith agreeth <hi>Glanvil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 10. c. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Furtum non eſt ubi initinm habet detentionis per dominum rei;</hi> But this Rule of <hi>Glanvil</hi> has its exceptions; as appears by theſe Caſes in our Law.<note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. 107. 13. E. 4. 9.</note> If a Carryer hath a bale or pack of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe delivered unto him to carry it to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place, and after he take the whole pack <hi>animo furandi,</hi> this is Larceny: for the delivery had taken his effect, and the privity of the Bailement is determined; ſo if he open the pack, and take any thing out<note n="*" place="margin">Furtum ſine affectu furaudi, non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur.</note> 
                     <hi>animo furandi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Juſt. 4. 1. 7.</note> 'tis Larceny.</p>
                  <p>If a Taverner ſet a piece of plate before a man to drink in it, and he carry it away, this is Larceny: for it is no Bailement, but a ſpecial uſe to a ſpecial purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">13. E. 4. 9. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſect. 191.</note> our Law does make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between a Poſſeſſion and a Charge;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104039:23"/> for when I deliver goods to a man,<note place="margin">21. H. 7. 15, a, 12. H. 7. 15. a. 3 H 7. 12.</note> he hath the poſſeſſion of the goods, and may have an Action of Treſpaſs, or an Appeal, if they be taken or ſtoln out of his poſſeſſion. But my Butler or Cook,<note place="margin">Cro. 1. part <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> vers. <hi>Hickes.</hi> 638.</note> that in my houſe hath charge of my veſſel or plate, hath no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, nor ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs or an Appeal, as the Baily ſhall, and therefore if they ſteal the plate or veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, it is Larceny: And ſo it is of a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, for things be <hi>in onere, &amp; non in poſſeſſione Promi, Coci, Paſtoris, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether of goods found and converted <hi>animo furandi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quaeſt. 2.</note> Larceny can be committed?</p>
                  <p>If one looſe his goods,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> and another find them, though he convert them <hi>animo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi,</hi> to his own uſe, yet it is not Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceny, for the firſt taking is lawful.</p>
                  <p>So if one find Treaſure Trove,<note place="margin">22. Aſſ. pl. 99. 22. c 3. Cor. 265.</note> Waif, or Stray, and convert them <hi>cum affectu furandi:</hi> it is no Larceny, both in reſpect of the finding, and alſo for that <hi>Dominus rerum non apparet: And non eſſe, &amp; non apparere tantundem valent quoad eum, cui non ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether an Infant,<note place="margin">Quaeſt.</note> that is under the age of diſcretion, can commit Larceny?</p>
                  <p>An Infant,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> until he be of the age of 14, which in Law is accounted the age of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion cannot commit Larceny, or other felony;<note place="margin">Co.

                  </p>
                  <p>Whether the removal of things <hi>felleo ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quaere 6.</note> from one room to another, in the ſame houſe, can be Larceny?</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104039:25"/> they be not carried away, is Larceny as if a Gueſt take the coverlet or ſheets of his bed, and riſing before day, take the coverlet or ſheets out of the chamber, where he lay,<note place="margin">21.

                     <hi>Robbery</hi> is (ſaies <hi>Coke</hi>) a felony by the Common Law, committed by a violent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, upon the perſon of another, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in fear, and taking from his perſon his money or other goods of any value what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: Or it is (ſaies another) a felonious taking away of another mans goods from his perſon or preſence, againſt his will, putting him in fear, and of purpoſe to ſteal the ſame goods.

                  </p>
                  <p>Out of which deſcriptions, the Reader may obſerve theſe ſpecial circumſtances: 1. That it is not Robbery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>2. That the word <hi>(taking)</hi> neceſſarily

                  <p>Touching <hi>Burglary,</hi> there are 3 matters worthy of obſervation: <hi>viz</hi> 1. The Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology or origination of the word. 2. Its Definition: 3. Reſolutions concerning this offence.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Burglary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymology.</note> is derived of two words <hi>Burgh</hi> and <hi>Laron, Burgh</hi> ſignifying an Houſe,<note place="margin">Co. lib. 4. f. 39.</note> and <hi>Laron</hi> ſignifying a Thief, as it were a Houſe Thief.</p>
                  <p>This crime,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Brooke</hi>'s Caſe.</note> according to the acceptance of our Common Law is thus defined.</p>
                  <p>It is when one breaketh and entereth into the houſe of another in the night, with a felonious intent to rob or kill, or to do ſome other felony; in which caſes, although he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104039:27"/> carry away nothing, yet it is felony, for which he ſhall ſuffer death.</p>
                  <p>The Reſolutions that are given upon this offence, are theſe following.</p>
                  <p>1. Touching fraction and entry: If the door of a manſion houſe ſtand open,<note place="margin">4. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions.</note> and the Thief enter into the houſe with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſteal, this is a breaking of the houſe in Law, and no Burglary, becauſe there muſt be an actual breaking, for the words of the Indictment are, <hi>Felonice &amp; Burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter fecit, &amp;c.</hi> which are to be underſtood of an actual breaking of the houſe, and not of a breaking in Law.<note place="margin">Co. 3.</note> So it is if the window of the houſe be open,<note place="margin">Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 64.</note> and the Thief with a hook, or other engine draweth out ſome of the goods of the owner: this is no Burglary, becauſe there is no actual breaking of the houſe. But if the Thief breaketh the glaſs of the window, and with a book or other engine draweth out ſome of the goods of the owner; this is Burglary, for there was an actual breaking of the houſe.</p>
                  <p>If divers come in the night to do a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary, and one of them breaketh and enter, the reſt of them ſtanding neer to the door,<note place="margin">13. <hi>H</hi> 4. 13.</note> or about other part of the houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to watch that no help ſhall come to defend the owner, this is Burglary in all.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes Burglary may be committed by entry without any breaking: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; if a ſervant will conſpire with other men to rob his Maſter, and to that intent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104039:28"/> he openeth his Maſters doors and windows in the night for them, that they come into the houſe by that way, this is Burglary in the ſtrangers, and the ſervant is a thief; but no Burglar. And this was the opinion of <hi>Manwood</hi> Chief <hi>Baron</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> at the Quarter Seſſions holden at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> in January 1579. 21 <hi>Eliz.</hi>

                  <p>If Thieves come in the night with hue and cry, pretending that they be robbed, and ſhall require the Conſtable to ſearch for the felons, and whilſt he goeth with them into ſome mans houſe, they bind and rob the Conſtable and dwellers, this is Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary; for in Judgment of Law,<note place="margin">Co. 3.

                  <p>You ſee by what has been ſaid before, that Burglary the Common Law reſtrains to a robbing of a houſe, by night or breaking in, with intent to rob or to do ſome other felony; but the like offence committed by day, we call Houſe-breaking, or Robbing, (and not Burglary) and this kind of felony is provided for by the Stat.<note place="margin">39. <hi>Eliz:</hi> c. 15.</note> of 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> That if any man ſhall break a houſe by day,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104039:29"/> and take away thence money or goods, to the value of five ſhillings, or more in any part of the dweling houſe, or Out-houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſame, though no perſon be therein, for this felony he ſhall loſe the benefit of his Clergy; ſo as for this offence the party ſhall ſuffer death, as in caſe of Burglary</p>
                  <p>Upon this Law, happened this Caſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evans</hi> and <hi>Finch</hi> were arrigned at the Gaole delivery of New-Gate: for that they about 12. a clock in the fore-noon, brake open <hi>Domum manſionalem Hugonis Audeley,</hi>

And upon evidence it appeared, that the ſaid <hi>Evans</hi> by a ladder climbed to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per window of the ſaid <hi>Audeley</hi>'s chamber, and took out thereof the ſaid 40. pounds: And that the ſaid <hi>Finch</hi> ſtood upon the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the view of the ſaid <hi>Evans,</hi> and ſaw <hi>Evans</hi> in the chamber, and was aſſiſting to the committing of the ſaid robbery, and took part of the money. And all this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being found, it was adjudged, becauſe the ſaid <hi>Finch</hi> did not enter into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he was not within the Statute of 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which takes away Clergy, where an houſe is broken open, and the robbery is above the value of five ſhillings, no perſon therein, that he ſhould have his Clergy, which was allowed him. And as for <hi>Evans</hi> the ſpecial verdict found, that he was in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104039:30"/> the chamber of <hi>Hugh Audeley,</hi> in the Inner Temple, and that the robbery was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted between 12, and one of the clock in the day time, no perſon being within the chamber at the time of the breaking thereof, but that divers perſons were in the Inner Temple Hall, and in other places of the houſe: And whether this be a breaking open the houſe, and taking of goods above the value of five ſhillings; <hi>nnulla perſona,</hi> being within the houſe, and within the ſaid act of 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> they prayed the diſcretion of the Court? And it was reſolved upon this ſpecial verdict (being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by <hi>Certiorari</hi> into the Kings Bench, and the priſoner removed by <hi>Habeas corpus</hi>) that this breaking open the chamber, and taking 40. pounds out thereof, <hi>nulla per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona</hi> being therein (although there were divers perſons in other parts of the houſe) was within the Stat. of 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which takes away Clergy from ſuch offenders: Wherefore Clergy was denyed to the ſaid <hi>Evans,</hi> and Judgment given in the Kings Bench, that he ſhould be hanged.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Burning</hi> is a felony at the Common Law, committed by any that maliciouſly and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily in the night or day,<note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 66.</note> burneth the houſe of another.</p>
                  <p>Out of which we may obſerve two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:104039:31"/> Firſt; To make it felony, it muſt be done with malice and will; for if it be done by miſchance, or negligence, it is no felony. But whether the Law doth ſometime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that the houſe was burnt maliciouſly, and voluntarily, may be a <hi>Quaere?</hi> It is anſwered, it does: As if one intend to burn the houſe of A. only, and not the houſe of B. and yet in the burning the the houſe of A. the houſe of B. is burnt, in this caſe the burning of the houſe of A, is felony,<note place="margin">Co 3. Inſt. <hi>f. 67. Plowd.</hi> Com. <hi>f.</hi> 475.</note> becauſe it proceeded of the malicious and voluntary burning of the houſe of A, and the event ſhall be coupled to the cauſe, which was voluntarily and malicious: And the rule is, <hi>Involuntarium ex voluntario or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum habens, moraliter pro voluntario habetur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; to make it felony, it muſt be the houſe of another, and not his own houſe: As for example:</p>
                  <p>One <hi>W. Holmes</hi> was indicted in <hi>London,</hi> for that he being poſſeſſed of an houſe in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>Throgmorton</hi> ſtreet,<note place="margin">Cro. 3. part. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Caſe. <hi>f.</hi> 377.</note> in ſuch a ward for ſix years, the remainder to <hi>Iſ.</hi> for three years, the Reverſion to the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> in fee: He <hi>vi &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis felonice, voluntarie, &amp; malitioſe igne combuſſit, &amp;c.</hi> his own houſe: Upon this being arraigned at <hi>New-Gate,</hi> he was found guilty: add before Judgment this Indictment was removed by <hi>Certiorari</hi> into the Kings Bench, and being argued by <hi>Grimſton,</hi> that it was not felony.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Richardſon, Jones,</hi> and <hi>Berkeley</hi> it was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104039:32"/> held that it was not felony to burn an houſe, whereof he is in poſſeſſion, by vertue of a Leaſe for years: For they ſaid, that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of houſes is not felony, unleſs that they were <hi>aedes alienae:</hi> And therefore <hi>Britton,</hi> and <hi>Bracton</hi> mention that is felony to burn the houſe of another: and the Year-Books and <hi>Co. lib. 11. Powlters</hi> Caſe, which ſay, that burning of houſes generally are to be intended <hi>de aedibus alienis, &amp; de non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priis:</hi> And although the Indictment be <hi>ea intentione ad comburendum felonice, &amp;c.</hi> yet intent only without fact, is not felony: Alſo <hi>Barkeley</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> held, that it cannot be ſaid <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> when it is in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and therefore it was reſolved that it was not felony, wherefore he was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereof: But becauſe it was an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant offence, and found, they ordered that he ſhould be fined 500. pounds to the King, and impriſoned during the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſhould ſtand upon the Pillory, with a paper upon his head, ſignifying the offence at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and at <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> upon the Market day, and where he committed the offence, and ſhould be bound with good ſureties to his good behaviour during life.</p>
                  <p>Note,<note place="margin">22 &amp; 23. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. nunc Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis.</note> there is a late Act made, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the malicious burning of houſes, Stackes of Corn and Hay, and killing and maiming of Cattel.</p>
                  <p>Touching burning, the Civil Law ſpeaks thus:</p>

                  <p>I proceed to thoſe that immediately touch the King, and his Crown; and they are:</p>

And ſo it was reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England Hill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Jac. Regis,</hi> in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104039:33"/> the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray, Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clarke</hi> Seminary Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>So if divers conſpire the death of the King, and the manner how, and thereupon provide weapons, powder, poyſon, aſſay harneſs, ſend Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the like for execution of the Conſpiracy, this is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient overt act to prove the compaſſing and imagination of the Kings death.</p>
                  <p>If any man ſhall attempt to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo ſtrong, that the King ſhall not be able to reſiſt him, he is guilty of Rebellion.

                  <p>Note, that there is difference taken by our Law between felony and High treaſon; for it is not felony, unleſs there be ſome act done: <hi>Non efficit conatus, niſi ſequatur effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus:</hi> But if one compaſs or imagine the death of the King, who is the Head of the Common-wealth, and declares his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing or imagination, by words or Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is High treaſon: <hi>Doct. and Stud. lib. 2. cap. 41.

                  <p>1. The Etymology or Origination of the word:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Miſpriſion,</hi> cometh of the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Meſpris,</hi> which properly ſignifieth neglect or contempt; for (<hi>mes</hi>) in Compoſition in the <hi>French</hi> ſignifieth <hi>mal,</hi>

                  <p>In legal underſtanding Miſpriſion of treaſon, is either when one knoweth, that another hath committed treaſon, and will not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him to the King or to the Councel, or to any Magiſtrate, but doth conceal the ſame; it is when one hath committed ſome hainous offence under the degree of treaſon.</p>

                  <p>Whether this offence of Bribery can be perpetrated,<note place="margin">Qu. 2.</note> by one that hath a Judicial place in the Eccleſiaſtical Court?</p>
                  <p>The Statute of 5 <hi>E. 6. c.</hi> 16. doth extend as well to Eccleſiaſtical Office as temporal,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> which concern the Adminiſtration and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Juſtice,<note place="margin">Co. 3.

                  <p>The <hi>Mirror</hi> ſaith, that Women, Infants, Ideots,<note place="margin">c. 1. ſect. 3.</note> Lepers, or Profeſſours in Order of Religion, or Clerks, or Perſons attainted of felony, or <hi>non compos mentis,</hi> cannot be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provours.</p>
                  <p>Now, an Approvour is he who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome felony, which he confeſſeth, and appealeth or approveth, that is to ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth others, which were coadjutours or helpers with him, in doing the ſame or other felonies, which thing he will approve; and this proof is to be either by Battaile or by the Countrey, at his election that appealed.</p>
                  <p>This Accuſation is often done before the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104039:56"/> Coroner, who either is a ſigned to the felon by the Court to take and record that which he ſaith, or is called by the felon himſelf, and required for the good of the Prince and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to record that which he ſhall ſay.</p>
                  <p>If upon his appeal all thoſe Partners be convicted, the King <hi>ex merito Juſtitioe</hi> is to pardon him. But it is in the diſcretion of the Court either to ſuffer him to be an Approver,<note place="margin">21.

                  <p>Note; If a Man that is of good ſame be appealed by an approver, by which he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and kept in priſon, yet he may have a writ, to be directed to the Sheriff, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to ſuffer the Party appealed to be Bayled by good ſureties. But if a Man appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an approver, be kept in priſon, and afterwards the Approver dieth, there he may ſue a Writ directed to the Sheriff, to ſuffer him to be Bayled upon good ſurety, if he be not a notorious felon, although he be not of good fame, Fitzh. N.B 250. d.</p>
                  <p>Note further, that before Indictment no perſon can approve, becauſe if his approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be falſe,<note place="margin">43. Aſſ. Pl. 39. 15. <hi>E.</hi> 3.

                  <p>In caſe of felony, as there be principals, ſo there be Acceſſories, and acceſſories be of two ſorts, by the Common Law, and by the Statute Law.</p>
                  <p>Acceſſory by the Common Law is alſo of two ſorts §.</p>
                  <p>1. Acceſſory before the offence or fact; and it is he that commandeth or procureth an other to commit felony, and is not there preſent himſelf, when the other doth it, but if he be preſent, then he is alſo a principal: As where I S. doth hold I. X. and commands I. D. to kill him, whereupon I. D. doth give him a wound to his heart, whereof he inſtantly dies, It is held that both be principals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both are parties to the wound. 13. H. 7. 10. a.</p>
                  <p>So a Woman ſervant conſpired to rob her Miſtreſs, and brought a Stranger to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104039:57"/> where the Miſtreſs lay aſleep, the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger killed,<note place="margin">2 &amp; 3 <hi>Eliz. Dyer f.</hi> 128.</note> the ſervant ſilent, nothing doing, but holding the candle; the two Chief Juſtices and Hare, though the Servant a Traitreſs and a principal.</p>
                  <p>If a Man counſelleth a Woman to murther the Child being in her Body,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dyer f.</hi> 186.</note> and after the Child is born, and then is mudered by the Woman in the abſence of him that ſo gave the Counſel; yet he is acceſſary before the fact, by his counſelling, before the birth of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and not countermanding it.</p>
                  <p>Note,<note place="margin">Co. <hi>lib. 4. f. 44. a.</hi>
                     </note> that in Man-ſlaughter a Man cannot be acceſſary before the fact, for Man-ſlaughter enſueth upon a ſudden debate or Affray, for if it be premeditated, it is murder.</p>
                  <p>2. Acceſſory after the offence, and it is he, that receiveth, favoureth, aideth, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteteth any Man, that hath done any mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or other felony, whereof he hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſuch an acceſſory ſhall be puniſhed, and ſhall have Judgment of life and member, as well as the principal, which did the felony.</p>
                  <p>But the Quere may be, whether one may be acceſſory to an acceſſory? It is anſwered, that one may; if one feloniouſly receive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that is acceſſory to felony, there the receiver is an acceſſory.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of acceſſories by the Common Law.</p>
                  <p>Acceſſory by the Ssatute Law, is ſuch a one that abbeteth, counſelleth, or receiveth any Man, which committeth, or hath committed any offence made felony by Statute; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

                  <p>By what has been ſaid, you ſee that the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory ought not to be condemned, but where the principal is attainted, and not where he is convicted only, and had his Clergy; which Clergy is a Refuge provided by the Common Law in favour of Learning,<note place="margin">Of Clergy.</note> to ſave the life of an offender <hi>Literate</hi> in certain caſes; I ſay in certain caſes, becauſe the benefit of the Clergy is taken away in many particulars, as,</p>

                  <p>But it alwaies was clear, that a fact in one County ought not to be tryed in another.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Learning touching Appeals with theſe Queries.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 1. <hi>Whether all Appeals ought to be ſued in proper Perſon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is anſwered, that all Appeals are to be ſued in proper Perſon, and not by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, as Appeal of Maihem muſt be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſon.<note place="margin">21. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 72, &amp; 73.</note> A Woman, which was <hi>Croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enſeint,</hi> ſued this Appeal;<note place="margin">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104039:65"/> did ride to <hi>Iſlington</hi> to her, to ſee if ſhe were alive, and deſired Execution, which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the Defendant had Judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether an Appeal may be commenced more then one way?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is anſwered, that Appeals are commenced two wayes, either by Writ, or by Bill.</p>
                  <p>1. By Writ, when a Writ is purchaſed out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> by one Man, againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, commanding him that he ſhall appeal a third Man of ſome felony, or other offence by him committed, and to find Pledges, that he ſhall do this with effect, and this Writ is to be delivered to the Sheriff to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
                  <p>2. By Bill, when a Man of himſelf giveth his Accuſation of another Man in Writing to the Sheriff, or Coroner, and taketh upon himſelf the burthen of appealing him that is named in the ſaid Writing.</p>
                  <p>And note, that there is a diverſity worthy of obſervation, betwixt an Appeal by Bill, and by Writ: for in the Appeal by Original Writ both principals and acceſſories,<note place="margin">Co. 2. Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 183.</note> are generally charged alike, without any diſtinction, who be principals, and who be acceſſories: but otherwiſe in the Appeal by Bill.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Accuſation by way of Appeal. I proceed now to ſpeak of the other kind of Accuſation; <hi>viz.</hi> by Indictment.</p>
                  <p>Indictment cometh of the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Enditer,</hi>

                  <p>For the clearer underſtanding of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, take theſe following Rules.</p>
                  <p>That there be words ſo appropriated to offences criminal,<note place="margin">Reg. 1.</note> that they cannot be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally by any other words, or Periphraſis.</p>

                  <p>But note, that in caſe of an Indictment,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104039:72"/> there is alſo a difference obſerved; for (as hath been ſaid) it ſhall refer to the time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Indictment for avoiding of Eſtates, Charges and Incumbrances made by the Felon, after the perpetration; but for the mean profits of the Land,<note place="margin">Co.
