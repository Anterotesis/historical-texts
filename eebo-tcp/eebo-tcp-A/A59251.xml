         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In Answer to the late Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensers

               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Gratefully Acknowledge
my Obligations, for the
good will, you shew to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
me. The perusal
of this <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> had long since set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a full <hi>belief</hi> in my soul: <hi>That the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of separated Souls might be Compleated
before Re-union with their Bodies and the
General day of Iudgment.</hi> So that, in truth,
I was not a little surprised by your book. It
was my misfortune it fell into my hands, just
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53988:3"/>
then, when our expectations were at the height
of those troubles, which afterwards succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our Nation, and which have ever since
much diverted me from things of this nature,
whilst in such nicities, as you now have
brought the question too, our understandings
ought to be perfectly calm. And this I hope
will plead for the delay that I have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
you sooner with these Reflections on
your book (which I designed long agoe) if
my other occasions had not interposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
I found not that satisfaction I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
wished for in your <hi>Letter;</hi> your Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
seemed not manly, your Answers not
home; you will pardon me then if I mind
you of my Exceptions against both: which
I shall endeavour to do with that just mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that befits Brethren. I cannot altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approove of harshness in writing, even
against the professed adversaries of our holy
Faith. It was not unhappily said by one of
them, as I remember, <hi>That writing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
ought to carry as much sweetness
as Love-Letters,</hi> and that the other rudeness
served but <hi>to chase away the game.</hi> And since
you have administred to me a just occasion
to reprehend this in your Letter, I shall
be wary not to be justly taxable my self,
both to yours and your <hi>Masters person,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53988:3"/>
Master <hi>White</hi> (whom you have now intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into the scene) I bear as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as any one whosoever, upon so sleight an
acquaintance: It is not the <hi>Doctor,</hi> but the
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> combat. I cannot digest their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
who usurp the Authority of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
tribunal, to brand any opinion with
the title of <hi>Heresie,</hi> whilst the <hi>Church</hi> hath
not done it to their hands: much less can I
endure, that the <hi>Author</hi> himself should be
stigmatized with the infamous character of
an <hi>Heretick.</hi> And though in this present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
I am fully convinced, that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
systeme of Purgatory stands condemned,
both by this Bull of <hi>Benedict</hi> the 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. and
the <hi>Florentin Council,</hi> and that of <hi>Trent,</hi> and
by consequence is <hi>Heretical:</hi> yet I am very
willing to believe, those who sustain it, do not
see its condemnation. And yet I think it will
appear that the <hi>Author</hi> of it, and those Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
who are now able pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icients in his school
are armed, even against the Authority it self.
This misfortune I regret, that I know not
how to address my self to you, but in print:
and since things which pass the press, are not
confined to one or few mens view, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to many eyes and censures, I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to satisfie even vulgar readers; who
certainly, though perhaps now acquainted with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53988:4"/>
the controversie it self, never yet d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>scover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the source and fountain of this new
molded Purgatory. And to the end I may do
so, I shall in the very introduction to my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
lay open to my readers eye, the first
grounds and rise, and the afterwards conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
progress, of this your new doctrin: Nor
could I otherwise acquit my self of it, with
just satisfaction to other readers, whilst if I had
spoken only in manuscript to you, <hi>(who are
now raised</hi> (as you say) <hi>above your pitch and
inabled to give any one satisfaction that is not
before hand resolved to receive none, by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with those solid men, who are acquainted
with every resort of</hi> Master <hi>Whites doctrine)</hi>
my business had received a much quicker dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.</p>
            <p>For my Method, I hope, you will pardon
me, if leaving whatsoever you have urged
either against the Publishers (whom you are
pleased to style <hi>Dispensers)</hi> of this <hi>Bull</hi> and
<hi>Council,</hi> or any thing else, not directly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to our question, to the latter end of
my Discourse. After your Doctrine laid open,
and its grounds, and the Question stated
between us, I betake my self at first to
our business in hand about the <hi>Bull</hi> and
<hi>Council.</hi> And for my Style, since we are
now in a Controversie much more proper
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53988:4"/>
for a <hi>Divinity Lecture</hi> then a <hi>Rhetorical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,</hi>
the strength of the Sense, rather
then the quaintness of the Expression, will
best befit the subject. This Preface will
claim your pardon, if you consider it gives
some light to what I hereafter say. But I
will neither detain you, nor my Reader any
longer, but fall to our work in hand.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from a very
Learned and Worthy Friend of
mine,<note place="margin">Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that he himself being present at a
Conference between Master <hi>White</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eminent Scholar of our Nation, divers
years before Master <hi>White</hi> appeared in Print:
among other things then discoursed of, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>White</hi> advanced a Phylosophical Position
which the other denied, as inconsistent with
our holy faith of the Blessed Sacrament: to
which Master <hi>White</hi> replied, <hi>Let us find out
the Truths in Phylosophy, and the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of our Faith will square well enough with
them:</hi> to which the other, <hi>Nay,</hi> Sir, <hi>by your
favour, let us in the first place presuppose the
establisht verities of faith, and then square
our Phylosophy to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have many times reflected, often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
with others, of the different consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of those different methods, which these
two great persons held in leading our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53988:5"/>
to truth. I have often enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
my self with these thoughts, what a
dangerous method Master <hi>White</hi> prescribed,
and as now appears followed? what a <hi>natural</hi>
and new <hi>divinity</hi> it would prove, which
should be squared to those Phlyosophical
truths, which our weak understandings
should be able to establish, independent of
<hi>divine revelation?</hi> And at last <hi>Master White</hi>
hath brought forth this his issue, and made
it publick to the world.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. It is not my design, in this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
discourse, to run through those many
little books, which this Author hath given
us on several occasions: And the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the authority of our supream Pastor,
hath already taken notice of, and interposed
his sharp, but justly deserved censures, against
divers of them; and doubtless will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
against the rest, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits
I shall then as to the present, concern
my self only with this one controversie, of
<hi>the state of those souls which leave this life in
the state of Grace; but so that they are not as
yet fully purged:</hi> and with those positions
and grounds, on which this new molded
Fabrick of Purgatory stands, unless some
one Doctrine or other, of the <hi>Author</hi> of it,
having a neer alliance with the business in

hand, so offer it self, that our discourse, and
the Subject would be illustrated by it.</p>
            <p>Sect. 4. <hi>And first as to the opinion it self,
he thus delivers it</hi> of the middle State, (acc. 1.)
I acknowledg <hi>(sayes he)</hi> in humane failings,
a difference betwixt mortal, and venial; nor
do I deny an imperfect remission of mortal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities,
but I place not this imperfection, in
that the sin is totally cancelled, the pain only
remaining; but in the change of an absolute,
into a conditional affection, as it were instead
of, I will, substituting, I will not; but Oh,
that I lawfully might, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the affection or
inclination he had to temporal good, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
not extinguished, of mortal become
venial, changed, not destroyed. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the operation of death (as it were)
new molded, and minted into a purely spiritual
substance; he carries inseparably with him
the matter of his torment; in like manner
as he also doth, who takes leave of his body,
with his affections only venially
disordered;<note place="margin">This is not well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

where imagine a place filled
with hellish dishes, by which the
soul, as from an external tormentor, suffers a
butchery; but we are in horrour of the strife
and fury of innate affections, which is therefore
<hi>proportioned to the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

new fabrick of Purgatory, and indeed a
whole new system of Philosophy and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was made publick; it was (as I take it)
this; after the Book <hi>of the immortality of
of the soul,</hi> fathered on Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby:</hi>
Master <hi>White</hi> appeared himself on the Stage,

to the mind of that most eminent man,
and most excellent Philosopher, Sir</hi> Kenelm
Digby, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He discovers the great mine of
this <hi>Phylosophy;</hi> here the suttleties of <hi>Logick,</hi>
the secrets of <hi>nature,</hi> the hidden properties of
<hi>bodies,</hi> both heaven and earth, are layed open;
and not only that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Consilium Authoris.</note> but we are further led on
<hi>by an undisolvable chain of
unavoidable consequences</hi> (as is
pretended) to the abstract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53988:6"/>
of <hi>metaphysicks,</hi> to the clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of separated souls, intelligences,
even the existence and attributes of God
himself. And <hi>All</hi> this (if the Reader hath
faith enough to believe, for otherwise, I am
confident, he will find but slender satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
by most clear and evident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by a long chain of consequences, or
a series of <hi>Patets, Fits, sequiturs, clarum ests,
consequens ests, confectum ests,</hi> and the
like.</p>
            <p>The Foundations thus laid, conformable to
this incomparable (and I think incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible)
Peece, for never Daughter was

Religion, for nothing is upon any other
grounds admitted into this new <hi>Theological
School,</hi> of which I give my Reader a full
Account, <hi>Sect. 23, 24. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sect. 6. <hi>In his Peripatetick Institutions
then or Philosophy,</hi> 5 book, lesson 1. <hi>he lays
the foundations of his future Purgatory, or
the state of Souls in separation, and having
in the first place laboured to evince, That
Rational Souls, such as those of men are,
may</hi> exist <hi>or</hi> be <hi>without their Bodies. He
delivers that notion (which he desires to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
in us) of a separated Soul, in these
words,</hi> nu. 9, 10, 11. Now he who desires to
frame to himself, in some sort, a notion of
a separated Soul, let him ponder with himself
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53988:7"/>
that Object which corresponds to the word,
Man or Animal, as such: which when he
shall see Abstracts from Place and Time,
and is a substance by the only necessity of
the terms: let him conceive the like of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
soul. Then let him attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
some self evident and most Natural
Proposition, in which, when he shall have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated,
That the Object is in the Soul,
with its proper existence, and, as it were, by
it: let him think a separated Soul is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that is, all other things by the
very Connexion of Existencies. Lastly,
When in bodies he shall observe, that motion
proceeds from the quality of the mover, and
a certain impulse, and that this impulse is
derived again from another impulse, and so
even up to that which is first moved and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond.
Let him imagine the soul is a kind of
Principle, of such impulse, whatsoever thing that
must be. <hi>And so he holds on,</hi> nu. 12. What is
said of the substance of the soul, undoubtedly
must be understood too, of its proper accidents:
for since they depend onely on the soul, (being
something of it, nay even the very soul it self,)
and it would be more imperfect without them;
they must run the same fortune with it, unless
some special reason interpose. <hi>Out of which
he deduces immediately</hi> num. 13. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53988:8"/>
things then were in the man according to
his soul, at the instant of his death, remain
inseparably in the state of separation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all his resolutions or judgments, whether
speculative or practical, shall remain in it.
<hi>Out of which he deduces in the same</hi> Book,
less. 4. num. 1. And because the affections in
the soul, are nothing else but judgements, upon
which operation does, or is apt to follow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
it comes to pass, that our affections to acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and friends, and the rest we cultivated in
this life, shall remain in the future. <hi>And
more fully in the same place,</hi> num. 2. The
affections shall remain, and that in the same
proportion they were during life. <hi>Out of which
he concludes there,</hi> num. 3. Those who have
given themselves up wholly to corporal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
will be affected with a vast grief, through
the impossibility of those pleasures there; <hi>that
is, because corporal pleasures cannot now be
injoyed by the soul, in her state of separation.
This is the essence, the substance of his</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;
<hi>this is his whole chain, or deduction
of it, this is the grief he admits in separated
souls, for accusing them of ignorance, who
conceive</hi> fire, <hi>or any other</hi> material <hi>or</hi> external
<hi>agent hath power to afflict them in that state;
he conceives them sufferers from these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
affections to corporal pleasures,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53988:8"/>
which therefore torment the souls, because
they now are in a state, where these pleasures
are impossible to be injoyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sect. 7. <hi>Now as to the measure or dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of separated souls, and the continuation
of that state, till the</hi> day of judgment; <hi>the
foundations are laid in the same</hi> Book:
less. 3. num. 5. Again <hi>(sayes he)</hi> it is plain,
that a separated soul in an other manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
place and time, then in the body; since in
that it only abstracts from them, but out of
that, it comprehends them. For this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
and actual knowledg, places all place, and all
time within the soul, so that it can act in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place at once, and together (as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
this respect,) and provide for all time,
wherefore it is in a manner a maker and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of time and place; <hi>out of which he
deduces fully</hi> of the middle state, acc. 12. in
spiritual acts whether they bring happiness or
misery; there is no proportion to time, so as
to make pain, which lasts longer, to be greater;
or that which ends sooner, to be less: for those
are the properties of corporal things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
act of a pure spirit reflected on it self, being
of its own nature, out of the reach of time, is
not subject thereto, but greater then the whole
extension of time, <hi>&amp;c. And in the next</hi> Sect.
<hi>more fully.</hi> If to a thing <hi>(that is a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53988:9"/>
soul)</hi> which coexists to a longer part of
time, nothing be thereby added; or to a thing
which coexists to a shorter part of time, nothing
be thereby diminished, there can be no reason
why duration should represent, either more
or less grievous in these respective cases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
So that whatsoever grief of a separated soul
is by the quality and force of its essence grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the same, let its Co-existence to time, be
what it will, must be more vehement, and that
which is less, less intense, nothing being gained
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> lost by the perpetuating, or shortning of the
motions of the Sun, or other caelestial bodies,
<hi>&amp;c. And from this ground in the same
book,</hi> account. 22. <hi>he concludes,</hi> Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
time intervenes betwixt it <hi>(that is the prayer
now powred out for a departed soul, or death)</hi>
and the restauration of the world, <hi>(that is the
day of general judgment)</hi> is to departed
souls, but as one moment.</p>
            <p>Sect. 8. <hi>And further, as to the Immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of that state of separation, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness
of the acts of Souls now se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from their Bodies, his grounds are laid
down in the afore-cited</hi> Perepatetick Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
<hi>book 5. less. 4. num.</hi> 6, 7, 8. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>(says he)</hi> out of what hath been said
'tis deduced, That in the state of separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no variety can happen to Souls from any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53988:9"/>
body, or the change of Bodies: for since <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
change passes not from any body into the soul,
but through the Identification of the soul with
its own body; and this Identification ceaseth
by the state of separation: it follows, that
no action nor mutation can be derived from
any Body to the Soul. Nor has the Soul, of
it self, a principle of change in it self: not
from hence only, because an indivisible cannot
act on it self, but also, because since a muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soul cannot be any other, then either
according to the Vnderstanding, or according
to the Will. But the Vnderstanding is suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to know all things together and for ever;
whence by the course of Nature, there is no
room left either for Ignorance, or new Science:
And the Will is either not distinct from the
Vnderstanding, or at least is adequately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
in the state of separation; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that naturally no mutation can happen
to a separated soul from within, or caused
by it self. Nor yet from any other Spirit
without the Interposition of the Body: for
since all Spirits are indivisible, their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
too will be such; but an indivisible effect,
supposing all the causes of necessity exists in
the same instant: wherefore if any thing be
to be done between Spirits; tis all in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
so done and perfected, that afterwards
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53988:10"/>
an other action cannot be begun: for if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
either the causes were before adequately,
put; or not; if they were, the effect was put,
if they were not, some of the causes is changed,
that it may now begin to act, and not this, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
the former is the first mutation; whereof it is to
be urged, Whether the causes were put before?</p>
            <p>These are the eternal truths (as they would
perswade us) the unshakable foundations of
Phylosophy, on which this whole new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of <hi>Purgatory</hi> stands: and I have been
the more careful to deliver them fully to
my reader, (even in this beginning of my
discourse) that he may with one cast of
his eye see, on what firm foundations, this
new school hath abandoned the hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
faith of our holy mother the <hi>Church;</hi>
and now dares pronounce, That what she hath
hitherto taught us, <hi>proceeded but out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the nature of separated sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.

other his new Doctrines, in this new preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Demonstrative <hi>Theology;</hi> but in defence
of his new molded <hi>Purgatory,</hi> issued out his

where there was nothing their own,
but the pains to translate, and the charges

with what satisfaction, that little Volume
was received by pious persons, and how their

out to every mans eye, as condemned by that
sacred authority, took fire, An <hi>O</hi> or an <hi>A</hi> shall

<hi>That no Souls are delivered out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,

of this Position is the universally received

most evidently in this, That all <hi>Orthodox</hi>
Writers who have treated this subject, <hi>of the
state of separated souls,</hi> since the Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Bull</hi> aforesaid and <hi>Council,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it as a certain truth; and therefore
no one of them any where sustain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:

be weakned, by saying, That it is indeed the

universally received <hi>opinion</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> only;
but not their <hi>Faith;</hi> for besides what I shall

those who are acquainted with the prying cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity

variety of their apprehensions, know very
well, that where any thing may lawfully be
denyed, their restless curiosity ceases not to
call it to the Test, nor is it universally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
as Truth; and therefore it is <hi>authority</hi>

his Compendium of this <hi>Bull;</hi> and
tells us, That <hi>all Learned Writers agree.</hi> It
will justly fall under our consideration: First,
Whether this our present Question of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
were not then intended and defined?
And secondly, Whether this his new Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Charity,</hi> was there disputed and setled by

could have hapned to a Person whose
business it was to answer this very <hi>Bull,</hi> and <hi>of
all those solid and cleer-sighted Persons, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
with whom he was now raised above his
own pitch:</hi> I should justly suspect, that neither
he nor any one of them, had ever read this
very <hi>Bull,</hi> about which we now dispute. For
was it possible that a few great Letters, should
so possess their eyes, and their great good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to their new <hi>Masters</hi> Doctrine, so fill
their hearts, that there was no room for any
thing else of the whole <hi>Context?</hi> For the
<hi>Pope</hi> himself in this Bull having in most plain
and express words stated our very Question
to their hands: how was it possible they
should <hi>All</hi> over-look it? <hi>There arose</hi> (saith
he) <hi>a matter of question, not long since, in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53988:14"/>
time of</hi> John <hi>the</hi> xxii. <hi>our Predecessor of happy
memory, between some Doctors of Divinity,
concerning the vision of the souls of Iust men
after their death, in which nothing was to be
purged, when they departed out of this world; or
if there were, it was now totally purged: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they see the Divine Essence, before the re-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of their bodies, and the general Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
and also concerning other matters, &amp;c.</hi>
And yet in truth. to do him right, he did see
this, and cites it, <hi>page</hi> 24. and yet hath the
confidence to impose his quite different <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
upon us. Now, Sir, if it were possible
this should escape your consideration, yet
since you appeal to <hi>Cherubinus</hi> his <hi>Compendium</hi>
of this <hi>Bull,</hi> you ought at least to have read
and considered him: and yet in truth I cannot
believe it. For was it possible, that after <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubinus</hi>
too, agreeing perfectly with the <hi>Pope</hi>
had stated our <hi>Question,</hi> you should have the
boldness to deny it, and obtrude your new
fancied controversie of <hi>Charity</hi> upon us, and
appeal to this very <hi>Author,</hi> whose words do
most clearly and evidently condemn you?
But having heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Pope,</hi> I will satisfie my
Reader, and let him hear <hi>Flavius Cherubinus</hi>
in his own words.</p>
            <p>Because <hi>(sayes he)</hi> there arose a question
among the Divines and others, Whether the souls
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53988:14"/>
of Iust men departed, in which there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be purged, or if there were, it was now
purged, did see the Divine Essence before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of their bodies, and the general Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
§. 1. For the deciding of which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>John xxii.</hi> enjoyned the Cardinals, Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and Divines, in a Publick Consistorie,
That they should deliberately speak what they
thought of it, when he should demand it; but
being prevented by death could not perfect it:
Now <hi>Benedict</hi> the xii. after a diligent exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and deliberation with the Cardinals of
the Sacred Roman Church, and by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
cleerly defines this question. §. 2. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi>
And another, concerning souls deparned in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
sin. §. 4. And commands, that it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against such as pertinaciously hold,
or assert the contrary, as against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
§. 5. And hereunto he adds a penal
Sanction.</p>
            <p>This is the whole <hi>Compendium</hi> of <hi>Cherubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
who directly with the Pope states our
present Question, and delivers us, that it
stands <hi>defined.</hi> And yet against this evidence
to which you your self appeal, you have
the confidence to tell us, The sole and only
<hi>Question</hi> was: <hi>Whether perfect Charity brings
an immediate heaven?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. Now, Sir, it is not possible for
you to perswade an intelligen Reader, as you
endeavor <hi>page 24)</hi> that there was one onely
<hi>Question</hi> disputed and defined in that time.
The <hi>Pope</hi> himself, and <hi>Cherubinus</hi> to whom
you appeal, have in <hi>terms</hi> made two. First,
<hi>Concerning the souls of Iust men, in which
nothing remains to be purged, when they pass
out of this life?</hi> And secondly, <hi>Of those souls
in which something is to be purged.</hi> And that
there were more Questions then <hi>one</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by this self-same <hi>Bull,</hi> that very Title
which you say, <hi>page</hi> 10. belongs to it, and
stands printed at <hi>Rome, 1617. A definition of
certain Articles concerning the blessed vision of
God, and the Beatitude and damnation of souls;</hi>
will clearly evince. Let my Reader consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the word <hi>Articles,</hi> the several states of
souls, of which our holy <hi>Faith</hi> is here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and I think he will rest satisfied, it
was not <hi>one</hi> only question, much less your only
question of <hi>Charity,</hi> which stands here defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to us. Nor will that <hi>Criticism,</hi> that the
Pope styles it <hi>Quaestio, a Question,</hi> and after
him <hi>Cherubinus,</hi> at all avail you; for every
one knows that where a question is stated
of any Subject, which suffers divisions, and
subdivisions, it comprehends in it all those
several questions, which of every one of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53988:15"/>
those divisions, and subdivisions may justly
be made; and so it is in our very business,
where the present question <hi>concerning the state
of departed souls,</hi> extends to all the several
conditions of souls, which departed this life.
And that it was the <hi>Popes</hi> design, and full
purpose, to deliver us what of all these we
stand bound to believe, will appear evidently
by his exact division and enumeration of the
several conditions, in which souls depart from
this their earthly habitation: Both of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
who after Baptism received, dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the use of <hi>freewill:</hi> Of those who
coming to the use of Reason, after <hi>Baptism</hi>
incur no blemish of sin: Of those who in
the same supposition, have incurred the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of sin, and yet depart this life, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fully satisfied, by worthy fruits of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
Of those who in the same supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have incurred the blemish of sin, and
have not made full satisfaction, but pass out
of this life with a guilt of temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due in the next: And lastly, of those
who depart this life in mortal sin, and enmity
to God, of all which he here delivers our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Faith; so unquestionable a truth it is, it
was not one only, or your only single question
of <hi>Charity,</hi> which stands here defined: And
truly Sir, if your patience had held out, to

read but to the end of the second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Scholion</hi>
of this said <hi>Cherubinus,</hi> to whom you appeal,
you would have found not only this <hi>one</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<hi>of the souls of just men, who depart this
life without any need of being purged in the
next,</hi> or this other, <hi>of those souls which so
leave their bodies with a guilt of punishment in
the next life;</hi> but eight more questions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
and decided, even according to this
<hi>Cherubinus</hi> his judgment, by this self same
<hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pope Benedict</hi> the xii. For thus he

            <p>Now Sir, when you have perused and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

in young men. But I beseech you Sir,
how could those <hi>solid, cleer-sighted persons,</hi>
give you the confidence to impose so grosly
upon us? to state us here a question, of which
the <hi>Bull</hi> delivers not one word: of which
<hi>Cherubinus,</hi> to whom you appeal, makes not
the least mention, and yet you confidently
add, <hi>All Learned Writers agree.</hi> pag. 14. Where
if you had not named <hi>Writers,</hi> I should have
judged, you appeal'd to your <hi>solid clear-sighted</hi>

I cannot pardon this your so confident impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
on your Reader; You tell us, our present
controversie, <hi>concerning the delivery of souls
out of Purgatory,</hi> stands not here defined,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53988:18"/>
because the Word <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is not in the

is not in the <hi>Bull,</hi> whilst there is not the

related in <hi>Spondanus,</hi> which occasioned this

the Decree, nor in the Decree it self, nor any
thing that follows it, the <hi>Pope</hi> pronounces of
<hi>Charity</hi> I, or <hi>no;</hi> much less doth he declare
either the affirmative or negative of this your
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53988:18"/>
new <hi>Question,</hi> to <hi>secure</hi> it; nor is there the
least hint in <hi>Cherurbinus</hi> of it, I gave my
Reader his whole <hi>Compendium,</hi> that he might
see, how far you were transported with the
high esteem of your <hi>solid clear-sighted</hi> Friends,
when you appeal to him, who thus agreeing
with the <hi>Pope</hi> pronounces against you
<hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do your Arguments drawn from <hi>holy

punishments</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> so earnestly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
in his Preface to this <hi>definition</hi> at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
you. Alas Sir, the whole systeme of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, every part and parcell of it, is
directed, to plant, to kindle <hi>holy desires</hi> in our
Souls; and yet I think you will not easily
avow, there is nothing else defined, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to us, in this whole fabrick, but
purely and precisely, that <hi>perfect Charity
brings an immediate heaven;</hi> nor will it be
any plea for you, that this was then the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because the <hi>Pope</hi> ushers his Definition
with this Exhortation to <hi>holy desires,</hi> (which
might very well and properly introduce any
Position of Christian Religion whatsoever, and
peculiarly this, because by <hi>progress</hi> in <hi>vertue</hi>
and <hi>holy desires,</hi> our endeavours are rendred
more effectual for souls in that distressed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
as very neer allyed to his Decrees,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53988:19"/>
               <hi>concerning the state of departed souls:</hi> For
how neer a tye soever, the one hath to the
other, though it were by an immediate, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
evident consequence, yet it is highly
unlawful to change the state of the present
<hi>question,</hi> and impose upon us, that not it,
but some other, thus allyed to it, stands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
by the Decree. When the Church
combated the <hi>Eutychian Heresie,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
two natures in Christ, no Christian dare
affirm, it onely then defined the plurality of
Wills against the <hi>Monothelites:</hi> because these
two questions, have so necessary and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
a connexion. And can you hope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
an ignorant Reader, that when the
Pope defines: <hi>That after purgation, even
before the re-assumption of their bodies, departed
souls are received into heaven:</hi> he defines
nothing at all about <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but onely this,
that <hi>perfect Charity brings an immediate hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
though he hath not any thing like this
Position in his <hi>Bull:</hi> and that this should be
fixed on the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Cherubinus,</hi> and all
Learned Authors to boote. I hope then Sir,
you will pardon my boldness, if I challenge
you fairly with this: If you do not make it
appear, by those unknown Learned Authors in
<hi>terms,</hi> that yours was the question, and not
that of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> we shall judg you have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53988:19"/>
wrong'd them as much, as now to our eyes, you
have imposed on the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Cherubinus:</hi> And
I justly challenge it of you, that you bring
us it, in <hi>terms,</hi> and not by a consequence of
a second or third remove, or else your sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in citing Authors, will be highly questionable
by your Reader, or indeed now past
<hi>Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly I wondred at the first perusal of
this part of your Book, why you should use
this sleight to prepossess the unwary Reader;
but afterwards by the rest of your discourse,
I easily observed it was but made use of, to
render, by this art of changing the question,
a plawsible answer to this <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi>
otherwise unavoidable: and yet I discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at last a further design, which no man but a
Prophet could have foreseen, to wit; that
you might fix upon your Adversary, that <hi>he,</hi>
not <hi>you,</hi> stands guilty of disowning these sacred
authorities, and that forsooth, because he
opposes the efficacy of holy <hi>charity,</hi> the
<hi>Queen of vertues,</hi> which you, and your <hi>Master</hi>

<hi>The middle sorts</hi> (sayes he) <hi>who
are to teach the simple people,</hi> are obliged to
believe some of these points (that is such
as are determined, by the holy <hi>Church</hi> in her
<hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Consistories) Explicitely: though
not all these Points singly, nor all these Persons
equally, but according to their several state
and learning, whereby they are to instruct the
ignorant: As for example, they are all bound
to believe explicitely that the souls of just
men departed without sin, as of little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;
or if they have sinned, have here or in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53988:20"/>
Purgatory fully satisfied, are pass'd into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before the day of Iudgment: according
to the Church</hi>'s <hi>determination, making it a
matter of faith, in the extravagant</hi> of <hi>Pope

            <p>

of the Pope in our present <hi>Bull,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I proceed further in your Answer, let
us take a short survey of the <hi>Florentin Council,</hi>
of which I can not but blame you of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
in that you give your Reader so slender
an account: And if <hi>I must not flatter your
sloth,</hi> I know not how otherwise to excuse
it, then that you were not conversant at all
in it; and so you rested satisfied, with what
your <hi>cleer-sighted</hi> friends told you, or <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi>
his, <hi>Vbi hoc idem firmatum fuit:</hi>
since (if it were possible) the Council seems
more full and home to our <hi>Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first, In the Third Article which the
<hi>Publishers</hi> gave you it <hi>defines; If truely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
Souls shall depart this life, before they
have satisfied for their Commissions and Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
by worthy fruits of Penance: that
their Souls are purged by the punishments of
Purgatory after their bodies death, &amp;c.</hi>
Which Doctrine can finde no admittance
in your new modell; for all the sufferings
of souls, which you fancy by their irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53988:21"/>
and now unchangeable affections, avail
nothing as to the <hi>Purging</hi> or cleansing of
<hi>Souls</hi> in their state of Separation: since that
is wholly reserved, by you, to the change of
those affections at the re-union. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
when <hi>Art.</hi> 4. upon this Doctrine of
the Council so said down, it pursues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto us: <hi>That Souls which are purged
either in their bodies, ar being uncloathed of
their bodies (as is above said) are presently
received into heaven.</hi> I would have you to
observe, how this further Doctrine of the
delivery of them, and the compleating of
this <hi>purging</hi> being <hi>uncloathed of their bodies,</hi>
is by this Parenthesis, <hi>as is above said,</hi> wholly
built on the former Doctrine, of the <hi>purging</hi>
itself: And it will be unavoidable, since
there is a <hi>Purgation</hi> of <hi>souls</hi> by the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Purgatory</hi> against you; that there
also is as effectually concluded, a compleat
<hi>Purgation</hi> of them whilst <hi>uncloathed</hi> of their
bodies, and an immediate delivery, perfectly
condemning, and destructive of your Doctrine
in the very point in Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that my Reader may have a cleerer
view of this unavoidable Truth, let us set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and compare this Doctrine of the</hi>
Council <hi>with yours. The Council</hi> defines,
That truly penitent souls which depart this life
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53988:21"/>
before they have satisfied for their sins, are
purged by the punishments of Purgatory after
death; and being thus purged uncloathed of
their bodies, are presently received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<hi>Or as the</hi> Pope <hi>more</hi> expresly <hi>pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
before the reassumption of their bodies, and
the general Iudgment. <hi>Now how happily do
you, and your new Master agree with this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
when you tell us,</hi> Souls which depart
this life with affections to corporal pleasures,
suffer a vast grief, by reason those pleasures
are now impossible to be enjoyed, but they are
now in an unchangeable condition both as to the
affections their torment, and the state it self.
So that there is no hope they should ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
before reunion with their bodies; for
though they suffer by their inordinate unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
affections, yet not possibly as to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or change of their state or sufferings, whilest
uncloathed of their bodies; and therefore can
not Presently, be received into Heaven, or before
the Re-assumption of their said bodies, and the
general Day of Iudgment. <hi>And I would have
you further to observe and weigh the words;</hi>
Sunt purgatae, are now purged, <hi>in the preterper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect
Tense,</hi> either in their bodies, <hi>(which you do
not deny compleatly perfected in some souls,
in this life,) or</hi> uncloathed of their bodies,
<hi>which still irrationally,</hi> gratis, <hi>and wilfully
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53988:22"/>
you deny, though the</hi> Council <hi>defines of both in
the same form and style of words,</hi> Sunt purgatae,
they are now purged. <hi>Which cleerly imports a</hi>
Purgation <hi>now past, and perfectly compleated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we Will take our rise a little Higher,
from the very process of both the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin</hi> Fathers in this business of <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
now assembled at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
(though afterwards translated to <hi>Florence</hi>
and so is called the <hi>Florentin Council,)</hi> began.
For there in the very beginning of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in order to this Decree, this Question of
<hi>Purgatory</hi> was handled. See <hi>tom. 4. Concil.
Gen. oct. Synod. Quaestio de Purgatorio.</hi> And
both the Latin and Greek Fathers lay down
their several Positions of Purgatory. And
First the Latins thus begin. <hi>We do believe in
this world, a Purgatory fire: by which the
souls guilty of lighter faults (that is) veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
sins, are purged. For those who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
their sins, and have received the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Body of Christ, and presently die before
previous satisfaction: without doubt in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
fire, which is commonly called Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
are purged; and together with the help of
the Church, the prayers of Priests, Masses, and
Alms, are expiated.</hi> After this the Greeks
lay down their perswasion of <hi>Purgatory</hi> in
this manner. <hi>We judge</hi> (say they) <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
not to be a fire, but a darksome placee full
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53988:22"/>
of afflictions, in which souls now being, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of Divine Light; but that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated
and freed, from this darksome place and
torments, by the help of the Church, the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Priests, Masses, Alms, &amp;c.</hi> Now
Sir, it were beyond all the degrees of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to assert that the question of <hi>Purgatory</hi>
was not here disputed or <hi>defined:</hi> Or that
they talked onely of <hi>Charity, as being an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
disposition to bliss.</hi> And it is most
cleer, that out of these several professions,
in which both sides agreed against you, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and home to our Point in question, of an
<hi>expiation</hi> and <hi>delivery</hi> from this <hi>Purgatory</hi>
(either a <hi>fire,</hi> or a darksome place,) issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out this definition <hi>(Being purged, uncloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
of this body, presently)</hi> opposite to your
Errour. And I would have my Reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how positively, it was intended by the
Council, to deliver us the Faith of the Church
conformable to the unanimous Doctrine of
both parties, both of the <hi>expiation</hi> or perfect
<hi>Purging</hi> of Souls, when <hi>uncloathed of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and of their <hi>present delivery,</hi> whilest
<hi>uncloated,</hi> for in all this, both the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin</hi> Fathers cleerly agreed, against this new
School: which when he shall have considered,
I doubt not but he will rest satisfied, it can not
be an act of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> but of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53988:23"/>
               <hi>Will,</hi> which forces the word <hi>Presently</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
(if it signifie any thing at all by these
moderns) <hi>at the day of Iudgement,</hi> which
was not the time, either the <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi>
Fathers ever thought of, but of the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
time of separation, whirh is our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
now in hand. But because this Point
is excellently well handled, by an eminently
Learned Person of out Nation, who with
unavoidable strength pursues it more at large,
in a Paper which came lately to my hands, I
will presume to give it my Reader in his own
words at the end of my discourse <hi>[Letter</hi> C.]
And further Sir, for your more compleat and
full satisfaction, since with confidence enough
you strongly assert, That it is <hi>Incomparably
false, that either the Pope or Council ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to settle this Point of the delivery of
Souls out of Purgatory before reunion.</hi> I will
add to the Paper of this great Divine, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of a School-fellow of yours, (yet if I
mistake not, a much better proficient, in
your <hi>Masters</hi> Doctrine, certainly much more
<hi>ingenuous)</hi> who vanquished with the evidence
of this Truth, acknowledges, what indeed
he could not with any modesty deny, <hi>That this
your new Doctrine of Purgatory stands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by both the Bull and Council:</hi> and yet
he was so captivated, that he endeavours to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53988:23"/>
sustain it by other grounds, he had now learnt
in your School. My Reader shall find his
Letter at large, <hi>[Letter</hi> D.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. But before I pass any further,
since I have already told you, that both <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
White,</hi> the Author of this <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and
his abler <hi>Scholars</hi> are armed against the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
both of <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> it will not
be out of my Readers way, but very much
conducing to my design of giving him a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
of this School, if now by some short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on the Doctrine delivered both by
this <hi>ingenious</hi> Gentleman, and Master <hi>White</hi>
himself, I make good that charge. For by
them it will appear to what unavoidable exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
the defence of new Fabricks in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
drive those, who wedded to their
preconceived <hi>Phylosophical fancies,</hi> are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ro square their <hi>belief</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This ingenuous Scholar confesses,</hi> That
truly according to the opinion that the Holy
Ghosts assistance in Councils and Consistories
it without restriction or limitation: the Paper
delivered [Letter <hi>C.]</hi> seems to him to evidence
a deliverance of Souls out of Purgatory, before
the Day of Iudgment. But according to the
opinion, that the assistance of the Holy Ghost,
in Councils and Consistories, is no longer then
there is a diligent search to find out what Christ
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53988:24"/>
taught, and the Apostles delivered as so taught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there appears onely, that the Council of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Pope Benedict, did think it to be so,
which may raise opposition to a disobedience,
but not to an Heresie. &amp;c. So that unless We
shew that the Council of Florence and Pope Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict
determined conformably to Tradition;
Mr. Blacklowes <hi>(that is Master Whites)</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the doctrine and practice new, will not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the least of Heresie, <hi>&amp;c. But foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the strange consequences of this Doctrine,
he therefore Adds,</hi> This puts all to a loss;
for how shall it be known, that Councils and
Consistories apply themselves aright? Easily
<hi>(says he)</hi> by examining Tradition of what
you have seen and heard. This is the common
light, and plain way promised, to keep even fools
from straying from Christs Doctrine. <hi>Thus he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Sir this Exterminating Doctrine was
learnt in Master</hi> Whites <hi>School, where it is
but too too frequent. And first, as to the</hi>
infallibility <hi>of the</hi> Pope, <hi>without which no
submission, as to Faith, can take place. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

               <hi>(now being constituted by God a

it with</hi> sound of trumpet, <hi>and

the Councils, in his</hi> Tab. Suff. tab. 22. <hi>This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his signal Doctrine.</hi> Non est impossibile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
It is not impossible that the Pope or Council should
attempt to establish that, (as now of Faith, which
was some time before not of Faith) and by that
very attempt fall into an error, and even promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
that error, <hi>&amp;c. And further he tells us,</hi> As
to a certain prophetick inspiration immediately
and miraculously, enlightning the Council or
Pope, if constantly and by the ordinary Law
of God it be asserted to be required; it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
fabulous, and asserted without any solid
ground. <hi>Thus he. Upon these grounds (I
say) did this good proficient in this his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
School, endeavour to sustain your other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ruinous Fabrick of</hi> Purgatory; <hi>for in
truth there is no other means left to support
it, but by the destruction of all the Authority
of both</hi> Popes <hi>and</hi> Councils <hi>to deliver us our
holy Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53988:25"/>
And now I desire my Reader to consider,
(for his just and full satisfaction of the design
of this School) that if these grounds be once
admitted, Christian Faith, (which they now
combat,) is a meer mockery. For if after all
the Canons of <hi>Councils,</hi> all the <hi>Anathmaes</hi>
pronounced against any Opinion, (the very
<hi>Anathema</hi> it self carrying with it, and being
an exercise of that power, invested in the
<hi>Church</hi> to oblige us to submission and <hi>beleef,)
it still remains to be showen, that the Pope or
Council determined conformably to Tradition,
or else Master Whites styling the doctrine and
profession new, will not savour the least of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie;</hi>
or that <hi>it is not impossible, a Council
may err, and promulgate an errour,</hi> we are
at an irrecoverable loss: For no <hi>Catholick</hi>
claims any other assurance of his <hi>Faith,</hi> then
upon this firm foundation, that <hi>our holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Church, is his infallible Directress.</hi>
That <hi>the Councils her mouth are the unerring
Deliveres of Truth.</hi> Which if it stand no
firm <hi>absolutely,</hi> but upon a <hi>supposition</hi> of a
<hi>due application</hi> (it being impossible we should
have any higher or more authentique proof, of
this supposition, then the Council it self) there
is no <hi>security,</hi> no <hi>assurance</hi> left of any thing
delivered by them.</p>
            <p>Not so (says he) <hi>We may easily know,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:53988:25"/>
when Councils and Consistories apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
aright, by examining tradition, of
<hi>what we have seen and heard.</hi> And shall I a
private an illiterate <hi>Christian</hi> (not yet <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with these solid and cleer-sighted
Persons)</hi> recall all the decrees of <hi>Councils</hi> to a
new examine? is there still a higher Court,
to which I may and ought to appeal, from
their sentence, as to a superiour <hi>Iudg</hi> and
Umpire over them? shall I take this liberty
upon me, to censure their Proceeds, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
to reject their <hi>definitions,</hi> as my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall find them consonant to, or disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
from, <hi>what I have seen and heard?</hi> and
if they were to receive their approbation
from this Court: How can I (unless a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
pride blind me) hope, that my indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
in the search, my ability to find, shall
not only equallize, but even exceed that of
five hundred, perhaps a thousand <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Prelates,</hi> and the scrutiny of numberless
<hi>Divines,</hi> assisting them in this <hi>Inquest?</hi> And
even to ease us of this sollicitude, you see
what exact care is taken, in these proceeds.
<hi>Pope Benedict</hi> here tells you of the holy
<hi>Church, that she teaches nothing rashly, brings
in nothing unwarily, introduces nothing in faith
unadvisedly.</hi> And hence it is that all such
sacred <hi>decisions</hi> are still ushered in, with some
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53988:26"/>
               <hi>such expressions as these.</hi> After an humble
invocation of the holy Ghost. After a careful

not this the utter <hi>Extermination</hi> of all that
<hi>authority</hi> we hitherto have believed the
<hi>Church</hi> is furnished with, to deliver us
our holy <hi>Faith?</hi> Is not this to resolve finally
<hi>(en dernier resort,)</hi> our <hi>Creed</hi> into our own
brests, to make every idle head competent
Judge of <hi>Popes, Councils, Consistories, All;</hi>
And them Judges of just nothing? wherein
do those loose bands of disagreeing <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
all disagree from us, and all agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, but in this that we acquiesce and
submit to the holy <hi>Church,</hi> as the faithful
keeper and dispenser of our <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi>
and so submit, that from her sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
we admit no <hi>Appeal,</hi> against her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
we admit no <hi>Contradiction,</hi> whilst they
by a supereminent pride, assume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a power to judg <hi>this Pillar of Truth,</hi>
and resolve All into their own <hi>capriccioes, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

And yet I pray you consider whether by this
appealing from the Church to Tradition;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53988:26"/>
               <hi>what we have seen and heard:</hi> we are not
sunk into a deeper sink of Errour, of <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy,</hi>

which (though irrationally) they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
as <hi>Canonical;</hi> they admit their Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as authentick, and contest the sense
onely with the <hi>Church,</hi> whilst this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
affoords us a far more full and ample
reserve to evacuate all <hi>Faith</hi> at our pleasures:
since it is still in our power, and we compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Judges, what is <hi>Tradition;</hi> what <hi>not:</hi>
where the Council proceeded with <hi>due Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
upon the <hi>depositum</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> where
upon the uncertain wavering opinions of
<hi>Schoolmen,</hi> or pretended assistance of the

in these &amp; these Points in particular. He and
Master <hi>White</hi> more modestly and shily mince
the matter, and teach us that <hi>possibly</hi> onely,
or <hi>not impossibly, the Council may err, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate

that these inconveniencies are saved, by this

<hi>Tab.</hi> 22. For there having delivered this his
Doctrine against the infallibility of <hi>Councils,</hi>
he presently adds: <hi>But it is impossible that
such an errour</hi> (thus promulg'd by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil)
<hi>should pass into an establisht Doctrine of
the Church, and be accepted as a Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by the Fathers, and preached by
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as to the first, it will presently appear
even in this our question, that if their new
model of <hi>Purgatory</hi> be subsistent, not only
<hi>possibly,</hi> or <hi>not impossibly,</hi> but <hi>de facto,</hi> the
Florentin Council and <hi>Church</hi> hath erred in
this <hi>particular.</hi> And since to say, even <hi>not
impossibly</hi> the Council may err, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all assurance is now pulled up; I
know not but this Doctrine is as high, and
higher <hi>Independancy</hi> then theirs: And as to
those words of Master <hi>Whites.</hi> I answer, that
they notwithstanding, it is still in his power
by his former Doctrine <hi>(that it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

error)</hi> to evacuate all the <hi>Canons</hi> of all the
<hi>Councils</hi> at his pleasures; for however the
Authority of the Council now stands ingaged
in the definition of any Doctrine: however
the Decree is now <hi>published</hi> to the whole
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53988:27"/>
world, however the <hi>Church</hi> accept of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
however all <hi>Catholiques</hi> submit to the
<hi>Decree,</hi> yet it remains still in his power to
say, <hi>It never passed into an established Doctrine
of the Church,</hi> whilest he, or his <hi>cleer-sighted</hi>
Scholars intend to shake it. And how far
this his reserve of <hi>an establisht Doctrine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by Fathers, and preached by Christ,</hi>
extends, will sufficiently appear in his very
attempt of the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in our
Question of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> (For I have reason
to beleeve, he had a special regard to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> when he renounced thus
the Authority of <hi>Councils.)</hi> The consciences
of all the illiterate <hi>Catholiques</hi> bear witness,
that the delivery of Souls from <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is
now their received <hi>Faith,</hi> from their present
<hi>Pastors</hi> and Teachers; no <hi>Divine</hi> but knows,
that for Three hundred years and upwards,
ever since the promulgation of <hi>Pope Benedict</hi>
his <hi>Bull,</hi> no Orthodox Writer but submits
to his <hi>Decree</hi> as <hi>unquestionable: Master
White</hi> himself tells us, That St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the
<hi>great</hi> was the first Founder of that <hi>Faith</hi> (we
now fight for) a thousand years ago, pursued
and sustained by the numberless number of
incomparably eminent <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi>
In sum, if there be any Article of our <hi>Faith</hi>
witnessed, any establisht, it is this: not any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53988:28"/>
one carrying after it a more ample continued
<hi>practise,</hi> not any one testified by so many
<hi>Foundations, Prayers, Masses, Almes,</hi> &amp;c.
as this. And yet <hi>this is no establisht Doctrine
of the Church: It is not a Truth delivered by
Fathers, as preacht by Christ.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he being overwhelmed with the consent
of the whole <hi>Church</hi> for a thousand years,
appeals with the <hi>Protestants</hi> to the Primitive
Ages immediate to <hi>Christ;</hi> their <hi>plea</hi> and
his being just the same, differing onely in
this, that they say, the substance of <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
is not the <hi>establisht Doctrine of the Church as
delivered by Fathers, preacht by Christ:</hi> He,
that the <hi>delivery of Souls from thence,</hi> is not
even yet <hi>established.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

(as our ingenious Scholar says) <hi>to keep fools
from straying,</hi> but the way to make <hi>fools
stray,</hi> and supposes a high folly in him who
accepts it; who leaves the received Doctrine
of the holy <hi>Church,</hi> to gadd after new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
of a modern <hi>Divine.</hi> But the way to keep
both fools and wise men from straying, is
that which all the wise men in the world have
hitherto followed, to acquiesce, to submit, to
the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Pillar of Truth,</hi> without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>dispute</hi> or <hi>reserve,</hi> without further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of her <hi>Decrees,</hi> by <hi>what we have seen

call the Decrees of <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> to a
new trial by this Touchstone of <hi>Tradition,</hi> by
asking his very Question, <hi>What we have seen
and heard?</hi> my Adversary hath lost his cause.
For to this Question, being proposed in our
present controversie of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> what can
we with truth answer; but that we have <hi>seen</hi>
innumerable <hi>Masses, Dirges, Alms,</hi> &amp;c?
and that we have constantly <hi>heard,</hi> that <hi>souls
are delivered out of Purgatory by these power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
helps, before the Day of Iudgment?</hi> And
what can we with truth answer; but that we
have hitherto <hi>beleeved</hi> this; and if we are
still our selves, and are not <hi>so inconstant as
to be carried away wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h the wind of a new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
we do <hi>beleeve</hi> it, and shall continue to
<hi>believe it.</hi> And for the proof of this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I appeal safely even to the Consciences
of those few Proselytes this new Master,
<hi>Master White,</hi> hath gained: Whether till of
late this new Systeme of <hi>Purgatory</hi> came to
light, they ever entertained the least doubt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53988:29"/>
of it? Whether it were not their full <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion?</hi>
A <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they beleeved to
have been delivered with as firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
an <hi>Authority,</hi> as any other whatsoever?
Whether ever they divided this, from the rest
of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and allowed it a less degree
of assurance onely, as of <hi>Opinion?</hi> Nor will
it avail my Adversary to say, That it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his full <hi>perswasion,</hi> bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not his <hi>beleef;</hi>
he never understood it, (though delivered to
him from his present <hi>Pastors)</hi> as the <hi>Faith</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> but onely as <hi>the generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Opinion of Divines:</hi> and that in truth he
never ranked it among the Articles of his
<hi>Creed,</hi> but in a lower form, of I know not
what <hi>consent</hi> of <hi>Schoolmen.</hi> For the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all Mankind will refute this falshood.
And confident I am, if a long perswasion of
his now received <hi>Doctrine</hi> hath not effaced
the memory of his past disposition of <hi>soul,</hi>
his own conscience bears witness against him.
For as to the whole Universality of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
they still assert and sustain this <hi>Faith;</hi>
they hear not of this <hi>novelty</hi> without horrour.
And for that handfull of persons who are
(thanks be to God) not one in a million,
who have of late embraced the contrary:
let them (for it highly concerns them) due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examine their consciences, Whether the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53988:30"/>
private esteem of their Master, Master <hi>White,</hi>
the <hi>Authour</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine;</hi> the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
new apprehensions he introduces, in lieu
of that great terrour and fear they before were
in, of the sufferings of that state: the easing
their Consciences from the incumbent care of
assisting their departed friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, (for all this
is immediately wrought by an acceptance of
this <hi>Position)</hi> hath not wrought upon their
<hi>inconstancy</hi> to abandon the Tents of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and to list themselves in this new
Squadron, to impugn their pious <hi>Mother:</hi> to
forsake a formerly received <hi>Beleef,</hi> now to
adhere to a new <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which certainly at
the first proposal checkt their former perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the holy <hi>Faith</hi> planted in their <hi>Souls.</hi>
Nor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath the contrary Assertion any thing
but a bold confidence to warrant it; for we
know, we feel, we experience in our selves
this <hi>Beleef. We</hi> do beleeve the <hi>Councils can
not misguide us.</hi> We do beleeve the <hi>delivery
of Souls, before the Day of Iudgment.</hi> This is
our <hi>Faith</hi> as firm as a <hi>Rock,</hi> not to be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by all the <hi>Sophistry</hi> of the world. If it
were possible (as certainly it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
that it could be evidenced that our <hi>faith</hi>
of both these is erroneous: yet certainly it
could never carry any f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That his own condemnation might be the

Thus then he makes <hi>Luthers,</hi> and his own

<hi>of the Doctrine of which he stands suspected</hi>
(and much more if now he hath sustained
in Print) <hi>whether he believes</hi> (this his new
Doctrine of Purgatory) <hi>to be that Doctrin</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:53988:31"/>
which this present Age he now lives in, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from their Fathers, of the immediate
foregoing Age? Whether he received it in
his childhood, when he was first instructed
in Christian belief, and which, till he now
became a Doctor, he followed? And let him
answer for himself (for what other answer
can he make) then that <hi>(this his new broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Purgatory)</hi> is not that Doctrin he thus was
taught, whilst he was yet a Child: But
that it is better Doctrine then the former, which
he himself hath now evinced out of sacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents:
<hi>Heathen Poets, out of the Bowels
and Principles of Nature, by Demonstration,
And that the contrary Doctrine to which he
had been bred, took its rise onely from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the nature of separated substances.</hi>
And let the faithfull people <hi>(says he)</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass

new Doctrine fights against the known Laws of
your Country? that such an Author as you are

his presumption with death? Do you not
know that you now fight against the Fathers
and Monuments of Antiquity? that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

impugne that reverence due to our most dear

the Position of this our Master, as we shall
<hi>presently see.)</hi> And that this truth was left
by God to him, to be revealed and manifested to
the Church: Of which Position the vulgar
Christians, as a sluggish Cattel not at all given
to speculation know nothing, and so he contemns
them; he laughs at the Doctours, he styles
the Saints lyars, because men: but that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is the first to whom God hath made known
so great a mystery. But though he be a most
arrogant person, let him weigh with him, and
consider: Though I have hitherto contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this sublime and happy truth: But when
I come to propose this Doctrine to others, they
will presently object, <hi>and ask whether</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith hath any other ground of its secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
then a continued succession through all ages
to our present time? Do you <hi>Sir</hi> promise this
new light, <hi>of science, of Demonstration?</hi> If
I deny it, will they not presently hiss me out?
Will they not cry out to the faggot with me?
And shall we believe that in such a disposition
of the faithful people, that (such an <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour)</hi>
will dare to print or publish his novelty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or that he shall hope to find either buyers of his
Book, or followers of his Doctrine, <hi>Thus he.
And thus</hi> Sir, <hi>your great Master pleads the
cause, and arraigns</hi> himself, <hi>and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53988:33"/>
of his new</hi> Purgatory, <hi>thus he thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and lightens, and I think home to our
purpose, for the consciences of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
bear witness against it, the</hi> unlearned <hi>know
it is</hi> improbable, <hi>and the</hi> learned <hi>see it is</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
            <p>Having said this to the ingenuous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>Letter,</hi> who is a

short reflections on his and his Masters

an effectual admonition to him, both to see
and repent, that he hath entred himself
a <hi>Scholar</hi> into this dangerous <hi>School,</hi> and

            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. And now <hi>Sir</hi> I hope this better
proficients judgment will be of some weight,
since he is your School-fellow. I think an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
understanding will be convinced,
by that evidence I have already brought: the
undoubted intention of the <hi>Pope</hi> was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us our holy Faith, in all the several
conditions of <hi>souls,</hi> which depart this mortal
life, either in the state of grace, or out of it;
either which need, or need not any Purgation
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53988:33"/>
in the next life, and for the <hi>Council,</hi>
besides the strength of words of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
the very <hi>Process</hi> of it, the several
Doctrines of the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek
Churches</hi> in order to this Decree, will
evince that their intentions reach as home, to
our purpose, as their words. But because the
Reverend Esteem of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ur new <hi>Master,</hi> and
of those <hi>solid,</hi> and <hi>cleer-sighted</hi> persons stop
your eares against the voice of the Church:
Let us try that Musick which certainly would
cure you of this <hi>Tarantula.</hi> What if we
could obtain your new <hi>Master</hi> to plead on the
behalf of that Faith we now maintain? this
certainly would prevail: Let us attempt
it then; if you are not as yet so good a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in your new School, that you are ready
to believe, the <hi>Council</hi> erred in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
question of <hi>Purgatory:</hi> I doubt not to
conclude you out of your Masters own
grounds. Master <hi>White</hi> then layes you down
this fundamental Doctrine. <hi>The Church</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>in her definitions of Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
onely on tradition: and declares to us,
that Depositum of Faith, which was handed
down from Christ, and his Apostles, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
number of Fathers and Pastors, to
their numberless children and flock, through
age to age, even to any one detèrminate moment.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53988:34"/>
When then any controversie is to be decided,
and a Council is summoned to declare our
Faith; what course is then taken? surely no
other then this. The Fathers there gathered,
lay down that Faith thus handed down to
them, which they received from their precedent

let it not be denyed, but the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentin
Council</hi> proceeded in that very way he
hath chalked out for them, in onr present
<hi>question,</hi> and my work is done. Let us take a
view of the <hi>Council.</hi> Both the Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Fathers meet first at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> afterwards
at <hi>Florence;</hi> their business there is to declare
the Faith of the Church, <hi>concerning the state
of souls which depart this life;</hi> and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
concerning the Souls which are detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Purgatory:</hi> both sides lay down their
hitherto received Faith, in order to a decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Let us see how happily they agree with
this new molded <hi>Purgatory.</hi> And first as to
the <hi>Latins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against Master</hi> White, <hi>who pretends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstate,</hi>
that no material agent can work
upon the soul in its state of separation; <hi>they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53988:34"/>
believe</hi> that souls guilty of venial impurities,
are purged by this fire, <hi>directly against Master</hi>
White <hi>who holds;</hi> there is no purging of the
soul in the state of separation, neither by fire,
nor not by fire; for this is reserved to the reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
when her now torment, her irregular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
shall be changed. <hi>They believe that</hi>
souls there detained, by this fire together with
the help of the Church, the Prayers of the
Priests, Masses, Almes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Expiated.
<hi>directly against Master</hi> White, <hi>in the point in
Question,</hi> both as to the indivisible duration of
the state, <hi>he pretends to demonstrate,</hi> and
the unchangeableness of it, <hi>and the</hi> continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it till the day of Iudgment. <hi>Being
thus unfortunate with the</hi> Latins, <hi>who must
needs have thrust this new</hi> School <hi>out of their
Communion; let us see what favour it would
find with the</hi> Greeks. <hi>These then profess this
belief: That</hi> souls there, are detained in a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
place. <hi>Directly against Master</hi> White, <hi>who
holds that</hi> souls in the state of separation doe
not only abstract from place, but comprehend,
and are in some manner governours, of all place:
<hi>they believe souls are expiated and freed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against Master</hi> White, <hi>who holds</hi> there
is no expiating and freeing of souls, but at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
with their bodies; <hi>they believe</hi> souls
are freed by the Prayers and Sacrifices of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53988:35"/>
Priests, Almes, <hi>&amp;c. directly against Master</hi>
White, <hi>in all the wayes before mentioned,
both as to his</hi> indivisible measure, <hi>or</hi> duration
of souls, <hi>the</hi> unchangeableness of their state,
<hi>and the continuation of</hi> it, till the day of
Iudgment. <hi>And most especially both sides una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
agree against him, in asserting the
efficacy of Prayers, and</hi> Sacrifices <hi>of the</hi>
Priests, <hi>for the dead; for in his new systeme
(as shall be evidenced hereafter) these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
advantage not the souls any thing
at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What wonder then, if out of both the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Professions, thus directly
opposite to <hi>him,</hi> should issue out a <hi>Decree</hi>
directly destructive of this his <hi>Machin:</hi> or
whilst neither part would admit him into
their Communion; they should conspire to
destory his <hi>errour. The sacred Council ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving:
We define</hi> (say they) <hi>that the souls
of them, who after</hi> Baptisme <hi>received, have
contracted no blemish of sin, as also those souls,
who after they have contracted the blemish of sin,
are purged either in their bodies, or being uncloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
of their said bodies, are presently received
into heaven.</hi> What wonders is it, we should have
a purging of <hi>souls uncloathed of their bodies,</hi>
and a <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which both sides agreed against him, destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

of all this new Doctrine? And truly
what to answer to this evidence but by those
other grounds, that the <hi>Council</hi> did not proceed
<hi>with due Application,</hi> and so erred; I cannot
imagine. And now I think I have fulfilled my
promise to my <hi>Reader,</hi> that either this new
model of <hi>Purgatory</hi> cannot subsist, or else
the <hi>Council,</hi> in our very point in question,
hath not only <hi>possibly,</hi> or <hi>not impossibly,</hi> but

               </gap>here indeed, but (say you, <hi>pag.</hi> 19 20. &amp;c.)
they reach not home to our point: The
Popes <hi>ante reassumptionem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>before the reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
depends on the precedent words; <hi>when
after death they shall be purged, and after the
aforesaid purgation,</hi> which words also should
have <hi>stalked</hi> in great Letters; This <hi>purgation</hi>
is indeed <hi>supposed,</hi> but no way <hi>defined:</hi> and
for the <hi>Councils, Presently,</hi> it also depends on
the foregoing words; <hi>being purged, uncloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,</hi>
&amp;c. which presupposes a <hi>purgation</hi> held
by some divines, in the state of <hi>separation,</hi> but
no way <hi>Decrees</hi> it; and since the question
was not then of the truth of this <hi>supposition,</hi>
(as now it is,) but that then it was admittted
without more adoe; you grant us, that in
that <hi>supposition</hi> those words passed into the
<hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councils Decrees:</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> indeed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53988:36"/>
was of the opinion, that the <hi>purgation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f
souls might be compleated in the state of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
but what does that concern you: You
lawfully dissent from his <hi>Opinion</hi> if you find
reason, but not from his <hi>Faith:</hi> where he
<hi>opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

leads;</hi> but where he <hi>defines</hi> you <hi>submit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sir as to this, I wondered at your last
word <hi>submit,</hi> for I understand not you, if
you understand your Master. We are here in a
business of <hi>Faith,</hi> and certainly you pass a
very handsome complement upon the <hi>Pope,</hi>
when you tell him you <hi>submit</hi> to his <hi>definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
If this be real, (since your submission
in <hi>faith</hi> can not be grounded but upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that he is <hi>infallible;)</hi> your <hi>Master</hi> will
instantly discard you out of the School: For
an <hi>Heretick</hi> an <hi>Arch-Heretick;</hi> for an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer
of <hi>Antichrist</hi> into <hi>Christendome:</hi> This
censure he hath fixt on this Doctrine, as I have
told you before.</p>
            <p>But as to your plea, though (to use your
own Phrase) it is <hi>incomparably false,</hi> as is
before evinced; nor can it according to your
<hi>Masters</hi> own grounds take place in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
where they proceed upon the <hi>depositum</hi>
of <hi>Faith:</hi> Yet to give you that satisfaction,
we will joyn issue in this your <hi>subtility,</hi> as if
your plea were allowable. And in truth,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53988:37"/>
when you say that they proceeded on this as a

much blame the boldness of this attempt,
because it will leave very ill consequences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

being so far different: for here St. <hi>Paul</hi>
out of one absurdity which his adversary

your Reader, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councill</hi>
does not only not <hi>Define</hi> against you, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Define</hi> nothing at all, and only dispute
against your Adversary, pressing out of one
impossibility, which he admits, an other which
follows it.</p>
            <p>But you tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 28. and that very
truly, that among the <hi>Divines</hi> in the Schools,
many times such impossible <hi>suppositions</hi> are
sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, to clear a point in question. And yet
you are somewhat unfortunate in your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
for in this example you bring, <hi>If
Iudas had repented heartily, God had been
merciful to him:</hi> This is so far from being a
Question, that no Christian can hold the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.
And for your other, <hi>If there had
been no Trinity, there had been no Incarnation.</hi>
The supposition indeed is impossible: but I
would willingly know, what Divine <hi>Disputes</hi>
it: Since it is impossible, we can have any
light; that in case there should be but one
Person in God, he would not have taken
Humane Nature npon him. But though
your questions be indisputable, others upon

               </gap>itions are: where the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

               </gap>
so it would be nothing) but might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in <hi>possible</hi> terms, though not so justly
home to our understandings. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the <hi>Divines</hi> dispute, <hi>Whether if the
holy Ghost did not proceed from the Son, he
would be distinguisht from the Son?</hi> which
question is no way impertinent: it bearing
this sense in other words, <hi>Whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the holy Ghost from the Son, be the
precise reasen of the distinction between those
two Persons?</hi> And so for our better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of this nicity, is stated in that <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
supposition.</hi> But though this and the

Decrees,</hi> to proceed on such <hi>Metaphysicall
nicityes:</hi> whilst in truth, without these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

told us, <hi>That both the</hi> Pope <hi>and</hi> Councill
<hi>proceeded on such quiddities,</hi> however it
beseemed, or misbeseemed their <hi>Gravities,</hi>
or else you tell us nothing as to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of building these Definitions upon

And yet you would possess your Reader, as if

proceed onely on these niceties and formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

that the Pope spake onely to them: as if we
were bound to beleeve in our <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
in the <hi>Schools,</hi> whatsoever our practise
be out of them. And yet all our practise of
Devotions for the Dead, stands on the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Doctrine: which if built on an
impossible supposition, these formalities can
regulate just nothing. So that the Objection
you made to your self, still remains in full
force: <hi>That this is but an evasion, which</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
<hi>and without any ground you make use of,
to evade an otherwise unavoidable Authority.</hi>
I can not then but lament the misfortune of

or hearkened unto; that you your self
were not called to counsel in this business:
it would have saved both the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>

My Reader may perhaps have met this new

for all those Lights of the <hi>Church</hi> are most

and <hi>nothings.</hi> And besides, because it is
provoked (after the mode of our late cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways
in Faith) to the primitive Ages im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
to Christ: I will (for my Readers
just satisfaction) give him two or three of the
most eminently learned Fathers of those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to which they appeal, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it will appear how far different their
<hi>sentiments</hi> were, both as to the <hi>Substance</hi> of
those sufferings, as well as to the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tinuation</hi>
of them, from <hi>those</hi> of this modern School.
Let Great St. <hi>Augustine</hi> stand in the Front.
<hi>We may not doubt</hi> (says he)
<hi>but that the dead are helped by
the Prayers of the holy Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>Ser.</hi> 32. de <hi>verb.</hi> Apostoli.</note>
               <hi>and by the wholsome Sacrifice, and by the
Almes, which are distributed for their
souls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For this is a Doctrine delivered
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53988:41"/>
by the Fathers, and observed by the whole
Church.</hi> And afterwards; <hi>Now when works
of Mercy are performed for their assistance;
who doubts but that they help them, for whom
prayers are not in vain offered up, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majesty?</hi> &amp;c. This place I choose to
stand in the Front, because it strongly asserts
the Essence of Purgatory derived by <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
from the Fore-fathers, and observed by
the whole Church, and because it is so home
to the relief, those souls receive by our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Alms. And now this great Father
having told us, what he hath thus received
as to the Substance, let him also tell us what
he hath received as to their <hi>Sufferings</hi> there,
and <hi>Continuation</hi> of them.
<hi>Let no man say,</hi>

For surely, that Purgatory fire will be more
severe then any punishment which can be felt
or imagined in this world.</hi>
And again:<note place="margin">Hom. 16. de 50.</note>

               <hi>We must so long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

afterwards erred, yet in all points stood cleer,
when he writ those Learned Commentaries I
here cite.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hom. 14. in Levit.</note> The nature of the
sin <hi>(says he)</hi> is like the
matter which is consumed by
the fire, which as the Apostle
affirms, is built by sinners: who upon the
Foundation of Christ, build Wood, Hay,
Stubble: Whereby is plainly declared, That
some sins are so light, as they may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to Stubble, to which if fire be applied,
it can not stay long in it: Other sins are like
Hay, which the fire also consumes without
much difficulty; though it stayes somewhat
longer then in the Stubble: And other sins are
compared to Wood, in which, according to the
quality of the crimes, the fire finds a lasting
and great substance to feed upon. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
each sin, according to its quality or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
is punished; but for how

Sister</hi> Macrina. As they who purge Gold,
<hi>(saves he)</hi> from its drossie mixture by the
fire, do not onely melt that which is adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
but must of necessity melt that also, which
is pure, together with the counterfeit, bad, and
corrupted matter; which corruption being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
the Gold remains purified: In like sort,
it is also necessary, that whilst the naughtiness
and corruption is consuming in the fire of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;
the soul, which is united to this naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
and corruption, must continue in the fire
until that adulterate, gross, impure, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
matter, be wholly abolisht and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore the torment and sorrow
there suffered, is measured by the quantity of
the Vitiosity <hi>(as he terms it)</hi> and naughtiness,
which is found in each one of the sufferers.
For it is not meet, that both of them, to wit,
he who for a long time hath wallowed in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
evils, and he who hath faln into certain
mean offences, should be equally tormented and
afflicted, by the purgation of his vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
and habitude: but proportionably to the
measure and quantity of the matter, shall that
pain-bringing flame be inkindled, to continue
for a longer or shorter space of time, according
as it shall find fewel to nourish it. The Soul
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53988:43"/>
therefore that is clogg'd with a great inherent
burthen of matter, must necessarily suffer a
great and longer induring flame, which may
waste that matter: But the soul to which that
consuming fire is applied for a less space of time,

               </gap>nishment doth remit, so much of its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
and severe operation, by how much

            <p>I hope, Sir, when you have perused and

               <hi>But it is worth my</hi> Readers <hi>pains to see this

Third Age <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>described at
large in the same Book,</hi> Sect. 9. <hi>and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</hi>
In the tenth Chapter <hi>(sayes he)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
and is perfected, the Enarration of the
Third Age of the Church, which because it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53988:50"/>
is to be prosperous and blessed, and subject to few
evils, therefore it is described onely in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Reason of this is, for since Grace
prefects Nature, and since in rational nature
there are three degrees, or species of knowledg,
by which successively the soul receives increase,
to wit Faith, which governs Children: Opinion,
which steers young men as yet unexperienced
and unskilful: And lastly, Science which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
men now perfect: It is necessary that in
the Church, Nature ascend by the self same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
Till <hi>Constantins</hi> time <hi>(the first Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Emperour)</hi> Faith alone took place: From
<hi>Constantin</hi> till our age, Hereticks, were comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Rhetorical and Logical dissertations,
which because by little and little, is fitted to
conduct men to Evidence, the immediat succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Age of the Church is to be expected, in
which Evidence succeeding, there will be no
place for Heresies, but the Church shall flourish
in most perfect Peace and Prosperity.</p>
            <p>And having thus adorned the scene, he
brings himself down from Heaven, with
these happy demonstrations in this manner.
<hi>As in this Chapter</hi> (sayes he) S. John
<hi>teaches, describing unto us, A strong An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel;
as fitting for mans estate: Descending
from Heaven, from whence all good things
are derived to us. Cloathed with a Clowd:</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:53988:51"/>
That is with a celestial garment, as who brings
heavenly things to us: not keeping himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof
from us, but even approaching and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neer unto us: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd <hi>the Rainbow,</hi> which
is the symbol of Divine Peace, hung over <hi>his
Head</hi> And <hi>his Face was like the Sun:</hi>
To wit, as he who came to communicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
light, to humane kind: And <hi>his Leggs</hi>
in strength and firmness, <hi>as Pillars:</hi> And
in activity, <hi>as Fire:</hi> And he had in his
Hand, <hi>an open Book,</hi> that is to be read
and understood by All, And in which there
was no obscurity or involution: And <hi>He put
his right Foot on the sea;</hi> that is, he
subjected turbulent spirits by force and Power:
And <hi>His left Foot on the Land;</hi> that is,
confirming and strengthening the humble and
meeek: And <hi>he cried out with a lowd
voice,</hi> even like <hi>the roaring of a Lyon:</hi>
Which apertains to the latitude of the Church,
which is signified to be extended as farr as his
voice might be heard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the effect of
his voice was, that the <hi>seven Thunders
might speak their Uoices;</hi> that is, have
their effects: which the Apostle is forbidden,
<hi>to write</hi> for the reasons above delivered; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
<hi>he is</hi> commanded, <hi>to seal</hi> them in
his memory, perhaps to be told to pious men in
privat, not publickly to be promulgated to the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:53988:51"/>
But least this could not be so happily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to himself, and his long lasting <hi>third
age</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> steered by his <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

this same <hi>Angel</hi> swearing. <hi>That time
should be no more,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is presently
described to have <hi>devoured this open Book,</hi>
which the Angel brought from heaven.
Which might seem to regard the end of
the World, when <hi>time shall be no more,</hi> but
these circulations of the heavens shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their last end and Period: he tells us,
<hi>that this Oath of the Angel,</hi> and this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
of the Book,</hi> by S. <hi>Iohn, belong to
the preparation of the ensuing ruine of the
World, and consummation of all things.</hi> And
the Book <hi>though sweet to the tast, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
yet <hi>was bitter in his stomack:</hi> And <hi>could
not be contained, but forced him to preach the
Doctrine of it, to others.</hi> Thus he:</p>
            <p>But <hi>it is a good divertisement to see how
after this sublime conception had fallen into
his head, how he</hi> huggs <hi>it, and pleases him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the fancied happiness, of that
state of the</hi> Church, <hi>which thus shall be

contemptible to <hi>Naturalists,</hi> to <hi>Disbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. Why should we then wonder, if
we have a new <hi>Purgatory?</hi> Alas, Sir, we
have a new <hi>Systeme</hi> of a whole, intire, <hi>new
Religion:</hi> We have a <hi>Doctour</hi> who with long
melancholy thoughts, having fansied a world
in the <hi>Moon,</hi> perswades himself, that all the
<hi>Faith Christ</hi> taught us, shall be <hi>evacuated:</hi> all
other <hi>Schools</hi> shall cease: and he, forsooth, for
the future be the sole <hi>Pole-star</hi> of the World.
It is not unworthy of our observation, by what
wary sters this new <hi>Divinity</hi> (which fitted
to the <hi>Genius</hi> of our times, I never read, but
think I am in a <hi>Romance)</hi> walkt into the
world. The first attempt was upon <hi>Scripture,</hi>
where by a long <hi>Catalogue</hi> of its uncertainties,
by the <hi>Transcribers, Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>

               <hi>Printers</hi> mistakes, or the
wilfull corruptions of <hi>Iews,
Hereticks, half-witted</hi> and
bold <hi>Readers:</hi> it would puzzle any mans Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,
to count how many to one it is, there is
not one true word of <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>Scripture.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sole score of the <hi>Transcribers</hi> mistakes,
(in that supposition, that there were Two
thousand Copies writ of the <hi>Bible</hi> in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years) he concludes it sixteen to one,
against any determinate word, that it is not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53988:54"/>
the true word of <hi>Scripture,</hi> this onely saved,
that the same errour might be in several Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.
After this succeeded the <hi>infallibility</hi> of
the <hi>Pope,</hi> of which I have given my Reader
his sense already. Then followed, that he
should attaque the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Councils,
Which,</hi> in truth, with a better grace, and a
complement of a <hi>Non est impossibile,</hi> he sent
packing out of his <hi>School:</hi> And yet all
this while he bore us in hand, that he would
save <hi>All,</hi> by manly sustaining <hi>Tradition,</hi> the
<hi>uninterrupted Doctrine</hi> handed down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
by the succession of Fathers to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
from <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> to any
determinate Age: But because this <hi>Tradition</hi>
could not, with any appearance be sustained,
but that it carried or supposed, the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of <hi>Councils:</hi> Since there is nothing
more universally and constantly beleeved: nor
can we imagine any more Authentique proof
of any Doctrine, that it is delivered by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
then the <hi>Decree</hi> of a <hi>Council:</hi> And yet
he being resolved, by the ruine of that <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
to make way for his <hi>Demonstrative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
Tradition</hi> faded and dwindled, into
this mysterious expression: That the Errour
of a <hi>Council,</hi> though promulgated, <hi>should
not pass into an established Doctrine of the
Church, as delivered by Fathers, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53988:55"/>
by Christ:</hi> by which he brought all into
his own power again. And when he had thus
(as he thought) cut all the sinews of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-Beleef;</hi>
the mystery of all the design is
discovered: We must be governed by <hi>Faith</hi>
no longer: Christ with his <hi>Doctrine</hi> hath posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Chair long enough: Master <hi>White</hi>
with his <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> must now take place.
And least my <hi>Adversary</hi> should tell me; I
do him wrong, in asserting, That after the
rest, he hath now laid <hi>Tradition</hi> aside: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him and his <hi>solid cleer-sighted</hi> Friends, to
give me a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of all those Doctrines he
admits into his new <hi>Theology,</hi> or prooves in
his <hi>Institutiones sacrae</hi> (which are to be our
<hi>Scriptures, Fathers, Councils, School-men,</hi> for
the future) by <hi>Tradition,</hi> or on the score of
<hi>Authority.</hi> Nor let him complain; I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a heavy task upon him: Those <hi>who are
acquainted with every Ressort of his Doctrine,</hi>
will quickly answer it: The <hi>Catalogue</hi> will
proove so slender, so short, it will cost him
no considerable Pains: I could comprehend
them <hi>All</hi> in this one Word, <hi>Nothing:</hi> For
in truth, <hi>there is none at all:</hi> So safe a truth it
is, that in lieu of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
we have nothing in this <hi>School,</hi> but under
the title of <hi>Peripatetick</hi> and <hi>Sacred Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
an <hi>Epicurean, Lucretian Phylosophy;</hi> or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53988:55"/>
rather a medley of both theirs, and <hi>Aristotles</hi>
Phylosophy, and Pretended <hi>Demonstrations:</hi>
not of our <hi>Faith,</hi> as Catholiques have hitherto
understood it, but as now changing quite the
<hi>Notions</hi> of the <hi>Mysteries,</hi> he is pleased to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it. Of which we shall see more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 26. Why then should we wonder at
the Issues of this <hi>Brain?</hi> What should we
wonder at these <hi>Productions,</hi> which out of an
absolutely erroneous <hi>Method,</hi> were hatched, and
brought to light? It is no marvel, if a most
<hi>Exotick Phylosophy</hi> being presupposed, an
equally or more <hi>Exotick Divinity</hi> is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. <hi>A little Errour in the beginning,
prooves a great one in the last end.</hi> The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to square <hi>Theology,</hi> to (I know nor what)
pretended <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> hath wrought this
destruction. Nor need we the help of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
Our own Experience and Reason suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
evince, and discover this method to be
ruinous. There is no man who hath made
even a moderate progress in Sciences, but is
sufficiently convinced how weak, how feeble
our Understandings are: They are but <hi>Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
in <hi>Sciences,</hi> who are puft into a vanity, as
if they were even now become <hi>Masters.</hi>
The better Proficients they grow, the more
daily and howrly do they cleerly discover their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53988:56"/>
own Ignorance. Let's consider it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
there is no knowledg so certain, so
connatural to our undexrstandings, as that of
Quantity, the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Mathematiques:</hi>
and yet all the wit of men, that ever yet
have been in the world, come so far short
of the discovery, that millions of <hi>Problemes</hi>
might yet be proposed, which no man can
<hi>solve.</hi> And now as to our knowledge of
<hi>Natural Bodies,</hi> it is far inferior to the
former; for of these we scarce understand
any thing at all. Who ever comprehended
the <hi>Composition,</hi> the <hi>Properties,</hi> or even
the Essential notion of a <hi>Fly?</hi> What <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian</hi>
ever understood fully the Nature, the
operations, the effects, of any one <hi>Herb,</hi>
any one <hi>Simple?</hi> Who ever knew how <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb</hi>
works on the innumerable parts of our
bodies: how it purges, how it refines, how
it abates, how it heightens the several hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of it? St. <hi>Basill</hi> understood our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
much better, who in his 168 <hi>Epist.</hi> to
<hi>Eunom,</hi> prosecuting this subject, proposes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
twenty questions (to which twenty and
twenty more may be added) of a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<hi>Emmet:</hi> In none of which, the wit of
man can satisfie his curiosity. And if we are
thus short in those things we daily converse
with, which we touch, and tast, what will
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53988:56"/>
our knowledge amount to in <hi>Separated Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
in <hi>Souls,</hi> in <hi>Angels,</hi> in <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
The true ground of this our ignorance
being this: That our understandings in our
present state of <hi>mortality,</hi> being onely <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
moveable from our <hi>Phansies,</hi> which
depend wholly on the weak reports drawn
from our Senses: we have not, in this state,
without <hi>Revelation,</hi> any other notions but
such as are abstracted from <hi>sensible Objects;</hi>
so that the peculiar properties of abstract
<hi>Substances</hi> (since we are not now possest of
the peculiar essential notions of them) can
not now by us, naturally, be known. And
hence it is, that finding our selves so feeble,
in things the most obvious even to our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
all the Wise men of the World, have
ever been struck dumb, and ravisht in the
consideration of that <hi>Omnipotent</hi> hand, which
built both <hi>us,</hi> to honour and love <hi>him,</hi> and
<hi>them</hi> for our use to that end; so that where
his <hi>Authority</hi> is ingaged, as certainly it is,
in all things that apperrain to <hi>Faith:</hi> we
abase our prying proud curiosity, and <hi>square</hi>
our weak apprehensions to <hi>them,</hi> and not
these stupendious <hi>supernatural Mysteries,</hi> to
our creeping groveling apprehensions of
<hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was then upon this mistake, that this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53988:57"/>
new</hi> Purgatory <hi>came to light; it is one, and
but one of a thousand of those unheard of
productions, this new</hi> Phylosophical Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
<hi>is stuft with. I could give my Reader
many instances of</hi> Doctrines <hi>he never yet, not
indeed the world was acquainted with: but
I will conclude with that very</hi> Doctrin <hi>(be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it offers it self as neer allyed to this
our present</hi> Subject) <hi>with which he concluds
his</hi> Demonstrative Divinity. <hi>It is concerning
the</hi> Damned Souls; <hi>for we have not onely a</hi>
Poetical Purgatory, <hi>he hath also furnisht
us with a most</hi> Romancical Hell: <hi>and who
can but smile to think of those ridiculous</hi>
mimick <hi>postures, he fancyes of</hi> Horse-cours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Dancers, Fencers, Bowlers, <hi>and all other
Brutals</hi> attempting now in Hell in all their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
postures; those very pleasures in which
they constituted their final
end in this life.<note place="margin">Instit. Sac. 1. 3. Lcct. xi.</note> 
               <hi>Thus then
of those</hi> Souls <hi>he concludes:</hi>
Their misery <hi>(sayes he)</hi> depends on their
present perverseness, so that if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would, they might even yet be happy.
Out of the force and series of Nature, of which
they are parts, nothing better <hi>(to wit, then to
be damned)</hi> could happpen to them; neither
to All of them in general, nor to Any one
of them in particular. <hi>And least Nature or
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53988:57"/>
God should escape this</hi> Fatall Doctrin, <hi>he
adds:</hi> And even Nature and God himself
should have been worse, if they had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
dealt with. Pagan Fatality! <hi>Out of
the</hi> force <hi>and</hi> Series <hi>of</hi> Nature, <hi>nothing
better, could happen to</hi> Iudas <hi>then to be</hi>
damn'd; <hi>and if he had not been so,</hi> God had
ceased to be God: <hi>as so, forsooth,</hi> Wisdom is
justified against her children. <hi>Thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
his Prodigious</hi> Theology.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. And now I hope my Reader
hath some light of the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi>
of this our <hi>great Master</hi> and his new <hi>School.</hi>
It will give him an introduction into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>discovery</hi> of their <hi>learning.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his pretended <hi>Demonstrations</hi> are now
so cryed up by that little handful of his
Scholars, whose itch after novelties hath
rendred Proselites of his <hi>Doctrin;</hi> and since
in the <hi>Entry</hi> to my <hi>Discourse,</hi> I have laid
down those (as they would have us believe)
unshakable grounds, of this new minted <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory:</hi>
my Reader may justly challenge that
we should take a <hi>Survey</hi> of them. And
though this might seem weakly to <hi>antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,</hi>
what I heare far abler Pens have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
at large, yet why should we not
take a short <hi>view</hi> of them, and that even in
the very order they lye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53988:58"/>
And first then, leaving his Gibberish <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of a <hi>Separated Soul,</hi> how Ridiculous is
this <hi>Position:</hi> That the <hi>proper accidents</hi> (that
is, <hi>those things that are in the Soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Soul, its practical judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Its affections to friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
even to Corporal pleasures)
are the Soul it self.</hi> Since that they are so,
is not onely <hi>Indemonstrable,</hi> but <hi>Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
false:</hi> for the <hi>Soul</hi> is both Created
without them, remains in the <hi>Body</hi> without
them (in such as by grace have subdued
these Inordinations) and much more in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
both with, and without the <hi>Body,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after the <hi>Resurrection:</hi> And even
in his Systeme of Purgatory, <hi>the Soul shall
be divested of them at the re-union:</hi> and yet
all the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> or <hi>Lucretian Phylosophy</hi>
in the world, can never evince, that the <hi>Soul
can be separated from it self:</hi> Therefore nor
from these <hi>Affections</hi> if they be the <hi>Soul it
self.</hi> And how came these immediately
insuing words, to escape his wary Pen,
<hi>That the Soul without them were more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect?</hi>
Are those very <hi>Affections</hi> which
constitute <hi>Purgatory</hi> and
<hi>Hell</hi> too,<note place="margin">Inst. Sac. lib. 3 Lect. 9.</note> perfections of the
<hi>Soul?</hi> Or when she comes
to divest her self of them
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53988:58"/>
at the <hi>Re-union,</hi> does she remain more
imperfect in <hi>Heaven,</hi> then when she was in
the state of suffering by <hi>Them?</hi> or is she
then not her selfe because she is without
them? or had she been less <hi>Perfect</hi> if she
had passed out of this life, by perfect mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
without th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m? But because this <hi>Doctrin,
That the Soul were more imperfect without
these Affectinos,</hi> is very neer allyed to an other
excellent <hi>Doctrin</hi> of our great <hi>Master</hi> (and
which <hi>will much promote solid devotion)</hi> of
the <hi>Corporal Pleasures</hi> themselves; let us
compare them together, they agree very
happily, and will illustrate one an other:
<hi>Since Corporal life</hi> (sayes he)
<hi>is made in order to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Beatitude,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inst. Sac. lib. 3. Lect. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
pleasures are conformable
to corporal life, and therefore of necessity
that Corporal life in its kinde, is the best,
which hath the most, and greatest Corporal
pleasures: (as elsewhere is shewn more at large)</hi>
And further, <hi>since the best Corporal life, doth
best serve to the attaining of Beatitude, it is also
necessary that the Christian discipline (which
is the Mistriss of Beatitude) should even fill
our lives with the pleasures of the Body, and
those who live piously, should enjoy a hundred
fold</hi> (of those Corporal pleasures) <hi>more then
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53988:59"/>
those who live ill.</hi> Might not this excellent
<hi>Sermon</hi> very well become a St. <hi>Austen</hi> or a
St. <hi>Paul?</hi> No truly, Sir, they never were
acquainted with this <hi>Demonstration:</hi> They
lived in the <hi>Non-age</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> they
were steered by <hi>Faith</hi> not by this <hi>Evidence</hi>
and <hi>Science.</hi> And so they walkt in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities;
Tenances, Mortifications.</hi> They
never fancyed, <hi>That that Corporal life was
best in its kind, which abounded with most
and greatest Corporal pleasures:</hi> much less,
<hi>That such an one was best adapted to attain
that Beatitude</hi> they thirsted after. They
looked on <hi>Corporal Pleasures</hi> as the Bane of
the <hi>Soul:</hi> But our Great <hi>Master</hi> being still
himself, might well teach us, That the <hi>Soul
without these Affections were more imperfect,</hi>
since he placed <hi>the Perfection of a Corporal
life, best adapted to attain Beatitude,</hi> in the
injoyment of the <hi>Pleasures</hi> themselves. In
earnest, Sir, I have a scruple to Translate such
<hi>Doctrines</hi> as these are, which onely befit <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus</hi>
his School, and the life of Hogs:
(though you would perswade us <hi>they are
truths which promote solid Devotion)</hi>
if I were not confident of my <hi>Readers</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and that they will beget a just horror in
his Soul, both against the <hi>Doctrines</hi> themselves,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53988:59"/>
and those <hi>Principles</hi> that lead to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 28. Secondly, How frivolously he
concludes, <hi>That the affections to corporal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
accompany the soul in her state of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
Their rise, their origin is the Body.
The Soul were untouchable by them, if it
were not by reason of that union it hath, to
that clay which now incloses her. How could
the Soul be concerned to <hi>see,</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> to
<hi>touch,</hi> if she had neither <hi>eyes, ears, hands,</hi>
or any other <hi>corporeal organs,</hi> by which these
pleasures could be conveyed to her? especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if she enjoyed her fill of those far more
noble and excellent satisfactions (such as he
puts of eminent compleat knowledge) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to that <hi>state</hi> of <hi>separation</hi> And
what <hi>Purgatory</hi> could a <hi>Scholar</hi> indure, who
should pass out of this life with all his <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
regulated, save onely that to learning,
since in that <hi>state,</hi> his soul should even be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visht
with the injoyment of all that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which he inordinately long'd for in this
mortal life? How then is not the soul divest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of those base <hi>affections,</hi> when she passes out
of the <hi>body,</hi> which have their source from
this earthly habitation? But let us compare
this Doctrine, with an other admirable <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
of our Master. He tells us in his <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks,
lib. 5. lec. 1, n.</hi> 6. That the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53988:60"/>
of the <hi>soul</hi> from the <hi>body,</hi> is of that
efficacy, <hi>that the soul even in substance is
changed: and that a separated soul is in truth
an other thing</hi> (in substance) <hi>then it was in
the body.</hi> As if forsooth it were <hi>this thing,
this soul,</hi> which now informs my <hi>body,</hi> that
offends <hi>God</hi> in this life; and an <hi>other thing,</hi>
an <hi>other soul</hi> shall be punished for it in the
next. And doth not this <hi>Doctrine</hi> evacuate
all the fear of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> Judgment and <hi>Hell</hi>
too? And let not my <hi>Adversary</hi> tell me
he says it is an <hi>other thing,</hi> but says not, <hi>that
it is an other soul:</hi> For I desire him to tell
me, what <hi>other thing</hi> it is, if it be not an
<hi>other soul;</hi> for still it is a <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi>
but a <hi>soul. A thing</hi> is a <hi>notion</hi> more <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi>
then a <hi>soul:</hi> and what are distinguished
in a <hi>notion</hi> that is more <hi>universal,</hi> can not be
the same in a <hi>notion</hi> that is less <hi>universal.</hi> No
<hi>Logician</hi> ever fancied, that those things which
are distinguished in the notion of <hi>Animal,</hi>
can be the same in the notion of <hi>Homo.</hi> If
then the separation render the <hi>soul,</hi> an <hi>other
thing,</hi> an <hi>other soul;</hi> how should it not have
other <hi>accidents</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him) are the soul it self? or must it
not of <hi>necessity</hi> have so? <hi>But let this too be
supposed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 29. Thirdly, Whoever fancied, <hi>That
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53988:60"/>
a separated soul shall be tormented with a vast
grief, by reason corporal pleasures are now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be injoyed?</hi> Who ever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
or tormented, because he could not do
that, which he knew to be <hi>impossible?</hi> Who
ever was intollerably afflicted, because he
could not <hi>Fly?</hi> or render his body as incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
as a <hi>Diamond?</hi> or become an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel?</hi>
Stay, (you'l say) I suppose an ardent

not do that, which they see is <hi>impossible</hi> in
their present <hi>state,</hi> whilst they cannot transfer
themselves into an other <hi>state,</hi> in which the
pleasure they so much covet may be <hi>possible.</hi>
How ardent a thirst soever you have to the
knowledge of all truth; yet since you see
such <hi>knowledge</hi> is in this life impossible to be
attained, (and you hope for it in the next) yet
do I not beleeve you indure any <hi>vast grief,</hi>
or even are much tempted to rid your self
out of this world, that you may injoy it in the
next. Besides, your Master tells us; <hi>The
Will is either not distinct from the Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or at least, is adequately governed in the state
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53988:61"/>
of separation:</hi> How then can the <hi>Will</hi> be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with a vast grief, because of the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of those <hi>pleasures,</hi> whilst the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
shall cleerly represent to it, the <hi>Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Vileness, Vnworthiness</hi> of such Pleasures,
and which at one blow, cuts off all the <hi>Wills</hi>
pursuit, shall represent them, as <hi>Impossible?</hi>
But the truth is, this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is grounded
upon a pure mistake: For the <hi>absence,</hi> much
less the <hi>impossibility</hi> of corporal pleasures,
doth not torment with any <hi>vast</hi> or consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<hi>grief,</hi> those <hi>souls,</hi> (even in this life)
which are most of all <hi>immerst</hi> in the <hi>affections</hi>
to them, (and by consequence, not <hi>separated
souls;</hi> for (he tell us,) <hi>they remain in the
state of separation, even in that same proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they were in this life:)</hi> but just then, when
the body prompts or calls for an injoyment.
Let us consider the most <hi>luxurious,</hi> the most
<hi>gluttonous</hi> person in the world, when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
capacity of his body is satiated with those
pleasures, he indures no considerable torment,
till the body again call for a reiterated enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is not then rational to say, That a
<hi>Soul</hi> which passes out of this life by a long
continued <hi>Feaver,</hi> and therefore carries with
it into the next world, a great affection to
<hi>drink,</hi> shall be tormented in the next life
with a <hi>vast grief,</hi> because she now can not

injoy the pleasure of <hi>drinking,</hi> whilst in
truth, she can never suffer any <hi>thirst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how sordid and low a fancy he had of
<hi>Spiritual Substances</hi> in their <hi>state</hi> of <hi>separation:</hi>
to conceive them thus tortured, because <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

Heathen Phylosophers would not stoop to;
which <hi>Avicen,</hi> though a <hi>Turk,</hi> contemned,
and his Master <hi>Mahomets</hi> Heaven, built up
and fancied for <hi>Swine.</hi> It had been pious,
and worthy a Phylosopher, to conceive them
(as good Christians do) tormented with a
<hi>vast grief,</hi> because they had so ungratefully
offended Almighty <hi>God,</hi> and delayed their
beatitude, for such low, contemptible, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
<hi>Pleasures.</hi> But this satisfied not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
it reacht not home, to build us up a <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
out of which no delivery could be
hoped for till the <hi>Day of Iudgment;</hi> This
grief was rather a disposition for <hi>Heaven;</hi>
and therefore he must find us out some unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and unchangeable <hi>Affection,</hi> which must
detain <hi>Souls</hi> there, till he please to release
them. Besides, it is frequent, that vicious
men detest at their deaths those brutalities,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53988:62"/>
the excess of which, hath ruined their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Fame, and Fortunes; and yet pass out
of this life without true Repentance, to be
punisht for them in the next, for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>But let us also compare this, with an other
signal <hi>Doctrine</hi> of this our <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>er, De Med.

those afflictions which he supposes his <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
asserts, that the Souls suffers by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Agent; delivers us this unexpected
<hi>Doctrine:</hi> thus arguing against him. <hi>From
whence</hi> (sayes he) <hi>an unexpected Truth breaks
forth; That all those pains</hi> (inflicted by an
external Agent on the Soul) <hi>are Purely Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
For since on the one side, the souls thus
to be purged, are supposed to be perfect in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and extremely thirsting of the eternal
good, which they are certain to attain; and on
the other side, cleerly understand, that corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
punishments are the onely means by which
they may attain beatitude; it is evident they
to these pains are, as a man of an invincible
courage, in whom no weakness of mind can take
place; who being highly inflamed to attain
some good, ventu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es on things of great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
either in acting or suffering: In
which, both Experience and Reason teach
us, he would feel unspeakable pleasure.</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:53988:62"/>
As if, forsooth, <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>torments,</hi> cease to
be such, and become <hi>purely pleasures,</hi> whilst
the soul now perfect in charity, faints not
in suffering them. As if with perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Divine Will, and an absolute
desire to satisfie the Divine Justice, an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
longing after the ending of these griefs,
and the enjoyment of beatitude, were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent:
which necessarily includes and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with it a high affliction. But how by
this <hi>sudden, and unexpected Doctrin,</hi> all our
apprehensions are changed in the sufferings
of our B. <hi>Saviour?</hi> Who by a most perfect
charity, <hi>inflamed with the thirst of redeeming
mankind, under went all,</hi> with an <hi>invincible
courage: for in him no weakness of mind
could take place.</hi> We must now change all
our pious <hi>meditations,</hi> no more must we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Scourges, Whips, Contempts,
the Nails, and Cross to have been any other
thing, but <hi>pure pleasures</hi> to him. An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Doctrin to increase our Love to our deer
<hi>Saviour,</hi> who to redeem mankind was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and resigned to suffer <hi>pure pleasures,</hi> and
to incourage penance according to S. <hi>Paul,
si compatimur &amp; conglorificabimur.</hi> This is
an other <hi>truth to promote solid devotion.</hi>
Now then as to the Souls in <hi>Purgatory</hi> (which
certainly being perfect Masters of <hi>Reason,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:53988:63"/>
and now in charity, and see their own <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
to be unchangeable, can not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to faint in their sufferings) let us
now learn this <hi>unexpected sudden truth which
now breaks out,</hi> that we have been hitherto
quite mistaken: their <hi>sufferings</hi> are so far
from being <hi>pains,</hi> that in truth they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>purely pleasures.</hi> O happy model
of <hi>Purgatory!</hi> But let this be supposed
too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sec.</hi> 30. Fourthly, to come to the other
fundamental stone of this <hi>fabrick.</hi> It is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
false,</hi> that separated <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
both as to their <hi>substance,</hi> and <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are <hi>measured,</hi> by this <hi>indivisible durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>moment:</hi> or that to <hi>co-exist to a greater
or less part of time, adds or diminishes nothing
to them.</hi> What if the Omnipotent Hand of
God should create in this moment a new
<hi>Soul</hi> separated from any body: had the rest
of souls departed their bodies many ages agoe,
no greater duration, then this their even now
created companion? What if the same
Hand of <hi>God</hi> should now destroy one of those
separated <hi>souls,</hi> shall the rest of them which
shall <hi>co-exist</hi> to all future time, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no longer <hi>duration</hi> then she? What if
there were no <hi>body,</hi> no <hi>motion,</hi> no <hi>time</hi> at
all, could not <hi>God</hi> create a <hi>Soul,</hi> and destroy
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53988:63"/>
it at his pleasure? and yet not this in the
same <hi>indivisible moment:</hi> For then it would
follow, the Soul <hi>is</hi> and <hi>is not</hi> in the same <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant;</hi>
Therefore in some other posteriour
moment. What if <hi>God</hi> should again repair
this thus annihilated soul? We could not
imagine, that this new second <hi>existence</hi> would
be measured with the same duration that the
first, for this would exclude the very <hi>suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>
of an interruption. Besides, Sir, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Theology</hi> teaches us that <hi>Angels</hi> (whose
duration is as indivisible as that of <hi>Souls)</hi>
were not created in <hi>Termino,</hi> but in <hi>Viâ:</hi>
The holy Angels were not Created in the
<hi>State</hi> of <hi>Fruition;</hi> nor the <hi>Devils</hi> in the
<hi>State</hi> of <hi>Damnation,</hi> but both in the way
to these several <hi>States.</hi> And that <hi>first</hi> they
were in the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> in which the good
by adhering to <hi>God</hi> were <hi>afterwards</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Glory,</hi> whilst the <hi>Devils,</hi> by their
pride and disobedience, were deservedly <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards</hi>
thrust out headlong into <hi>Hell.</hi> Who
hath rendred it evident that all this could
be effected in one indivisible moment?</p>
            <p>And further, Sir, as to this point, that my
Reader may be cleared more fundamentally
in it: We must observe, That since <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
which is devoid of all <hi>Succession,</hi> is the
measure of a Perfectly <hi>Permanent being,</hi> that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53988:64"/>
is, of <hi>God</hi> himself: as far forth as any thing
recedes from a <hi>Permanent being,</hi> so far it
recedes from <hi>Eternity,</hi> and comes to <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
Now though the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> does
not consist in <hi>motion,</hi> and therefore is not
measured by our <hi>Time:</hi> Yet since the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
of an <hi>Angel</hi> is neither its <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
nor its <hi>Will,</hi> much less is it the <hi>Acts</hi>
of these <hi>Powers:</hi> The <hi>substance</hi> of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
is not measured by <hi>Eternity,</hi> since it
hath Transmutation adjoyned to it: and so
<hi>hath a proper duration,</hi> or measure between
<hi>it</hi> and <hi>time.</hi> And further, since the
<hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> have a real and true
<hi>succession,</hi> they are measured by a true <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>
and <hi>time,</hi> not that of <hi>bodies,</hi> or the
motions of them, but by a time proper to
the <hi>succession</hi> of those Operations; and if
holy <hi>Writ</hi> deliver us any other then <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical</hi>
truths, of <hi>separated Substances,</hi> it
delivers this <hi>succession</hi> in them. Your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
himself takes notice in his <hi>Med. Stat.
acc. 22. Of the Souls of the slain</hi> (describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Apocalyps) <hi>resting under the Altar,
and crying out to have the day of Iudgement
hastned;</hi> which reaches home to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that they are concerned in the length
of the stay, and that it is absolutely false,
that there is no <hi>succession</hi> of <hi>Acts,</hi> even in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53988:64"/>
Beatified <hi>Souls;</hi> or that, <hi>to coexist to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or less part of time, adds, or diminishes
nothing to them:</hi> Though it fals much short
of rendring our Prayers onely available <hi>for
the hastning of that day</hi> (as we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
see) for which end he there introduces
it. And if you please to consider in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the <hi>Angel</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tels him, <hi>That the Prince</hi> (or Angel)
<hi>of the Kingdome of the Persians resisted him
one and twenty dayes: And behold Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
one of the first Princes</hi> (he who stands
for the Children of the Jewish Nation) <hi>came
to his help:</hi> You will easily observe, there
is not this <hi>comprehension</hi> of all time, your
<hi>Master</hi> fansied, in the <hi>workings,</hi> or <hi>beings,</hi> of
<hi>Separated Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. Fifthly, As to his grounds of the
Immutability of that state, it is groundlesly
assumed, <hi>That a Soul can suffer no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from a Body, but by identification</hi> (or
by being the same thing) <hi>with that body.</hi>
And indeed who ever fanfied that the soul
could thus be <hi>identified,</hi> or become the <hi>very
self-same thing,</hi> with the <hi>body?</hi> Who ever
believed that now in this life, our <hi>Souls</hi> are
really and truly our <hi>Bodies,</hi> and our <hi>Bodies</hi>
are our <hi>Souls?</hi> Or if they were thus <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,</hi>
or the <hi>same thing;</hi> how were it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53988:65"/>
they should ever be severed: since
nothing can be imagined to be served from
it self? <hi>Christian Phylosophy</hi> never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
this <hi>position,</hi> it is evidently destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of the <hi>Immortality</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and
of all <hi>Religion:</hi> For if the <hi>Soul</hi> be <hi>Identifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
(or the <hi>same thing)</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the body, it must
of necessity be resolved into dust with the
body: For no man can conceive, how any
thing should supervive it self; so that this
will put an end to <hi>Purgatory, Heaven, Hell</hi>
and <hi>All Religion.</hi> We that walk by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith,</hi> and not by new Lights, this <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Fatuus</hi> of <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
That the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> as two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
parts, concurred to the building up of
<hi>one</hi> Man: who is <hi>one,</hi> not by <hi>simplicity,</hi> not
by <hi>Identification</hi> of the parts, or I know not
what strange fancyed <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of
the <hi>Soul</hi> into the <hi>Body,</hi> but by substantial <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
or <hi>Composition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, Sir, It can never be evidenced,
That not onely such an Inimaginable <hi>Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
should be necessary, to the end that a
<hi>Soul</hi> may be <hi>passive</hi> from the <hi>Body:</hi> but
that even a <hi>Substantial union</hi> is requisite.
We see that the <hi>Soul,</hi> in the state of <hi>Vnion,</hi>
even <hi>Naturally,</hi> suffers by the <hi>Bodies</hi> Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as in Frensies, caused by Feavours,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53988:65"/>
or other distempers: And who shall render it
evident, that in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>separation,</hi> not
naturally, but by the Omnipotent Hand of
<hi>God,</hi> she may not be <hi>passive</hi> by <hi>Fire,</hi> or some
other <hi>External Agent:</hi> by some way our <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings</hi>
now reach not to?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 32. Sixthly, It is a purely voluntary
and false Assertion, <hi>That a separated soul
knows all things together and perpetually.</hi> The
very holy <hi>Angels</hi> do not thus know all things:
Our Blessed <hi>Guardians,</hi> of new know daily,
and howrly, our actions; and represent our
sighs and devotions in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> and
since in these we are <hi>free,</hi> and not tyed neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
to any thing but <hi>our selves,</hi> it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should know them, till we our
selves have determined our selves to them:
Nor even then immediately, (for <hi>God</hi> alone
is the searcher of hearts,) till they have sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
out into some <hi>effect.</hi> And our B. Saviour
himself tells us, <hi>The holy Angels themselves
know not of that day and howr,</hi> (to wit, of
Judgment) <hi>but onely the Father.</hi> Matth. 24.
and they rejoyce at the new conversion of a
sinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. Seventhly, Who ever rendred
it <hi>Evident,</hi> that <hi>No Alteration can befall a
separated Soul from any other Spirit, without
the interposition of the Body?</hi> For Spirits can
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53988:66"/>
act on Spirits immediately, without such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition;
and the contrary Doctrine is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of all the conversation of the holy
<hi>Angels</hi> for all <hi>Aeternity;</hi> is destructive of
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> holy <hi>Writ</hi> delivers us of the
fall of the Devils, where <hi>the Dragon</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
<hi>to have drawn after him the third
part of the Stars,</hi> or Angels, into his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
And if <hi>Angels</hi> can thus <hi>Act</hi> on An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
without this <hi>interposition</hi> of a <hi>body,</hi> why
not on <hi>separated souls?</hi> Nor is that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of this his Doctrine at all subsistent:
<hi>For since</hi> (says he) <hi>All Spirits are indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
their Operations must be indivisible:</hi> And
consequently, <hi>perfected All of them in one
moment.</hi> For this consequence is perfectly
null. Nor will it ever be rendred evident,
that an <hi>Act</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> may not <hi>coexist</hi> to a
great or less part of time; much less will it
ever be evinced (as is already proved) that
there is not a true and real <hi>succession</hi> in their
<hi>operations.</hi> So that his Doctrine is absolutely
false, when he tells us; <hi>If any thing be to be
done among Spirits, it is so done and perfected
in one moment, that afterwards an other action
can not be begun</hi> And besides, when he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes;
<hi>An indivisible effect, the causes being put,
of necessity exists in the same moment:</hi> Though
he may say true for that one <hi>Act;</hi> but when
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53988:66"/>
he infers the same for all succeeding <hi>Acts</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Aeternity,</hi> he errs most grosly: Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this, (which is one of the most funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<hi>Bases</hi> of all his <hi>Phylosophy</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,)</hi>
that all Causes are fixt and set, as to
<hi>All</hi> Effects whatsoever, from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
unto all future succession: By which
Doctrine, both <hi>God</hi> himself is necessitated so
to do, that he can not do otherwise, then he
doth do; and each intelligence so to know
<hi>(by the connexion of existences)</hi> that it can
not know, otherwise then it does know; which
is most pure <hi>Pagan Fatality,</hi> destructive of
the Liberty of <hi>God,</hi> and all <hi>contingency</hi> in all
created things whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 34. Lastly, That we may vindicate
<hi>Christianity</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> from <hi>that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of separated Substances,</hi> he boldly and
injuriously fixes upon <hi>Her,</hi> and the <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> from a most gross abuse:
let us take a survey of his 17 <hi>Accompt</hi> in his
<hi>Middlè State of Souls.</hi> He there tells us, The
delivery of <hi>Souls</hi> before Reunion, <hi>proceeded
out of the ignorance, or not adhering to this
Doctrine,</hi> of the incomparable St. <hi>Thomas</hi>
and his School: <hi>That in Abstracted Spirits,
there is neither discourse, nor any manner of
composition; but purely a simple apprehension:
so that errour and falsity can have no place in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53988:67"/>
them. For these</hi> (sayes he) <hi>depend on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
so that it is impossible, Indivisibles</hi> (or
Spirits) <hi>should be capable of Succession.</hi> Now
that my Reader may fully understand, both
the <hi>Truth</hi> here contained, and his most erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Consequences drawn from <hi>It;</hi> We
must observe, that there is a double Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in <hi>Vnderstandong:</hi> both of the <hi>Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat</hi>
to the <hi>Subject,</hi> and of the <hi>Conclusion</hi> to the
<hi>Premisses:</hi> Both which take place in <hi>Vs,</hi> by
reason of the weakness of our <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi>
in this state of mortality. For neither do <hi>We</hi>
at one single <hi>glance</hi> understand the <hi>Praedicat,</hi>
though we cenceive the <hi>Subject;</hi> nor do we
attain to the <hi>Conclusions</hi> included in the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
but by a long indeavour and succession
of <hi>reasoning</hi> or <hi>discourse:</hi> So that our U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other, and the <hi>Conclusion</hi> with the <hi>Premisses.</hi>
But it happens otherwise in <hi>Angels;</hi> For they,
by a cleer strength of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
both the <hi>composition</hi> and <hi>division</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
with one simple <hi>sight,</hi> and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions</hi>
in the <hi>Principles,</hi> without this succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of discourse. This is St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
1 <hi>Par. quaest. 58. art. 3. &amp;</hi> 4. Now
it imports not our present business, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Whether this knowledge of <hi>Spirits</hi> is a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53988:67"/>
true <hi>discourse,</hi> since a succession of time is
not perhaps requisit to <hi>that,</hi> but onely of
<hi>causality,</hi> which is here found. But it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
us to consider, That out of this <hi>Doctrine</hi>
of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> it no ways follows, That <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
or <hi>falsity can have no place in separated
Substances.</hi> For the same St. <hi>Thomas</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
this, in the very next <hi>Article;</hi> and
teaches us: That though in such things, as
are thus <hi>naturally</hi> known, by the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the terms or <hi>Principles, Spirits</hi> can
not err; yet in <hi>such things as depend on the
supernatural Ordination of God, as far forth
as they are supernatural; Errour may take
place in them. And this</hi> (says he) <hi>happens
not to the good Angels; because they judge not
of those things which supernaturally belong to
the Object, without due submission to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ordination;</hi> but it does in the <hi>Devils,</hi>
who <hi>by their perverse will, withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Divine Wisdome, judge erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously
of supernatural things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that we may further see how injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
he would improove the Doctrine of
this great Saint and <hi>Doctour,</hi> both against <hi>him</hi>
and the <hi>Church:</hi> we must further observe,
that his Consequence, <hi>That Indivisibles</hi> (or
Spirits) <hi>are not capable of succession:</hi> is both
<hi>null,</hi> and against this holy <hi>Doctour</hi> every
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53988:68"/>
where. For in the first Article of this very
Question, he teaches, <hi>That Angels are not
alwayes in actual consideration of those very
things, they know naturally.</hi> He tells us,
<hi>That of those thinge which God reveals to them,
of which they receive new revelations, by the
occasions of affairs, they are in potentiality,</hi> or
preceding ignorance. He tells us in the next
Article, <hi>Those things whose knowledge depend
on one onely Species, Angels know all together;
but not those which depend on divers.</hi> He tells us
in fine everywhere, That there is a <hi>real and
true Succession</hi> in their <hi>Acts,</hi> which is measured
by a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true Succession</hi> of <hi>Time.</hi> And I
can not admonish my Reader too of ten: of <hi>His
fatal Necessity</hi> and <hi>Connexion of Causes,</hi> which
runs through all his Doctrine, and grounds
these his Positions, when he tells us, That a
<hi>separated Soul is all other things by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of existencies, and since she knows all
things together, and for ever; by the course
of Nature, there is no room left either for Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
or new Science:</hi> Which Doctrine is
the Corner-stone of all his Fabrick of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
and is perfectly destructive of all <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
because destructive of all <hi>Liberty</hi> in
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Creatures:</hi> And peculiarly destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of all the <hi>mysteries</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturality;</hi>
for all these depend on the pure
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53988:68"/>
freedom and <hi>Will</hi> of God who is not, nor
can not be tyed to creatures: and therefore
the same <hi>Angelical Doctor,</hi> in the precedent
57. <hi>Quest.</hi> Art. 3, 4, &amp; 5. concludes, <hi>That
Angels neither know all future contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
Nor <hi>the secrets of our hearts,</hi> Nor <hi>the
mysteries of Grace, but as far forth as it
pleases God to reveal these to them: which
in their first Creation he did in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
but more amply and fully after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
according as it did agree with their
Offices and imployments in this Vniverse.</hi>
This, Sir, is true Christian <hi>Theology</hi> (which
reaches much more to souls in Purgatory)
learnt by <hi>revelation</hi> from him, who neither
can be deceived, nor deceive us: not out
of <hi>Epicurean, Lucretian, Pagan,</hi> Principles
of <hi>Fatality</hi> in things, and of <hi>Necessity</hi> in God,
in order to his Creatures.</p>
            <p>But if we should suppose all these <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi>
principles and consequences to be
true; that there is no <hi>Error,</hi> no <hi>Ignorance,</hi>
no <hi>Succession</hi> in <hi>Separated Substances,</hi> now in
their present state of <hi>Separation:</hi> How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequent
is it (as he there tels us) <hi>That
they are now just that, (as to their affections,)
which this state of union with their bodies
and mortality made them?</hi> What a frivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
discourse he introduces, arguing in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53988:69"/>
same 17 <hi>Acc. As an Embri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> (sayes he) <hi>or
seminal Mushrom delineates a future man, so
the thoughts and affections of this life, design
by their impressions, the future condition of the
Soul: So that death produces such an Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as from the man so disposed is naturally
producible, thus to remain till Resurrection.</hi>
For this hath no Connexion with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Doctrine of the Immutability of Souls
in the state of Separation. If we should
suppose, that there is no variety in them, no
succession in that single state of <hi>Separation,</hi>
how will it follow, there is no change of <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
in these two, and those so different
<hi>States</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Vnion?</hi> Besides, Sir,
if the Antecedent of this his Argument reach
home to his purpose, it is a Position destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of all <hi>Christianity;</hi> if this <hi>Embrio,</hi> or
<hi>seminal Mushrom delineate the future man,
if the Soul be such as the quality of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
exacts and determines it to be</hi> (as he tells
us) <hi>it is, at the first infusion into the body,</hi> and
remains so, or else he tels us nothing to his
purpose: Our liberty is destroyed. There
remains no hopes, that these his <hi>Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
by the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>body;</hi> should be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>education,</hi> by <hi>vertue;</hi> should be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by <hi>Grace:</hi> Since then this his <hi>Doctrin</hi>
is absolutely false, and since souls, in truth,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53988:69"/>
by the assistance of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
overcome (even whilst in their <hi>Bodies)</hi>
what they contract, or are determ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nod by
their <hi>Bodies,</hi> (as our holy Faith teaches) how
excellently is it concluded, That <hi>Souls</hi> now
in <hi>Separation</hi> do not Correct, what was in
them by the commerce of that unworthy
Clay, which before inclosed them? And
how will it not be as well or more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concluded, that <hi>Souls</hi> at their <hi>Re-union</hi>
too, passing now from Separation to Union,
(as well as before from Union to Separation,)
carry with them their unchangable <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
and so never get out of his <hi>Purgatory</hi>
neither before nor at the day of <hi>Iudgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these short reflections, my Reader
will easily observe, how far these <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantin,
unshakeable grounds</hi> fall short of
that so much <hi>boasted</hi> Evidence, even of
<hi>Truth:</hi> some of them being most perfect
falshoods, the rest groundless, uncertain,
dreaming <hi>Assertions:</hi> and yet they are such
as shall serve the levity of some men, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
the <hi>authority</hi> of the whole <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> and upon these shall be Errected a
new modled <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as upon other the
like they have built us a whole, new, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Religion,</hi> of which they are so fondly
inamoured, and peremptory, that now they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53988:70"/>
boldly pronounce, The hither to received <hi>Faith</hi>
of the <hi>Church, proceeded out of Ignorance of
the Nature of Separated Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 35. But to conclude my <hi>Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and our business; if this his Position be
true, <hi>That no Souls are delivered out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
before the day of Iudgment:</hi> What
serve for all our <hi>Devotions, Prayers, Alms,
Offerings?</hi> Doth the holy Sacrifice of the
<hi>Altar,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> hath defined to
be Propitiatory even <hi>for the Dead,</hi> avail those
distressed Souls nothing at all? No, my
Adversary dares not, as yet, venture upon
this. The <hi>Councils</hi> are so <hi>cleer,</hi> so <hi>home</hi> to
this Point, his credit were ruined, if he
should attempt to deny it. His new <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi>
then, must be furnished with some
<hi>new</hi> way, by which our endeavours may be
beneficial to those poor Souls, or else no
<hi>Catholiques</hi> Ears could be open to his new
<hi>Divinity.</hi> Is it perhaps, the <hi>intermitting</hi> at
some times, or <hi>abating</hi> of the fury of their
<hi>torments?</hi> O no, this <hi>Doctrin</hi> finds no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
in his School. His <hi>indivisible du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
admits of no <hi>intermission:</hi> and where
the <hi>Soul,</hi> by her now <hi>unchangable affections,</hi>
is her own executioner, no <hi>Allay,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement</hi>
of torment can be hoped for till
<hi>Reunior,</hi> What then perhaps shall our
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53988:70"/>
Prayers be of force to obtain their <hi>Release?</hi>
O no, this the least of all, It were against
all their <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> and therefore is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to his new changeable state at the
<hi>Resurrection.</hi> What then is the effect of all
our tears and prayers? What benefit doe
<hi>Separated Souls</hi> receive by them? This,
and onely this, <hi>That the day of Iudgment is
hastned by them.</hi> And is this all? Yes, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this is all our new <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Purgatory</hi>
can admit of, as to the Assisting of the
<hi>Souls</hi> detained in it. But what if this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerating
the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Iudgment</hi> prove no
advantage, no help at all to those distressed
<hi>souls?</hi> Would not all <hi>Christians</hi> be justly
charged with an intollerable <hi>folly?</hi> Would

                  </gap>upereminent Error,</hi> in a <hi>Doctrin</hi> which draws
so much practice after it? Whilst both the
<hi>Florentin Council</hi> here, and that of <hi>Trent</hi>
pronounce, and all <hi>Christians</hi> agree, <hi>That the
Souls detained in Purgatory are assisted, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
by the Prayers and Suffrages of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
yet living. And yet certain it is, that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stning
of the day of <hi>Iudgment</hi> is no advantage
to them, in these their <hi>Positions</hi> and <hi>grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let this great</hi> Master <hi>himself plead
the</hi> Cause. <hi>Let him fairly deliver us his
sublime sense, in his own words: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53988:71"/>
our devotions assist those souls or no?
Whether</hi> the hastning of the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>be any way beneficial to them? and that
by his very <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bylosophical</hi> grounds, the basis
and foundation of the duration of souls now
detained in his new minted Purgatory.</hi>
In spiritual acts <hi>(says he)</hi> whether they
bring happiness or misery, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to time: so as to make pain which
lasts longer, to be greater or that which
ends sooner, to be less, for these are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of corporal things. Every act of a
pure Spirit reflected on it self, being of its
own nature out of the reach of time; not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
thereto, but greater then the whole exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of time, &amp;c, If then to a thing <hi>(or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
soul)</hi> which co-exists to a longer part
of time, nothing be thereby added, or to a
thing <hi>(that is, a separated soul)</hi> which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exists
with a less part of time, nothing be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished:
there can be no reason, why du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
should represent either more, or less
grievous, in these respective cases: So that
whatsoever grief of a separattd soul is by the
quality and force of its essence greater, the
same grief (let its co-existence to time be
what it will) must be more vehement, and
that which is less, <hi>(by the force of its es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence)</hi>
less: Nothing being gained or lost
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53988:71"/>
by the perpetuating or contracting of the
motions of the Sun, or other Celestial bodies:
So that whatsoever time intervenes between
<hi>death</hi> and the Restauration of the world <hi>(at
the day of Judgment)</hi> is to separated souls
as one moment. <hi>This doctrin presupposed,
What can separated souls be concerned</hi>
when <hi>the day of Judgment shall come? And
hath not your admired</hi> Master <hi>made a fair
hand of it? hath he not now compleately
ended his work? This, and only this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in his new</hi> Systeme: <hi>That the</hi> day
of Iudgment is hastned by our prayers, <hi>that
so the souls may be assisted by them, and he
himself escape that brand of</hi> Heresie <hi>(whilst
the</hi> Councils <hi>pronounce,</hi> They are assisted
by us) <hi>which even vulgar eyes would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
have fixt upon his</hi> Opinion. <hi>And now
he hath fairly delivered us of that empty
pretence. It is not, It can not be (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him)</hi> That the pepetuating of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the heavens, or their even now ending
their Circulations, can give any addition or
diminution, to the torments and sufferings of
souls in the state of separation. <hi>For in them
to</hi> co-exist <hi>to one</hi> hower, <hi>to one</hi> minute and a
million of Ages, <hi>is one and the same thing.
Let the</hi> Angels <hi>Trumpet summon</hi> them
<hi>this moment, let it be deferred ten thousand,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53988:72"/>
thousand years;</hi> He <hi>tells us, and for fear we
should not understand him, again and again,
tells us,</hi> Their duration <hi>is still the</hi> same, Their
moment <hi>one and the</hi> same, Their pains, <hi>their
sufferings</hi> one <hi>and the</hi> same.</p>
            <p>But how happily will he be surprized, if
out of these grounds it be evinced, That those
<hi>Souls</hi> (as to their present <hi>state</hi> of <hi>separation)</hi>
can not be concerned, whether ever the Day
of <hi>Iudgment</hi> come or no? Let us suppose,
that the Providence of <hi>God</hi> had so ordered
this machin of the <hi>world;</hi> that these <hi>circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
of the Heavens should never receive
their last end and period: <hi>Separated Souls,</hi>
most evidently, (according to his <hi>Positions,)</hi>
would not at all be concerned in this our <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;</hi>
for where to <hi>coexist to one minute,
howr, or a million of ages, is the same thing;</hi>
the <hi>Soul,</hi> in that <hi>state,</hi> cannot be concerned
whether Time ever or never receive an end.
He himself tells us, <hi>Nothing is gained or lost
by the perpetuating</hi> (that is, never ending)
<hi>or even now contracting of these motions.</hi>
And this will be rendred more evident, by
the consideration of this our <hi>Supposition.</hi> For
since to <hi>suppose</hi> the world shall last for ever,
is but to <hi>suppose</hi> it shall last longer, then any
determinable number of Ages; and since his
<hi>indivisible duration</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> doth not onely
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53988:72"/>
comprehend <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that determinate</hi> number
of years, but <hi>all time</hi> whatsoever: (He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
teaches us, <hi>That every Act of a pure
Spirit reflected on it self, is greater then the
whole extension of time:)</hi> It follows, that this
<hi>duration</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> it self remaining the very
<hi>same,</hi> would comprehend all Time in that
<hi>Supposition,</hi> that <hi>time</hi> should never have an
<hi>End;</hi> and by consequence, a <hi>separated Soul,</hi>
(as to its <hi>state</hi> of <hi>separation)</hi> is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned,
whether ever the world should
<hi>have,</hi> or <hi>not have</hi> an <hi>end.</hi> And what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
this his <hi>Doctrine</hi> will have, to evacuate
our apprehensions of <hi>Eternity,</hi> I leave to my
<hi>Readers</hi> consideration.</p>
            <p>Away then with these idle <hi>Winter-tales;</hi>
away with this <hi>Ignorance of the nature of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
souls: A Purgatory fire: A purging
in the state of separation: A delivery from

to that sensless Devotion, which

run through my Adversaries defence of his
<hi>Purgatory</hi> against our present <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
I have given my Reader some small
light into this <hi>School,</hi> Its <hi>Method,</hi> Its <hi>Design:</hi>
I have given some touches upon Its <hi>Doctrines,</hi>
Its <hi>Demonstrations:</hi> and we have concluded
with this <hi>Devotion</hi> for the <hi>Dead.</hi> There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
onely, that I make some short <hi>reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
on what is added in this <hi>Letter;</hi> either as
to the <hi>Publishers</hi> Persons, or other things,
which did not directly pertain to our present
Question of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And First, as to his Quarrel, <hi>pag. 1, &amp;c.</hi>
That the Publishers printed this Book <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any application. A Medium,</hi> by which
Mr. <hi>White might seem</hi> an <hi>Heretick, to the
good women</hi> (as he tells us) <hi>of which
there are not a few; and ignorant men,
of which there are too many:</hi> Nay, their
own <hi>Proselytes</hi> become <hi>such,</hi> by <hi>making
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53988:73"/>
private Interpretations;</hi> since this <hi>is to give
themselves over to the private Spirit.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
The <hi>Faith</hi> of their Flock being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
their <hi>Pastoral</hi> Care obliged them
to this proceed: They published the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of this Doctrine, and pointed it
out, which prooved effectual to their <hi>Design.</hi>
When <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Catechisms</hi> are proposed
to the <hi>vulgar,</hi> without further application
to this or that <hi>Opinion</hi> of a private Doctour,
or <hi>Heresie:</hi> there is no fear Children should
become <hi>Heretiques,</hi> but are instructed in
<hi>Faith.</hi> It is those, who with <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy</hi>
wrest these Sacred <hi>Texts</hi> to their own
preconceived fancies, that run the hazard.
To Master <hi>Whites</hi> person, neither they, nor
I, have any Quarrel: It's an errour of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to conceive him an <hi>Heretique;</hi> For
those onely are <hi>such,</hi> who voluntarisy and
pertinaciously adhere to some one or more
<hi>Doctrines,</hi> contrary to the received <hi>Faith</hi> of
the <hi>Church:</hi> Those who deny all <hi>Faith,</hi> who
pretend no Knowledge is necessary, but such
as is establisht by natural <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi>
are not <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but <hi>Naturalists,</hi>
and <hi>Pagan Phylosophers.</hi> In your Third Age
of the <hi>Church,</hi> which shall be directed
by this new Light, there will be no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of <hi>Heresies.</hi> When St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53988:74"/>
               <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi>
shall be evacuated; his other Doctrine,
<hi>Oportet Haereses esse,</hi> will find no place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow was this your Quarrel, usher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>pag.</hi> 4. with <hi>Tantoene animis coelestibus
irae?</hi> The <hi>Publisher</hi> had not bewrayed the
least impatience; there was nothing in the
Book you pretend to answer, of his own:
It was not <hi>he,</hi> but <hi>you,</hi> that pronounce your
self guilty of Anger. And yet this was as
pertinent, as your—<hi>Quid non mortalia pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctora
cogis?</hi> is adapted to him, whom all
good men (better acquainted with him,)
have been more prone to censure, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
disposition, to that, which you now
slily would fix upon him. But yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unhappily was your Defence of a <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Purgatory,</hi> ushered in with these <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Exclamations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You tell us, <hi>pag. 7, &amp;</hi> 9. That
Master <hi>White had long before appeal'd to these
very Authorities,</hi> and urged them so home,
that he had rendred it evident, They speak
his <hi>Opinion,</hi> and against that <hi>Faith</hi> I sustain.
My Reader may, if he please, for his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
peruse that <hi>mysterious</hi> place in his
16 <hi>dimens. De med. Stat.</hi> And I answer,
That it is not altogether unhappy, in an <hi>ill
Cause,</hi> to be able to say any thing without
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53988:74"/>
blushing. I have seen <hi>Criminals</hi> deride the
<hi>Court,</hi> scorn the <hi>Iudge;</hi> but I never yet heard
any of that eminent Confidence, that he
durst Vaunt, the <hi>Court</hi> had pronounced in
his favour, when he stood condemned by the
<hi>Sentence.</hi> But because you have learnt to
say so too, after your <hi>Master,</hi> an ordinary <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
will judge, That you verily beleeve you
have no Credit to lose, when you will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
your <hi>rest</hi> at this disadvantage. The
<hi>Pope</hi> defines <hi>Souls being purged even before the
re-assumption of their bodies, and before the
general Iudgment, were, are, and shall be in
Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Council</hi> defines, <hi>Souls being
now purged uncloathed of their Bodies, are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
received into Heaven.</hi> I sustain this
Faith; <hi>That Souls may be purged uncloathed
of their bodies,</hi> and that <hi>such are received
presently into Heaven, before the re-assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their bodies and general Iudgment.</hi> You
maintain the contradictory of this <hi>Position;</hi>
and yet you have the confidence to tell your
Reader, and even hope he beleeves you; <hi>That
the Sentence is pronounced in your favour, and
that I stand condemned by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, You quarrel, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. at the
Title of their Book, which is: <hi>Concerning
the state of departed Souls.</hi> You fancy a
<hi>Mystery</hi> which they never meant, and tell
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53988:75"/>
us, this is a false Title; the true one is, <hi>A defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of certain Articles concerning the blessed
vision of God, and the beatitude and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls.</hi> Which yet is the very self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
with the other; in this onely differing,
that what they comprehended in the word,
<hi>state;</hi> is here declared by this division, <hi>Of
beatitude and damnution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 37. Fifthly, You tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 11.
the word <hi>Verbatim</hi> made you <hi>smile.</hi> Surely,
Sir, you do not <hi>smile</hi> without some special
grace; since you mind us so often of it.
And presently you triumph about the <hi>gender</hi>
of <hi>Synodus,</hi> which you insinuate, the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher</hi>
was ignorant of, he having added to it
an Adjective in the Masculine <hi>gender:</hi> and
you pursue your sport amain, and tell us,
<hi>The Printer must take the fault upon him, or else
the publisher will be suspected, to be better skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in transcribin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Three hundred lines of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
then making three:</hi> and yet you safely
pass this censure upon him, since <hi>the Printer
was exact enough in all the Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
Latin.</hi> And further, you read us a
<hi>Grammar Lesson,</hi> that some words in <hi>[us]</hi>
are of the <hi>Feminine,</hi> some in <hi>[a]</hi> of the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
gender.</hi> Now, Sir, we will suppose
that you were very carefull to examine the
<hi>Print;</hi> and yet (for all your care) <hi>Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctum
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53988:75"/>
Ecclesiam</hi> escaped your eye: For
since you came so lately from <hi>Grammar,</hi> I
do not suspect you have forgot that <hi>Ecclesia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
and <hi>Musa</hi> are of the <hi>Feminine gender,</hi> though
<hi>Poeta</hi> indeed is (as you tell us) of the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine.</hi>
But these are meer seven-years-old-School-boys
imployments, unworthy your
reflections, now you write <hi>Man,</hi> and would
be tampering in <hi>Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it unbeseems your <hi>Youth,</hi> thus to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque
a person of <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Learning;</hi> who
long before your new minted <hi>Purgatory</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the world, both read and sustained
<hi>Orthodox Divinity,</hi> in a famous University,
(and I hope I may say it without vanity)
with Dignity and Honour to that Chair:
which was not every ones good fortune, even
after their <hi>Conclusions</hi> had passed the <hi>Press,</hi> as
I am informed out of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, You laugh, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. at your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
as if they were afraid to produce their
<hi>Reasons</hi> against Master <hi>White;</hi> and therefore
you must guess at <hi>their whispering Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by their stalking in great Letters.</hi> And
elsewhere you tell us, <hi>We can not weild Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and therefore <hi>our weapons are Authority.</hi>
What <hi>Goliath</hi> is this <hi>that exprobrates the
Hoast of the Living God?</hi> The Church, Sir,
is both armed with <hi>Authority</hi> against <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:53988:76"/>
and is not unfurnished with <hi>Reason</hi> to
sustain her <hi>Faith</hi> against all the Pagan Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
of the world. If my indeavours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your <hi>approbation,</hi> I shall proceed to
further discoveries, in this your <hi>faithless</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Theology.</hi> And as to your complaint,
That <hi>some words</hi> in their little Book <hi>stalkt
in great Letters,</hi> 'tis grounded on your little
<hi>conversation</hi> with <hi>Books;</hi> where Capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are frequent, especially in citing <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities:</hi>
For there where the force of the
proof lies in two or three words, they are
pointed out thus to the Readers eye and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</hi>
You may, if you please, print in
Capital Letters, <hi>Monachi subditi Episcopis,</hi>
and <hi>Notent Monachi,</hi> and then, you will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
publish a little yet undigested Choler, in
a <hi>Controversie</hi> again and again <hi>decided</hi> by
that Tribunal, from which there is no appeal.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, You tell us, <hi>pag. 14. Master</hi>
Whites <hi>opposers acknowledge, that this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of Purgatory was not handled in Pope</hi>
Benedict <hi>his dayes: since they accuse Master</hi>
White <hi>for the first starter of this doubt.</hi> Your
<hi>Adversary</hi> the <hi>Publisher</hi> of the <hi>Bull,</hi> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all of this: If his other <hi>Opposers</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him of it, I know not how they can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the <hi>Accusation.</hi> New Opinions are raked
out of <hi>hell</hi> every day by the <hi>Heterodox</hi> party,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53988:76"/>
of which we yet finde obscure footsteps in
<hi>Antiquity.</hi> Many opinions were choaked
by the authority of the <hi>Church</hi> even in their
birth, and broached again. Your self ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<hi>Pope Benedict,</hi> and many <hi>Doctors</hi>
of the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> were of opinion, <hi>That
Purgation might be perfected before Reunion,</hi>
pag. 19. and it will not be improbable, if
it was onely their <hi>Opinion</hi> (as you pretend)
that others with Master <hi>White</hi> held the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi>
But how can you parallel <hi>pag.
17.</hi> Master <hi>White</hi> (according to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary)
with him, <hi>who brake a Law
before it was made;</hi> if Master <hi>White</hi> now
breaks one, three hundred years after it was
made; unless you will suppose, that no one
Article of our <hi>Faith</hi> was establisht, till some
one or other impugned it, for otherwise, his
now <hi>Crime</hi> (or erroneous Doctrin) might
stand <hi>condemned</hi> long agoe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 38. Eightly, You would perswade your
Reader, <hi>pag.</hi> 34, 35. that not <hi>You,</hi> but <hi>We</hi> stand
condemn'd by this <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Council:</hi> because
<hi>the sole design of the Pope was, to secure this
sacred verity, That perfect Charity brings an
immediate heaven.</hi> And since your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
holds, <hi>That every soul immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her separation, converts her self perfectly
to God,</hi> and yet he detains her still in <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:53988:77"/>
to suffer a <hi>dry and arbitrary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which doth not <hi>redress the already
rectified affections of the soul:</hi> It follows, <hi>He</hi>
contradicts the <hi>Popes</hi> design, and stands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by this his <hi>Sentence.</hi> I answer,
<hi>first,</hi> That I have already charged you with
imposing on the <hi>Pope,</hi> and if it were true,
that the Pope doth here define, <hi>That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Charity brings an immediate Heaven
(which when you shew we shall be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the miracle)</hi> yet does not your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against us, at all conclude: for
where does your <hi>Adversary</hi> tell you, <hi>That
immediately upon separation, all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the soul are rectified and she in perfect
Charity?</hi> much less that she hath satisfied the
divine Justice for her irregularites in this
mortal life. The <hi>Publisher</hi> hath not one word
of this in his book you pretend to answer.
(You are like a Romancical Knight, you
make Gyants and kill them) but if he truely
did hold this <hi>Doctrin</hi> which you impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him: yet will your Argument be of no
force against him. For this question being
proposed, <hi>Whether souls immediately upon
separation, rectifie all their affections?</hi> Your
Adversary may take which side of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
he pleases, and still sustain with
the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> this their Doctrin
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53988:77"/>
of Purgatory against you. And first, let us
suppose he should asser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with you, <hi>That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
affections do accompany the soul into
the next life,</hi> yet he may sustain those Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are <hi>purged</hi> and <hi>rectified</hi> before <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union:</hi>
and what crime should he be guilty
of, but of opposing your pretended Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations?
and so your mock Victory, and
Pageant Triumph (whilst you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, <hi>p.</hi> 35. to <hi>acknowledge with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,</hi>
that the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> pronounce
against him) is at an end: the strength of
your proof depending on An <hi>Imposition</hi> on
the <hi>Pope,</hi> An <hi>Imposition</hi> on your <hi>Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and a <hi>non</hi>-concluding Argument drawn
out of them both. I had almost forgot,
that in this case, he should withstand the
authority of <hi>Virgil,</hi> whose <hi>Phylosophy</hi> your
Master magnifies above that of the <hi>Church:</hi>
though the <hi>Poet</hi> describes both corporal
punishments inflicted on the <hi>Souls,</hi> (which
your master will needs understand after his
too frequent Metaphorical manner) and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
their passing into <hi>Elysium</hi> (his feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heaven) <hi>before Resurrection,</hi> of which
the <hi>Poet</hi> never dreamt. Nor even as to
the proof that <hi>Affections</hi> to corporal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
do remain in <hi>Separated Souls</hi> (for
which end it is introduced) doth this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53988:78"/>
place of this <hi>Poet</hi> reach home:</p>
            <q>
               <l>—nec funditus omnes</l>
               <l>Corporea excedunt pestes, penitus<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
est,</l>
               <l>Multa diu concreta modis inolescere mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For these words doe not clearly carry this
sense;</p>
            <q>
               <l>Do all evils cease, all plagues all strifes</l>
               <l>Contracted in the body, many a stain</l>
               <l>Long time inured, needs must even then
remain.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But however (to do him right) if this place
do not reach home, this <hi>Doctrin</hi> is frequent
with the <hi>Heathen Poets</hi> in their <hi>Fables,</hi> as in
that of <hi>Narcissus 3. Metamor.</hi> where he
stands condemned to gaze upon himself in
the next life, because he passed out of this, in a
doting self-love.</p>
            <p>But if we should suppose the <hi>Publisher</hi>
to approve: <hi>That such souls immediately
upon separation, rectifie all disordered affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</hi>
how will you justifie, that <hi>this</hi> or
<hi>perfect Charity is an immediate disposition to
Beatifical Vision?</hi> What do you think of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53988:78"/>
               <hi>Lumen Gloriae,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> which
is farther required? And if you fancy
with your <hi>Master, lib. 5. Perip. Lect. 15.
That God is a Sun,</hi> darting <hi>out existencies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the several dispositions of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
What doctrin shall we have from
you of the Saints in this life? will you
pronounce, That never any <hi>Saint</hi> had perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
regulated his <hi>affections</hi> but just in that
very moment he passed out of this life?
What do you conceive of the holy <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</hi>
of the <hi>Baptist?</hi> what in particular of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he tels us, <hi>I live now not I,
but Christ lives in me?</hi> What of the holy
Fathers ofx the old Law? What of the ever
Blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> even when she bore the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
of the world in her sacred womb?
did all these injoy Beatitude, or were they
imperfect in <hi>Charity?</hi> or did this Sun not
dart forth his existencies as <hi>perfect Charity</hi> the
<hi>immediate disposition to heaven</hi> required?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let us consider your Argument, you
tell us, that your</hi> Adversary <hi>conceiving the</hi>
Souls now perfect in Charity, <hi>delayes their
Beatitude and condems them to a</hi> dry and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
punishment, <hi>pag. 35. This</hi> dry and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
punishment <hi>you have out of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Doctrin, for he prosecutes it at length in
his</hi> Middle State<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Acc. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c. And first,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53988:79"/>
he tells us,</hi> God doth not punish sinners upon
the score of Revenge, nor for the satisfaction
of Iustice; since he suffers no injury by our
offences. <hi>Nor can the punishments of Souls</hi>
be involuntary, or springing from an external,
<hi>much less,</hi> from a material Agent; but from
within. <hi>That</hi> such pains neither avail Them,
nor Vs. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That these sufferings have
no connexion with the sins: <hi>and yet</hi> God being
a perfect Architect, hath so artificially framed
his work; that of it self it performs all opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
without supplement, or future minute
alterations, in any of its Members or Organs.
<hi>And so he excepts</hi> against punishments which
are supposed to remain due after the fault for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.
Acc. 13. <hi>All which is but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
what the</hi> Heterodox <hi>party alledged long
since, in their impugnations of</hi> Purgatory
<hi>and</hi> Penance; <hi>and which stands condemned by
this the</hi> 30 Canon <hi>of the</hi> Council of Trent,
Sess. 6. de Iustif. <hi>occasioned by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
If any one shall say, That to every
penitent sinner, after the grace of Iustification
received, that so the fault is forgiven, and
the guilt of eternal punishment, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
no guilt of temporal punishment to be
payd, either in this life, or in the future in
Purgatory, before the passage to Heaven may
be opened; let him be Anathema. <hi>Thus
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53988:79"/>
the</hi> Council. <hi>Where by the way you may
observe a</hi> temporary punishment in Purgatory,
<hi>against your Systeme: and after the</hi> remission
of the fault, a punishment due.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But because this</hi> Truth <hi>is so fundamental
in the Sacred</hi> Council, <hi>all its Doctrine of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
the third part of</hi> Penance, <hi>depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on it: Let us compare its Sacred</hi> Oracles,
<hi>with the Doctrine of our new</hi> Master. <hi>And
first,</hi> Sess. 14. cap. 8. Of the necessity and
fruit of Satisfaction. <hi>The</hi> Council <hi>declares
this</hi> Doctrine <hi>(of Satisfaction) to have been
the constantly received Faith of the</hi> Church
<hi>by</hi> Divine Tradition, <hi>and is</hi> impugned now by
those who have an outside of Piety, but have
denied the vertue of it. <hi>Directly opposite to
our new School, which teaches,</hi> That Pains
remain not due, after the fault forgiven: <hi>under
pretence of</hi> promoting solid Devotion. <hi>And
the</hi> Council <hi>pronounces,</hi> That it is altogether
false, and against the Word of God, that the
fault is never remitted, but that All the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
is also forgiven. For besides Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Tradition, there are illustrious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in holy Writ, which most manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
this Errour. <hi>Thus the</hi> Council, <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against our new</hi> Master, <hi>as will presently
appear by his answer to this Doctrine. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Council pursues.</hi> Nay, the order of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53988:80"/>
the Divine Iustice doth seem to require, that in
an other manner sins should be pardoned in them
who before Baptism offended by ignorance;
then in those who after Baptism violate the
Temple of God. And it becomes the Divine
Clemency, that sins should not be pardoned <hi>(in
Penance)</hi> without any satisfaction. <hi>Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against our</hi> Master, <hi>who tells us;</hi> No Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
are inflicted upon the score of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Divine Iustice, <hi>since</hi> God suffers no
injury by our offences. <hi>The</hi> Council <hi>holds on.</hi>
Let the Priests of God have before their eyes,
that the Satisfaction which they impose <hi>(on
Penitents)</hi> be not onely as to the guard of a
new life, or as a medicine of infirmity; but
also as in revenge and chastisement of their
past sins. <hi>And on this Doctrine, the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the</hi> Church <hi>is grounded in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of</hi> Penance, <hi>where Satisfaction is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
after</hi> Absolution <hi>and forgiveness of
the sin, and that in</hi> Revenge <hi>and</hi> Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Directly against our</hi> Master, <hi>who
excepts against this Doctrine,</hi> That after the
sin forgiven, Pains remain due. <hi>And the</hi>
Council <hi>concludes:</hi> which whilst our Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
will not understand, they so teach the best
Repentance to be a new life, that they take
away all the force and use of Satisfaction.
<hi>And again, the same Council,</hi> Sess. 6. cap. 14.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53988:80"/>
               <hi>declares;</hi> That in the Penance of those who
fall into sin <hi>(after Baptism)</hi> is not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
Ceasing from sins, and a detestation of
them, or a contrite and humbled heart; but a
confession and absolution; and also Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Fastings, Alms, Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not for
the Eternal punishment, which together with
the fault is remitted by the Sacrament; but
for the temporal punishment, which (as holy
Writ teaches) is not All of it, alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as in Baptism. <hi>Directly against</hi> Him:
<hi>For the</hi> Fault <hi>is here remitted, together with
the</hi> Guilt <hi>of</hi> Eternal punishment, <hi>by the</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<hi>and yet</hi> Temporal pains <hi>remain
due in</hi> Penance, <hi>but not in</hi> Baptism. <hi>You
see, Sir,</hi> Punishments due, <hi>after the sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
which</hi> Doctrine <hi>you would disgrace
with your Epitheres of</hi> dry and arbitrary.
<hi>Where by the way I would have you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That sins are in an other manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in</hi> Baptism, <hi>then in penance; for in</hi>
this, <hi>a</hi> Temporary punishment <hi>remains due,
not in</hi> That. <hi>And I pray you tell us, when
you write again, Whether in Baptism recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with your</hi> Conditional <hi>affection to
mortal sins, or an</hi> Absolute <hi>one to</hi> venial <hi>sins,
if the</hi> Party <hi>should at that very moment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this life; your</hi> Master <hi>would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him to</hi> Purgatorry, <hi>even till the</hi> Day
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53988:81"/>
of Iudgment? <hi>though this</hi> Countil <hi>here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that the</hi> Fault, <hi>together with the</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<hi>is</hi> All <hi>of it remitted in</hi> Baptism;
<hi>and the</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Florence <hi>defines,</hi> That the
Souls of them who after Baptism received,
contract no blemish at all of sin, are Presently
received into Heaven. <hi>I do very much sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
this</hi> Presently <hi>will signifie</hi> at the Day
of Iudgment, <hi>in your Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because the <hi>Council</hi> here mentions <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Examples</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> where the
sin was forgiven, and yet a <hi>punishment</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
which had no natural connexion to
the sin it self, as all <hi>Divines</hi>
understand in the case of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>

where for his <hi>Crime,</hi>
now forgiven, <hi>God</hi> took away
his <hi>Son.</hi> It is not unworthy
our observation, how our great <hi>Master</hi> was
pinched with this <hi>Example,</hi> when he sustains,
<hi>De Med. Stat. dimens. 13. That punishments
are not inflicted by God, which have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the crime.</hi> For there having
(most injuriously) tied God to Nature; and
told us, <hi>That God being the Author of
Nature, which flows from him as from its
proper Cause, mu contradict himself, if he
act any thing against it:</hi> And therefore <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
assign punishments bearing no connexion with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53988:81"/>
the fault.</hi> Yet presently (in the same leaf)
to answer this Case of <hi>David,</hi> he was forced to
have recourse to <hi>a Miracle, or work beyond the
usual and connatural course of causes, and the
usual connexion between the fault and penalty,
that God might signalize a revenge:</hi> (which
according to his Doctrine, is to make God
contradicts himself.) In which he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
all his former Positions and Grounds,
both of Gods proceeding on the score of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and Justice; and this his now deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctrine, That he punishes not, but by
a <hi>Penalty</hi> naturally connected, or <hi>flowing</hi>
from the <hi>Crime.</hi> But presently he tells us,
That <hi>such Examples</hi> are not to <hi>be drawn to
the condition of ordinary punishments, which
are usual in the common order of things.</hi> But
why it may not be extended, that Gods <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
may and doth require of <hi>separated Souls,</hi>
a punishment not now flowing from their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Affections,</hi> he doth not tell us: Nor
indeed could he give other <hi>Reason</hi> then,
that this Doctrine would not square with his

satisfaction for sins which the souls of those who

it self is quite pulled up by the very roots.</hi> And
when you write again, Sir, I expect your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
should tell us; That this <hi>Council</hi> too,
as well as that of <hi>Florence,</hi> doth not decree any
thing against your <hi>Master,</hi> but against me. The

            </p>
            <p>Sect. 39. <hi>But what is all This, if</hi> Master
White <hi>(as you tell us,</hi> pag. 33.) say it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable,
that Souls being purged are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
in Heaven? <hi>Or if you can not beat
it, with all this indeavour, into our heads,</hi>
that charity is the immediate disposition to bliss:
<hi>since</hi> this is the ground of his envied Book, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,</hi>
of the Middle State of Souls? <hi>(as you
say,</hi> pag. 34.) <hi>For what can all the</hi> Councils
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53988:82"/>
               <hi>prevail against a</hi> Demonstration? <hi>And were
it not worth my Readers pains to see, and
satiate his soul, with the</hi> excellent Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<hi>of this</hi> sacred Verity? <hi>the</hi> Pope <hi>in
our present</hi> Bull <hi>declares,</hi> Souls now purged
see the divine Essence. <hi>And we having, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

we not see how his A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to</hi> Heaven <hi>too? Thus then,</hi> Instit. Sac.
Tom. 2. lib. 3. Lect. 6. <hi>he with incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
evidence, sufficient to destroy the hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
onely</hi> Faith <hi>of the world demonstrates,</hi>
That Souls perfect in Charity, enjoy the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
Vision. <hi>And first presupposing,</hi> That
souls in the next life attain a plenary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all things. <hi>He thus pursues,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
<hi>(sayes he)</hi> since God is one onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
which is so elevated above the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all possible, and existent things, that
it is superior to gender <hi>(genus)</hi> it self, and
hath no common reason: it is evident that an
intellect by force of the intellection of all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
things, much less of existents, can not
be erected by consequence, and as it were vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
discourse, to the knowledg of such a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
which is (as we may say) as it were,
the diffinition of God: and therefore can not
intuitively see God. Again, it is evident,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53988:83"/>
That those who have lived holily, that is,
exercised themselves to have God for the last
end, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le good, having now received this
plentitude of knowledg, out of that, that they
more strongly and evidently know this truth,
do infinitely increase in the affection to see
God: and since the Will is a reflection of
existence upon essence, by which the vertue
of the entity is exercised and applyed to the
desired effect: such a Saint, not to be any other
thing, then a man exercised according to the
whole vertue and Entity, in respect of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of God. Since that then as to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is to be himself to be, so to know God,
is to be God: that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be <hi>(of)</hi> to be

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> esse <hi>esse)</hi> but since the vertue of a thing to
be, is nothing but a potentiality, especially in
respect of to be subsistent, which is both essence
and to be: it is concluded such a Saint, by all
which is in him, not to be any thing else, but
an actual and exercised potentiality of being
God. Since therefore on the part of God, out
of that that he is to be it self, (or speaking
more especially, it is to be understood in act it
self, or to be in act understood, which is to be
his own to understand passively: so that to be
understood, is not in him a denomination, but
a real quality (that very quality which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53988:83"/>
the Father) and this quality or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
is subsistent, and by consequence proper
to no power but to any <hi>one</hi> accommodated) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be wanting which appertains to the
reason of act and actuality: it is concluded,
That the Saints and God are one by power
and act, that is, that the Saints cleerly see
God. <hi>And now, truly Sir, if my Readers
patience hath held out, as mine hath to
Translate this long</hi> Demonstration, <hi>just as it
lyes, for fear of spoiling the</hi> Non-sense, <hi>I
think he desires me to make it his humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
to that Ingenious Gentleman, who
Translated your Masters</hi> Middle State of

Write again, in what</hi> Moode <hi>and</hi> Figure
<hi>this</hi> Syllogisme <hi>concludes.</hi> But now having
Demnostratively understood, <hi>That the Saints</hi>
perfect in Charity immediately see God. <hi>Let
us see how you pursue the way that</hi> Separated
Souls <hi>attain to this perfection by</hi> Re-union,
<hi>And so;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 40. Ninethly,</hi> You tell us, <hi>pag. 37.
Master White</hi> endeavours <hi>to finde a state in
which the soul may be changeable to more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53988:84"/>
desires, and a connatural cause to give
her those desires, to wit, the corporal and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
sight of her dearest Saviour, &amp;c. For
what state more fit for changeableness, then
a corporeal one? and what more powerful
to ravish the whole affections of a soul, then
the divine face of her Spouse?</hi> My Reader
will not wonder at the inventions your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>finds out,</hi> now he is a little acquainted
with the <hi>head</hi> that finds them. Yet this
<hi>invention</hi> is worth our observation, which I
suspect, you will hardly shew in any former
writer, and so justly he may be proud of it.
The <hi>Souls</hi> then have been all the time of
their <hi>separation,</hi> in a state of <hi>suffering</hi> only,
by their irregular <hi>affections:</hi> which being
wholly unchangeable in that <hi>state,</hi> they are
as yet not purged, or cleansed at all, but
perfectly the same they were at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>death:</hi> but now by <hi>reunion with
the body they are put into a new state of
changeableness.</hi> Now, Sir, <hi>Christians</hi> that
have hitherto walked by <hi>Faith,</hi> do all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the way or Pilgrimage of men to
the future life, is ended at <hi>death.</hi> They
never heard that <hi>Souls</hi> at the <hi>Resurrection</hi>
are returned to <hi>Act</hi> again in order to <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
If that <hi>state</hi> do render <hi>Souls</hi> change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53988:84"/>
and free, and their actions then, have such
an influence on their future <hi>state,</hi> it will just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be feared, that many of them may drop
out of <hi>Purgatory</hi> into <hi>Hell.</hi> Nor <hi>will the
sight of the Divine face of their Spouse,</hi>
quite evacuate this apprehension: For if
the Soul be not necessarily, but freely and
voluntarily <hi>ravisht,</hi> the doubt will remain,
Whether she will still continue her inordinate
<hi>affections,</hi> or avert her self wholly from God,
and so either remain in his <hi>Purgatory</hi> still, or
nowpass into <hi>Hell?</hi> And how happily, Sir,
doth this change of <hi>affections</hi> (which is your
sole and onely purging or cleansing of the <hi>Soul,
wrought by the sight of the Divine face of
Christ,</hi> which sight is doubtless an <hi>incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
pleasure,</hi> and such an one as <hi>ravishes the
whole affections of the Soul)</hi> agree with the
Decrees of these <hi>Councils:</hi> That of <hi>Florence,</hi>
when it defines; <hi>The Souls are purged by the
pains of Purgatory.</hi> That of <hi>Trent,</hi> when
it teaches; <hi>After the sin remitted, temporary
pains are due in Purgatory.</hi> When now we
are taught, that souls are purged <hi>by pure plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
the sight of their dear Spouse.</hi> And in
earnest, Sir, I know not why the world is
not more inamoured of your Doctrine: You
have now filled our lives with the <hi>pleasures</hi> of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53988:85"/>
the <hi>body;</hi> you have quite turned the <hi>pains</hi>
and <hi>afflictions of Souls in the state of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
into <hi>Pure pleasures:</hi> And now at the
Re-union, you fancy the Souls <hi>affections</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
(that is her self purged) by an <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
pleasure, which even ravishes all her
affections.</hi> And to compleat a most pleasant
Divinity, I could pursue it, even to your
Masters pleasant <hi>Hell:</hi> who, <hi>Instit. Sac. lib.
3. lec.</hi> 9. describes the <hi>damned</hi> so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with their torments, <hi>that they are in love
with them, and would not be without them.</hi>
But I reserve that to an other <hi>discovery.</hi>
Onely I will for the present mind you, that
since the <hi>inordinate Affections</hi> of the damned
are their torment, (according to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in that same place,) and those affections
remain in them, in the same <hi>proportion they
were in this life;</hi> and since doubtless where
<hi>pleasures</hi> are possible, and easie to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and we continually pressed by our <hi>bodies</hi>
to the enjoyment; the refraining from them
is a far greater torment, then where the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
are not so impetuous, or none at all;
and the <hi>injoyment</hi> represented as <hi>impossible,</hi>
which at one blow outs off all the Wills pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit:
It will follow, That those who restrain
themselves from these <hi>pleasures,</hi> are in a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53988:85"/>
greater <hi>Hell</hi> in this life, then those who are
<hi>damned</hi> in the next. And therefore it would
not seem very rational, that any man should
precipitate himself voluntarily <hi>now</hi> into a
greater <hi>Hell,</hi> where is duration and successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to avoid a less in the future life, the <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of which, <hi>is but as one moment.</hi> And
let me further beg of you, to render us a
cleer account, How it should happen, that
the <hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>damned</hi> at the re-union should
not all of them rectifie their now disordered
affections, and fly to Heaven: For since
your Master hath already taught us, That the
damned Souls <hi>are now furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inst. Peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
judgments corrected in
them: their grief depending
on this, that their affections to corporal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are greater then in proportion to other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
which ought to be preferred:</hi> it would
not be inconsequent to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is Doctrine, That
those damned souls now seeing most evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that other desires ought to be preferred
before these <hi>affections to corporal pleasures,</hi>
(since this errour is now rectified) and they
in a condition, by re-union with the body, of
<hi>changeableness,</hi> they should also rectifie
their <hi>affections,</hi> which are but these <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:53988:86"/>
and by consequence become now De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizons
of Heaven, which also might seem to
become the Mercies of <hi>God,</hi> and render the
<hi>state</hi> of the Blessed more happy there, by their
company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 41. Tenthly, You entertain your
Reader, <hi>pag. 36, &amp;c.</hi> with scoffing at <hi>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Grains, sanctified Beads,</hi> the <hi>extending
of Indulgencies to the next World,</hi> which you
style <hi>External devices, Vtensils of a thriving
Devotion, deluding Priviledges,</hi> &amp;c. which
perfectly befits a <hi>Scholar</hi> trained up in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
School; thus he began. And you are
not content with this, you retrive again, (in
the same place,) and fix upon your <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi>
that signal calumny long since fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Church,</hi> (for the use of such things,)
<hi>That she goes to Heaven by such things, not
by holy desires:</hi> Nor even <hi>pretends, that such
things promote souls in holy desires, or increase
sanctity in them.</hi> In which you speak against
your own Soul and Conscience: For you very
well know, the <hi>Church</hi> is not guilty of this;
nor your Adversary, who will tell you, that
he beleeves with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>if he had
faith able to remove mountains, yet it would not
avail him without charity;</hi> and further tells
you, That such things as you here enumerate,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53988:86"/>
do <hi>increase sanctity and holy desires in us,</hi> and
render our prayers more effectual for the
<hi>Souls in Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eleventhly, You tell us, (in your Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,)
<hi>That private calumnies are whispered
against Master White, as holding strange O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
which his own Books contradict.</hi> I
have also heard something of this, and I think
our informations jump; you may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
find it hinted at in this discourse: Nor
need that Gentleman fear your title of a <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatour,</hi>
or that his <hi>Authority</hi> will not carry
it, nor indeed will it be engaged in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
he is provided of a Defence; I have
shewed him that very Doctrine <hi>in terms,</hi> in
your Masters Book, which he had told him
in <hi>Private;</hi> it is ready for you, you shall have
it when you please to call for it: And
I wonder <hi>those solid persons, acquainted
with every ressort of his Learning,</hi> did not
see it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, You add, <hi>Your Master hath this
comfort, That his carriage needs neither fear
the exemplarity of his Adversaries lives, nor
his unparalled Learning the force of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</hi>
In which, your Reader will be
perswaded, that you were not a perfect Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in <hi>Galateus</hi> his School. The <hi>Publisher</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:53988:87"/>
against whom you write, is a <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
exemplarity;</hi> and for my part, where
your Masters Pen is not engaged, I have
been edified by him, even in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
I find some things most excellent; but
why comparisons should be made, I do not
understand. <hi>You</hi> and <hi>I</hi> being private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
hope still the best, and pray for all
those whom we desire to better by our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
But because it is both laudable and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to magnifie the good and pious lives of
men, I joyn heartily with you in this <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
of your Master: And if you now design
to advance in order to his <hi>Canonization,</hi> and
can make good his <hi>Faith,</hi> (which is the first
<hi>Quaere</hi> of that Court,) I shall very willingly
give testimony to the exemplarity of his
<hi>Life.</hi> I wish from my Soul, his <hi>Doctrine</hi>
would appear intirely and fully <hi>Catholick;</hi>
and for the rest, you have my Vote; he
may be beleeved, as holy, as St. <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 42. And now, Sir, I hope to have
given you some satisfaction in our point in
controversie. We as yet have proceeded
upon this unshakeable ground, That the
<hi>Councils</hi> are unerrable in their <hi>Decrees;</hi> and
upon this I have received a very ample and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53988:87"/>
full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one my self. I do beleeve, That <hi>Souls
are purged uncloathed of their Bodies, and
presently received into Heaven before re-union
with them.</hi> And that the <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi>
deliver this Position, I must see, if I have
eyes; and I hope you will, by what is said.
And this hope is heightned in me, because
my Conscience tell me, I have proceeded
with as even a hand as I could, in balancing
what you have said against it, with that which
I have said for it. If I am byassed naturally
on either side, it is on yours: Nature prompts
me still to wish, the <hi>Church</hi> and her <hi>Faith</hi>
were not engaged against you: Your opinion
would, at one blow, ease me of that incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
care to assist my dead Friends: But I
have learnt this work of mercy from a Child,
<hi>to pray for the Dead,</hi> which in your Systeme
(as I have evinced) is fruitless. But alas, Sir,
this business of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is not that which
so much troubles my head, though it be one:
I have a deeper fear: I am pressed with the
consideration of this new molded <hi>Theology,</hi> I
see this <hi>demonstrative Doctrine,</hi> this pretence of
reducing the mysteries of <hi>Faith</hi> to our narrow
brains, this hope of introducing <hi>Science</hi> in
lieu of <hi>Faith</hi> into the World, strikes much
deeper then yet <hi>You</hi> imagine. Nor am I at all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53988:88"/>
confident <hi>of your solid cleer-sighted Friends,
who are acquainted with every resort of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Whites <hi>Doctrine.</hi> I fear, and I think
not without Reason, the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>He</hi> have
nothing common, but <hi>words;</hi> for the <hi>notions</hi>
and significations are quite different: But
our <hi>Faith</hi> lies not in the sound of <hi>words,</hi> but
in the sense and meaning of them. When I
am told, <hi>Souls are not purged in the state of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
but onely at re-union;</hi> though the word
<hi>Purgatory</hi> yet remain, my <hi>Faith</hi> remains not
of this <hi>Article.</hi> And so it will fare with the
rest. I do beleeve <hi>Faith, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
are infused by the Holy Ghost, into our
souls in Baptism.</hi> I do beleeve <hi>holy Iustif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace</hi> (by which we are the Sons of God)
<hi>is something inhaerent in our souls;</hi> and my
notion of these things which are <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
is, that they are of a different order and
series then <hi>Nature.</hi> But when I am now
taught, <hi>God is the Author of Nature, but
showrs not down into us an other series of
things of an other or differing order; Reason is
Nature to us, and the perfection of Reason
is Demonstration:</hi> Though at the same time
we are taught, That <hi>God perfects Nature
by supernatural things;</hi> yet I suspect the
word <hi>supernatural,</hi> being still the same,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53988:88"/>
that now it is become <hi>aequivocal,</hi> and
signifies an other thing with him then
it does with me. I do believe <hi>the ever
Blessed Trinity to be Three real Persons, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Holy Ghost:</hi> Yet where I
find this most sublime mystery pretended to
be Demonstrated by what is <hi>Essential</hi> in
God <hi>(to know and love himself,)</hi> when I find
it so brought down to our capacities, that
it is pretended, <hi>The examples of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
and Natural Phylosophy equalize this
Mystery;</hi> when I am taught, <hi>That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Son</hi> (in Divinis) are <hi>Metaphors:</hi>
I have a great apprehension that this <hi>Doctrin</hi>
and my hitherto received <hi>Faith</hi> agree but in
<hi>words,</hi> not in the things signified by them.
I do believe, <hi>That God most freely, and of
his own goodness built this Vniverse:</hi> I
believe, <hi>He is not necessarily tyed to the order
or course of Nature:</hi> And when I am now
taught, <hi>That God must contradict himself if he
Act any thing against Nature.</hi> That, <hi>Out of
the force and series of Nature, nothing could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
better to Iudas, then to be damned.</hi> In fine,
God should cease to be God, if this <hi>Flye</hi>
should not now be in <hi>nature.</hi> I fear though
we agree in this word <hi>God,</hi> our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
jump not at all. Christians appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53988:89"/>
and adore the liberal free hand of their
Maker; but a God tyed to any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
himself, is not a Christian <hi>God,</hi> but a
<hi>Pagan Iupiter.</hi> I do believe upon Christs
words, <hi>That if I keep the Commandments I
shall enter into life:</hi> and this is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of my Doctrin of manners. And
when I am now taught, <hi>That God neither
commands nor forbids any thing.</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we agree in these words, <hi>Thou shalt not
Steal: Thou shalt not commit Adultery:</hi>
my whole Doctrin of <hi>Morality</hi> is banished
by this assertion. It will hereafter appear
your <hi>Master</hi> hath furnished us with a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
other <hi>Morality</hi> then ever <hi>Escobar</hi> thought
of. What do you think of this Position of
your Master in his book of <hi>Government and
Obedience, ground</hi> 6. speaking of himself, <hi>An
other man</hi> (says he) <hi>is no otherwise to me, then a
peece of Cloath or Wood, which I cut and
shape after my own will, fittingly for my
use: Even though I do him harme, or seek his
ruine; It follows not I wrong him.</hi> How
well doth this agree with that Principle of
Nature, <hi>That we ought so to do to others, as
we would have them do to us?</hi> In summ,
where I see a pretender to Demonstrate all
the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our holy <hi>Faith,</hi> and that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53988:89"/>
               <hi>Faith</hi> shall cease and <hi>Evidence</hi> take place,
I justly fear though the <hi>words</hi> are still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
this is but to supplant Christ and
his Doctrin; our notions and significations
of words must be changed, or else these
stupendious <hi>Mysteries</hi> can not be levelled to
our weak capacities. But though these be
my apprehensions, yet I wish I were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken:
I wish these new Doctrines may
receive such Explications, that they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
no less Catholick then those I profess,
and shall be as happy to receive satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as you to give it me; but, withal, I
must frankly promise you, that I shall
require your satisfaction both in these
and many other <hi>Doctrines.</hi> I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
with thankfulness, that one may be
instructed by Master <hi>White,</hi> whose excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Wit and Pen, if duly applyed, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable;
but if I mistake not, he hath flown
beyond the bounds fixed by an unerring
hand: and therefore desire you to accept
of this serious Protestation, That I have
an intire respect for his <hi>Person,</hi> and if
any harsh word hath escaped my Pen, it is
the Doctrine not <hi>He</hi> that is concerned in
the Epithete: the same I speake and intend
to your self. Though if you consider the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53988:90"/>
case aright (where not only whatsoever is
sacred to Catholicks, but what the Heterodox-Party
agree with them in, is thus attaqued;
Where the foundations of Christianity and
of all Religion, the <hi>Liberty of God,</hi> and
<hi>Contingency of Creatures,</hi> is thus attempted
by a <hi>Lucretian</hi> Galamawfry <hi>Phylosophy,</hi> to
make way for a new <hi>Demonstrative Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)</hi>
such an exotick design deserves not a
more mild censure then what I have fixed
upon it: and yet I hope you will nor find
<hi>your</hi> too too frequent <hi>Calumniating Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,</hi>
or any thing like it in my whole
<hi>booke.</hi> If you think there is any animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
in my <hi>Discourse,</hi> I heartily beg your
pardon: we daily say, <hi>Sicut &amp; nos dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus,</hi>
where these heats are easily allayed;
and for our present Controversie of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
let us patiently expect the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of our undoubted <hi>Superior,</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

him by our Lord Iesus Christ in St.</hi> Peter
<hi>to Feed, to Rule, and to Govern the Vniversal

Holy in all his works, who through
his mercy forsakes not the Sacred
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53988:91"/>
Roman, Catholique, and Apostolical
Church, which his right hand hath
planted as his Vineyard, and which
he hath raised up, as chief and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queress,
to be the head of all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
our Lord saying to <hi>Peter, Thou
art Peter, and upon this Rock I will
build my Church:</hi> but by his blessed
Apostles, especially <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
the singular Defenders of the same
Church, keeps her through his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
Benignity and continual Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety:
that she being governed by these
Rulers, may remain stable in her self,
as founded upon the firm Rock, and
that all the believers of the Christian
Faith may obey her, may yield to
her, may intend to her, may live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her authority, may be under her
discipline and correction. That in her
nothing may be taught rashly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
brought in unwarily, nothing
in Faith unadvisedly introduced: and
that so men may decline from evil,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53988:92"/>
and do good; that they may walk
in the right paths, and make progress
to better things, by their holy desires;
that they may hopefully expect the
neer approaching rewards of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life of just men, and fearfully
dread the not far off calamities of
Hell, appointed for the wicked. For
it is written, <hi>Behold I come quickly,
and my reward is with me, to render
unto every one according to his works.</hi>
But if it shall be otherwise attempted
by any one; that she forthwith by
her authority (adding also punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thereunto, as she shall judge
it expedient) totally root it out. For
which Church (to the end that she
subsisting in her self might inform
others) our Saviour Christ Jesus pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his Father in the time of his
Passion, saying, <hi>Simon, behold Satan
hath desired to have you, that he may
fift you as Wheat: but I have prayed
for thee, that thy faith may not fail, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53988:92"/>
when thou art converted strengthen thy
Brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§. 1. There arose indeed a matter
of question not long since, in the
time of <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22 our Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of happy memory, between some
Doctors of Divinity, concerning the
Vision of the Souls of just men after
their death, in which there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be purged, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
out of this world, or <hi>if there
were,</hi> it <hi>was now totally purged;</hi>
Whether they see the Divine Essence
before the assumption of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the generall Judgement,
and also concerning other matters:
some of them holding the negative,
some the affirmative; others accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their own imaginations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to shew divers things, and
in divers manners, concerning the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Divine Essence by the Souls
aforesaid, as it is known apparently by
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53988:93"/>
their words and writings, and by their
rejected Disputations, which we here
omit for brevities sake: because they so
differed amongst themselves from our
determinations. And whereas our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Predecessor, to whom the
determination of the above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Questions did belong, had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself in his publick Consistory,
as well before his Brethren, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
of the holy Roman Church,
(of whose members we our selves then
were) as before the Prelates and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
in Divinity (many of them
being present) strictly charging and
commanding them, that each one
should deliberately deliver his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concerning the matter of the
aforesaid Vision, when he should
require it from them: But being
prevented by Death (as it pleased
God) he could not effect it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="181" facs="tcp:53988:93"/>
§. 2. We therefore, (after the
death of our aforesaid Predecessor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
assumed to sit in the Apostolical
Seat; more seriously considering,
how great dangers of Souls might
be incurr'd, and how many scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
might arise, if the aforesaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
were left unresolved: to the
end that the diversity of opinions
may perish, and the solidity of truth
may plainly appear, having first
made use of a careful examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the matters aforesaid, and
having diligently deliberated with
our Brethren, the Cardinals of the
said Roman Church: Do, with
the advice of those our Brethren,
by the Apostolicall authoritie, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
by this constitution to be valid
for ever.</p>
                        <p>§. 3. That according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ordination of God, The Souls of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53988:94"/>
all the Saints, which departed out of
this world before the Passion of our
Lord Jesus Christ; as also the Souls
of the holy Apostles, Martyrs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
Virgins, and of the other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
departed after they had received
Christs sacred Baptism; in whom

if there then be, or shall be any thing
to be purged in them, when after Death
they shall be purged.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And, That the Souls of Infants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
with the said Christian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and to be baptized; when being
baptized they shall depart this life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have the use of their free

                        <p>
                           <hi>PRESENTLY after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,</hi>
and after the aforesaid Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in such as stood in need thereof;
<hi>EVEN BEFORE THE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUMPTION
OF THEIR
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53988:94"/>
BODIES, AND BEFORE
THE GENERAL JUDGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT;
(since the Ascension of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:)
WERE, ARE, AND
SHALL BE IN HEAVEN,
in the heavenly Kingdome, in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Paradise with Christ, aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the fellowship of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
and (since the Passion and
Death of our Lord Jesus Christ,)</hi> they
have seen, and do see the Divine Essence
by an intuitive vision, aud even face to
face, without the mediation of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
interposing it self by way of a visible
object; but the Divine Essence shewing
it self immediately unto them, nakedly,
clearly, and openly: <hi>And, That they
thus seeing the Divine Essence, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the same.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, That by such a vision
and fruition, the Souls of them who
are already departed out of this life,
are truly blessed, and have eternal life
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53988:95"/>
and rest; and so shall their Souls be,
which shall hereafter depart this life,
when they shall see the same Divine
Essence, and enjoy it before the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Judgment.</p>
                        <p>And, That this Vision and Fruition
of the Divine Essence, doth evacuate
in them, and cause to cease the Acts
of Faith and Hope; as Faith and
Hope are properly Theological Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                        <p>And, That after such an intuitive
and facial Vision and Fruition shall be
begun in them; the same Vision and
Fruition, without any interruption,
evacuation or cessation, hath remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
continued, and shall be continued,
even to the final Judgment, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
even to all Eternity.</p>
                        <p>§. 4. Moreover We Define, That
according to Gods common ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the souls of such as die in actual
deadly sin, descend PRESENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53988:95"/>
into Hell after their death, where
they are tormented with infernal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments;
and, That nevertheless,
in the Day of Judgment all men shall
appear before the Tribunal of Christ
with their bodies, to render an account
of their own actions, that every one
may bear the proper things of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
according to what he hath done,
whether good or evil,</p>
                        <p>§. 5. Decreeing, That our Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

every of them, be held by all faithfull
people: And that whosoever shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

the common ordination of God, the Souls of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53988:98"/>

               </p>
               <p>Though the very Text it self of the

be repressed. It is to be noted, That when
any doubt arises concerning the meaning of
a <hi>Council,</hi> we are diligently to seek out what
occasioned such a Decree, and find what was
then chiefly agitated and debated.</p>
               <p>The matter here in dispute between the
<hi>Latins</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was this, <hi>What Souls
were admitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </p>
               <p>Let us hear the <hi>Latins</hi> in this question
concerning the fire of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> presently
in the beginning of the <hi>Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Latins</hi> acknowledge both in this
world a fire, and a <hi>Purgatory</hi> by fire; and
also in the future world they acknowledg a
fire, yet not purging, but eternal. They
confess also, That souls are cleansed and freed
by that (first named) Purgatory Fire, and that
he who hath committed many offences, is
freed after a long time of purgation; but
he who hath committed a few, is sooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us now heare the Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Greeks are of opinion, That the <hi>Fire</hi>
is in the future onely, and that in this world,
The temporary punishment of sinful Souls
consists in their being imprisoned in a <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
place,</hi> where they remain for a time;
but that they are purged, that is, <hi>freed</hi> and
<hi>delivered</hi> from that obscure and afflicting
place, by the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the
Priests, but not by <hi>Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto the <hi>Council</hi> of the Souls in <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi>
It proceeds to declare the opinions
of both Churches, concerning the souls of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53988:101"/>
Just men, which have no debt at all to be
paid.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Latins</hi> say, That the souls of holy and
just men are in Heaven; and that (without any
<hi>medium)</hi> they see and enjoy the Sacred <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> imagine that the souls of just
men have indeed obtain'd <hi>Beatitude,</hi> but not
perfectly; and that they shall perfectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it, when they shall be reunited to their
Bodies in the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And, that in the
mean while, they remain in a separated place,
where they interiorly rejoyce, entertaining
their thoughts with the fore-seen and fore-known
perfect <hi>Beatiude</hi> and Adoption which
is prepared for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You see the Question cleerly and plainly
propounded: You see wherein the Eastern
and Western Churches agree, wherein they
disagree: What (after their frequent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations)
was at last concluded? Surely
no other thing, then—The sacred Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
approving,</hi> We define, That the souls of
them, who after Baptism received, have
contracted no blemish at all of sin; as also
those souls, which after they have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the blemish of sin, are purged either in
their Bodies, or being vncloathed of their said
Bodies, are presently received into Heaven,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53988:101"/>
and cleerly behold God himself in Trinity and
Vnity, <hi>as he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold a <hi>Categorical Definition,</hi> directly
determining the proposed difficulty. The
Question was, How many sorts of souls were
admitted to the intuitive Vision of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the general day of Judgment? The
Councill answers, Three Sorts:</p>
               <p>The first sort, such as after Baptism, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
no sin.</p>
               <p>The second such as although they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
sin, yet fully satisfied for them before
their death by worthy fruits of Pennance.</p>
               <p>The third, such as contracted sin, and did
not fully satisfie in this life, but were purged
afterwards in <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Aversary dares not deny an admittance
of the First and Second sort of Souls to the
fruition of God <hi>presently,</hi> before the day of
general Judgment. But he most inconsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejects the Third sort now in Question.
For what an absurd Exposition of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
would this be? The souls of Just men
having no sin at all, are received <hi>presently</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
the day of general Judgment to the cleer
Vision of God. In like manner the souls which
have fully satisfied for their sins before their
departure, are admitted presently before the
day of Judgment to eternal Beatitude: the souls
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53988:102"/>
cleansed in Purgatory are admitted <hi>presently,</hi>
that is, in the day of Judgment? When as
this Third Sort of Souls is contained in the
same period, under the self same form of
words. And (which is to be taken special
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ice off) the Particle <hi>Mox presently,</hi>
wherein is the greatest force, is joyned one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this Third sort of Souls, though it is
also necessarily understood in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>Surely none of the <hi>Latins,</hi> none of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> did either question or controvert,
Whether the Souls of Just men, or the Souls
in Purgatory were admitted to eternal Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<hi>in the Day of general Iudgment:</hi> But
the sole difficulty was of the time preceding;
as manifestly appears by the Declaration of
both Churches: and as concerning <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
the difference between them was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this; That the <hi>Latins</hi> admitted the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of a material Fire; the <hi>Greeks</hi> a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
place, but not Fire.</p>
               <p>Now for that the Adversary is pretended
to be a Catholick, and acknowledges that he
ought to submit himself, not onely to General
<hi>Councils,</hi> but also to the Judgment of the
Chief <hi>Pastor:</hi> Let him attentively read and
consider the solemn Decree of <hi>Pope Benedict</hi>
the xii. (above related) where he shall find his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53988:102"/>
Assertion in most plain terms condemned:
For by that Constitution he may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in what sense this particle <hi>Mox present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
inserted in the Florentin <hi>Council,</hi> is to be
explicated, where the same matter, almost in
the self-same words, is handled; and where it
most manifestly signifies immediately, and
before the day of general Judgme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</p>
               <p>This Decree is extant in <hi>Sanderus</hi> (de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibili
Monarchia,) and it is also mentioned in
the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Tome of the <hi>Councils,</hi> in the life of
the said <hi>Benedict,</hi> in these terms.—<hi>He defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
That the Souls of holy men, sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated
from their sins, were blessed, and enjoyed
the cleer sight of God before the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And he is there highly praised, as a
vertuous man, and one perseverantly constant
till his death in pious actions.</p>
               <p>What (think you) may we now judge of
him, who calls the <hi>Definition</hi> of such a <hi>Pope,</hi>
and of so great a <hi>Council,</hi> a <hi>new Doctrine, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by no foundation, and opposite to the
