            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GEntle Reader, not manie yeeres since, a booke was published <hi>of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian exercise, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:</hi> written by a Iesuit beyonde the Seas, yet an English-man, named Ma. <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> which Booke, Ma. <hi>Edm. Bunney</hi> hauing dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently perused, committed to the publique viewe of all indifferent iudgements: as glad that so good matter proceeded from such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected people, and that good might arise thereby to the benefite of others. Since the manifestation of that booke, the first Author thereof, named Ma. <hi>Parsons,</hi> hath enlarged the same Booke, with a second part and new additions, wherein hee hath concluded and
<pb facs="tcp:10709:4"/>
finished his whole intent of the Resolution, and that vppon some speciall causes, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe setteth downe. For hauing enlarged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers poynts, which before he omitted, and comming to the reasons of this newe supply, in his Praeface he saith in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beeing admonished by the writings of diuers, that since the publishing of my first booke, it hath beene misliked in two principall poynts. First, that I speake so much of good works, and so little of faith. Secondly, that I talked so largely of Gods iustice, and so breefely of his mercie. Beside, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing by the information of many, that diuers persons, hauing a desire in themselues to read the former Booke, but yet beeing weake and fearfull to be touched so neere in conscience, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that booke did: durst neuer intermedle therewith, beeing informed there was nothing in the same wherewith to entertaine themselues, but onely such vehement matter of perswasion, as would greatly trouble and afflict them. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of which inconueniencie, I haue framed this second part of that worke, and therein inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diuers Chapters and discourses of matters more plausible, and of themselues more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: wherewith the Reader may sollace hys minde, at such times as he findeth the same not willing, to feele the spurre of more earnest motion to perfection.</hi>

what you haue reade in his owne wryting. And considering howe diuers were desirous to haue thys latter part, because they had thorowlie read the other: after passage the perusing of sundrie learned men, who haue thought it as worthy to be seene as the first, it is (gentle Reader) presented to thy viewe, reade it indifferentlie, and iudge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as thou findest occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

               <p>The Prophet Daniell had many visions, and strange reuelations of great &amp; high mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries: but one amongst all other (and this the least) of the most dreadfull iudgments of God vpon sinners in the ende of the world. The vision was by the great riuer Tygris:<note place="margin">Daniel. 10.</note> where, as diuers Angels were attending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bankes: so vpon the water it selfe stood one in the likenes of a man, of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dreadfull maiestie; his apparrel beeing onelie lynnen, through which his body shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like precious stone:<note place="margin">A most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vision of Daniell, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee sawe Christ.</note> his eyes like bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lamps: his face like flashing lightning: his armes &amp; legges like brasse inflamed, and

his voyce as the shoute of a whole multitude of people that should speake together.</p>
               <p>This was Christ by all interpretation, at whose terrible presence when Daniell fell downe deade, hee was erected againe by an Angell, and made strong to abide the vision, and so hauing heard &amp; seene the most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things that in his booke hee recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, he was bold to aske a question or two, for better vnderstanding therof, and his first question was,<note place="margin">Daniell. 12.</note>

               <p>Whereby, as by all the rest that hetherto hath beene alledged, is made apparent, that inconsideration, negligence, carelesse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,

and lacke of vnderstanding in our owne estates, and in Gods iudgments &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with iniquitie and sinne, hath been a bane, &amp; a common perdition of retchlesse men from time to time.</p>
               <p>And if we will turne our eyes to thys our age,<note place="margin">The cause of so much sinne at thys day.</note> much more shall we see the same to be true.

               <p>Truelie, nothing in reason can be lesse tollerable in the presence of Gods maiestie, then whereas he hath published a lawe vnto vs with so great charge to beare it in minde, to ponder in hart,<note place="margin">Deu. 6. et 11. Iosua. 1. Psalm. 118.</note> to studie &amp; meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it both day &amp; night, at home &amp; abroad, at our vprising &amp; our downe lying, to make it our cogitation, our discourse, our talk, our exercise, our rumination,<note place="margin">Eccle. 6. et 22.</note> and our delight; that wee should notwithstanding contemne the same, as to make it no part of our thought but rather to flee the knowledge thereof, as wee see most men of the world doe, for not troubling theyr consciences.</p>
               <p>But the holie Ghost hath layd down the reason hereof long agoe in these words:<note place="margin">Eccle. 17. The first cause why men flie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration.</note>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10709:22"/>
whensoeuer it thinketh of the Lawe of God, or of honestie. So Felix the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Iurie, when S. Paule began to talke of <hi>iustice, chastitie, and Gods iudgements</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him:<note place="margin">Acts. 24.</note> he was wonderfully afearde, and said to Paule, <hi>that hee shoulde depart for that time, and that he would call for him afterwarde, when occasion shold require.</hi> But he neuer did, and what was the cause? for that (as Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus testifieth) hee was a wicked man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioseph. li.</hi> 20. <hi>antiq. cap.</hi> 5.</note> and Drusilla his faire Ladie that was with him at Saint Paules speech, was not his true Wife, but taken by allurement and violence from another, and therefore it offended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both to heare preaching of chastitie.</p>
               <p>This then is one principall cause, why men of this world wil not enter into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their own estate, and of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, least they shoulde reade and see their owne faultes, and beare witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselues of theyr own condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>These are two of the cheefe causes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration, I meane wilfull mallice, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate corruption in the vanities of this life.

                  <note place="margin">Esay. 32.</note> the feare of God is the treasure of saluation; and the seconde, that by this feare hee was made sollicitous, watchfull, and dilligent in Gods seruice, of which the Prophet Micheas saith thus.<note place="margin">Miche. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I will tell thee (O man) what is good, &amp; what our Lord requireth at thy hands:</hi> to wit, <hi>to doe iudgment and loue mercie, and to walke sollicitous and watchfull with thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou ô holie and blessed man Iob, did this exercise of consideration,<note place="margin">A considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon the dooings of Iob.

<q>nowe I see wel the cause why thou writest of thy selfe: that thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest doubt and feare all thy workes and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were they neuer so circumspect.</q>
But what shall wee say nowe adayes (most happie Saint) who doe not doubt so much as our owne disolute, carelesse, and immoderate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who feele no terror of God at all, nor doe vse any one iote of watchfulnesse in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing his commaundements? truelie, thys proceedeth of nothing else but of inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10709:27"/>
it proceedeth of lacke of knowledge both of God and of our selues. For (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse) if we knowe either of these two things aright, (as indeede neither of them can bee well vnderstood without the other) it could not be, but that many of vs wold change our wrong courses.</p>
               <p>O mercifull Lord, what sinfull man in the world would liue as he doth, if he knew ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thee or himselfe as hee shoulde doe?

Whereby wee perceiue, that sensualitie or contentation of the sences,<note place="margin">The felicitie of beastes.</note> is the finall ende desired of beastes, and theyr very <hi>summum bonum,</hi> or supreame felicitie.</p>
                     <p>But in man, albeit for maintenaunce of the body, there be thys appetite also to satis-fie hys sences, according to the lower proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hys minde, that is called <hi>sensatiue:</hi> yet according to the hygher part of hys minde, whose name is Reason, or the reasonable part, (which is the onely part indeede, that is peculier to man, and distinguisheth hym from vnreasonable beastes,) hee hath an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of some more highe &amp; excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, then is the contentation of these sences:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10709:48"/>
for that by experience we see and feele, that oftentimes, when the sences be all satis-fyed, yet is the minde not quiet, which argueth, that sensualitie, or sensuall delectation, is not our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> wherin our mind must rest, and enioy her felicitie.</p>
                     <p>Heereupon haue Phylosophers and wise men fallen to dyspute in all ages, what shold be the finall felicitie and <hi>summum bonum</hi> of man-kind? And Cicero saith, that this point, is, <hi>cardo totius phylosophiae:</hi>

                        <p>For first, when it was spoken and vttered by Iacob, there was no probabilitie of anie Scepter at al, to be among the Iewes, for that the Israelites or sonnes of Iacob at that day, were poore and fewe in number, and neuer like to be a distinct Nation of themselues, or to depart foorth of Egypt againe. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if any such thing shoulde come to passe, as they might be a people, and haue a Scepter of gouernment of theyr owne.

And thirdly, when Moses recorded and put in writing thys prophecie, (which was diuers hundred yeeres after Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob had spoken it,) it was much lesse likelie, that euer it shoulde be true, for that Moses
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10709:66"/>
then present in gouernment,<note place="margin">Exodus, 2, Iosua, 19.</note> was of the tribe of Leui, and Iosua designed by God for hys successor, was of the Tribe of Ephraim, and not of Iuda: which maketh greatly for the certaintie of thys recorde. For that it is most apparent, that Moses would neuer haue put such a prophecie in writing, to the dysgrace of hys owne Tribe, and to the preiudice and offence of Ruben, Simeon, Ephraim, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tribes; neyther would they euer haue suffered such a derogation, but that it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by tradition, that theyr Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Iacob had spoken it, albeit then present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie there was no great likeli-hood, that euer after, it should come to be fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>And thys was for the time of Moses, but yet consider further, that from Moses to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell, (that was last of all the Iudges,) there passed foure hundred yeeres more,<note place="margin">1, Regum, 1, and 8.</note> and yet was there no appearaunce of fulfilling thys prophecie in Israell; for that the Trybe of Iuda was not established in that gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

For it is not probable, that his diuine Maiestie, which hath appointed euery other creature to some action for hys owne glorie, (as hath beene declared at large before) should leaue man-kind onely, which is the worthiest of all the rest, without obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to his seruice.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</note> that seeing our onely businesse and affayre in thys world, is to serue our Maker, and saue our owne soules: and that all other earthly creatures are put heere to serue our vses to that ende onely: we shoulde for our parts be indifferent to all these creatures, as to riches or pouertie: to health or sicknesse:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10709:83"/>
to honour or contempt: to little learning or much learning: and we should desire onely so much or little of eyther of them, as vvere best for vs, to the attainement of our sayde ende and Butte pretended; that is, to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of GOD, and the weale of our soules.

aside, &amp; leaue the marke. Most men do run awrie, and doe follow fethers vp and downe in the ayre; most men doe pursue vanities, and do wearie themselues out in the pursute thereof, vntill they can neither run nor goe, nor moue theyr lims any further: and then, for the most part it is too-late to amend their follie. Will you heare the lamentations of such vnfortunate men? these are theyr owne words recorded by scripture. <q>We are weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the way of iniquitie and perdition, and the way of God haue wee not knowne.<note place="margin">Wisdom, 5.

               <p>Thys is the lamentable complaint of such men, as ranne awrie, and followed a wrong course in theyr actions of thys life. These are they, who pursued riches, honour, pompe, and such like vanities, and forgate the great and weightie businesse for which they vvere sent. These are they, who were esteemed happy men in this world, and thought to run a most fortunate course, in that they heaped much riches together; aduaunced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues and theyr families to great dignities: becam gorgious, glorious, and dreadfull to others:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10709:86"/>
and finallie, obtayned what soeuer their lust and concupiscence desired. This made them seeme blessed to worldly cogitations,<note place="margin">The fonde iudgment of the world.</note> &amp; the way wherein they ranne, to be most prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and happie.

                  <hi>The expectation of Nations:</hi> and we call him nowe, <hi>The saluation of Nations.</hi> And finally, there was no other difference between the old fayth of good men from the beginning, &amp; ours: but onely in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces of tyme, cleerenes, perticularitie, and of the maner of protesting the same, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes and ceremonies. For that in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce they beleeued the same Redeemer that we doe, and were saued by the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in his merits as we are. For which cause Eusebius <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>By thys then it is most manifest, that not onely now to vs that be Christians, but at all other tymes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world, and to all other persons and people what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, that desired to haue theyr soules saued, it was necessary to beleeue and loue Christ, and to professe in hart his Religion. For
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10709:98"/>
which consideration, I thought it not amisse in thys place, after the former grounds laid, that there is a God; and that man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and placed heere for his seruice:<note place="margin">The causes of thys Chapter.</note> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate and prooue also thys other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that the onely seruice of thys God, is by Christian Religion. Wherein, albeit I doe not doubt, but that I shall seeme to many, to take vpon me a superfluous labour, in proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a veritie, which all men in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doe confesse: yet, for the causes before alleaged in the second Chapter, which moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me in that place to prooue, that there is a God: that is to say, first, for the comfort, strength, and confirmation of such, as eyther from the enemie may receiue temptations, or of themselues may desire to see a reason of theyr beleefe; and secondly, for awaking, stirring, or stinging of others, who eyther of malice, carelesnes, or sensualitie, are fallen a sleepe, and haue lost the feeling and sence of theyr beleefe, (for many such want not in these our myserable daies,) it shall not bee (perhaps) but to verie good purpose, to laie together in thys place, with the greatest bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie that possibly may be, the most sure grounds and inuincible euidences, which we haue for declaration and confirmation of this matter.</p>
               <p>For albeit the Apostle S. Paul declareth,<note place="margin">Hebru. 11.</note>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:10709:99"/>
the things which we beleeue, be not such in themselues, as may be made apparent by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of humaine arguments: yet such is the goodnes and most sweete proceeding of our mercifull God toward vs, as he wil not leaue himselfe without sufficient testimonie, both inward and outward,<note place="margin">Acts, 14.</note> as the same Apostle in another place doth testifie. For that inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, hee testifieth the trueth of such things as we beleeue,<note place="margin">The dyuers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. of the things that we beleeue.</note> by giuing vs light &amp; vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with internall ioy and consolation in beleeuing them. And outwardly, hee giueth testimonie to the same, with so many conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, probabilities, and <hi>arguments of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilitie,</hi> (as Diuines doe call them,) that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the very poynt of that which is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, remaine styll with some obscuritie: yet are there so many circumstaunces of likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, to induce a man to the beleefe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as in all reason it may seeme against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to denie or mistrust them.</p>
               <p>Thys shall easily appeare by the treatise following of Christ and Christianitie, and of the foundations of our Religion, which shall be confirmed by so many pregnant reasons, and most manifest circumstaunces of eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent probabilitie: as I doubt not, but the zealous Christian shal take exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort therein, and esteeme himselfe happie, to haue a lotte in that faith and Religion, where
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10709:99"/>
he shall see and feele so much reason, proofe, and conueniencie to concurre and shewe it selfe, for hys satis-faction.</p>
               <p>And to thys effect, it shall be of no mean moment, that I haue prooued before, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, diuinitie, and infallible trueth of the Iewes Scriptures, or olde Testament; which writings we haue receiued from that Nation that doth (as it were) professe enmity against vs, and the same beeing written so many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before the name of Christianitie vvas knowne in the worlde: it cannot be but of singuler authoritie, what soeuer shall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged out of those records for our purpose. And therefore as before, in proouing our first principle, <hi>That there is a God,</hi> wee vsed onely the testimonie of such witnesses,<note place="margin">The vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted witnesses to be alleaged in thys Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> as coulde not be partiall: so much more in this confirmation of Christian Religion, shall we stand onely, eyther vppon the confessions of such as are our enemies, or vpon the records of others, who must needes be indifferent in the cause, for that they liued before eyther cause or controuersie in Christianitie, vvas knowne or called in question.</p>
               <p>My whole purpose shall be then, to make manifest in thys Chapter,<note place="margin">The dryft of thys Chapter.</note> that Iesus Christ was the Sauiour &amp; Redeemer of man-kind, fore-promised and expected from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the worlde; that he was the only
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10709:100"/>
sonne of God, and God himselfe, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that what soeuer he hath left vs in hys doctrine and Religion, is true &amp; sincere, and the onely way of saluation vppon earth. For cleerer proofe and declaration whereof, I will reduce what soeuer I haue to say here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, vnto three principall heads or braunches,<note place="margin">The principall heades.</note> according to the order of three distinct times wherein they fell out; That is to say, in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first place shall be considered, the things that passed before the Natiuitie or incarnation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Christ.

               <p>In declaration of which three generall points, I hope by the assistance of him whose cause we handle, that so many cleere demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations shall be dyscouered: as shall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie confirme thy fayth (gentle Reader) and remooue all occasions of temptation to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie.</p>

Secondly, if the temporall kingdome of the house of Iuda, (wherof Christ must come) shal cease and be destroyed at the comming of Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, (as thys Scripture auoucheth:) how then can the Iewes expect yet a temporall King for theyr Messias, as most fondly they doe?</p>

                     <p>NOwe in the thyrd place commeth to be considered,<note place="margin">Whether Christ should change the Law of Moses.</note> what authoritie and power the Messias should haue at his appearaunce vpon earth, and whether he should chaunge and abrogate the Law of Moses, or no? wher in there is no lesse controuersie betweene vs and the later Iewes, then in the former point of his diuinitie. For we holde with S. Paule,<note place="margin">Gala, 3, &amp; 4. Hebru. 7.</note> that the Lawe of Moses was giuen vnto the Iewes but for a time, to entertaine that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple withall,<note place="margin">1.

                     <p>This we prooue first, for that the Lawe of Moses was an imperfect Lawe,<note place="margin">The Lawe of Moses imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> bringing nothing to perfection, as S. Paule well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth;<note place="margin">Hebrues, 7. Acts, 15.</note> It was (as S.

It was a carnall and seruile Lawe, consisting most in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. It was a Law of terror and feare,<note place="margin">Gala. 3.</note> more
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10709:114"/>
then of loue and libertie of the spirit. It was a Lawe (as I said before) of signes and figures for things to come, &amp; consequently to cease, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those things which it prefigured shold come to be present.<note place="margin">Deut, 15.</note> It was a Lawe peculiar and proper for the Iewes alone, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of all the rest of the world:<note place="margin">Deut, 13, &amp; 14 Leuit. 5, &amp; 23, Exodus, 23. Deut, 27.</note> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise therof, was allowed onely in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Iurie; and that which is more, it was not permitted but in one place only of that Countrey, that is, in Ierusalem, whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man was bound to repaire three tymes a yeere, to wit, at the Pasqua, at the Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coste, and at the feast of Tabernacles: and in that place alone to make theyr sacrifices, and in no other Countrey or place besides.</p>
                     <p>Nowe then reasoneth the learned Diuine,<note place="margin">Good reasons.</note> if thys Lawe of Moses were for the Iewes and Iurie onely: howe could it serue for the time of the Messias, who was to be King, as well of the Gentiles as of the Iewes: and to rule all people in the worlde,<note place="margin">Psal, 2,21,26. Esay, 2,11, 19.</note> that should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him vnder one Lawe. If the exercise of this Lawe were allowable onely, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Ierusalem: how coulde it possiblie be fulfilled by Christians, that are dispersed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the world? As for example, hovve coulde they repayre to Ierusalem thrise eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie yeere? howe shoulde euery woman that should dwell in England or India, repaire to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10709:114"/>
Ierusalem for her purification after euerie child-birth,<note place="margin">Leuit. 12. Exod, 13. Numb. 8.</note> as by the Law of Moses she was commanded? Most euident is it then, which we said before, that thys Law was giuen but to endure for a time. And to vse S. Pauls owne wordes,<note place="margin">Hebrues, 7.</note> it was but <hi>introductio melioris spei,</hi> an introduction to a better hope. It was but an entertainment to that people, (which by theyr beeing among the Egiptians, were prone to idolatrie,) vntill Christ shold come and ordaine a perfect Law.<note place="margin">The new law of Christ, and the perfections thereof.</note> That is, a Lawe of spirit and internall affection: a Lawe of loue and libertie: a Lawe that shoulde be common to all men: serue for al Countries, tymes, places and persons: a Law that shold be written in the bowels of our harts, a Law that should be tollerable, easie, sweet, plaine, light, breefe, &amp; flexible as well to the poore as to the rich: a Lawe (to conclude) that should consist in charitie.</p>
                     <p>This signified Moses, when he said to his people, after hee had deliuered the former Lawe vnto them:<note place="margin">Deut. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lorde shall rayse vnto you a Prophet of your owne Nation, and from among your owne bretheren, as my selfe: hym shall you heare.</hi> As though he had saide: you shall heare me vntill he come, that must be a Law-giuer as my self: but yet of a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Lawe: and therefore more to be hearde and obeyed. And then he addeth, <hi>who soeuer
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:10709:115"/>
shall refuse to heare the words of this Prophet, I my selfe will reuenge it saith the Lorde GOD.</hi> Which wordes can not be verified in anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet after Moses vntill Christ: for that of those Prophets, the Scripture sayth,<note place="margin">Deuter, 34.</note> 
                        <hi>There arose no Prophet like vnto Moses in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell.</hi> Which is to be vnderstood, that they had no authoritie to be Law-makers, as Moses had, but were all bounde to the obseruation of that Lawe onely which Moses left, vntyll Christ came, whom Moses heere calleth <hi>a Prophet as himselfe:</hi> that is, a Law-maker, &amp; exhorteth all men to heare and obey him.</p>
                     <p>Thys yet is made more playne by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of Esay, who sayth:<note place="margin">Esay, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Out of Sion shall come a Lawe, and the word of God out of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi> which cannot be vnderstoode of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Law that had been published eyght hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres before thys was spoken,<note place="margin">A newe Lawe prophecied.</note> &amp; that from the Mount Sinai, and not from Sion; But Christes Lawe began from Sion and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and from thence was spred into all the worlde. Which the same Esay fore-sawe when talking of the comming of the Messias he sayth:
<q>In that day there shall be an Altar to God, in the midst of the Land of Egipt. And the tytle of the Lorde at the ende thereof, &amp;c. And God shall be knowne to the Egiptians at that daie, and they shall honour him with sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and oblations.<note place="margin">Esay, 19.</note>
                        </q>
Which words coulde not

be verified in the olde Lawe of Moses, for that by that Lawe the Egiptians coulde haue neither Aultar nor Sacrifice: but at Christes comming it was fulfilled, when the Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were made Christians, and enioyed both the Aultars and sacrifices that Christians do vse.</p>

                     <p>For better vnderstanding whereof, it is to be noted, that besides al knowledge of the Messias, that diuers Gentiles might haue by the Hebrue Scriptures, which (<note n="*" place="margin">Chap, 2.</note> as I haue shewed before,) were in the Greek language diuers ages before Christ was borne, or by the instruction or conuersation of the Iewes, with whom many Pagans did liue familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: there remained three waies peculier to the Gentiles, whereby they receiued some

                     <p>And for the first way,<note place="margin">The first way.</note> it is euident, that as the Iewes receiued diuers things by successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from theyr fore-fathers, and they againe from Moses; and Moses fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Patriarches, Iacob, Isaac, and Abraham, (who was the first man from whô that whole Nation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and in whom they were distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from all other people in the world:) so had the Gentiles and other Nations theyr succession also of doctrine and monuments,<note place="margin">Tradition of learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Iewes and Gentiles.</note> euen from the beginning; albeit the lower they went, the more corrupt they were, and more obscured in diuine knowledge, by their exercise in Idolatrie. So we knowe that the Romans had theyr learning from the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: the Graecians from the Egyptians: and the Egiptians from the Chaldeans, who were the first people that receiued instruction in diuine matters from Adam, Methusalem, Noe, and others of those first and auncient Fathers.</p>

And thereby (no doubt) could tell many high and secret misteries, especially touching Christ, in whom all his hope for redemption of hys posteritie did consist.

hys Apostles and other followers,<note place="margin">The calling of the Apostles.</note> (whereof Iosephus also in the place before alleaged, maketh mention,<note place="margin">

And yet all, vppon the suddaine, left both father, mother, wyfe, children, and other temporall respects, and followed him, who had nothing to giue or promise them in thys worlde. A man, that neuer spake them fayre, or vttered doctrine that was not repugnant to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualitie of thys life, as may appeare by theyr owne wrytings and testimonies of him. A man, that was contemned by the better sort, as then it might seeme: that is, by the wyse and learned of that Countrie, and especially disliked by them that were in gouernment, as a dangerous and troublesome man to the state. One, that had neyther freendes in the worlde to beare him out, nor a house to put his heade in.

this (I say) is such a miracle, as neuer in the worlde fell out the like, and must needes be graunted by the enemie, to be supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                     <p>The second poynt is,<note place="margin">The miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous facts of Iesus.</note> of externall things and facts doone by Iesus, aboue all power of humaine abilitie, in the sight and knowledge of all the Iewes; which facts were published by our Euangelists, and especially by Saint Matthew, in the Hebrue tongue, while yet the persons were aliue vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were wrought, or infinite other that might be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses thereof. As for example, the raysing of Lazarus in Bethania, that was a Vyllage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but a mile or two distant from Ierusalem:<note place="margin">Iohn. 11.</note> at whose death and buriall, (beeing a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) many Scribes &amp; Pharisies must needes be present, (according to the Iewish custom at that time, as is reported by Iosephus,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioseph. lib.</hi> 17. <hi>antiq. cap.</hi> 11.</note>) and they sawe him both deceassed, interred, and the funerall feast obserued for him, as also raised againe from death by Iesus, after foure dayes of hys buriall.

Neyther onely had they to contende &amp; fight against theyr enemies, but also to direct, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and menage all those, who should be adioyned to theyr Maisters kingdome. To which charge they seemed so vntoward and insufficient, in all that time wherein they ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with him heere vpon earth: as by they questions and demaundes made vnto hym a little before his passion, they might appeare to haue learned very little, in three whole yeeres conuersation and instruction: and in very deede, to be incapable of so hygh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries and functions.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithstanding, these men, who of themselues were weake and impotent, after strength and confirmation receiued by the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:10709:168"/>
descending of Gods holy Spirite into them: became so perfect, able, and most excellent men, as they brought the whole worlde in admiration of them.

                     <p>These myracles and many moe are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Saint Luke: whereof some part were seene by himselfe, and the rest most euident to all the world, as doone in publique before infinite witnesses. Neyther is it possible they coulde be faigned, for that (as in the like I haue before noted,) it had beene most easie to haue refelled them, and thereby to haue discredited the whole proceedings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion in those first beginnings.<note place="margin">The myracles reported of the Apostles, could not be feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> As for example; if the myracle of Saint Peter, beeing deliuered forth of the hands and pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Herode Agrippa, had any way beene to be touched with falsehood: howe manie would there haue beene of Herods Officers Courtiers, seruaunts and freendes, that for defence of their Princes honour, (so deeplie tainted by this narration of S.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:10709:169"/>
hauing so pregnant meanes by publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to doe the same; So againe, whereas the same S.

Paule, but the Magistrates also, (who the day before had caused them to be whypt,) came and asked them pardon, and humblie intreated them to depart out of theyr Citty. Thys storie (I say) if it had been false, there needed no more for confutation thereof, but onely to haue examined the whole Cittie of Philippi, which coulde haue testified the contrarie.</p>

And the same verie text, words, and sentences, which from age to age the learned Fathers doe alleage out of these Scriptures, we finde them now, as they had them at that time. As for example, S.

the spirits which were accustomed to yeelde Oracles, were by length of tyme growne olde and dead.

Secondly, in his Treatises of Phylosophy, he passeth it for a ground, that spyrits, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of materiall bodies, cannot dye, or wexe olde; and therefore of necessitie hee must conclude, that some other cause is to be yeelded of the ceassing of these Oracles, which cannot be but the presence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of some higher power, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the saying of S.

by the Prophets of God, most euidently fore-shewed.

                  <p>By all which waies, meanes, arguments and proofes: and by tenne thousande more, which to the tongue or pen of man are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable, the christian minde remaineth setled, and most firmely grounded in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted beleefe of his Religion: hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all other things, euidences, certainties, and internall comforts and assurances which are infinite: these eyght demonstratiue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and perswasions which insue,<note place="margin">Eyght rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> for hys more ample and aboundant satis-faction therein.</p>

as the most simple and vnlearned man in the world, should not be able (but of wylfulnes) to goe astray therein. His wordes are these, directed to the Gentiles.<note place="margin">Esay, 35.</note>

                  <p>Thus then it appeareth, that the plaine and direct way mentioned by Esay, wherein no simple or ignoraunt man can erre, is the doctrine taught by the mouth of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ and hys Apostles, which howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it seeme to be obscure and darksome to men of peruerse mindes, that are not exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in it: yet to the godlie and studious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and hearers, that haue theyr eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,

And heereof it is that the word of God is called the sworde of the spirit:<note place="margin">Ephe, 6, 17.</note> because, as it was giuen by inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the first, so being expounded by the direction of the same spirit, it is most liuely and mightie in operation:<note place="margin">2, Tim. 3,16. Heb, 4, 12.</note> sharper the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any two edged sword, and entering through, euen to the deuiding a sunder of the soule and the spirit, of the ioynts and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the hart.</p>
                  <p>Thys is that spirituall sworde wherwith our Sauiour Christ preuailed against sathan the head Lord &amp; maister of all Heretiques,<note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> who notwithstanding pretended scriptures for his deuillish purposes. And the Apostle Paule,<note place="margin">Acts, 9.</note> being furnished wyth thys only wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, disputed against the peruerse &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:10709:200"/>
Iewes, which dwelt at Damascus, and confounded them, proouing by conference of Scriptures, that thys was very Christ.</p>
                  <p>Nowe as it was expedient that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels should be written, that we learning the trueth foorth of them,<note place="margin">Theophilactꝰ.</note> should not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the lyes of heresies; so was it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the same Gospels shoulde be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for the confirmation of fayth.<note place="margin">Hieronimus.</note> And heereof it is, that the Apostle S. Paule, Rom. 10. sayth,<note place="margin">Rom, 10, 17,</note> that fayth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by hearing the word of God,<note place="margin">1. Peter, 1, 23 Ephe, 5, 26.</note> because the word preached, is the ordinary meanes to beget and increase faith in vs, for the which cause also, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the incorruptible seede whereby we are borne a newe, and whereby the Church is sanctified vnto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to conclude thys poynt, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the holy scriptures are that most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and secure way mentioned by Esay, seeing they are the rule &amp; leuell both of our fayth and life, contayning in them sufficient matter to confute errour and confirme the trueth, able to make a man wise vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">2, Tim, 3, 15. 16, 17.</note> &amp; perfectly instructed vnto euery good worke:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Basil. moralium, Regula.</hi> 80. <hi>ca.</hi> 21.</note> this ought to be the duetie of the faithfull, (that I may vse the words of Basil,) to be thorowly perswaded in his minde, that those thinges are true and effectuall, which are vttered in the Scripture, and to reiect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:10709:200"/>
thereof. For if whatsoeuer is not of fayth be sinne, (as saith the Apostle) and if fayth commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, without doubt when anie thing is without the holy scripture, (which cannot be of faith,) it must needes be sinne. And therefore (to speake as S. Augustine speaketh,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>August. cont li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teras. petil, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note>) if any, I will not say if wee, but (which S. Paule addeth) if an Angell from heauen,<note place="margin">Gala, 1, 8.</note> shall preach eyther of Christ or of his Church, or of any other thing which pertaineth to faith, or to the leading of our life otherwise, then we haue receiued in the holy scriptures of the Law and the Gospel, let him be accursed.</p>
                  <p>Now if forsaking all bie-pathes of mens inuentions and traditions, we wyll search di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently in the scriptures wherein we thinke to haue eternall life,<note place="margin">Iohn, 5. 39.</note> wee shall see that they testifie of nothing so much, as of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God in Christ Iesus; who as he is the ende of the Lawe for righteousnes to euery one that beleeueth,<note place="margin">Rom, 10, 4, Gala, 3, 24.</note> so doe they sende vs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and as it were leade vs by the hande like a careful Schoole-maister vnto him, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs to apprehend and lay holde on him with the hand of fayth, and to apply hym wyth his gifts and graces vnto our selues, and our owne saluation. So that faith is made the meanes, and as it were the Conduit to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:10709:201"/>
conuey Christ himselfe, hys death, burial, and resurrection, and all the rest of hys benefits vnto vs, which the Apostle witnesseth. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los. 2. 12. Yee are buried (saith he) with him through Baptisme, in whom ye are also rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp together,<note place="margin">Coloss. 2,12.</note> through <hi>the fayth</hi> of God effectually working, who raysed him from the deade. Whereof it ensueth, that all the faithfull, doe not onely obtaine the benefite of Christes death &amp; buriall by their Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, wherby they die vnto sinne: but also do receiue and enioy, the fruite and effect of his resurrection by a liuely fayth, whereby they are quickned and raysed vp vnto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in thys life, and are assertained of resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to glorie in the life to come,<note place="margin">Phillip, 3,21.</note> by hys mightie working that is able to subdue all things vnto himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that the summe &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of our whole Religion, and of our eternal saluation or damnation, consisteth in the knowledge of this one vertue, it shalbe worth the labour, breefely (but yet plainly) to describe the forme, force, &amp; nature of this faith whereof we speake. Wherein you shall not looke for the diuers significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which that word receiueth in the Scripture, nor for any declaration of those vnprofitable faythes whereof S. Iames speaketh,<note place="margin">Iames, 2, 19.</note> which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the wicked, and to the deuils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:10709:201"/>
wherby they beleeue that Iesus is that Christ;<note place="margin">Marke, 1, 24.</note> but heere my purpose is to entreate, of that liuely and sauing fayth, which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier and propper to the elect and chosen children of God, whereby they beleeue, that Christ is theyr Iesus,<note place="margin">Math. 1, 21.</note> by whom they are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from theyr sinnes, and from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due vnto them for the same, and by whom onely they are restored vnto the fauor of God,<note place="margin">Rom, 8, 17.</note> and made heyres with Christ of hys heauenlie kingdome.</p>
                  <p>In the Epistle to the Hebrues,<note place="margin">Hebru, 11, 1.</note> there is a notable description of that liuely fayth, wher it is said, to be the ground of things that are hoped for, &amp; the euidence of things that are not seene. Of which description of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, we may make a plain definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after thys sort. Faith is an assured perswasion of our saluation by the meanes of Christ, which is grounded on the promises of God, &amp; sealed in our harts by the holie Ghost. This defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forme &amp; proprietie of true faith, but the other, in the Epistle to the Hebrues, seemeth rather to be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the substance of fayth, &amp; speaketh of the obiect matter thereof. But both of them tend to one and the same thing, namely, to expresse the nature of true faith, to consist in the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that eternall life, which is purchased vnto vs by Christ Iesus, which although we
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:10709:202"/>

This fulnes of fayth, containeth in it these three thinges.</p>
                  <p>First, a notice or knowledge of the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promises of God in Christ Iesus. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, an vndoubted perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the truth of those promises. And thirdly, the applying of the same to the comfort of our soules and consciences, for our saluation. For as it is not enough for a man to haue meate, vnlesse he also eate it and digest it, so it is not enough for vs to know the promises of God, vnlesse we beleeue the same to be true,<note place="margin">Hebru, 4,2.</note> and applie them to our owne selues. And as it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a wounded man, to haue a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne salue or Medicine in his window, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee apply it to his wounde, so is it not sufficient for vs, to knowe that Christ is the Sauiour of the worlde, vnlesse also wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be a Sauiour vnto vs, and lay holde on him by the hand of fayth.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, this is the propertie &amp; effect of a sauing fayth, euen to apply Christ wyth
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:10709:202"/>
his gifts vnto euery one of the faithfull, and to make all conclusions of Gods promises perticuler, that is, peculier to themselues &amp; theyr owne saluation. And therfore it is that fayth is called the life of the soule,<note place="margin">Habac, 2, Rom, 1, 17. Hebru, 10. 37.</note> because it is the instrument, wherewith Christ the true life and foode of our soule is to be eaten. Yea it is the mouth, the tongue, the teeth, the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and that heate of our harts &amp; soules, whereby Christ the worde of God, is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually taken, eaten, and digested of vs; wyth which worde, or rather with which Christ, our soules doe liue:<note place="margin">Iohn, 6, 51.</note> namely, with the fleshe and blood of Christ which we eate &amp; drink, whilst we embrace and receiue Christ by a liuelie fayth. Whereupon S. Cyprian hath this sweete saying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyprian. lib, de caena. domini.</hi>

That which foode is to the bodie, that is the word to the spirit. So that faith is that bond, which dooth so straightly vnite and knitte vs vnto Christ, no otherwise then the members are vnited to the head, wherby wee pertake hys spiritual graces, as the members of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die receiue nutriment from the head; and in a worde, what good things soeuer are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for vs to eternall life, doe flowe and are deriued vnto vs from Christ, as from a most plentifull and wholesome fountaine, and are
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:10709:203"/>
conueied vnto vs by the instrument of faith, as by a strong and substantial Conduit pype.</p>
                  <p>It were too long, and not so pertinent to the purpose, to recite all the properties of this sauing fayth whereof we speake: it may suffise therefore to haue shewed you these fewe notes, and effects thereof, by the due consideration whereof, it shall be easie for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to examine and try themselues,<note place="margin">2, Cor, 13, 5.</note> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh, whether they be in the faith or no, and consequently, whether they be true Christians for the first part of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: namely, for matters of beleefe, which consisteth (as hath beene shewed) not onelie in beleeuing whatsoeuer is propounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the holy Scripture, (although that also be a true faith,) but also in the assurance of Gods loue &amp; fauour towards vs, wrought in our harts by the preaching of the Gospel, and sealed by the holy Ghost; whereby wee doe firmely perswade our selues, that our sinnes are as vtterly forgiuen vs for Christes sake, as if we neuer had committed any, and his righteousnes as perfectly imputed vnto vs, as if wee had performed the same in our owne persons.</p>

                  <p>Of the second fountaine are deriued other qualities conformable to that humor, as are the denying of iurisdiction and authoritie in our Superiours, the contempt of Prelates, the exaggeration of the faultes and defects of our Gouernours, the impugnation of all Bishoplike dignities or Ecclesiasticall emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, and especially of that rule whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to appertaineth the correction of such lyke offenders: and finally, for satis-fying thys deuillish and pernicious venime of malice, those wicked reprobates doe incite and arme the people against theyr spirituall Pastors, they kindle factions against Gods faithfull Ministers, they deuise a new Church, a new forme of Gouernment, a new kingdom and Ecclesiasticall Hierarchie vpon earth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Many causes of euill lyfe.</note>Nowe then, as these are the causes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely or principally of erring in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, most facile and easie (as wee see) to be discerned, so of errour in lyfe and manners, there are many more occasions, causes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>springs, and fountaines to be found.

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:10709:207"/>
be to purpose to haue a foundation without a building vppon it, or a stocke or tree that beareth no fruite. Which thing S. Iames (speaking of that historicall and dead fayth, whereby the wicked &amp; the very deuils the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Thys poynt of doctrine of vertuous life and obseruing of Gods commaundements, not our Sauiour Christ alone in his Sermon, most earnestly vrged, (as hath beene sayde) but his fore-runner also Saint Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, and hys followers the holie Apostles, whereof the one continually called vpon the people to bring foorth fruites meete for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;<note place="margin">Math, 3, 8.</note> the other in all theyr writings, &amp; no doubt in all their Sermons after matter of doctrine and faith propounded,<note place="margin">Roma. 12. 1. Ephe, 4, 1.</note> do proceede to exhortation, and precepts of Christian life. In so much as Saint Augustine &amp; other auncient Fathers, are of opinion, that the rest of the Apostles, S. Peter, S. Iames, S. Iohn, and S. Iude, perceiuing the loosenesse and securitie of the people in theyr tymes, direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theyr writinges, eyther onely or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to this ende, euen to perswade and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the necessitie of good life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation among Christians. Yea and that Saint
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:10709:207"/>
Paule himselfe, when hee concludeth that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the Lawe,<note place="margin">Rom,3,28,</note> doth not exclude the works of charitie, as effects and fruites of fayth, which followe him that is alreadie iustified in the sight of God: but hee excludeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of saluation, which goe before him that is to be iustified. Wherby it appeareth, that S. Paule handling the causes of our iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the sight of God, is not repugnant or contrary to S. Iames, speaking of the notes and signes whereby we are iustified: that is, (as the word is taken <note place="margin">Math,12,37.</note> els where,) declared or known to be iust or righteous before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>The sum is, that although good workes are not the causes of our saluation,<note place="margin">Colos.1,10.</note> yet they are the way as it were, and the path that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereunto: because by them, as by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine markes, we perceiue our selues to haue entered, and to haue proceeded in the waie of eternall life. Yea, they are the fruites and effects,<note place="margin">Iames,2,18.</note> whereby we testifie and declare both vnto our selues and to others, the trueth of that faith which we professe. And therefore our Sauiour Christ willeth vs in the Gospel,<note place="margin">Math,5,16,</note> to let our light shine <hi>before men,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our good works, may take occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to glorifie our heauenly father.</p>
                  <p>And his holy Apostle Saint Iames,<note place="margin">Iames,2,18.</note> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth those carnall &amp; sensuall Christians, that

But as for God, that searcheth the secrets of the harts and reynes, it needeth not that wee shoulde shewe him our faith by our workes, nor may wee looke for iustification at his handes by the best of them:<note place="margin">Rom, 4, 2.</note> for then might wee haue whereof to boast, but there is no boasting with God, and therefore no iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying by workes in his sight. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the Lorde requireth good workes at our hands, to the end that himselfe might be <note n="*" place="margin">1, Pet, 2. 12.</note> glorified, our needie bretheren releeued and <note n="*" place="margin">1, Cor,9.2,13</note> comforted, others gained &amp; wonne by our example, to the embracing of the same faith and Religion which we professe: our owne faith exercised and strengthened, and our calling and election made sure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.<note place="margin">2, Peter,1,10</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is very requisite that the children of GOD,<note place="margin">1, Pet,1,18,19.</note> which are bought with so high a

price, as with the blood of Iesus, should glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God both in soule &amp; body, because they are redeemed both in soule and body, and not liue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,<note place="margin">1, Cor, 6,20, 2, Cor,5,15,</note> but vnto him which died and rose againe for them.</p>
                  <p>Thys is the ende of our election before the foundations of the world were layde, as the Apostle testifieth, Ephes. 1.4.<note place="margin">Ephe, 1,4,</note> euen that we should be holy and blameles before him in loue. Thys is the ende of our creation, as the same Apostle witnesseth, Ephesians, 2. 10.<note place="margin">Ephe, 2,10.</note> Where he saith that we are Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshyp created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, wherein he hath ordained that wee shold walke. This is the end of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as olde Zacharie prophecied, Luke, 1. 74, 75.<note place="margin">Luke. 1,74,75</note> that beeing redeemed and deliuered from all our spirituall enemies, and from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall destruction whereunto we were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, we should serue God without feare, in holines and righteousnes before him all the daies of our life. Finally, this is the ende of our vocation. For God hath not called vs to vncleannesse, but vnto holinesse:<note place="margin">1, Thes, 4,7. 1, Pet, 1,15.</note> and as hee that hath called vs is holy, so must we be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in all manner of conuersation. And it can not be that they which are truely iustified, that is to say, made righteous by a liuely fayth in Christ, should not also in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure be sanctified, that is, made holie by a

                  <p>Let not men therefore deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the onely name and shadowe of faith, without the nature &amp; substance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

And Saint Iohn auoucheth, that whosoeuer saith, hee knoweth GOD,<note place="margin">1, Iohn, 2,4.</note> and keepeth not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, is a lyer. Which beeing so, we must examine the trueth of our fayth by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our life: for then &amp; not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise are we true Christians, if wee fulfill in works, that whereof we haue made promise in words. That is, in the day of our Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, we promised to renounce the pompe of this world,<note place="margin">What we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in our Baptisme.</note> together with all the workes of iniquitie; which promise, if wee performe nowe after Baptisme, then are we true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and may be ioyfull. But contrariwise, if our life be wicked, &amp; contrary to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, it is saide by the voyce of trueth it selfe. Not euery one that shall say to mee Lord, Lord,<note place="margin">Math, 7.</note> shall enter into the kingdom of heauen. And againe, why doe yee call mee Lord, Lord, &amp; doe not performe the things that I tell you.</p>
                  <p>Heer-hence is it, that God complained of his old people the Iewes, saying:<note place="margin">Esay, 29,17.</note> 
                     <hi>this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple honoureth me with their lips, but their harts are farre off from me.</hi>

with their mouth, and wyth their tongues they lyed vnto him. Wherefore let no man presume to say he shall be saued, if faith and good life be diuorced &amp; put a sunder, which S. Chrisostome noteth, by the wofull and heauie chaunce &amp; iudgment that happened vnto him, who in the Gospell was admitted to the feast of Christian faith &amp; knowledge, but for lacke of the ornament or garment of good life, was most contumeliouslie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of his expectation.

That is, what profite or damage hee may expect by hys knowledge and profession of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

there are no lesse paines and punishments reserued.

Thys might be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by diuers and sundry examples of holie writ, howe be it two onely shall suffise for thys present.</p>
               <p>The first is of the people of Israell, not long before theyr banishment into Babilon, who being threatned from God by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ieremie, that manifolde punishments were imminent ouer their heads, for theyr greeuous sinnes committed against his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie: began (in stedde of repentaunce) to fall to desperation: and consequentlie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:10709:213"/>
to take that impious course of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute life, alleaged before out of Saint Paul; for thus they aunswered God exhorting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by hys threates to reforme theyr wicked liues.<note place="margin">A desperate resolution.</note>

                  <q>

Aske and enquire of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Gentiles, whether euer among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were heard any such horrible blasphemies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And after this, for the more declaration of this intollerable iniurie heerein offered to hys Maiestie: he commanded the Prophet Ieremie to goe forth out of his owne house, and to gette him to a potters shoppe, which in the Village was framing his vessels vpon the wheele. Which Ieremie hauing doone, he sawe before his face a pot crushed &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Potter all in peeces vppon the wheele, and thinking thereby that the vessell had been vtterly vnprofitable and to be cast away, hee sawe the same clay presently fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againe by the Potter, into a new vessell, more excellent then before.<note place="margin">A meruailous example of Gods clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> Wherat he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing, God said vnto him;

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:10709:214"/>
wyth hys vessell? or is not the house of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell in my hands, as the clay in the handes of thys craftes-man? I will denounce vppon a suddaine against a Nation and Kingdome, that I wyll roote it vppe and destroy it, and if that Nation or Kingdom doe repent from their wickednes, I also will repent me of the punishment which I intended to lay vppon them.</q>
And then he proceedeth forward, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring vnto Ieremie the exceeding greefe and indignation which he conceiueth, that any sinner whatsoeuer, shoulde despayre of mercie and pardon at hys hands.</p>
               <p>The seconde example is, of the same people of Israell, during the tyme of theyr banishment in Babilon; at what tyme being afflicted wyth many myseries for their sins,<note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Gods wonderfull mercy.</note> and threatned wyth many more to come, for that they chaunged not the course of theyr former wicked conuersation: they began to despayre of Gods mercie, and to say to the Prophet Ezechiell that liued banished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and exhorted them to amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vppon assured hope of Gods fauoure towards them;<note place="margin">Ezech. 33.</note>

of this most feruent loue; and thereby as it were, by one fire to enkindle another wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our harts: did vse oftentimes and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie, to repeate thys sweete name of Father in hys speeches to his followers,<note place="margin">Math, 5,6,8. &amp;c.</note> and therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon founded diuers most excellent &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable discourses; as at one time when hee exhorted them from ouer-much care and worldly solicitude: hee addeth thys reason: <hi>Your father in heauen knoweth, that you haue neede of these thinges.</hi>

we shoulde not by thys confidence become more negligent in reforming our liues, but rather doe it out of hande, without all delay or procrastination.

<q>Let no man after a hundred sins, nor after a thousande, despaire of Gods mercie, but yet so let him not despaire, as hee seeke presently without all stay, to reconcile hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God by amendment of life: least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps after that by custome he hath gotten a habite of sinne, he be not able to deliuer him selfe from the snares of the deuill, albeit hee woulde.</q>

<q>Not euery man that hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but he that perseuereth in sinne, is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and abhominable in the sight of GOD.

                  <p>
                     <q>Thus then we see, if a mans foote, leg, or arme be broken,<note place="margin">A similitude of the body, to expresse the misery of the soule, by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying sinne.</note> with howe great paine the fame is restored to his accustomed strength.

So fareth it (deere brethren) in the woundes and ruptures of our soul.
