            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
ACCOUNT
OF
TYTHES
In GENERAL.</head>
            <p>THE only Command from God, that we read
of in Holy Scripture, for the Payment of
Tythes, was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> to the People
of <hi>Israel,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Levitical Law.</hi> Then God
first reserved to himself the Tythe of the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 30. Which he did for this Reason, that,
intending to take the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> more peculiarly
into his Service (as he did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 6. in stead of,
or in exchange for all the First born of <hi>Israel,</hi> ver. 12,
13, and 45. and Chap. 8. ver. 18. Having before reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and appropriated the First born to himself, <hi>Exod.</hi>
13. 2.) he might bestow those Tythes on the <hi>Levites,</hi>
for and towards the Maintenance of that whole Tribe,
as a Reward for their Service in the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 21, 31. and in lieu of, and
Compensation for, their Part or Share of and in the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which thereupon they were expresly
cut off from, ver. 20, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>2. Now although it was grounded on a Principle
of Moral Justice and Equity, that the <hi>Levites,</hi> thus
engaged in a continual Attendance on a publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and shut out from their Share in the Inheritance
of the promised Land, should receive a sufficient
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104191:2"/>
Maintenance from them for whom they performed
that Service, and who enjoyed their Part of the Land:
Yet the ascertaining of the <hi>Quota</hi> of that Maintenance
to the exact Proportion of a <hi>Tenth Part</hi> of the Increase
of the Land, was not grounded on moral Justice, but
had it's Dependance on the Ceremonial Law, adapted
and limited to the Polity of that Dispensation and
People only. And that it might not be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it's appointed Time and Bounds, it pleased the
Divine Wisdom, to subject it to such Ceremonial Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
as plainly rank it amongst those carnal
Ordinances (Rites or Ceremonies) which were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but <hi>till the Time of Reformation,</hi> spoken of <hi>Heb.</hi>
9. 10. For as God appointed the <hi>Levites</hi> to be offered
for a <hi>Wave-Offering,</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> in the Name and on
the Behalf of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he said to
<hi>Moses, Thou shalt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of
the Congregation, and thou shalt gather the whole Assembly
of the Children of Israel together,; And thou shalt bring
the Levites before the Lord, and the Children of Israel
shall put their Hands upon the Levites: And Aaron shall
offer</hi> (in the Margin <hi>Wave) the Levites before the
Lord, for an Offering</hi> (in the Margin <hi>Wave-Offering)
of the Children of Israel; that they may execute the
Service of the Lord,</hi> Numb. 8. 9, 10, 11. So the Tythes,
which were assigned for the Maintenance of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
were to be first offered, by the People, as an
<hi>Heave-Offering</hi> unto the Lord. (<hi>The Tythes of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel, which they offer as an Heave-Offering
unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi>
18. 24.) And even the Tythe of those Tythes, which
the <hi>Levites</hi> were to yield unto the <hi>Priests,</hi> were to be
offered, by the <hi>Levites,</hi> as an <hi>Heave Offering</hi> to the
Lord, before the <hi>Priests</hi> might have them. <hi>Thus speak
unto the Levites</hi> (said God to <hi>Moses) and say unto them,
When ye take of the Children of Israel the Tythe which I
have given you from them for your Inheritance; Then ye
shall offer up an Heave-Offering of it for the Lord, even
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104191:2"/>
a Tenth Part of the Tythe. And this your Heave-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the Corn
of the threshing Floor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thus ye also shall offer an
Heave Offering unto the Lord, of all your Tythes, which
ye receive of the Children of Israel: And ye shall give
there of the Lord's Heave-Offering to Aaron the Priest,</hi>
ver. 26, 27, 28. This makes it evident, beyond doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Tythes, which were given by the People
to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and by the <hi>Levites</hi> to the <hi>Priests,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, had their Dependance on the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law, as that Priesthood had; and were to stand
no longer than that Law and that Priesthood stood:
Which was but till <hi>Shiloh</hi> came, and by the Offering
of himself once for all, had put an End to all the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy
Offerings under that Law.</p>
            <p>3. This the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
did so well understand, that he positively declared
that <hi>the Levitical Priesthood being changed, there was
made of Necessity a Change also of the Law,</hi> (of that
Law, by which that Priesthood and the Maintenance
of it had stood) See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. And 'tis also evident
from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity, that neither
the Apostles themselves, nor (for some Ages after them)
any of the Christians, did meddle with, or at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
themselves about Tythes; but let them totally
fall as they did the other abrogated Part, <hi>viz.</hi> Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. But after that the Mystery of Iniquity, which
in the Apostles time began to work (2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 7.)
had wrought to that Degree amongst some Christians,
and had drawn them so far from the Purity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the Gospel, as to form and model the Church
in many things, by and according to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
amongst other Ceremonial Parts of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Religion, which had been abolished by the Coming
and Death of Christ, Tythes were preached up again
(about the latter End of the fourth Century, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the fifth) by some, at first, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104191:3"/>
of Alms and Charity (because Part of the Tythee
under the Levitical Law were appointed for th
Maintenance of the Fatherless, the Widow and the
Stranger, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 28, 29.) And by others, as then still
due by the Mosaic Law, which had required them to be
paid to the <hi>Livetical Priesthood.</hi> Which Plea afterwards
(Corruptions increasing in the Church, and in those
especially who were called the <hi>Church-Men,</hi> or <hi>Clergy</hi>)
more and more prevailing, the Payment of Tythes
was re introduced, as due by those Levitical Laws,
which had been given to the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old. And
upon that Bottom, Tythes have stood, been claimed,
and the Claim defended unto this Day.</p>
            <p>5. Now, not only he that thus claims and receives
Tythes; but he that consents to, and complies with
such Claim, by paying Tythes thus brought in, and
thus claimed, doth thereby implicitly, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
(at least) deny that Christ has put an End to the
Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and consequently that he
is come, and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind.
And that this may appear as plain as is possible, I shall
draw the Matter into an Argument, thus:</p>
            <p>To uphold any thing, as still in Force, which was
to be taken away, and cease at and by the Death
of Christ, is to deny that Christ is come and hath
fuffered in his Flesh for Mankind.</p>
            <p>But to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to uphold a
Thing, as still in Force, which was to be taken
away, and cease at and by the Death of Christ:</p>
            <p>Therefore to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to
deny that Christ is come, and hath suffered in
his Flesh for Mankind.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> must be granted, and the <hi>Minor</hi> I thus
prove.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever was <hi>a Part</hi> of the Ceremonial Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> was to be taken away, and cease at and
by the Death of Christ;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104191:3"/>
But Tythes were a Part of the Ceremonial Law
of <hi>Moses;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore Tythes were to be taken away, and
cease at and by the Death of Christ:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> here again is unexceptionable; and the
<hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved:</p>
            <p>Every <hi>Heave Offering</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> was <hi>a Part</hi>
of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moses;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Tythes</hi> were an <hi>Heave-Offering</hi> among the
<hi>Iews,</hi> Numb. 18. 24.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Tythes</hi> were <hi>a Part</hi> of the Ceremonial
Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. By this it appears, that without Regard had of
the Person to whom, or the Use for which Tythes
are paid, the paying of Tythes (as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them) being <hi>a Part</hi> of the abrogated Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> imports a <hi>Denyal</hi> of the Coming
and Death of <hi>Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Hence it is, that Tythes have
been, and are commonly called, <hi>Antichristian,</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ:</hi> And hence hath arisen that Saying (often
used not only by our antient Friends, but by some of
the Martyrs long before) <hi>viz. He that pays Tythes, doth
thereby deny that Christ is come in the Flesh.</hi> That
Conclusion could not have been drawn, from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Tythes to a wrong Ministry, or for a wrong
Use only, though such Payment be evil: Nor could
any thing justify that Inference, but the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that Tythes, depending on the Ceremonial Law
of <hi>Moses,</hi> which must of Necessity and in Course fall,
and cease when Christ suffered; the paying of Tythes,
carries in it a Supposal, that that Law is not yet ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but is still in Force: And consequently that Christ,
whose Death must needs have ended it, is not yet
come, nor has yet suffered in his Flesh for Mankind.</p>
            <p>7. That other Objection, not less weighty than
common against paying Tythes to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Unlawfulness of upholding a false Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
to perform a false Worship (being it self so
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104191:4"/>
clear and plain, that it needs no Illustration) I shall,
in this Discourse, no further meddle with, than to
observe in my way, how far it may affect those
Tythes also, which the <hi>Impropriators</hi> claim. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having premised what is said before concerning
Tythes in general, to what Hand, or for what Use so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
paid, let us now inquire into those Tythes, which
are called <hi>Impropriate.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Impropriate TYTHES.</head>
               <p>1. THAT these Tythes, which are claimed by
the <hi>Impropriators,</hi> are of the same Nature,
and stand originally on the same Root and Ground, on
which the other Tythes stand, which are claimed
and exacted by the <hi>Priests,</hi> is evident from hence, that
they were all heretofore, these as well as those, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by, and paid to some or other of the <hi>Romish Clergy,</hi>
or their Appendices, the Religious Orders (so called)
and upon the same Foot. That is, These <hi>Impropriate
Tythes,</hi> were paid to those Religious Orders or Houses,
as being due to God, by Vertue of the <hi>Levitic Law;</hi>
as well as the other Tythes were paid to the <hi>Parish-Priests,</hi>
on the same supposed Right, from the same
Law. But how these Tythes came to those Religious
Houses first, and how afterwards from them to the
<hi>Impropriators,</hi> is next to be inquired.</p>
               <p>2. Until the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> (so named, because it
was holden in the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> called the
<hi>Lateran</hi>) in the Year 1215. It was in the Choice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man to give his Tythes to what Church he pleased,
so he gave them to some Church. And even after that
Council, the <hi>Popes,</hi> as Heads of that Church, by their
dispencing Power, did give leave to such as would
sue, and pay for it, to give their Tythes from the
<hi>Parish-Priest,</hi> to such Order of Religious People (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Monks, Fryers,</hi> or <hi>Nuns</hi>) as they were best affected
to. By which means, the <hi>Parish-Priests</hi> (called <hi>Seculars</hi>)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104191:4"/>
and those of the several Religious Orders (called by
a general Title, <hi>Regulars</hi>) being left to scramble, as
they could, for maintenance, the <hi>Regulars (mendicant
Fryers,</hi> and others) swarming in all Places, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
at least, to greater Sanctity, and Austerity
of Life, than the <hi>Parish-Priests,</hi> prevailed with the
People, either living or dying, to give not only very
considerable Estates in Lands, but also the Tythes
of other Lands, and of whole Parishes, from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Priests,</hi> to their Religious Houses or Convents.</p>
               <p>3. The Tythes, or Parsonages, so given, were then
called <hi>Appropriations,</hi> because they were appropriated
to this, that, or the other Religious House or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
And I have read, that there were in <hi>England</hi>
about 3845 Parsonages thus appropriated. And as
Tythes were then held to be <hi>due to God and holy Church;</hi>
and those Religious Orders were reputed a Part of that
Church: So the Tythes as well as the Lands thus given
them, were continued to them, and possessed by them,
till that general Storm arose, in K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. his time,
which overturned those Religious Houses and Orders
together. And here, by the way, it may be noted,
That while those Religious Houses stood, a great Part
of the Lands which had been given to them, were,
by <hi>Papal</hi> Authority, exempted from paying Tythes:
Whence it is, that many of those Estates, which had
belonged to those Religious Houses, remain discharged
from the Burthen of Tythes still.</p>
               <p>4. As Tythes were set up here on the Authority of
the <hi>Levitic Law,</hi> and in Imitation of the <hi>Iewish Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi>
consonant to that Law: So while those Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Houses stood, and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power prevailed
here, not only the <hi>Seculars</hi> or <hi>Parish-Priests,</hi> but all
those <hi>Regulars</hi> who received Tythes, were bound to
pay the <hi>Tenths</hi> out of the Tythes they received to the
Head of their Church, the <hi>Pope,</hi> as the <hi>Levites,</hi> under
the Ceremonial Law, were required to do to the Priests.</p>
               <p>5. But after that K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. (upon a Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104191:5"/>
the <hi>Pope</hi> and him, about his Divorce from his
first Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> which he earnestly desired, and
the <hi>Pope</hi> would not grant) fell off from the <hi>Pope</hi>
(though not from <hi>Popery:</hi> For after that, he retained
the most pernicious Doctrines of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi>
contained in the six Articles, and burnt some for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
them) he threw off the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy here,
and assumed it to himself; declaring himself, and
being declared, first by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in their <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and soon after by <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
The only Supream Head in Earth of the Church
of England.</hi> This was done by the Statute of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi>
8. c. 1. And therein it is enacted. <q>That the King,
his Heirs and Successors, Kings of this Realm, shall
be taken, accepted and reputed the only Supream
Head in Earth of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And shall
have and enjoy, annexed and united to the Imperial
Crown of this Realm, as well the Title and Stile
thereof, as all Honours, Dignities, Praeemences, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions,
Privileges, Authorities, Immunities, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and Commodities to the said Dignity of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Head of the same Church belonging and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining.
And shall have full Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
from time to time, to Visit, Repress, Redress,
Reform, Order, Correct, Restrain and Amend all
such Errors, Heresies, Abuses, Offences, Contempts
and Enormities whatsoever they be, which by any
manner of Spiritual Authority and Jurisdiction
ought, or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> By which it is evident, the Intention of the
<hi>Parliament</hi> then was to transfer, confer and settle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
and upon King <hi>Henry</hi> all the Powers, Profits and
Priviledges, which had been before supposed to be in,
or belong to, or had been enjoyed or exercised by
the <hi>Pope,</hi> while he was received as <hi>Supream Head of
the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. And therefore, as the <hi>Pope,</hi> while he retained the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104191:5"/>
                  <hi>Supremacy</hi> here, had the first Fruits (which are the
Profits of every Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Living for
one Year) upon the advancing of any Ecclesiastical
Person, to such a Living; and also the <hi>Tenths,</hi> that is
the <hi>Tenth Part</hi> of all the Tythes: So these two Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
as appendant to that <hi>Supremacy,</hi> followed it;
being settled on the King, in the same Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
wherein the Supremacy was vested in him.
The Words of the Statute, 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 3. relating to
the <hi>first Fruits,</hi> are these. <q>That for the more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Continuance and Augmentation of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Royal Estate, being not only now recognized
(as he always indeed hath heretofore been) the only
Supream Head in Earth, next and immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but also their
most assured and undoubted natural Soveraign Leige
Lord and King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may therefore be enacted
and ordained by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the King's Highness,
his Heirs and Successors, Kings of this Realm, shall
have and enjoy from time to time to endure for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
of every such Person and Persons, which at any
time after the first Day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next shall be
nominated, elected, perfected, presented, collated or
by any other means appointed to have any Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
Abbacy, Monastery, Priory, Colledge,
Hospital, Archdeaconry, Deanry, Provostship,
Prebend, Parsonage, Vicarage, Chauntry, Free-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
or other Dignity, Benefice, Office, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
Spiritual, whithin this Realm, or elsewhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>within
any of the King's Dominions, of what
Name, Nature, or Quality soever they be, or to
whose Foundation, Patronage, or Gift soever they
belong, the first-Fruits, Revenues and Profits for
one Year of every such Arch-Bishoprick, Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
Abby, Monastery, Priory,—Parsonage, Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Then (after Provisions made for finding
out the Value of those Spiritual Livings, and for
paying, receiving and recovering those <hi>First-Fruits</hi>)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104191:6"/>
the Settlement of the <hi>Tenths</hi> (that other part of the
<hi>Pope</hi>'s Revenue) upon the King, follows, in the same
Statute, in these Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And over this, be it enacted by Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
that the King's Majesty, his Heirs and
Successors, Kings of this Realm, for more Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Maintenance of the Royal Estate of his
Imperial Crown and Dignity of Supream Head
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> shall Yearly have, take,
enjoy and receive, united and knit to his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Crown for ever, one yearly Rent, or Pension,
amounting to the Value of the Tenth Part of all
the Revenues, Rents, Farms, Tythes, Offerings,
Emoluments, and of all other Profits as well called
Spiritual as Temporal, now appertaining or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing,
or that hereafter shall belong to any
Archbishoprick, Bishoprick, Abbacy, Monastery,
Priory, Archdeaconry, Deanry, Hospital, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
House-Collegiate, Prebend, Cathedral Church,
Collegiate-Church, Conventual-Church, Parsonage,
Vicarage, Chauntry, Free-Chappel, or other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
or Promotion Spiritual, of what Name,
Nature, or Quality soever they be, within any
Diocess of this Realm, or in Wales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And so
goes on to direct the Time, Place and Manner of
Payment of these Tenths, with the Penalty for
non-Payment.</p>
               <p>7. Thus were these two great Pillars of <hi>Papal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
(First Fruits</hi> and <hi>Tenths</hi>) transferr'd from
the <hi>Pope,</hi> (the old Head) to the King, (the new
Head of the Church,) to support and maintain that
Headship in him, as they had done before in the
<hi>Pope.</hi> Which Ecclesiastical Headship the King was
no sooner possessed of, than he began to exercise it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those Religious Orders, Suppressing (as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
in his Life, p. 379. rel<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes) the <hi>Observant
Fryers</hi> at <hi>Greenwich, Canterbury, Richmond</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Places, and substituting the <hi>Augustines</hi> in their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104191:6"/>
Places. <q>Which he did (says <hi>Herbert</hi> there) for the
finding out how his People would take his Design of
putting down Religious Houses:</q> To which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the next Year, beginning with the lesser Sort,
and suppressing all those Monasteries, Priories and
other Religious Houses of <hi>Monks, Canons</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi>
which had not in Lands, Tenements, Rents, Tythes,
Portions and other Hereditaments, above the clear
yearly Value of two Hundred Pounds. By which
means 376 of those Religious Houses being dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
a Revenue of above thrity thousand Pounds a
Year, besides an hundred thousand Pounds in Money
raised by Sale, at low Rates, of the Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
of those Houses (a Sum not small in that Age)
came to the King, for Support of his Ecclesiastical
Supremacy.</p>
               <p>8. The Statute, which countenanced this Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is the 27 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 28. And a new Court,
called <hi>the Court of Augmentations,</hi> was then erected
and settled by Parliament, for receiving and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these new accessional Revenues: The Act for
which, in our printed Statute Books, is set before that
for the Suppression of those lesser Monasteries. But
though that, for Suppressing those Monasteries, be,
by an <hi>Hysterosis,</hi> set after that for establishing the
<hi>Court of Augmentations;</hi> yet it must have been made
before it: For it is recited in it.</p>
               <p>9. In that Statute, 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. c. 28. for Suppressing
those smaller Monasteries, mention is made o<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
Abbies and Priories, which, with in one
Year before the making of that Statute, ha<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> been
given and granted to the King by any Abbot, Prior,
Abbess or Prioress, under their Convent-Seal, or that
otherwise had been suppressed, or dissolved. All which
were, by that Statute confirmed to the King, and to
all those, unto whom the King either then <unclear>before</unclear> had
conveyed, or then after should convey any Part or
Parts thereof; To hold to them in like Manner,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104191:7"/>
stamped upon those <hi>Rectories, Parsonages,</hi> and other
Revenues by <hi>Tythes,</hi> into what Hands soever they
were passed. And therefore, by the Statute of 32 <hi>Hen.</hi>
8. cap. 7. in case of with-holding, or denying to pay
the Tythes, all Persons claiming them (<hi>Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
as well as <hi>Priests)</hi> are restrained from suing in
the <hi>Temporal Courts,</hi> and limitted to the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
or <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> only, for the Recovery of them.</p>
               <p>13. And that they might still have Dependence upon
the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> care was taken, from the first, by the
Statute of 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 27. That none of these
Estates, which then had come, or should come, from
any of those Religious Houses to the King, should
pass from him by Grant to any Person whatsoever,
without an express Reservation of a <hi>Tenth.</hi> And in
a subsequent Statute (33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 39.) Complaint
being made, that altho' out of those Grants, which
the King had made to sundry Persons, of Honours,
Castles, Mannors, Lands, Tenements, Rectories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(which were under the Survey of the <hi>Court of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations</hi>)
the <hi>Tenths</hi> had been reserved; yet the
Persons unto whom such Grants had been made,
though they had quietly enjoyed and taken the Issues
and Profits of those Lands, Rectories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had not
paid the reserved <hi>Tenths</hi> to the King: Provision was
made in that Statute, by several <hi>Forfeitures</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine-Paenae</hi>'s
to enforce the Payment thereof.</p>
               <p>Nor was Care taken of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Head</hi> (the
<hi>King</hi>) only, but of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Members</hi> (the
<hi>Clergy</hi>) also: Many, if not most, of which had Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
or Portions issuing out of those Parsonages, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
or other Spiritual Benefices (as they were
counted) which the Religious Orders held: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that upon the Increasing of those <hi>Appropriations,</hi>
whereby the <hi>Parish-Priests</hi> were pinch'd, there had
been Provision made early, in the time of K. <hi>Richard</hi>
the <hi>Second,</hi> for the <hi>Vicars,</hi> as well as for the <hi>Poor;</hi> the
Statute of 15 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. c. 6. directing, <q>That, upon the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104191:7"/>
                     <hi>Appropriation</hi> of such Churches, the <hi>Diocaesian</hi> of
the Place (or Bishop of the Diocess) shall ordain,
according to the Value of such Churches, a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Sum of Money to be paid and distributed
Yearly, of the Fruits and Profits of the same
Churches, to the poor Parishoners: And also, that
the Vicar be well and sufficiently endowed.</q> Which
Statute (so far, at least, as concerned the Vicars) was
afterwards confirmed by another Statute of 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.
cap. 12. which expresly ordains, <q>That the Statute
of Appropriation of Churches, and of the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Vicars in the same, made the 15th Year of
K. <hi>Ric.</hi> the 2d be firmly holden, and put in due Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:</q>
I say, besides these, the Stat. of 34 and 35
of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 19. takes notice, <q>That the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Bishops, Arch Deacons and other Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Persons, of both Provinces of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and
<hi>York,</hi> having formerly, in right of their Churches
received out of the late Monasteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> divers
Pensions, and other Profits, had after the Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those Houses, been disturbed, and denyed of the
having, receiving and gathering of the said Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Whereupon it is, in the said Statute,
enacted, <q>That if any Person or Persons, being Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
or Occupier of any Mannors, Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Parsonages, Benefices or other Hereditaments
of any of the said late Monasteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the King's
Gift, Grant, Sale, Exchange, or otherwise, out
of which any such Pensions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
lawfully going, answered or paid to any of
the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch Deacons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ecclesiastical Persons abovesaid, do, at any
time after the first Day of <hi>April</hi> next coming, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
deny the Payment thereof, Then it shall be
lawful for the said Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons,
or other Ecclesiastical Persons aforesaid,
being so denied; to be satisfied and paid thereof, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
to proceed in the Ecclesiastical Courts, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104191:8"/>
14. By which Statute, all Pensions payable to Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, Arch-Deacons, or other Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Person, that had been possessed thereof, at or
within Ten Years next before the time of the Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the Monasteries, out of the Parsonages, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
or Tythes holden by the said Monasteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
are confirmed and assured to such Arch-Bishops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Arch-Deacons, and other Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
still.</p>
               <p>15. So that, upon the whole, besides what hath been said
of Tythes in general, with respect to the <hi>Iudaizing,</hi>
and <hi>Denying</hi> of Christ, by the Paying thereof (which
extends alike to all <hi>Tythes,</hi> those claimed by the <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priator,</hi>
as well as those claimed by the <hi>Priest</hi>) the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
Tythes</hi> being generally charged, either with
some Payment to the <hi>Vicars,</hi> for enlarging of their
<hi>Stipends,</hi> or with <hi>Pensions</hi> to the Arch Bishops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Arch-Deacons, and other Ecclesiasticks: All
such of them as are so charged, come under the
same Objection, that is made against paying to the
Priest, <hi>viz.</hi> The upholding of a false Ministry, to
perform a false Worship. And if any <hi>Impropriation</hi>
may be supposed to be free from all those Charges;
yet all <hi>Impropriators,</hi> as well as <hi>Priests,</hi> being bound
to pay the reserved <hi>Tenths</hi> to the King, as <hi>Supream
Head of the Church</hi> (which were wont before to be
paid to the <hi>Pope,</hi> while he was owned for <hi>Head of
the Church</hi>) the paying of Tythes to an <hi>Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
is a <hi>Recognizing,</hi> and <hi>acknowledging</hi> of a Man
(Bad or Good, <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> as it happens)
to be the only <hi>Supream Head on Earth of the Church.</hi>
Which is to set an <hi>Human Head</hi> to a <hi>Spiritual Body:</hi>
and to divest and deprive our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> of
his undoubted Right, who the Apostle says expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is <hi>the Head of the Body, the Church,</hi> Col. 1. 18.
<hi>And that not of Man's making or appointing; but God</hi>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>hath given him to be the Head over all
things to the Church, which is his Body,</hi> Eph. 1. 22, 23.</p>
