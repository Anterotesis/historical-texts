            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I ſhall obſerve his own order and begin with his <hi>Title,</hi> which is <hi>The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph Stained:</hi> And if you aske the Author whoſe triumph; he will anſwer you in the next line, <hi>Truths Triumph:</hi> and if you further queſtion by whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee will tell you (toward the latter end) by GEORGE MASTERSON, <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Goſpell, &amp;c.</hi> And now I beſeech you Gentlemen, judge whether it correſponds with the profeſſion of a Preacher of the Goſpell, to <hi>ſtaine</hi> the juſt <hi>Triumphs of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:161473:3"/>But ſurely the Gentleman hath received the marke in his forehead by the impoſition of the holy <hi>Romiſh</hi> hands by ſucceſſion, and <hi>truth</hi> is become his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Merchandize, and he is Angry that any one who hath not received the ſame marke in his hand or forehead, ſhould preſume to name <hi>Truth;</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper onely to men of his owne tribe to buy and ſell that Merchandize.</p>
            <p>But let me trace you a little further, <hi>A Pamphlet ſo called,</hi> &amp;c. Truly before I have done with you, I beleeve I ſhall cleare it to the eye of all that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, that it was not onely ſo called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but was indeed really the ſame, and if I miſtake not, you doe your ſelfe confeſſe it and much more. The <hi>title</hi> of the booke you pretend to ſtaine, was <hi>Truths Triumph,</hi> or <hi>Treachery Anatomiz'd, being a Diſcovery of the falſe and treacherous information of Mr.</hi> Maſterſon, &amp;c. And you your ſelfe acknowledge to have given in to the Lords at their Barre, <hi>Ianuar.</hi> 18. an <hi>Information of dangerous and bloudy conſequence againſt L. Col.

            <p>And now give me leave to aske you this queſtion, Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> did it; or doth it become <hi>George Maſterſon</hi> a Preacher of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> to have a hand in ſuch a treacherous bloudy deſigne to make a bloody and dangerous informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without a word of truth in it againſt any though his enemies and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, much leſſe thoſe which neither he nor any other can adjudge leſſe then faithfull, and as deepe Proficients in the <hi>Schoole of Chriſtianity,</hi> as he himſelfe, the pretended <hi>Preacher of the Goſpell</hi> which leads me to the next part of his Title, where he (to ſet the fairer gloſſe upon his Treacherous and faithleſſe, bloody and dangerous Information) ſtiles himſelfe an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> or <hi>Preacher of the Goſpell</hi> at <hi>Shore-ditch</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161473:3"/>
and grew as zealous for the <hi>Scotch Presbytery</hi> as any of thoſe, whoſe Religion was a fat Benefice; by which ſeeming ſhew of Sanctity and the helpe of a ſpeciall friend, in or about <hi>Shore-ditch,</hi> he got to be admitted not to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (<hi>Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Curate</hi>) but reall Prieſt of <hi>Shore-ditch;</hi> where he hath (by his owne confeſſion) endeavoured to weed out the Nettles (and plant Elders in the roome thereof) untill ſuch time as the Army, with an <hi>Independant</hi> Axe hewed them downe by the rootes, and then Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> was enforced to borrow ſome <hi>ſeeds of Independency</hi> of a deare friend of his in <hi>Coleman</hi>-ſtreet, who had enough to ſpare, to begin a new <hi>Plantation!</hi> In which he hath made ſo large a progreſſe, that he is now become <hi>Goodwins</hi> darling, and ſhall be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized for his zeale to the cauſe, in his Kalender of Worthies.</p>
            <p>But to leave his <hi>Title,</hi> and proceed to his <hi>Proeme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>But leaving his <hi>Proem,</hi> which is ſtuft with nothing but impertinencies, and inconſiſtencies, being <hi>Billinſgate,</hi> or rather language of the <hi>Spittle Houndſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch,</hi> or <hi>Hogſdon,</hi> (only taking notice of his juſtification of himſelfe in the latter end thereof;) to which I may be bold to affirme that, His own conceipt is greater then the report of others; for many (nay moſt) have, alwayes repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him a <hi>politick Prieſt,</hi> and a <hi>flattering Orator,</hi> but few have or doe adjudge him either a <hi>conſcientious Paſtor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or a man doing that himſelfe which with ſuch earneſtneſſe he preſſes as a <hi>duty</hi> upon others; He is indeed very zealous in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, juſt Prieſt-like boaſting of his <hi>annointing,</hi> but indeed a very careleſſe Practitioner; He is one of thoſe that Preaches another ſhould <hi>not beare falſe witneſſe,</hi> but he may and doth? another ſhould <hi>not lye,</hi> but he doth?

            </p>
            <p>It ſeemes Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> hath two Trades to live by, and I confeſſe it is good wiſdom; <hi>A Preacher of the Goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>You take great exception that you ſhould have the name of <hi>Trechery</hi> faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon you, as if you did not indeed deſerve it; but truly I beleeve, when it ſhall be conſidered that Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> came privately in to the Roome, and ſtood ſneaking in a corner to heare what was ſaid, and neither asked a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor objected againſt what was delivered or ſpoken, but catcht at ſeverall broken ſentences, and patcht them together to make up an <hi>Information;</hi> truly I beleeve in the eye of reaſon, this demeanour cannot deſerve a fairer name then premeditated <hi>Treachery,</hi> or <hi>a Deſigne to betray;</hi> if any advantage could be gotten.</p>

            <p>This is another falſhood, for he ſaid ſo many were appointed <hi>in the nature of a Committee,</hi> and that the honeſt Blades in <hi>Southwarke</hi> did not like <hi>that name,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8. ly"/> In the ſeventh place you vary from your information given at the Barre, for there you ſaid the Parliament mans name which did intend to attempt to kill <hi>Crumwell,</hi> was <hi>Harrie,</hi> and now you come, with <hi>this Gentleman his ſon is of his Chriſtian name</hi> (as they call it) nay it is you that call it, for it is your trade to make others <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> though you your ſelves are worſe then <hi>Jewes,</hi> for they had a vaile before their eyes, but you hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe.</p>

            <p>

And proceed to your next falſhood, which you affirme as the words of Mr. <hi>Wildman,</hi> viz. <hi>That he knew three other men that at the ſame time had taken up the ſame reſolution,</hi> which is altogether falſe, as will afterwards appeare by the teſtimony of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perſons of as known intergrity, and better converſation then any this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former can or doth produce.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11. ly"/> But this is as true, as Mr. <hi>Wildman</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>he would never truſt honeſt man againe for</hi> Crumwells <hi>ſake:</hi> which how unlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let any man judge, for if Mr. <hi>Wildman</hi> was reſolved never to truſt <hi>honeſt man more,</hi> becauſe <hi>one</hi> had deceived him, with whom would he converſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? certainly he muſt converſe with <hi>knaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and if the deceitpfull dealing of one <hi>ſeeming Saint</hi> was ſo irkeſome to him, what would the palpable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed diſhoneſty of ſo many profeſſed <hi>Divells?</hi> he had not need to converſe with Prieſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they are generally a very <hi>compendium of deceipt,</hi> nothing but <hi>ſeeming ſanctity,</hi> they ſeem to be clothed with Lambs Skins; but they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ravening Woolves. I believe Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> you were miſtaken, Mr. <hi>Wildman</hi> ſaid he would never truſt <hi>Prieſt</hi> more for your ſake: but to be ſerious, he did ſay that he ſhould never truſt any man upon bare profeſſions for L.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12. ly"/> The next remarkeable lye (though there be many which J for brevity ſake omit) is, that Malignants gave encouragement to go on with the Petition, ſaying, <hi>It was the moſt rationall piece that they had ſeen:</hi> In which particular you do moſt groſly pervert the ſence, and only patch up ſeverall broken ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, together ſpoken at ſeverall times, and upon ſeverall occaſiosn, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:161473:5"/>
that the Petition was of ſuch equall concernment unto all; That the very Malignants would be ſo farre from oppoſing it, that (ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſome few that were linke unto the Kings intereſt, by perſonall engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) many would joyne in the promoting of it.</p>
            <p>And now Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> is this ſuch a tranſcendent crime in your bill of ſinners, for a man to promote a Petition that tends to the <hi>uniting even ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> much leſſe <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>brethren,</hi> who have been deluded to a bloody con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt each with other and have been almoſt conſumed in a <hi>flame</hi> of <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>your brethrens the Prieſts kindling?</hi> certainly if you were as you pretend a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> you would preach <hi>reconciliation</hi> to the <hi>Gentils,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not repine at thoſe, nay endeavour the ruine of thoſe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to heale the <hi>wound</hi> that you have made, by your <hi>dividing principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the irrationality of this will appeare, when the great contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Principles of thoſe Gentlemen, and the principles of thoſe which they call Malignants, are put into the ballance together: for there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute inconſtancie betwixt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one by that Petition endeavouring to deſtroy the poore of the King, in relation to his diſſent to laws, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endeavouring to maintaine it.</p>

            <p>But Mr. <hi>Wildmans</hi> conſtancy and courage in ſtrugling with oppoſite Powers (though in thoſe whoſe frowne would create another ſoule in the Informer, is to all that know him ſo evident) That your ſcandalous report of his demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour herein cannot blemiſh his honour; but render your ſelfe an abſolute <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> i. e. <hi>Alwayes a Lyer.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21. ly"/> In the next place you begin with a charge &amp; tell us we moſt not ſuppoſe that Mr. <hi>Wildman</hi> delivered all that at the Houſe of Commons which fills up the beſt part of ſeaven Pages.</p>
            <p>As if you ſhould ſay, I know it, but I would not have you believe it <hi>you muſt not ſuppoſe &amp;c.</hi> It ſeems you dare not affirme he did not ſpeak ſo much, but you are loath the People ſhould believe he did, and therefore you charge them, not to believe it: But you proceed to weaken the Peoples beliefe, and aſperſe the manner of the delivery of Mr. <hi>Wildmans</hi> language at the Barre, which you ſay was with ſuch ſtumbling, interfeering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and down-right Halting; fye Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſon,</hi> the eloquence of the Genr. is well knowne, only his exact care to relate the truth made him pauſe at ſeverall periods to recollect things though you might powre out your falſhoods without feare or wit: Know you not that the beſt part of Oratory is <hi>Deliberation,</hi> and it was not timidity that cauſed Mr. <hi>Wildman</hi> to take ſuch deliberation, but he remembred the ſaying in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>A wiſe man weigheth his words in the ballance, but the foole ſpeaketh raſhly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And believe me Mr. <hi>Maſterſon,</hi> if you had followed his example, and <hi>beene more ready to heare then offer the ſacrifice of Fooles,</hi> I am confident you would have been taken (if not for a better <hi>Stateſman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>But you come at laſt to the cataſtrophe of all, namely that <hi>There was no need of witneſſes,</hi> for hee appeared, (Ile ſpare your <hi>Greeke</hi> for you have but a little) <hi>ſelfe condemned, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what I wonder? All your Information againſt him amounts not to a <hi>crime</hi> according to <hi>Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and if not; by what will you condemne him? Doe not you paſſe a <hi>Sion ſentence</hi> upon him I beſeech you; and canonize him among your bundle of Hereticks; pray do not excommunicate him. And then he will be ſo farre from condemning himſelfe, that it will be above the reach or power of your ſelfe or all your <hi>Seminaries,</hi> (whoſe intereſt he is an enemy to) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:161473:7"/>In the laſt place, you ſeeme to take exception, at his wonder, that he ſhould be committed <hi>without Witneſſes,</hi> and that the witneſſes ſhould not be called in: And here you take upon you to domineere, as if you had got the victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have begun the fight.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you begin to queſtion the truth of Mr. <hi>Wildmans relation</hi> touching your <hi>Witneſſes acknowledgement that nothing was ſpoken at the Meeting but what tended to advance the Parliaments honour. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this you begin to run diviſion, and in the firſt place you take upon you to aske a queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>It is not yet evident that they have by Oath proved the contrary; but ſuppoſe one of them did confeſſe it before Witneſſe, ſurely that is ſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>icient to cleere the truth in that particular, and to demonſtrate to the world that truth is not ſo ſtrong on your ſide as you would make them believe.</p>
            <p>And I am ſo ſatisfied in the truth in this particular, that I ſhall make bold to wipe off that ſtaine from the face of <hi>Truths triumph,</hi> and returne you ſcoffe with this advantage:</p>
            <lg>

            </lg>
            <p>In the ſecond place you proclaime the <hi>Chaſtity</hi> of one of your witneſſes, (It ſeemes you ſuſpect the other for a <hi>Strumpet,</hi>) hee is true Roman, you ſay; but how ſhall we know it? He is but Secretary yet, neither to the Parliament, nor us; for he never declared what or how much he could witneſſe to be true of your Bloody dangerous Information, O but he's <hi>valiant too,</hi> the man is not yet borne that ever <hi>darſt tamper with him about it;</hi> marke J beſeech you, either Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> was never <hi>borne,</hi> and therefore a <hi>Monſter;</hi> or elſe Mr. <hi>Wiliſon is a Coward;</hi> now which of theſe will you believe, one is a Lye for a certaine. Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> without doubt hath tampered with him about it, or elſe hee had never given him that learned Certificate under his hand to ſupport his weake credit with the people. But what will you ſay Mr. <hi>Maſterſon,</hi> if your witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did acknowledge what Mr. <hi>Wildman</hi> affirmes without tampering withall, and to a man of as much credit, and valour as any of thoſe you ſo much boaſt of; This I will undertake when you dare to make good, and truly then if your Witneſſe will ſay one thing and ſweare another, I ſhall hardly thinke him either <hi>valiant</hi> or <hi>honeſt,</hi> but only one of your <hi>Diſciples</hi> that can alter his <hi>tone,</hi> as <hi>occaſion is offered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But waving the reſt I come now to the pleaſanteſt part of the ſtory, viz. <hi>the certificate,</hi> which methinks ſavours of the Prieſt, for ſure I am; it was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of nothing leſſe then ſpleen and inveteracy which no witneſſes ſhould be fraught withall, But I deſire the reader to obſerve how impertinent this is to the proving of Mr. <hi>Maſterſons relation true,</hi> he gives us a certificate, as he pretends
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161473:8"/>
wherein Mr. <hi>Williſon</hi> affirmes he ſpoke not ſuch and ſuch words? but I conceive it would have been more authentique, if he had got Mr. <hi>Williſon</hi> and his other wittneſſe to atteſt under their hands that this relation, or information of Mr. <hi>Maſterſon</hi> was true: for truly prieſts are grown to that paſſe now, that it is not ſafe to believe any thing they ſay without two or three wittneſſes.</p>
            <p>But by this time I thinke if you caſt up your account you have little reaſon to inſult over <hi>Triumphant truth,</hi> eſpecially when you ſhall have weighed this following teſtimony, not of one, but of many men, both valiant and faithfull, who have done more for truths vindication in the face of authority, then either your ſelfe or your witneſſe dare do, in a private veſtry to aſperſe her.</p>
