            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AS I Preach not to please Mens Ears, so but little regard ought to be had to the Scoffing Reflections of such Men, who contemn every thing of this kind, unless it consists of a Fancy-taking Modelation of empty <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> or a high <hi>Florid Stile,</hi> mixt with Wit, Learning, and Philosophical Notions. Sad it is to see that in <hi>Divine Matters,</hi> nay, in <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Persons should affect New <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> (as to the shame of the present Generation, they do in respect of Garbs and Dresses:) I am not for Airy and <hi>Florid Orations</hi> in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Word of God, but for that plain Way of Preaching used by the Holy Apostles, and our Worthy <hi>Modern Divines.</hi> Besides, could I so Preach or Write, as is the Flesh-pleasing, Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickling <hi>A-la-mode</hi> of the Times, of such who stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Words more than Matter, it would be utterly dislik'd by all such <hi>Pions Christians,</hi> for whose sake, and at whose Importunity these Sermons are published. The Holy Apostle (who tho profoundly Learned) disclaims any <hi>Rhetorical Flourishes,</hi> or perswasive Oratory, but professes that <hi>his Speech and Preaching, was not with the Inticing Words of Man's Wisdom, but in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:60037:5"/>
of the Spirit, and with Power, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.4</hi>—I may say of some <hi>Mens Orations,</hi> or <hi>Elocutions,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaks of the <hi>Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale,</hi> who was at first taken with his delicate Notes, but when he saw him said, <hi>Thou art a Voice and nothing else.</hi> But alas, since the Sacred Scripture it self can't escape some Mens Censure, as if the Stile was rude and unpolished, (they being destitute of that Spirit which gave them forth;) What can I expect to meet with from such?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> The great Joy that generally appeared amongst all People upon the Conclusion of the late <hi>Peace,</hi> put me upon Preaching on this Subject; and when I found so great a Number of Books Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for, I thought I had a Call to Print and Publish them, which was the least of my Thoughts when I first entered upon this Work: And indeed I greatly fear, many will see their Expectation frustrated, (I mean such who did not hear the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Preached, but only had some small account of them;) yet they knowing the Author, I may see cause to recal what I speak of my Fears. I must confess, divers Worthy and Learned Men have wrote most excellently upon the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> yet perhaps hardly any in the Method here used, nor under the Notions of a <hi>Covenant of Peace</hi>— In some things thou wilt find that I do differ from many Learned Men, who make the <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> a distinct <hi>Covenant</hi> from that of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thee to read the <hi>tenth Sermon</hi> before thou judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:60037:5"/>
who is in the right—By the <hi>Baxte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Party</hi> I expect to be called an <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> for that hath been their Artifice of late, to expose the <hi>True Ancient Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Doctrine</hi> about <hi>Justification,</hi> &amp;c. but others who are sound in the Faith, will (I am sure) acquit me of that Charge. My main design in all my Preaching (if I know my own Heart) is wholly to advance the Free Grace of God, through that Redemption which is in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and utterly to abase the Creature, tho it may seem a hard thing to keep in an even Line, and not fall into either Extream: May be some may stumble at some Expressions about God's being Reconciled in Christ to the Elect whilst Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners—But sure they can't think that I mean because he is reconciled in the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> that therefore he is actually Reconciled to any as they are considered in the <hi>First Adam,</hi> and abide under God's denounced Wrath and the Curse of the Law: I know I have been abused of late in Print, by some on the other Hand, but let all well weigh what I have said in my <hi>Medium betwixt two Extreams,</hi> and what is here said, and so receive Satisfaction [if in the Judgment of any I have missed the Truth in any material Case] I shall gladly receive Information from such, and readily embrace it upon the Evidence of Truth: For, I confess, I see but a little, and the Best know but in part—That which possibly may seem most distastful, is the frequent repeating of some things; yet in so doing, I have followed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of a very great Man, <hi>viz.</hi> That such
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:60037:6"/>
Things that are <hi>Emphatical,</hi> should be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to fix the Matter the better on the Mind of the Hearer, or Reader. Besides, they come in occasionally upon different Heads: And also I find the very same has been done by others, who are look'd upon as <hi>Stars of the first Magnitude</hi>: See the Epistle to Dr. <hi>Manton</hi>'s Fourth Volume, <hi>p. 8.</hi> where you have these Expressions, <hi>viz. Let it not offend thee that some things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, which frequently happens in the Course of any Man's Ministry, when the same Subject has been formerly handled.</hi> Moreover one Reason of it might be, because of the different Times of my Preaching these <hi>Sermons</hi>; I being called oft to Preach upon other Subjects betwixt them; neither do I think any thing is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitably repeated, it being chiefly to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the New prevailing Errours about <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> Thou wilt find many of the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Points of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> are handled in these <hi>Sermons,</hi> (tho but weakly, according to that small Gift-received;) And also thou wilt see how <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njustly I have been misrepresented in an Epistle to a certain Book lately Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—I do not say that thou hast all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements here Printed, as Delivered when these Sermons were Preached, especially in some of them, for if I had so done, the Book would have swelled too big, and indeed it exceeds now what I first proposed—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:60037:6"/>But to Conclude, If thou dost receive any Light, Spiritual Profit, or Advantage by thy perusing of these <hi>Sermons,</hi> let thy care be to return the Praise to the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> and with Charity to cover my Weaknesses, and forget me not in thy <hi>Prayers,</hi> who am now drawing towards the <hi>Period</hi> of my <hi>Labours</hi> and <hi>Days.</hi> —But yet through <hi>God's Grace</hi> at present remain thy Servant in the Gospel for <hi>Christ's</hi> sake,</p>

What Peace can such a People expect who are not humbled for those Sins and Abominations which caused the righteous and holy God to bring the Plague of War and Devastations upon them? When the Cause is not remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what reason have we to think the Effect will cease? GOD may it is true, take off one Rod, and yet chasten us with another; if War and the Pestilence humble us not, Famine may be looked for. See what God speaks in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.21. <hi>And if you walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more Plagues upon you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your sins; and ye shall eat the flesh of your Sons, and the flesh of your Daughters shall you eat, v.</hi> 29. A People may cry <hi>Peace, Peace!</hi> when sudden Destruction is just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them. I may say of the Nations of the Earth,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as <hi>Jehu</hi> said to <hi>Joram</hi>'s Messenger, <hi>What hast thou to do with Peace? What Peace so long as the Whoredoms of thy Mother</hi> Jezzabel, <hi>and her Witchcrafts are so many?</hi> What Peace can such a Nation or People look for, long to continue, whilst their horrid <hi>Wickedness,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60037:12"/>
Prophaneness, cursed Oaths, Blasphemy, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Whoredom, Pride, Treachery, Cruelty, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, Heresies, Superstitions,</hi> and all manner of abominations abound amongst them? know this assuredly God's Anger is not yet turned away, but <hi>his hand is lifted up still.</hi> The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven last Plagues</hi> will over a short time be poured forth; and whatsoever you may think of the <hi>present Peace,</hi> I fear worser things are near than what the Earth hath seen or felt yet; we are not fallen in such an Age as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any long time of Peace; No, No! God hath a fearful Controversie with the Kingdoms of the Earth; <hi>Babylon</hi> must fall, and <hi>Sion</hi> must rise, and Jesus Christ shall Reign and Possess his Visible Kingdom. And tho Reverend Mr. <hi>Beverly,</hi> in some respect, hath acknowledged himself mistaken, yet the Church of God is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to him for his elaborate Pains,<note place="margin">Things look as if this may be the last Year in which the <hi>Turks</hi> may be a Plague to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian</hi> state.</note> in his careful searching out the Mystical Numbers, so as to know the time of the end of the Beasts Reign and Tyranny, and the passing away of the <hi>Second Wo.</hi> Moreover, I am perswaded he hath out-done all that went before him, and may be the World will see in a short space, that he was not much mistaken as to the Time.</p>
               <p>Therefore it will be Wisdom in all to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear too hard Censures of this Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Let us wait to see what will be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Divine Providence between this and the end of the Year 1700. No doubt but ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Revolutions are ready to break out in the Earth. <hi>God will overturn, overturn, overturn,</hi>

                  </note> and such an one doubtless, will be produced when God <hi>puts it into the hearts of the Ten Kings</hi> (or some of them) <hi>to hate the Whore.</hi> So that from the whole we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect God will yet take Peace from the Earth, tho blessed be his Name, we enjoy a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at this time. But what may such Princes and People expect, who having got <hi>Peace</hi> from abroad, continue, or raise an Open War against the Lord and his People at Home; nay, shew their Rage and Malice (more since) in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting them than before. Oh! That all of us may be stirred up to cry to the Lord mightily for those poor People, and against their Enemies, as they are Foes and Opposers, and make War against the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and those that follow him: These things tend to cause me to conclude that the <hi>Present Peace</hi> in the <hi>European</hi> World may not last long.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, <hi>Peace</hi> made between King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations may soon be broken or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: But there is a <hi>Peace</hi> which being made shall be lasting, and never be removed: And this brings me to the Words of my Text:</p>

               <p n="1">I. It is GOD,<note place="margin">Who makes this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</note> the great God and Father of Mercy which makes this Promise; he that made and created us, see <hi>verse</hi> 5. <hi>For thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is thy Husband, the Lord of Hosts is his Name, the God of the whole Earth shall he be called</hi>; A Promise of Peace from such a King is worth regard, and to be prized by all to whom it is made.</p>
               <p n="2">II.<note place="margin">To whom this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made.</note> This Promise is made unto the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, and therefore it wonderfully behoveth us to consider it, and lay the matter to heart; some of those great Promises contained in the Writings of the Prophets, do peculiarly refer to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but this wholly and particularly respecteth the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, as you may see if you read <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Sing O barren, thou that didst not bear, break forth into Singing, and cry aloud thou that didst not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> The <hi>Jewish</hi> People were in a Legal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Married to the Lord, and many among them were spiritually espoused unto him, and brought forth blessed Fruit, the Church of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had a numerous Off-spring; but for a long Period of Time we poor <hi>Gentiles</hi> were pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by, God espoused us not; the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60037:14"/>
were not Married, or taken into a Covenant Relation with God until the Times of the Gospel, and it was upon the Rejection, and casting off of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they were graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, as <hi>Paul</hi> shews at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Now the Reasons why the <hi>Gentile</hi> People are called, or excited here to Rejoyce and Sing, may be these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From what precedeth in the 53<hi>d. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> where mention is made of the Sufferings, Humiliation, and Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>Surely he hath born our Griefs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our Sorrows,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>He was wounded for our Transgressions, he was bruised for our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> For our Iniquities, that is, for all the Iniquities of Gods Elect, not only for them among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but them also amongst the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Sing O Barren,</hi> sing ye Poor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for Jesus Christ Dyed for you, he bore your Transgressions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon the Consideration of the Promise of the Father to Jesus Christ in respect of them as well as any other, <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.10. <hi>He shall see his Seed, or the Travel of his Soul,</hi> even them amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as them amongst the <hi>Jews</hi>; i. e. He shall see all them for whom he Died, brought into a Covenant Relation with himself, even Married to him, and his own gracious Image stampt upon them; they shall be called, he shall see them Converted, he shall enjoy them, and imbrace them in his Arms, and they shall lie in his Bosom.</p>
               <p>They are called upon to Sing (as I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60037:14"/>
conceive) in respect of that great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Priviledge of there being thus Married to Jesus Christ, who before had no Husband, <hi>For thy Maker is thy Husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. From the Consideration, she is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the shame of being Barren; see <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Cry aloud thou that didst not Travel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Upon the Consideration of her numerous off-spring; <hi>For more are the Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate, than the Children of the Married Wife, saith the Lord,</hi> verse 1. <hi>Enlarge the Place of thy Tents, and let them stretch forth the Curtains,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verse</hi> 2. <hi>For thou shalt break forth on the Right Hand, and on the Left.</hi> This shews, that there should be a Multitude of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> Converted unto Jesus Christ; yea, a far greater number than of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which hath been made good in the Gospel Days, and will yet more abundantly in Times that now draw very near, when the <hi>fulness of the Gentiles</hi> shall be brought in: But O! How barren is she now, that once was the Darling of Heaven, and the only Church and People of God? hardly one <hi>Jew</hi> to be found throughout the Earth, that owns the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> or is a Believer, or a true Christian.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Because she shall never suffer shame any more, though for a short Time she was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, and seemed not to be regarded by the Lord; but being now Espoused, she shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually be Beloved, and injoy Christs special Favour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From the Consideration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that God has made with Christs for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60037:15"/>
them; <hi>For the Mountains shall depart, and the Hills be removed, but my Kindness shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my Peace be removed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This brings me to the next Thing.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">What is contained in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</note>III. Which is, that which is contained in the Promise, <hi>viz. Peace,</hi> Peace is a sweet Blessing, Peace with Men is highly esteemed; but this is Peace with God which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and exceeds all kind of Peace whatsoever. Yea Peace by Vertue of a Covenant, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made by God himself, <hi>The Covenant of my Peace, saith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">The Rise or Spring of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</note>IV. We have the Spring or Rise of this Promise, or the grand Motive that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God to enter into this Covenant of Peace, or to make this Promise; <hi>viz.</hi> His Love and Mercy, <hi>Saith the Lord, that hath Mercy on thee.</hi> This shews, that the Covenant of <hi>Peace</hi> was founded for poor Creatures who were in Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or in a deplorable Condition, Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall needed not Gods Mercy, he was the Object of Gods Love and Favour, but not of his Mercy: For Mercy extended to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, denotes he was in a forlorn and Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition before; and at that Time when Bowels of Pity and Compassion were moved towards him.</p>
               <p n="5">V. We have here also the Stability of the Promise, the Mountains that stand so fast shall, or may sooner depart, and the Hills be removed, than this Covenant of <hi>Peace</hi> can be broken or he removed; nay, and he that saith this, is the Lord, the faithful, and true
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60037:15"/>
God, that cannot lie; but to make it yet more firm, he hath sworn to his Promise;<note place="margin">Isa. 54.9.</note> for <hi>as I have sworn that the Waters of Noah shall no more, go over the Earth, so have I sworn that I would not be Wrath with thee nor rebuke thee</hi>; that is, not to forsake her utterly.</p>
               <p>So much shall suffice as to the Parts, and Explanation of the Words of our Text.</p>
               <p>I shall only raise, and prosecute one Point of Doctrine from hence, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the speaking unto this Proposition, I shall take this Method following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Lay down eight Explanatory</hi> Propositions <hi>by way of Premise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>I shall endeavour to open the main or chief Transactions about the bringing in, and establish-of this Covenant of Peace</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>I shall open the Nature of this Covenant of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>I shall shew you what is contained, granted or given in this Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Shew the Nature of the Peace comprehended in this Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Apply it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Proposit. I. <hi>That God foresaw from Eternity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</note> 
                  <hi>that Man would fall from that happy and blessed State in which he was Created; and that a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Breach would arise betwixt himself and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> Thereby,</p>
               <p>Had it not been thus, there would have been
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60037:16"/>
no room, no need, no occasion for God to enter into a Covenant of <hi>Peace</hi> with his own blessed Son, in behalf of Mankind without a War foreseen, there could I say, be no occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Covenant of Peace</hi> and Reconciliation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Proposition,</hi> That this <hi>Covenant of Peace</hi> was entered into between the Father and the Son before the World began. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, (aluding to this Covenant)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>God hath saved us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the World began.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.23.</note> Moreover, Our Lord Jesus saith, that <hi>he was set up from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, from the beginning, or ever the Earth was.</hi> That is ordained, substituted and anointed to be the great Representative and Covenanting-Head in behalf of all the Elect of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Proposition,</hi> That the Breach which God foresaw would arise, would be very great, or a most amazing or fearful Breach betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and lost Mankind, and that it was so might abundantly be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Nature of the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man opened.</note>It was a Breach occasioned by Sin, God did not first fall out with us, or proclaim War against Mankind; but we first broke that League and Covenant of our Creation with God; Man rebelled against his Creator, casting off his Obedience and Allegiance, and subjected himself to Sin and the Devil,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Lo this only have I found, that God hath made Man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but they have sought out many inventions.</hi> Tho all the Wickedness that is in Man's Heart, that Deceit, Hypocrisie, and streams
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60037:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Filthiness that is there, <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Wisest of Men could not find out: Yet this he had discovered, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fountain</hi> of it, namely <hi>Original Sin</hi>; or what it was that first caused that Breach and War which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and all Unconverted Men, or all ungodly Ones in the World. And now, That it is a fearful Breach appeareth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that Man run away from God, and hid himself,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>And the Lord God called unto</hi> Adam <hi>and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard thy Voice in the Garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid my self.</hi> That God who was before the Object of his Love and Delight, was now become Terrible unto him because of his horrid Sin and Guilt which lay upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was an unreasonable act of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and most horrid Rebellion, considering what God had done for Man, and how Great, Noble and Honourable God had made him; he formed Man in his own Image, and made him capable of enjoying sweet Fellowship and Communion with his Creator; he made him Lord and Governour of all things on Earth, and gave him a lovely, beautiful Spouse to be a sit <hi>help meet for him</hi>; he gave him power to stand in that happy Estate, tho he left him in a possibility of Falling to prove his Fidelity and Obedience to his Maker. But Man cast horrid Contempt upon God by his Unbelief. He dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed the true and faithful <hi>God,</hi> and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Devil,</hi> that <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> and so gave more <hi>Glory</hi> to Satan, than to his blessed and most rightful Sovereign.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60037:17"/>3. The Dismal Nature of this Breach fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears on Man's part, by considering of that vile and abominable Enmity which is in the Hearts of all Mankind (who abide in that old Nature) against God as the effects of that first Sin,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.</note> 
                  <hi>The carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject unto the Law of God, neither indeed can be</hi>; he doth not say, it is an <hi>Enemy,</hi> but in the abstract, it is <hi>Enmity</hi>; an Enemy (as one observes) may be reconciled, but <hi>Enmity</hi> can never be reconciled: Man by this Sin came to be alienated in the highest degree from God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>having the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God:</hi> And in another place, saith the same Apostle,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>And you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">The fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful state of Man by Nature. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51.</note>4. This still further appears, In that all Men naturally resist God and his good Spirit, they fight against God, <hi>Ye stiff-necked and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost, as your Fathers did, so do ye.</hi> Nay, they are called haters of God, <hi>The haters of God</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>should have submitted themselves. Ye have both hated me and my Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24</note> saith our blessed Lord. What can render Sin more evil, or Man more vile than to be called a <hi>Hater of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8.</note> they are <hi>haters of God and despightful; Their soul,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>abhorred me, and my Soul loathed them.</hi> Moreover, They are said to be Contemners of God, they even dare God to his Face, and harden their Hearts against him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 10.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60037:17"/>
He saith in his heart, thou wilt not require it</hi>; They fear him not, they <hi>atheistically</hi> deny his <hi>Providence,</hi> nay, his <hi>very being</hi>; or wish at least <hi>there was no God.</hi> And all this is the fruit and effect of Man's Rebellion or of his First Sin.</p>

               <p>My Brethren, These are the main things that are contained in, and about a Covenant of Peace among Men, as the chief Covenant Transactions; and my Purpose is to speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these Six things particularly: Tho I grant there is some difference between a Covenant of Peace between Kingdoms and States among Men, and this Covenant; especially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Work of the Glorious Mediator of this Covenant, and a Mediator of Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between Earthly Princes and States: As we, God assisting, shall make appear.</p>
               <p>But to proceed:</p>
               <p n="1">I. Concerning the Treaty, or Treating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Covenant. My Brethren, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> appoint their Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Embassadors</hi> or <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> to Treat about the Terms upon which they design and are willing to conclude a Peace after a ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and destructive War: They do not Treat about it in their own Persons; but the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace in this Covenant was only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God the Father,</hi> and <hi>God the Son</hi>; Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then had no actual Being, or did not exist, and therefore could not send any <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary</hi> to agitate Matters on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
               <p>It is true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1.</note> Our Lord Jesus Christ is called <hi>The Messenger of the Covenant whom we delight in.</hi> He is indeed our Delegate, Messenger or Trustee; but the Father alone, and not we

Delegated that Office and Power to him, for us, and on our Behalf, out of his own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace and Goodness before the World began. This Name of <hi>Messenger of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> doth</p>
               <p n="1">1. Denote Christ's Dispensatory Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Work and Office, and his free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary condescention to undertake in this Treaty, according to the Design, Purpose and Will of the Father, as our great Trustee, Embassador and Plenipotentiary. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. He may not only be called <hi>The Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Covenant,</hi> as our great Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Treat with the Father in Eternity, upon the Terms of our Peace; but also in his being sent from Heaven to Earth, actually to work about, and accomplish all things that were agreed on between them both; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the making of our Peace. He travelled from Heaven to Earth on this Errand, and to effect this blessed Work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He may be so called, because he is the Messenger that published the Happy News of the Peace contained in this Covenant, in the clear and glorious Ministration of it: Hence it is said,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here are the two Covenanting Parties <hi>the Covenant of Peace is between them both:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13</note> that is, between the <hi>Lord of Host,</hi> and the <hi>Man who is the Branch</hi>; betwixt them it was consulted, agreed to, or concluded, <hi>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the Earth was:</hi> that is, as the Covenant-Head of all God's Elect, or as Mediator and Peace-maker between God and them, and this setting up
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60037:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that, clearly implies a Covenant or holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact that was between them both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The consent of two Parties, or more, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Proposals made by the one Party, and the agreement of the other, tends to make a formal Covenant, so here was, my Brethren, a mutual re-stipulation betwixt God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Christ about our Peace and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For here were things commanded by the one, and agreed to be done in obedience by the other: In these Transactions the <hi>Father</hi> makes Proposals to the <hi>Son,</hi> and shewed him what he will have him do, if ever our Peace succeed and is made. And</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, Upon the doing of which many great Promises are made to Christ for the Merit or Desert of his Work, and to the Elect in him, out of meer Grace, for Christ's sake, or for his just deservings; hence our Lord saith <hi>he came to do the will of his Father, This is the Will of him that sent me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40.</note> &amp;c. he laid down his Life as his Father commanded him; he knew it was according to the Eternal Compact, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Decree of his Father, unto which he consented; God the Father agreed to prepare the Son a Body, the Son consented to assume our Nature, or take that Body,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Then said I, lo, I come to do thy Will O God!</hi> and in that body he was enjoined to die, <hi>I have power to lay down my life, and power to take it up again, this Commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> Also these Faederal Transactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God the Father and Jesus Christ are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60037:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
held forth in <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. <hi>He shall make his Soul an offering for Sin,</hi> this was that which Christ was obliged to do; and then we have the Promise of the Fathers to him, (1.) Of justifying of many. (2.) Of seeing his Seed, <hi>He shall see his Seed.</hi> (3.) That <hi>the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand</hi>; he shall have them all united to himself, pordoned and saved for ever. Again <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.6. The Covenanting Parties are mentioned, the Father saith, <hi>I. will give thee</hi> (that is, thee my Son) <hi>for a Covenant to the People.</hi> Here's the Father's Designation and first Sealing of our Lord Jesus Christ to the Mediatorial Office and Employment.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Our Lord Jesus readily complied with the Father's Purpose and Will herein, <hi>The Lord God hath opened mine Ear,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.5, 6</note> 
                  <hi>and I was not rebellious, I gave my Back to the Smiters, and my Cheeks to them that plucked off the Hair; I hid not my Face from shame and spitting.</hi> I gave consent thus to do, I readily yielded to my Father's Pleasure herein; and in the Fulness of Time he actually thus suffered to fulfil and answer the Terms of this Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will declare the Decree,</hi> (or as Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> reads it) <hi>the Covenant:</hi> that is, I will publish or manifest that which was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt God the Father and me This my Brethren, was long kept secret, but it is now clearly revealed, <hi>The secrets of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi>

first thing that was proposed to be opened, <hi>viz. That there was a Treaty or Treating between the Father and the Son about this blessed Covenant of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. I shall shew you more fully, <hi>That there was an Agreement upon the Terms.</hi> Or, <hi>That the Son of God did consent to what the Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is very evident from what hath been said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Fathers proposals in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peace. Isa.</hi> 42.6, 7</note> That God proposed Matters to his own Son; or what he must do to procure, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the <hi>Covenant of Peace</hi>; but let me add here one or two Scriptures more to shew you that Christ consented unto those Proposals made by the Father, <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for a light unto the Gentiles: to open blind eyes, to bring out the Prisoners from the Prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the Prison-House.</hi> And in Isa. 49.5, 6. it is said, <hi>And now saith the Lord that formed me from the Womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, tho Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, And my God shall be my strength: And he said it is a light thing that thou shouldst be my Servant, to raise up the Tribes of Jacob, to restore the preserved of Israel, I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayst be my Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi> These things all Expositors that are <hi>Orthodox</hi> agree were spoken by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to Jesus Christ, and do contain Proposals concerning the Covenant of Peace. And now</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60037:28"/>2. Let us in the next place consider of such Scriptures that prove that Christ did consent unto these Proposals. To this effect, see <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22.23, 24. <hi>The Lord possessed me in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his way, before his work of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before ever the Earth was. When there was no depths I was brought forth, when there was no Fountains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with Water,</hi> 30, 31. <hi>Then was I with him as one brought up with him, and was daily his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, rejoicing always before him, rejoicing in the habitable part of the Earth, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men.</hi> As this Text proves the Eternity of the Son of God, who is the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, eternal Wisdom of God</hi>; so also it shews there was a voluntary and ready consent in our Lord to undertake in the Work of our Peace and Redemption, that he was set up and did agree to undertake, as our Mediator, to make our Peace with God; and also, that he took pleasure in his so engaging on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; To this, let me add what <hi>David</hi> in the Person of Christ speaks,<note place="margin">Psa. 40.6.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacrifice and Offerings thou didst not desire, mine ears hast thou opened; Burnt Offerings and Sin Offerings hast thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, then said I, lo I come to do thy Will O God.</hi> This place is cited by the Apostle,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the World he saith, Sacrifice and Offerings thou wouldst not, but a Body hast thou prepared me. In Burnt Offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, lo I come, in the Volmn of the Book it is written of me, to do thy Will, O God.</hi> Nothing can more fully shew Christ's chearful Consent;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60037:29"/>
What God the Father required, Jesus Christ yielded to do, which was, to make satisfaction for Sin, in his Body on the Tree, and so to make our Peace with the Eternal <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Consider who the Persons transacting and treating with each other were, even God the Father, and God the Son; the Father stands upon satisfaction to his Law and Justice, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the whole Sum or Price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that so our Peace might be made, and Christ engageth to give it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The business or grand Matter transacted, I say, betwixt them was our Peace and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation unto God, and so to recover all God's Elect from Sin, Wrath and Misery, and work about their Eternal Happiness; the Elect, tho not then in Being, yet are here considered as fallen, wretched and forlorn Creatures.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That the Manner or Nature of these Transactions were <hi>faederal,</hi> or in a Covenant-way, one Person mutually engaging and sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulating with the other: The Father stands upon the strict demands of Law and Justice, the Son consents to glorifie the Father therein, and raise the honour of all the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which in time he did do, <hi>I have glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee on Earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.4, 5</note> 
                  <hi>I have finished the work thou gavest me to do. And now Father, glorifie me with thine own Self.</hi> As if he should say, the Terms agreed upon, or thy Demands are done, therefore let me have my Reward, and let mine Elect <hi>be made one in us</hi>; Let me not only Personally be one with thee, but also Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60037:29"/>
one, and so be glorified, as it is due to me, as the Hire or Reward of my Work.</p>
               <p n="4">IV.<note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of peace was made from all Eternity</note> If any ask when this Covenant or holy Compact was made, I told you, and say again, it bears Date from Eternity, or before the World began, when we had (as I said before) no Existence but only in the Eternal Decree and Purpose of God. Moreover, Remember this Covenant was made with Christ for us, and in him with us, for all that Grace which is given to us in time, was promised unto us in Christ, nay given to us in Christ from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. as our Surety, Covenanting-Head, and blessed Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>As to the special and particular Articles agreed upon, on which the Covenant of Peace was made and concluded, I shall open them under the next Head of Discourse.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Commonly in all Treaties,<note place="margin">Christ is the only Mediator of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of peace.</note> or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Peace amongst Men, there is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator chosen. So God chose a Mediator of this Covenant; yet his Work as Mediator, greatly differs from the Work and Office of all other Mediators, as I might make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: For Christ is not only Mediator of the Covenant, but <hi>Surety, Messenger</hi> and <hi>Testator</hi> of it also: And as he is considered Mediator, he is invested with a Threefold Office more particularly, which Offices he faithfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth in order to the making our Peace with God, in reconciling God to us, and us to God, which I purpose to treat of and open in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60037:30"/>The Work of our Mediator is not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to see our Peace made, or to labour by Intreaty to bring each Party to Moderation, and pliable Terms, and to see every thing done according to the Preliminaries agreed upon; but the whole Work of making Peace is solely committed to our Lord Jesus Christ, not to see others do it, but he himself doth it all, even all that God requires on his part, and what is necessary to be done <hi>for us, in us, and by us also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Let it be also considered, That God would not make any Covenant of Peace with us without a Mediator, without such a Mediator; and that Jesus Christ alone is the Mediator, is evident,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>There is one Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Christ Jesus.</hi> I say, God chose his Son to be the Mediator of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peace: and hence he is said to <hi>be given for a Covenant unto the People,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.6.</note> that is, as some conceive, To be the Mediator thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">II. God the Father's Demands must be granted; he will not suffer his Just Right and Honour to be invaded, nor his Glory eclipsed, therefore was this Mediator chosen; besides the Sanction of his Holy Law must be preserved; Private Persons may forgive Offences, as they please; but the Just and Holy Governour of the World, will not, cannot pass by Offences till the end of Government be secured, that so his Holiness and Justice be not stained, nor his Law fall to the Ground: Hence one main Article proposed was, That the Mediator of our Peace do make full Satisfaction, and if he

doth not this, there could be no Covenont of Peace concluded; this therefore was the result of that Counsel of Peace held in Eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There was I say, a necessity for the Son of God to be both Mediator and Surety of this Covenant: I do not say, that there was a necessity laid either upon the Father or the Son to enter into this Covenant of Peace for us: No, no! But if God will in a way of Free and Sovereign Grace enter into such a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for Mankind, there was a Necessity for Christ to be the Mediator and Surety of it; I say, Necessity, so far as we can, or are able to conceive, in respect of this Matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because God hath not revealed,<note place="margin">The necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Peace,</hi> and that Christ is he.</note> or made known any other way by which our Peace could be made, but by a Mediator, I do not say, that God could not any other way make our Peace, but that he could not in reguard of his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (so far as it appeareth unto us.) More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if God hath not made known any other way, then there is no other way for us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Peace with him: But no other way is made known.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There could be no other way, as we can conceive, because the breach that was between God and us, must be made up by a full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Law and Justice of God, God being Just as well as Gracious; and hence one end why Christ was made <hi>a propitiation through Faith in his bloud,</hi>

just, and the Justifier of him that believeth in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> vers. 26. that is, That no wrong might be done to the Essential Purity of God's Nature, or Rectitude of his Will; nor yet to his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Justice, by which he cannot but hate Sin, and for it require a Satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard of the <hi>Truth</hi> of God's Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pronounced against all Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> upon his Disobedience, legal Threatnings are such, that they admit of no Pardon, without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be made to the Justice and Holiness of God; and this was signified by all those Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Sacrifices and Offerings under the Law; therefore in vindication of the Truth or Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, together with the Honour, Equity, and Sanction of the Law, there must be Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made, or no Peace with God, for fallen Mankind; and this could not be done but by such a Mediator as Jesus Christ is.</p>
               <p>For that which could not be done by Men or Angels, nor as a simple Act of God's Mercy, without the Impeachment of his <hi>Holiness, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> &amp;c. could not be done at all: But no pardon, no Peace could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by Men nor Angels, nor as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute or simple Act of Mercy, without the Impeachment or eclipsing the Glory of the Attributes of God's <hi>Justice, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> &amp;c. therefore it could not be so done at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To say God might have entered into a Covenant of Peace for us any other way than by the Mediator Jesus Christ, or through his Death and Atonement would (as one observes)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60037:31"/>
reflect upon his Love to his own dear Son: For why should the Son of God be made a Curse for us, or suffer the cursed Death of the Cross, to make our Peace, if Peace could be made any other way, without the least injury to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Law, or Holiness of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No doubt my Brethren, but that the Son of God had been spared, if he had foresaw that our Peace might have been made some other way.</p>
               <p>Moreover, would it not then follow that there might have been two Ways to obtain Peace and Reconciliation with God, which is contrary to what our Blessed Lord says,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6.</note> 
                  <hi>No Man cometh to the Father but by me</hi>; that is, cannot come to have Peace with God any other way, but by me, by my Death, or through my Blood, nor without believing, or depending upon me: For thus it is with the adult.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is no other way of Peace with God, and therefore a Necessity of Christ's Mediation; because <hi>without the shedding of Blood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no Remission</hi>; no Pardon, and so no Peace; there could be no discharge from the guilt of Sin, no removal of the Punishment of Sin, nor any Purgation from the filth and pollution thereof, without the Blood of Christ be shed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Because it is positively said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no other Name given under Heaven whereby we must be saved:</hi> If there is no other Name, Way, or Means given, but by Jesus Christ; then there is a Necessity that our Peace be made alone by him: But this is so, therefore there is a Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Christ's Mediation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60037:32"/>In the next place we will enquire what is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary for the Mediator of our Peace to do, or were Requisites in him, according to the Articles agreed on in this Covenant, to make our Peace with God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">The Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites in Christ as a Mediator.</note>1. A Mediatour of this Covenant of Peace, must understand the Nature of that difference, or breach which was betwixt God and Man; and what Terms the Holy God, who is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Party) stands upon; and must have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if ever our Peace be made; and who but Jesus Christ, who is God, knew this? It was he only that well knew what it was that could satisfie Infinite Justice: Had it been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed either to Men or Angels to resolve this Question, <hi>i. e. By what Means shall fallen Man come to be reconciled to God, and God be righted as touching all that wrong Sin and Sinners have done him?</hi> What Answer think you could they have made? Alas! no meer created Being could resolve such a Question.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that is the Mediatour of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or that maketh our Peace, must not only know what will do it, but also he must be able to answer all God's Demands, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his Law and Justice; and also be able to supply all our Wants and Necessities: He must seek the Honour of the Blessed God, and equally seek and be able to relieve poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and none but Jesus Christ could do this, who is an indifferent Person, or one equally related unto both, he being <hi>both God and Man in one Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60037:32"/>(1.) He being God, the one and the same Eternal God, he could not know what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Glory of his Father; and therefore would not, could not eclipse his Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) And he being Man, he could not but sympathize with the poor Creature; and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God he did not only know all our Wants, but he is able also to supply them. This brings me to the next particular.</p>
               <p n="3">III.<note place="margin">Christ is every way qualified to be Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Covenant.</note> The Mediator of this Covenant must therefore be every ways suitably qualified, or capacitated for this Work and Mediatorship; and to this end I say, he must be God; nay, God in our Nature, (for a meer Man could not satisfie Infinite Justice); his Obedience or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings else could not therefore have been meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious: For it was from the Union of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature with the Humane, that put such a Worth or meritorious Efficacy in his Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>I say, Jesus Christ our Mediator must be <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why Christ must be God.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Because those Evils which he was to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, could never be taken away by any Person that was not God, or whose Sacrifice or Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not an infinite Worth and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it; because Sin is against the Infinite Majesty of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jesus Christ as Mediator must be God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise he could not sustain, or bear in his Body and Soul that great weight of Sin and Wrath laid upon him; for if but the guilt of one Sin was laid on any meer Man, it would sink him down to the lowest Hell; much more then would the weight of all the Sins of God's Elect have sunk down the Lord Jesus Christ,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60037:33"/>
when laid upon him, had he not been God, but a meer Man. How doth <hi>David</hi> cry out of the burden of his Sins?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 3 &amp; 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Mine Iniquities are gone over mine Head, as an heavy burden, they are too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for me.</hi> Nay, my Brethren, when our Sins were laid upon our Lord Jesus Christ, and he began to bear, and feel the weight of them, tho he was God, how did he cry out? <hi>and he began to be sore amazed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33, 34.</note> and said, <hi>My Soul is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sorrowful, even unto Death: Tarry ye here and watch, and he went forward a little, and fell on the Ground:</hi> The weight of our Sins and Divine Wrath, brought him down to the Earth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Christ our Mediator must be God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his Suffering, or the purchase of his Blood could not have merited all that Grace and Glory for all God's Elect, which indeed it did. Brethren there is a difference between a full Satisfaction or Payment of Debts, and a Price that is laid down not only to do that, but also to merit and purchase a Right to great Riches, high Priviledges and Honour.</p>
               <p>Now if Christ had only paid our Debts, or satisfied the Justice of God as to his vindictive Vengeance, tho we thereby had been delivered from Hell, yet that Payment could not have raised us up to Heaven; no, it is through the Merits of that Infinite Price Christ laid down, that we come to be the Sons of God, and Heirs of Glory; and all this is through the Dignity of his Person, and infinite Value and Worth of his Purchase, as being God; and also as it was the Grant of God the Father to Christ, in the Covenant of Peace, as the result of those Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60037:33"/>4. He must be God, because otherwise he could not have subdued, and overcome all his and our Enemies: What meer Man is able to wrestle with, and overcome <hi>Satan,</hi> and all the Powers of Darkness? Or how could he have prevailed against Death?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.14</note> Overcome and have subdued Death? <hi>I will ransom them from the Power of the Grave: I will redeem them from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plague; O Grave, I will be thy Destruction.</hi> And hence Christ says, <hi>Destroy this Temple,</hi>

                  <hi>awd in three Days I will raise it up again.</hi> This he could not have done except he had been the Eternal God. Now this is sometimes attributed to the whole Trinity, sometimes to the Father, sometimes to the Holy Ghost, so it is sometimes attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Jesus Christ, which shews, that the three Persons are all but one and the same God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He must be God, in respect of his Work as Mediator in reference to Man; for he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to quicken all God's Elect, (who in the <hi>first</hi> Adam <hi>were dead in Sins and Trespasses</hi>) and raise them from that Spiritual Death,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">II. Jesus Christ also as Mediator of Peace,<note place="margin">Christ must be Man.</note> 
                  <hi>must be Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He must be Man, because he must work out a Righteousness in the same Nature that had sined, Man was obliged to keep the Law perfectly; and this must be done by Man, if ever he be Justified with God;<note place="margin">

in the Covenant of Peace to be done in the Person of every elect Sinner,' but in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, who is the Representative of every one of them. For as we were all made Sinners by one Man, as the Head and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of all his Seed, so we became Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the compleat and perfect Obedience of one Man, as the Head and Representative of all his Seed; for as the Law being broken by one Man, is imputed to all his Seed, so the Law being compleatly kept by one Man, Jesus Christ, is imputed to all his Seed: <hi>For as by one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>so by the Obedience of one, shall many be made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> Moreover, Justice required that the same Nature that broke the Law, should keep the Law, tho room for a Substitute, or Surety, was reserved in the Wisdom and Council of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Christ must be Man, because he must die; now God as God (I mean the Godhead) could not die; Man must die to satisfie offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for the Breach of the Law; therefore Christ must be Man and die: And by Vertue of the Union of the Divine Nature with the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in his Person, the Death of Christ was a full Satisfaction to the Justice of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He must be one with us, or else how could his Obedience be imputed to us? For as our Sins was imputed to him, so his Righteousness is imputed to us.</p>

               <p n="3">(3.) Had Christ not been God-man, how could there been two Parties Covenanting with each other about making of our Peace: For Christ-God, the second Person, could not constitute a Party distinct from God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered essentially <hi>one: I and my Father are one</hi>;<note place="margin">Ark of the Covenant, p. <hi>76.</hi>

               <p>I shall now proceed to shew you what a Mediator signifies, and so open the Work of Christ as Mediator.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Mediator properly signifies a Midler, a middle Man, a Reconciler,<note place="margin">Job <hi>9.33.</hi> The Work of Christ as Media<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tor.</note> or <hi>a Days Man that lays his Hands upon both,</hi>

and a like related unto both, he being God and Man in one Person, he is a meet and a proper Reconciler of God to Man, and of Man to God. <hi>For there is one Mediator between God and Men,</hi>

Damnation, but this Gospel I understand not; I know no Covenant of Peace but that which Christ made with the Father; and it is his Work as Mediator to bring poor Sinners to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Terms of Peace agreed on in order to their personal and actual Interest in the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the said Covenant, Christ must change the Sinners Heart by the infusing of his Spirit, and so unite the Soul to himself, by which means he brings the Sinner into the Bonds of the Covenant: The outward means is indeed the Preaching of the Gospel, but the inward and effectual means, is the efficacious Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy Spirit; and he that saith it is in the Power of Man's Will to make his Peace, or to lay hold of the Covenant, takes the Work of Christ's Mediation out of his Hand, and the Crown from off his Head.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. A Mediatour many times meets with great trouble, and Difficulties in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to make Peace; and what trouble hath Jesus Christ met with? And what Sorrow hath he undergone from Devils, from Men, nay, and from Divine Justice, and incensed Wrath, when he put himself in our Law place? What Reproaches and Temptations did attend him? What Tears did he shed? What Anguish did he feel? And what a Bloody Agony did he pass under? And what a Painful und Shameful Death did he Die? And also what Opposition and Resistance, Scorn and Contempt doth he daily still meet with from Sinners? Oh! how averse are Men to accept of Peace and Reconciliation with God by Christ? Some contemn his Blood,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60037:41"/>
rendring it as an empty and carnal thing, and think to obtain Peace by another Christ; a Christ within, even by the Law or Light in their Hearts: Others by a new Law, or by their Faith and Sincere Obedience.—Moreover, some value the League they have made with Sin, Hell, and Death, and will not nullifie that, but esteem that Covenant before and above this Covenant of Peace, made between the Father and Son, and confirmed by Christ's Blood. But I can proceed no further at this time.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Christ a Mollifying Mediator.</note>XII. A Mediator must be of a <hi>mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temper,</hi> indeavouring to bring both Parties to terms of Peace, the one not to stand up to the uttermost rigour of Justice further than is absolute requisite, nor the other to remain stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and obstinate.</p>
               <p>Now Jesus Christ the Mediator of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peace in this infinitely excelled all that ever undertook such an Office.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How Mollifying was his Temper towards God? True, he well knew God could not in point of Justice, considering his Infinite Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Rectitude of his Nature, and the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Law, abate any thing; no, not one Farthing of the whole Debt, but must have full Satisfaction; yet Christ brought the Majesty of God to accept of his Mediation and Suretiship for us; and O how did God condescend to him herein, who might have vigorously exacted a full Satisfaction from the Sinner himself, and not to have admitted of a Substitute for him! But the Blessed Mediator prevails with God to accept of Payment from his Hands instead of a Personal Satisfaction made by the Sinner; God yields to Jesus Christ, and accepts of Payment or Satisfaction from his Hands; not in our Persons, but in the Person of his Son as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60037:42"/>
for tho the Father might make the first Proposal of this to his Son, yet 'tis by Christ's Undertaking that God is pacified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>He was made a Curse for us, therefore as by the Offence of one Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation, so by the Righteousness of one, the Free-gift came upon all Men unto Justification of Life.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>For as by one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners; so by the Obedience of one shall many be made Righteous.</hi> As <hi>Adam</hi> brought us into Debt, and made us obnoxious to Divine Wrath, so Jesus Christ hath paid our Debts by his active Obedience to God's Law, and by bearing that Wrath on his Soul and Body which our Sins had brought upon us;<note place="margin">Isa. <hi>53.8.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. See how the Mediator prevails with God, for instead of God's demanding an inherent Righteousness, a Righteousness wrought out in our Persons; he accepts of an Imputed Righteousness wrought out in the Person of his own Son in our Nature as Mediator,<note place="margin">

               <p>So, my Brethren, will the Lord Jesus Christ, after long Patience, and Forbearance, leave all Obstinate, Rebellious, and Unbelieving Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to the Severity of the Law of God which they have broken, and to the Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God; <hi>He that believeth not,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. We infer likewise from hence, that the Love of Jesus Christ was wonderful, and his Condescention exceeding great: What, did God take our Nature into Union with himself?

                  <p>And thus is <hi>Popery</hi> revived amongst us, and Justification by Works asserted by these Law and Work-mongers, for I cannot call them Gospel-Ministe-s; true, they affirm that Christ died for our good, but not in our stead; the Doctrine we maintain, is, that he died for our good; But how for our good? Even so, that he suffered as our Head and Representative in our <hi>stead</hi> or <hi>room, the Just for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust,</hi> or the Surety for the Principal, or for the Sinner; and this according to the Terms agreed upon in the Covenant of Peace, (and not simply for our good any otherwise) God being in his own Nature <hi>Just,</hi> as well as <hi>Gracious,</hi> could not without Wrong, or Injury to his <hi>Justice, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and the <hi>Sanction of his Law</hi> Acquit, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie and Pardon any Sinner, without a full Satisfaction to both Law, and Justice, and this must either be done by us, or by our Surety for us.</p>

                  <p>Christ did not come to engage, or undertake as a Mediator, that we should perfectly in our own Persons, keep the Moral Law, and so be Justified in God's Sight; nor did he come to undertake that we should sincerely keep any other Law to that end; much less, leave us to the exercise of our Natural, or Spiritual Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to keep such a Law, as the Condition of our Justification, and Acceptation with God; but he came to procure for us such a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by his own Obedience and Suffering, that the Holiness, Justice, and Law of God doth require of us if we are Justified with God, for <hi>what the Law could not do,</hi>

a hard case, my Brethren, that these degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or any pretending to be Gospel-Preachers, should deny Christ to be a Common Head and Surety for the Elect; for he that dies in the stead and room of others, is by the consent of the Law-giver substituted in their Law place, and so takes upon him the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a Surety, Representative, or common Person, undertaking to do, and suffer what others should, but these Men deny this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Capacity of Christ as a Surety, in this Sense, and therefore deny he obeyed and died in our stead.

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Now, say I, this confounds Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with Sanctification; and as I have told him,<note place="margin">See Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um betwixt two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.</note> then it also follows that Believers are partly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and partly condemned, <hi>i. e.</hi> we are not acquitted from the guilt of all Sin, whilst in this World, and so Christ's <hi>Dove</hi> is not <hi>

                  <p n="2">2. We say, that we are made Partakers of Christ's Righteousness, and the Benefits of it, by our Union with him through the Spirit, by which means Faith is wrought in us, by which we apprehend him; and we say, that Faith is an Instrument whereby we receive him, Faith only Justifying us objectively, <hi>i. e.</hi> It is not Faith, but Jesus Christ that Faith takes hold of, that doth Justifie us in the Sight of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Answ.</hi> Tho Christ was obliged, as our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to fulfil the Covenant of Works, or of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience; yet he was not Surety of the Covenant of Works, because he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, that we should perfectly keep the Law in our own Persons, which he must have done, had he been Surety of the Law of Works, but that he would keep that Law for us; and therefore it was another and better Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant of Works was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man, without a Surety; the Covenant of Grace is made betwixt God the Father, and Jesus Christ as our Surety for us; therefore another and better Covenant.</p>
               <p>These Men plead for a Covenant of Grace made betwixt God and us, distinct from the Covenant of Redemption; in which, Christ, as our Surety, engaged that we shall keep the New Law of Faith, and sincere Obedience; Christ having abolished the Law of perfect Obedience, and merited this mild Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Answ.</hi> Tho the Law as a Covenant of Works, <hi>Do this and Live,</hi> is taken away; yet as a Law, or Rule of perfect Obedience, it remains for ever: As the Reverend Mr. <hi>Cross,</hi> hath fully proved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to their New Law, it brings in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Works; and such Works too, that are attended with Sin, or Imperfections; and therefore their Doctrine is to be abhorred.

                     <hi>How the Suretiship of Christ differs from that
among Men.</hi>
                  </note>1. A Surety among Men, is not of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor's, but of the Debtor's procurement.</p>
               <p>But the Surety of the Covenant of Peace, was of God's procurement, who is Man's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, or rather offended Creator; God as an Act of Infinite Wisdom, Love, and Mercy, found him; <hi>I have found a Ransom.</hi> Moreover, the Father Chose him, Called him, and Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to be the Mediator and Surety of this Covenant, as hath been fully proved: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not follow, that so soon as our Surety struck Hands, or just when he laid down the Price, all God's Elect must actually be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited.</p>
               <p>For should a Creditor find a Surety for the Debtor, all must confess it is in his choice how and when the Debtor should be actually acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moreover, 'tis evident, that we had no actual Existence when Christ struck Hands for us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it was for such that he foresaw would fall under Sin, Wrath, and Condemnation, and Christ did not become a Surety to keep the Elect from falling under Wrath, and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, but to recover them out of that State; Justification presupposeth we were once Charged and Condemned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Surety and Debtor among Men, both enter into the same Bond, and the Debtor is look'd upon the principal Bondsman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:60037:64"/>But Christ's single Bond, in this Covenant, is accepted for all; here is a Change of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, God leaves out our Names, and puts in Christ's Name, that the Debt, Satisfaction, and Curse might fall upon him alone. See Dr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, Christ set forth, p.</hi> 52. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.5.</note> 
                  <hi>He was made Sin for us—Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us; he was wounded for our Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>—And now Jesus Christ here by puting his Name unto this Bond, is become the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Debtor, and is wholly obliged to pay, and satisfie for all the Sins of God's Elect; his Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship hath swallowed up the offending Debtors Obligation, to satisfie Law and Justice.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Doth it not then follow, we need not be concerned to keep or fulfil the Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We are not to be concerned to keep the Law to that end Christ kept it, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to be Justified by it, for so it is removed; but the Moral Law, as a perfect Rule of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, obligeth us to perpetual Obedience, it being so unchangable a Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Among Men, when the Surety makes a full satisfaction for Debtors, the said Debtors cannot be said to receive their Release, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, as an Act of Grace and Favour, but as an Act of Justice only.</p>
               <p>But Jesus Christ, in the Covenant of Peace, makes full Satisfaction for us, and yet we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Release and Discharge as an Act of Grace and Favour alone.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that God and not we found the Surety, which was an Act of his own Sovereign Grace, he being wholly at Liberty, whether he would save Man, or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60037:65"/>So that our Discharge through the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, must needs primarily and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally flow out of pure Grace, Favour, Love and Pity of God to us.</p>
               <p>Had Man found the Surety, it had been otherwise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because the Surety being the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, it is a farther Demonstration of Infinite Love and Favour to us, in that God should substitute him in our stead, and dispence with the rigorous Action of Satisfaction from us, and take it from our Surety, as put in our Law-place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because God, that he might work about our Discharge, in a way of Grace and Mercy, to the Honour of his Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made his own Son a Sacrifice for our Sins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because that Interest we have in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Pardon, Peace, and Reconciliation by Christ's Undertakings, is freely bestowed on us, as an Act of God's Sovereign Grace and Goodness, for as Christ purchased all Grace for us, so as an Act of God's Favour, and Christ's Purchase and Merits, he gives us the Spirit and Faith, in order to our actual Interest in all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Blessings; so that altho it all is in a way of Justice as to Christ, yet it is all in a way of Mercy and Free-Grace as to us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In that God accepted of Christ as a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for us who deserved no Pity, we having wilfully forefeited our vast Inheritance, and were become his Vile Enemies, and rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:60037:65"/>6. Because Christ became our Surety, from whom he could expect no after Recompence, or Satisfaction for that vast Sum he laid down for us, he never expected any Recompence from us for the Debt paid.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Because we are not only pardoned, and have Peace, but by Christ's Undertaking, are raised to great Honour: And O what Grace, Love, and Divine Goodness is here!</p>

               <p>I have shewed you <hi>First,</hi> That in a Covenant of Peace there is a treating betwixt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting Parties about the Terms upon which it is made: And accordingly in order to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or bringing in of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> you have heard that there was a treating between the Father, and the Son before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>

                  </note> I shall now proceed to the next thing, which is the <hi>Ratification,</hi> or <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, there was a twofold Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It was confirmed by God in Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.</note> and this was, as I conceive, in that Council of Peace that was held in Eternity betwixt them both: True, among Men this is called,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Signing of the Articles of Peace</hi>; but there was a full Confirmation of this Covenant, when it was Agreed on, and Signed, and that by both Parties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Father Confirmed it to Christ, and to all the Elect in him, by his Oath;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.3.</note> 
                  <hi>I have made a Covenant with my Chosen, I have sworn unto</hi> David <hi>my Servant:</hi> By <hi>David</hi> is meant Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; and I see no reason to doubt, but that this Oath of God the Father to the Son, as Mediator of our Peace, passed to him before the World began; <hi>Once have I sworn by my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 35.</note> 
                  <hi>that I will not lye unto</hi> David.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, when God concluded this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peace with Jesus Christ, he made a Promise to him of performing all things which he agreed unto; and evident it is, that this was before the World began;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.</note> 
                  <hi>In hope of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which God that cannot lye promised, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began.</hi> And as it was promised then to Christ, as the Head and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all the Elect, on their behalf; so there is the same Parity of Reason to believe, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60037:68"/>
then the Oath of God passed to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to us in him also; and now this Promise and Oath of God to Christ, gives not only Solemnity, but also firm and sure Stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this Covenant</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He added his Oath to his Promise (saith <hi>our late Annotator</hi> on the Holy Bible) to make,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pool's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations on Psal.</hi> 89.35.</note> and prove it to be Immutable: Hence Christ, it is said, was made a Priest by an Oath, not after the Order of <hi>Aaron</hi>:</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) God swore by his Holiness; What is more Sacred? By which God is seldom known to speak, or to swear; therefore nothing can more fully confirm this Covenant to Christ, and to us in him.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Jesus Christ then confirmed also the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on his part; on our behalf, by his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Hand in our stead, and to stand in our Law-place for us, as you have heard: This, my Brethren, was more than a bare Signing and Sealing the Covenant of Peace. But—</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is yet a farther Ratification, and Confirmation of the Covenant of Peace, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so there is among Men.</p>

                  </note>1. It was agreed betwixt God the Father, and the Son as Mediator, that this Covenant should come under another Acceptation, <hi>i. e.</hi> as the <hi>Last Will and Testament of Jesus Christ:</hi> True, it was not only Christ's <hi>Will,</hi> or Christ's
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60037:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Covenant and Testament, but the Father's <hi>Will</hi> and Covenant also: Hence the Testament is called, <hi>The Revelation of Jesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>which God gave unto him</hi>; that is, a Mediator: Yet Christ is the Testator, or he that is to dispose of all those rich Legacies which the Father by him, as Mediator, designed to bestow on all his Elect, it is called his Covenant, Testament, or Last Will.</p>
               <p>And now, since the New Covenant was to come under this Character, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's Last Will and Testament; there was a Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity (for many other Reasons) that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant should be Confirmed and Ratified by his Death <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p n="1">1. A Testator signifies a Disposer;<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. It denotes, that a Dying Person, who to confirm his Will and Testament; there is a Necessity of his Death, and thus Christ as a Testator, died by virtue of those Covenant Transactions betwixt God the Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on the behalf of God's Elect; <hi>Where a

                  <hi>there must also of necessity be the Death of the Testator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It also denotes, that he the Testator hath, or is Invested with some Estate, and hath a proper Right to dispose of it; Jesus Christ in this Covenant had all the Riches of Grace and Glory given to him as Mediator. See John 13.3. <hi>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his Hands,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover it denotes, that whatsoever he gives as a Testator, is of meer Grace, or of the Good Pleasure of his Will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Also it gives a Just Right to all such (to whom he bequeaths any Legacies) to what is given, so that such may sue out for them as their own.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it imports the Revelation and Declaration of his Will, Love, and Affections to all his Relations and Friends: So did Jesus Christ, in his Last Will and Testament, reveal his Will, Love, and rich Bounty to all God'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To proceed, there are, Beloved, seven or eight things to be considered in the Death of Christ.</p>

               <p>Not, my Brethren, but that all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who lived under the Old Testament, were saved by the Covenant of Grace, Christ was to establish, as I said before: Yet was not the Old Covenant actually taken away till Christ died, the latter Covenant is called an Everlasting Covenant; not, I say again, that the first, as to Righteousness, is ceased, or disannulled; no, but as a Covenant of Works, requiring perfect Righteousness of us in our own Persons, if ever we are Justified in God's Sight; but that the perfect Obedience which Law required of us is transmitted to another Head, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Christ Jesus, who having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered all its Demands in point of Obedience and Righteousness, so that <hi>He is the end of the Law,</hi>

               <p n="2">II.

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>God sent forth his own Son in the likeness of sinful Flesh—To Redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Death of Christ was that Price by which all Grace is purchased for us; for tho we have all Covenant Grants, and Blessings freely given to us, or merely of God's Free Grace, yet Faith, a New Heart, Regeneration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Pardon, and Peace, and all other Grace, and Blessings here, and Glory hereafter were all purchased for us by the Death of Christ; for as you heard Christ did more than pay our Debts.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Christ's Death was the Pacifying, or Atoneing Sacrifice, his Precious Blood quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fire of God's Wrath, and so it is the only way by which we come to be delivered from Hell: Our <hi>Jonah</hi> was cast over-board to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60037:71"/>
make a Calm, and caused the Storm of Divine Vengeance to cease.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And more directly to our present Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; I say again, the Death of Christ was to ratifie and confirm the Covenent.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Moreover, the Death of Christ was not only to confirm the Covenant of Peace it self, but to confirm all Covenant Grants, Covenant Blessings, and Covenant Promises also; for had not the Testator died, none could sue for any Legacy therein bequeathed to them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, also the Holy Ghost is appointed to be the Executioner of this Covenant; or, of the Last Will and Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>How much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself to God; Purge your Consciences from Dead Works, to serve the true living God.</hi> It is the same Spirit of Jesus that offered up his Body, that applies his Blood, and makes it efficacious to us, and also puts us into the Possession of the Inheritance purchased for us.</p>
               <p>And <hi>for this Cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of Death, that they which are called, might receive the Promise of the Eternal Inheritance</hi>; That is, through his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, and the Agency of the Holy Spirit, the Effects of his Sacrifice might become effectual to all the Elect, <hi>viz.</hi> to their Justification, Vocation, Sanctification, and Glorification.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Will</hi> of Man had been left, or substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to be the Executioner of Christ's Last Will and Testament, not one Soul might have been saved, or if otherwise, yet all the Glory

would not have then redown'd to Jesus Christ, but one great part thereof to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <q>The <hi>Messiah</hi> answered; Lord of the World, I joyfully take them upon me, and Charge my self with their Torment, but upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that thou shalt quicken the Dead; God, saith this <hi>Rabbi,</hi> granted him this, and from that time the <hi>Messiah</hi> charged himself with all kinds of Torments.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. Because the Gospel only shews us how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is made between an offended God, and offending Creatures; and no otherways is this revealed, or made known to Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">II.

It is, my Brethren, an Instrument of his Power, or a powerful means ordained of God to this purpose, it having an excellent and efficacious Influence attending it through the Spirit where it is proclaimed and received. My Brethren, Faith, Regeneration, Convertion, or Holiness, do not reconcile us to God; no, no, nothing doth that but the Blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And this I might make appear,</p>

                     <hi>For when we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi> Hence we are said <hi>to be Justified by his Blood</hi>; that is, <hi>Meritoriously,</hi> yet <hi>Materially</hi> it is by his Active, as well as his Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because our Reconciliation on God's part, I mean his being Reconciled to us, is antecedent to Faith, Regeneration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> your Faith doth not make your Peace, tho it be an Instrument by which you receive that Atonement that Christ hath made,</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. Nay, my Brethren, Justification is the Effects of Reconciliation; for had not Christ satisfied Divine Justice for us, we had not been pronounced Just, or Righteous in him; the Prisoner is acquited as the Effects of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Debts, his believing his Debts are paid, and the Law and justice satisfied, doth not pay his Debts; tho a Sinner is not in his own Person actually discharged, until he doth believe, or leastwise in his own Conscience.</p>

                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60037:74"/>True, Jesus Christ, as Mediator, doth both these; <hi>i. e.</hi> he pays our Debts, and knocks off our Chains; he makes the Atonement, and sprinkles the Blood upon our Consciences by his Spirit; if Reconciliation was the bending of our Hearts to God, to believe in him, and love him, why should Faith and Sanctification be laid down as the End and Effect of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:<note place="margin">

A Proclamation is Written, nay Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it may be read, and known of all Men; so God, in his Providence, hath caused his Gospel to be Printed, that it may be read and known to all to whom it is sent; it was first Written as Holy Men speak, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; and since it has been Printed also.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Proclamations are not put into a Book, I say, I think that is not usually done, to be kept for after Times upon Record, but the Gospel, or good News to Sinners, or this Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is put into a Book, for all succeeding Ages, and Generations to know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>

                  <p>But let me add one thing more here, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were different ways of proclaiming this News of Peace, by Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was first proclaimed to <hi>Adam,</hi> upon his Fall, by the Promise of <hi>the Seed of the Woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>Abraham</hi> it was proclaimed in these Words, i. e. <hi>In thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be Blessed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.</note>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> saith, God Preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Jacob</hi> by the coming of <hi>Shilo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>Moses,</hi> by a Prophet that God would raise up of their Brethren, like unto him; and by Types and Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>David,</hi> by a Promise of a Son to <hi>Sit</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne, and by a Covenant made with him, as a Type of Christ.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Prophets</hi> many ways very clearly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:60037:76"/>But in the New Testament Times more fully and clearer then ever; before it was hid, as it were, but the Vision is now opened, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things, things long kept secret, are plainly revealed; <hi>We behold with open Face:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</note> Many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Kings, desired to see and hear what we see and hear, but saw, and heard them not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Proclamation doth not usually contain the Sum of all the Articles of Peace, nor give an Account of all the Gifts, Grants, Blessings, and Priviledges thereof. But this Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Gospel doth publish and make known to all the World, the Summ of all the Articles of this <hi>Covenant of
Peace</hi>; together with all the great Gifts, Grants, Blessings, and Priviledges thereof: In the Gospel we read of the Council, Compact, and Eternal Purpose of God, concerning of all those Covenant Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions that were betwixt the Father and the Son from Eternity, which were hid, or kept secret until this Proclamation came forth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Proclamation of Peace doth not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly give an account of all the horrid Crimes and Offenders that are by virtue thereof, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardoned upon their coming in; for such a Proclamation is rather put out by a Prince to reclaim Stubborn Rebbels, in which their Names are inserted; but this Proclamation, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Gospel, proclaims Free Pardon for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sins, Iniquities, and Transgressions; and to all the vilest Traitors, Enemies and Rebbels against the Eternal God; as to all <hi>Swearers, Lyars, Drunkards, Harlots,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Bless God for the Gospel, that ever this Proclamation came to your Ears, Peace is proclaimed to you this Day, to you Sinners! What do you say? Do you resolve to throw down your Arms and come in? 'Tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what kind of Rebbels you have been: Here's a Pardon <hi>for all Sins and Blasphemy</hi> (in this Proclamation) <hi>committed against the Father and Son,</hi> and but one sort of Sinners are excluded, and but one Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this Good News? Do you believe it? And is it in your Hearts to take hold of the Promises of the Gospel? What Answer shall I return to him that sent me.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. This informs us of the Necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, I mean of the Gospel; for without this Proclamation had been published, the way of Peace could not be known, or without such a way of Revelation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Moral Law written in the two Tables, reveals nothing of this Peace made by Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60037:77"/>2. The Law or Light within all Mankind, reveals nothing of it, tho that convicts of Sin, yet it reveals nothing of a Saviour.</p>
                  <p>The Moral Law and Light, in all, discovers a God, but no Christ, no Mediator: What doth the <hi>Pagan</hi> World know of this Covenant of Peace? Or of this Mediator, or of this Proclamation? What will those <hi>Arch Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> say to this, who Talk of the Light within, and boldly affirm, That they should have known by a Christ within, as much as they do now, if the Word had never been written; But why then do not the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> know it, who have the same Light in them? And why can't they tell us, <hi>What those other things are that Jesus Christ did, that are not written?</hi> Believe them not:<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">II. Jesus Christ hath substituted, ordained, or appointed others under him, for him, and in his stead to be his Ambassadors of this Peace:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Who are they?</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Answ.</hi> Negatively, they are not the Holy Angels, tho it is true, the Angels brought the Good News of his Arrival, or first coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and also proclaimed <hi>Glory to God on high, on Earth Peace, Good Will to Men:</hi> Yet these he hath not appointed to be his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of Peace: No, no, they are Men, or Gospel-Ministers.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:60037:80"/>2. Yet Negatively, they are not all which are called Gospel-Ministers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some are <hi>Legal Ministers,</hi> Preachers of a Law, who know not what they say, nor what they affirm, yet not Preachers only of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, but of a New Law, turning the Gospel, or Free Promise of God, and Eternal Life (to such that believe in Jesus) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Law of <hi>Imperfect Faith, and Sincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as the Matter and Condition of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God; and indeed they seem to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Perfect Law of God, as if that was abolished, and a new Law, or Rule of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence procured by Christ's Merits in its room.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not such that only Preach Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or Morality, tho Christ's Ministers Preach this; yet to Preach this, is not to Preach Christ and Peace to lost Sinners; neither is this the great Doctrine contained in their <hi>Mission,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2.</note> but Christ only, and him Crucified.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not such that are Ministers of Man's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that come to their Ministry as Men come to Trades, who perhaps never knew Christ themselves, or were ever Converted: Can such be Christ's Ministers?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not such that Preach the Moral Law, as it is written in Mens Hearts, or that call the Light or Law that is in all Men, the <hi>true Christ of God</hi>; no, these are Deceivers, and <hi>Satan</hi> in them hath transformed himself into an Angel of Light.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Not such that deny the Godhead of Christ and his atoning Sacrifice, or that Satisfaction he gave to the Law and Justice of God.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:60037:81"/>

               <p n="2">II. Affirmatively, they are such that Christ hath Regenerated, and graciously Qualified, by giving them Grace and Ministeral Gifts, and are also authorized by him, to proclaim the Covenant of Peace. Let me open this a little.</p>
               <p>Every Ambassador must have a Regular Mission, or be Authorized, or Impowered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be imployed in that high Place and Trust:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15.</note> And so it is here, <hi>How shall they Preach except they be sent?</hi> That is, duly, or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, and to the Profit of the People. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ought to be Converted Persons; and also to be Members of some true Church or Churches of Jesus Christ, and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Persons; for Christ himself, till he was Baptized, did not enter upon the Work of his Ministry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They must pass the Probation of that Church, with whom they are Members, and receive a Regular Call from them to Preach God's Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover, they that are regularly called and authorized, and every ways compleat and orderly Ambassadors,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3.</note> must be Ordained by Prayer and Imposition of Hands,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</note> by the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p n="3">III. An Ambassador is a Person of Eminency and Honour in his Prince's Sight, they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Prince's Person; so is Christ's true
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60037:81"/>
and faithful Minister; he is one that Christ confers great Dignity and Honour upon, tho many of Christ's true Ministers have but little Honour from Men, nor are they accounted Honourable Ones by the World, but they are notwithstanding, <hi>Stars in Christ's Right Hand,</hi> and are called <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches. Yet what saith <hi>Paul? You see your Calling, Brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>how that not many Wise Men after the Flesh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are called: But God hath chosen the Foolish things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and base things of the World, and things despised:</hi> That is, Persons of no Esteem in the Eyes of the World, yet they represent Christ's Person, which is no small Dignity.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Some Ambassadors are Ambassadours of Peace, to perswade Enemies to accept of Terms of Peace, and to lay down their Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Ministers of Christ are Ambassadors of Peace, not to reconcile God to Men, but Men to God;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as tho God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> Man naturally is in a State of Enmity against God; and this way, through the Workings of the Holy Spirit by the Word, they come to be reconciled unto God.</p>
               <p n="5">V. An Ambassador of Peace is a Joyful Messenger, so are the true Ministers of Jesus Christ: <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 52.7.</note> 
                  <hi>are the Feet of him that bringeth good Tidings, that publisheth Peace, that bringeth good Tydings of Good, that publisheth Salvation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Ambassador is a welcome Messenger,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60037:82"/>
if he comes with Tidings of Peace from a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable and powerful <hi>Prince,</hi> whose Arms are irresistable, or whose force is unconquerable, and hath also been justly incensed, enraged, and stirred up to Wrath. My Brethren, the Consideration of this renders the Ambassadors of Christ, most Joyful and Welcome Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, where they come and proclaim Peace, because the great God is an irresistable Enemy, Who is a Match for him? And he is also justly incensed and stirred up to Wrath, by all Ungodly Persons:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth, the Lord revengeth and is furious, the Lord will take Vengeance on his Adversaries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and he reserveth Wrath for his Enemies—The Mountains quake at him, the Hills melt, and the Earth is burnt at his Presence, the World, and all that dwell therein:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Who can stand before his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? And who can abide the fierceness of his Anger?</hi> He is an amazing Warriour, he can shake the Heavens by his Voice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 24.8.</note> 
                  <hi>And cause the Mountains to tremble before him; with God is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Majesty, he is the Lord mighty in Battel:</hi> He causeth the Earth to fear, and the Inhabitants thereof to melt away, so that the Men of might cannot find their Hands: He can make <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> as Stubble to his Bow, and mighty Kings as Chaff before the Whirlwind: He makes <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> with his Black Guards, to quiver and fly into Darkness to hide themselves: He cuts off the Spirit of Princes, and Triumphs over the greatest and proudest Monarchs: <hi>Alexander, Pompey, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> have all yielded to this Invincible Conqueror;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60037:82"/>
and so shall in a short time the Proud and Haughty Tyrant <hi>Lewis le Grand:</hi> If God shows but his Finger on the Wall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.5.</note> he makes proud <hi>Belshazzar</hi> to quake; nay, he can employ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate Creatures to terrifie and destroy <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and his mighty Hosts. O how joyful then must those Tidings be, to hear that such a King, such an Enemy is reconciled to us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Ambassador of Peace, is welcome to a People who lie under heavy Burdens, or are in fearful Bondage, Slavery, and Misery, and have no power to save, or relieve themselves; for such, I say, to hear of Liberty, or of a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Peace declaring their Freedom, and that for ever, who had once been a Free People, but lost it; this renders such an Ambassador welcome indeed!</p>
               <p>Now this is the State of all Mankind: What Slaves? What Vassals of Sin and Satan are all Ungodly Mortals? Their Eyes put out, their Robes rent from them, their Souls wounded, and nothing but loathsome Sores from the Crown of their Head, to the Sole of their Feet; and fed with nothing but <hi>Ashes, Chaff, Husks,</hi> and <hi>Gravel Stones,</hi> and laid under the Sentence of Death, being Cursed by God, or by his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law, and Condemned to be Burnt alive, or to lie in Everlasting Flames ever dying, and yet can never die. O! How welcome is the News an Ambassador of Christ brings to such a People, who see this is their State, and yet are by him delivered!</p>
               <p n="3">3. An Ambassador of Peace is welcome, if he comes to offer Peace from a Prince that is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60037:83"/>
Faithful, and true to his Word and Covenant; and one that can give good Security as to what he agrees to, or Covenants to perform.</p>
               <p>Now the Ministers, or Ambassadors of Christ, come from the Faithful God of Heaven and Earth, who never did, nor can fail in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant nor Promises, to any Person, or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>He is Faithful, and cannot deny,</hi> i. e. He can as soon cease to be God, as cease to be True and Faithful: Hence all Covenant-Blessings come to be so firm and sure;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>In hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot lie, promised before the World began:</hi> Besides, he hath given good Security, even his own <hi>Oath,</hi> he <hi>hath Sworn to his Covenant by his Holiness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. An Ambassador is welcome, if he comes to offer Peace on easie Terms.—Now</p>
               <p>The Terms upon which God offers Peace, you have heard, are very easie; true, on his part, our Peace was made on hard Terms, it was by the Blood of his own Son: Had he said you shall have Peace upon a Sacrifice of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Rams, or Ten Thousand Rivers of Oyl, that might seem hard; or if you would Offer your First-born in Sacrifice, or run your Knife into his Throat, and let out his Hearts Blood, you would think those hard Terms; but it is not your First-born, but his First-born, whose Blood must be let out to make your Peace; you are but to look to him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.3.</note> trust in Christ: <hi>Hear and your Souls shall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What tho Faith will launch the Plague Sore, and let out all the Filth and Corruptions of your Polluted Hearts; will a Man think that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60037:83"/>
is a Cure on too hard Terms? Sirs, the Spirit will cause you to vomit up that Poyson that you have taken down; But is that too hard to save the Life of your Immortal Souls? Is it hard to tell a Man he must give up the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor he has harboured in his House? If he would have the King's Pardon, or possess that Peace purchased by the Blood of his own Dear Son.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That Love and Respect People shew to an Ambassador, a Prince looks upon, as shewed to himself, because the Ambassador represents his Person, and that Contempt which is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Ambassador, he takes as cast on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>So Jesus Christ takes the Honour, Love, and Respect which is shewed to his Faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as if it was shewed to him, and the same Dishonour done to them, as if it was done to himself; <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16</note> 
                  <hi>and he that despiseth you despiseth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. An Ambassador is to do his uttermost, in order to accomplish his Ambassy, and to bring the King's Enemies to accept of Peace.</p>
               <p>So are Christ's Ministers, they are to pray, to intreat, to beseech Sinners to be reconciled to God; <hi>We pray you in Christ's stead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> besought them with Tears, Faithful Ministers are willing to spend their Lives to win Souls to Christ, yea, to die upon the spot to save one poor Sinner; <hi>Knowing the Terror of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>we perswade Men.</hi> Our Great Master thought not his Blood too dear to make our Peace, and shall Ministers think their Strength, their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60037:84"/>
Lives, their Blood too much, that so they might see the Travel of Christ's Soul; I mean, Sinners reconciled unto God, or Christ's Blood by Faith sprinkled on their Hearts: Many like the Minister's Dignity, but few like their Work and Duty. My Brethren, it is a great Trust that is committed to them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26.</note>1. The Charge of the Souls of Men that are more worth than all the World, is committed to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The wonderful Worth of Gospel Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Truth is a rich Treasure; <hi>We have this Treasure in Earthen Vessels,</hi> this is committed to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis the Ambassy of that Peace which was made by the Blood of the Son of God, that is committed to them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 20.29.</note>4. <hi>The Charge of the Church</hi> of God, which he hath purchased with his own Blood, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. An Ambassador is to keep close or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to his Instructions, or to the Words of his Commission, not to add to it, alter it, or diminish from it, on pain of incurring his Prince's highest Displeasure; so must Christ's Ambassadors keep close to their Commission; <hi>Add thou not to his Word, least he reprove thee, and thou art found a Lyar</hi>; they must deliver their whole Message: There is a Curse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to him that adds or diminisheth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They must in all things exalt Jesus Christ, or seek the Honour alone of their Blessed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign: The whole of their Work is to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Christ, exalt Christ; <hi>To Preach Christ the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60037:84"/>
Lord, and themselves but Servants for Jesus sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not magnifie the Creature, nor set the Crown on the Head of the <hi>Will of Man</hi>; but throw the Creature down at Christ's Feet, and to Teach all Men, to account all Things done by them, or in them, in comparison of Christ, but Dung,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10.</note> or Dogs Meat, for thus did <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They are to preach nothing to be Christ's Ordinance, but what he hath instituted, or positively appointed in the New Testament, or Word of God, they must look into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. An Ambassador, if his Soveraign sees he cannot succed in his Work, or that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels will not have Peace, nor lay down their Arms, whilst the White Flag of Mercy is put out; he orders him to proclaim War, and puts forth the Bloody Flag; and nothing but <hi>War, Slaughter,</hi> and <hi>utter Ruine</hi> follows: So when Christ sees that his Ministers cannot prevail with Rebellious Sinners, but that they remain Obstinate and Obdurant, rejecting Peace upon the Terms of this Covenant, or will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be saved, but seek their Peace some other way, or continue in their Sins and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; he orders them <hi>to shake off the Dust of their Feet as a Witness against them,</hi> and so to proclaim War, and such will fall into the Hands of Divine Wrath and Vengeance, and Christ will at the last Day say, <hi>Bring out those mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27.</note> 
                  <hi>who would not that I should Reign over them, and slay them before my Face.</hi> And hence Wrath came on the <hi>Jews</hi> to the uttermost:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60037:85"/>
And saith <hi>Paul, Lo, we leave you, and turn to the</hi> Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="10">X. When an Ambassador is called Home, it is a sign the Patience of his <hi>Prince</hi> is <hi>worn out,</hi> and that he will wait on his Enemies no longer.</p>
               <p>What may'st thou then think, O <hi>London</hi>! Tremble, tremble! for how many Faithful <hi>Ambassadors</hi> in thee, hath God called Home very lately? Thy Day of Grace, thou mayest fear, draws to an end.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. An Ambassador must give an account of his Ambassage to his Prince.</p>
               <p>So Christ likewise will call all his Ministers to give an account to him, how they have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their Work; they must all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Christ; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py will such be, who have been Faithful in all things unto him, and have won many Souls to the Lord Jesus Christ, and have their Accounts to give with Joy.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, there are one or two Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities concerning the Work of other Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and the Ambassadors of Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">

                  </note>1. Other Ambassadors are impowered, to make Peace betwixt States and Kingdoms, or betwixt one Prince and another that are at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, they are not imployed only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Peace, but to make Peace; but this Christ's Ambassadors are not impowered to do, for no Men, nor Angels could make Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man; all the Wisdom and Power of Men and Angels failed here; should the Angels have combined together to have given up all their Riches, Treasures, and their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60037:85"/>
very Beings to God's Justice, they could not have made up that Breach; or should all the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors</hi> of the World have agreed to part with all their Treasures, Kingdoms, and Crowns, but to have redeemed one Sinner from Wrath and Divine Vengeance; nay, to pay off the Debts but of the least Sinner in the World, it would have been contemned by the Holy and Just God.</p>
               <p>Or, should all the Saints that ever lived, have offered up all their Graces, Gifts, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have satisfied for the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Debt any Sinner owed to God, it would have signified nothing.</p>
               <p>Alas, all that Angels have, Men have, or the Saints have, is none of their own, they owe all they have, and are, to God; therefore can spare nothing of it for others to satisfie God's Justice: There was none could make our Peace but Jesus Christ; and Christ's Ministers are therefore to proclaim that Peace which is already made, and endeavour to perswade Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to accept of it on those Terms offered to them, that they may be reconciled to God.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Princes do not meet together to make Peace in their own Persons, but send their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors (who are Men of less Dignity than themselves) to do it, though they receive their Instructions from their Masters; but God and Jesus Christ treated about our Peace in their own Persons, and Christ, as Mediator, made this Peace for us (who as God, is equal with God the Father) as well as he is he Chief and Grand Ambassador, to declare or proclaim it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. This informs us what a high value we should have of the Gospel, since it brings such Blessed News and Tidings to our Ears: O! How do poor People that have suffered by a long and desolating War, who have been ruined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, rejoyce to hear Peace proclaimed; they know not how to express their Joy, and yet know not how long it may be before War may break out again; but here is Peace proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Peace with God, Soul-Peace; Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace, Peace that shall never be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with such who are actually brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bonds of this Covenant; <hi>The Covenant of my Peace shall not be removed, saith the Lord that hath Mercy on thee:</hi>

                        <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.10, 11, 12.44, <hi>to the</hi> 54.</note> Therefore here is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite cause of Joy and Gladness, this is the sounding the Great Jubilee; all Bond-men now have liberty proclaimed, and they shall all be set free that take hold of the Covenant; the Great Jubilee was proclaimed and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with <hi>Musick, Triumph,</hi> and all Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Joy.</p>
                  <p>Now what was that a Type of, but of the Proclamation of Peace in the Gospel? Hence the Gospel it is called,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ps.</hi> 89.15.</note> 
                     <hi>The Joyful Sound:</hi> Is not here cause of Joy? Where are your Hearts? Do they not (as it were) leap in you with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing Joy?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This informs us also of the great and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity of Preaching the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this way only is Peace made known to us, and also how it came to be made.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:60037:86"/>3. This likewise informs us of that great Dignity God hath conferred upon his Faithful Ministers, they represent the Person of Jesus Christ: O what greater Honour than this can be conferr'd on Men?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Moreover, this Title should procure an high and honourable esteem of <hi>Ministers,</hi> (<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> are called <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches) especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such whom they have been Instruments to bring to accept of Peace, should highly value them. Besides, this is also necessary in respect of the good success of their <hi>Ambassage</hi>; tho it is true, People are too subject to make Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constructions what a Minister may speak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account; as if he herein rather sought his own Honour (than in magnifying his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to befriend the Gospel, and to advance the Honour of his Great Master Jesus Christ) and therefore perhaps he is under a Temptation to forbear. Men, for want of Charity, being so ready to interpret it as a Fruit of a Minister's Pride, and of that Ambition or Affection they have of some outward Grandure, and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pomp, which they design to gain by such a magnificent Title: The Apostle himself was sensible of this, but yet would not desist (tho they might count it his Folly) he doth magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Office, 1 Cor. 4.5. <hi>Let Men so account of us as Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of God; and that they judge nothing before the time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It also may inform us what need there is, that Churches take care to choose such to be Pastors, that are Sober, Grave, and Humble Men, and not <hi>Novices, Young</hi> and unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60037:87"/>
Persons,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Least being lifted up with Pride, they fall into the Condemnation of the Devil</hi>; who fell by his Pride, and is ready to tempt others to fall by the same Sin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And O! with what trembling should this Work be undertaken, 'tis a mighty Trust, and Woe to them that seek themselves, and not the Honour of God and Jesus Christ herein.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But some may perhaps say, If Christ will have Ambassadors to treat with Sinners, why doth he not use the Holy Angels, or choose them to this High Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not his Pleasure so to do; the Apostle gives one reason for it; <hi>We have this Treasure in Earthen Vessels.</hi>

                     <hi>and not of us.</hi> And hence, he has not chosen many Wise and Noble among Men, <hi>That no Flesh should glory in his Presence; i. e.</hi> Christ's Ambassadors, or Ministers, being Men, they have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage many Ways above Angels. (1.) They are concerned themselves in the Message they bring, which the Angels are not: What greater Argument to press a Man to Care and Faithfulness, than when his own Interest is concerned in the matter. (2.) Men have a more deep sense arising in their own Hearts upon the account of the Temptations they themselves are subject to. (3.) Because the Sufferings and Troubles that Ministers often meet with for Christ and the Gospel sake, are great Advantages to their Brethren, and others to whom they Preach; had the Holy Angels been the Ambassadors of this Peace, they could
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60037:87"/>
not have been exposed to those Trials, and Reproaches, nor have Sealed to the Truth of their Doctrine with their Blood, they cannot die. (4.) Because the Presence of an Angel might terrifie us, their Glory is so great; or, may be it might create Doubts in us, whether it be a good Angel, or not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This also shews, that Ministers have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Special Commission how and what to Preach, and what Ordinance to Administer; and also that they have a Regular Call to this Office; <hi>How shall they Preach,</hi>

                  </note>1 <hi>Answ.

               <p>So here, Is it true to say, That the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by Christ is Universal, when the greatest part of the World were never Redeemed, but remain under the Power of Sin and Satan? That Redemption which is by Jesus Christ, is from Sin, from the Guilt, Power, and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: And are all Men in the World thus Redeemed?

               <p n="4">4. Will a Man lay down Ten Thousand Pounds, to purchase such or such an Estate, and will he refuse to part with Ten Pounds to take up that Estate to make it sure to himself?</p>
               <p>Brethren, the Gift of Christ for us, <hi>i. e.</hi> his laying down his Life is far the greater Gift; and will he do this, and not give the Gospel to many Nations, nor Faith to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and yet died for them all?

                  <hi>God so loved the World, that he gave his only Begotten Son</hi>; that is, God so loved Sinful Mankind, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, That whosoever believeth on him might not perish, but have everlasting Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>We do not plead for an absolute <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Redemption, but for a Conditional one; that is, so that if all Repent, act Faith, are Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, obey Christ, and are Holy and continue so to the End, they shall be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Is this Gospel? Doth the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace run thus?</p>
               <p n="1">1. I argue then that Christ is but a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Redeemer, and hath only made a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Peace; <hi>i. e.</hi> he made our Peace, and paid our Debts upon this Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> That we Repent, change our own Hearts, or are Regenerated, and get Faith, and sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and continue Holy and Obedient to the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, this Notion of a Conditional Peace, and Redemption, renders our Salvation not to be of God's Free Grace alone, through that Redemption that is in Jesus Christ, but that we procure our Peace, or make it with God our selves, <hi>with our own Money, i. e.</hi> by
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60037:93"/>
our <hi>Repentance, Faith, Holiness, and final Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>; and that Christ only merited or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased this Grant, that our Money, <hi>i. e.</hi> our Faith, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should go for good Coin in Heaven, and procure our Justification, Peace, and Eternal Life for us—And thus the Glory that we are saved would not belong to God and Jesus Christ alone; true, that we might be saved, we may thank God and Christ; God, by the Death of his Son, is made reconcilable, but that we are saved, we may thank our selves, Christ doing no more for us that are saved, than he did for them that perish—but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we had more Wit and Care than they had; <hi>i. e.</hi> for by improving our common Grace, God was obliged to give us his Special Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. After this Notion Christ might be, or might not be a Redeemer at all; our Peace might, or might not be made with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it wholly dependeth upon the <hi>Will of Man, Man's Will</hi> determines the Issue of the whole matter, not that Christ undertook to how our Wills, or reconcile us to God; no, but that we our selves must Answer the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Repentance, Faith, Obedience,</hi> &amp;c. or else all that Christ hath done is lost, and comes to nothing; and why might not all refuse to do this as well as some, who never will believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ shall be a Redeemer, and make our Peace if we please; this puts a Bar to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser (as one observes) a Man can't in any good sense be called a Redeemer of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons out of Slavery, till the Persons perform
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60037:94"/>
those Conditions, upon which he laid down the Price: As for Example, (saith he)
<q>I lay down an Hundred Pounds for the Redemption of a Person in Slavery, upon this Condition, that he yield to serve me Seven Years after; I must have his Consent before I can Redeem him; and therefore upon these Conditions I am certainly suspended from being a Redeemer; nay, and am no Redeemer of such Persons, if they refuse the Terms:</q>
So that for Christ to be an Universal Redeemer, is a Contradiction; for it is to be a Redeemer of all, if they please, but can be a Redeemer of none but of such that consented to the Terms proposed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides, this casteth horrid Reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Son of God, as if he had done some great thing for us, in dying and making our Peace; when indeed, according to this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he doth but deceive poor Creatures; for he has made their Peace and Redeemed them if they will but get out of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Hands, and break his Chains and Bonds in pieces, and raise themselves from the Dead, and change their own Hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas he knew we were no more able to do this, than to create a new World. Therefore, Brethren, pray observe; we affirm, that whatsoever Conditions were agreed upon in the Covenant of Peace, our Lord Jesus Christ undertook to do and perform them all, both for us, and also in us; <hi>I will give them a new Heart,</hi>

               <p n="5">5. Moreover, Who can believe that Christ would shed his Blood for such whom he knew would never answer those Conditions which these Men speak of? besides, they being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions out of their power to perform.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Moreover I might argue thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> If Christ died for all, he intended to save all, but he never intended to save all, therefore he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for all: Who shall frustrate his Purpose, or Intention?</p>

               <p n="3">3. Because if any sort of Sinners were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, unless God should discover them by Name, who were included, Multitudes might utterly despair.</p>

               <p>The Terms on which Peace is proclaimed, run thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That whosoever <hi>it is that believeth, shall be saved:</hi>

                  </note> it would not only be hard, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, because Faith must be wrought in our

                  </note> dead in Sins and Trespasses: The Gospel in the Hand of the Spirit is a mighty Instrument of Christ's Power in the begetting or working of Faith in poor Sinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Proclamation runs to him that <hi>thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Oh, every one that thirsteth come to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>

               <head>SERMON VIII. Shewing when the Covenant did Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence; also the Nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant opened.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>ISA. Liv. x.</bibl>
                     <p>Neither shall the Covenant of my Peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>Doct. <hi>THAT there is a Covenant of Peace, made or agreed on, and stands firm in the behalf of all God's Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing under the General Head I am upon, I shall as it were but mention, which is the <hi>Sixth thing proposed,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>When did the Covenant of Peace Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and who are included in it, and what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in order to their actual Possession of the Peace, and Blessings thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenant was made in Eternity, but the time of its first Commencement, was after our <hi>first Parents</hi> had violated the Law of the first Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it did not so fully commence in the actual dispensation thereof, until Christ put an end to the Covenant of Works; then it was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60037:98"/>
(as you have heard) established; <hi>He took away the first, that he might establish the second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. As to those who were included in it; they were all the Elect, or all the <hi>Seed of Christ,</hi> or all that he, as a <hi>publick Head,</hi> represented, and no more. True, the whole World receives many external Blessings by virtue of it, (for the Elect sake;) for Jesus Christ is their Great <hi>Landlord,</hi> and Glorious Sovereign. The World is upheld by a new Title, <hi>i. e.</hi> from Christ as Mediator; for had not he interposed between God and it, the whole visible Fabrick doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less had been dissolved, and the whole Race of Mankind lost for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That which is required, in order to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Interest in, and Possession of the Sacred Blessings of this Covenant, and the Peace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is Union with Christ:<note place="margin">Ezek. <hi>20.37.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I will cause you to pass under the Rod, and bring you into the Bonds of the Covenant.</hi> Under the Rod, God brings Sinners under Convictions, that wounds like a Rod, and makes them pass under the Yoke, <hi>i.e.</hi> he Marries them to his Son, and so brings them into the Covenant. Sinners, by Faith, take hold of this Covenant, and Christ being given to them, they also give themselves to him, to be his, and no more their own, but the Lords; they take God to be their God, and Christ to be their Saviour, and so come to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the Blessings of the Covenant, and the Peace thereof.</p>
               <p>But no more as to this, I shall proceed to the third General Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:60037:99"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> My Business and Work is now to open the Nature of the Covenant of Peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I shall, God assisting, shew you what a kind of Covenant it is, or explain the Properties of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Apply it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peace, is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</note>I. The Covenant of Peace, is the Covenant of Grace: But pray observe, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peace may be considered as twofold, or a mixt Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it refers to Christ, or to his part, and Work therein; and as thus it was a Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant, Christ receives all for us, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the account of his own Desert, or Merits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But whatsoever we receive by virtue of this Covenant, it is wholly in a way of Free Grace and Favour, through his Merits, or through that Redemption we have by his Blood: But take it either ways, 'tis of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As to the Rise, Spring, or Efficient Cause thereof, it was God's Infinite Love, and Free Grace to his Elect: This moved the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to send his Son to be our Mediator, and to accept of him as our Surety, to do, and suffer for us, and in our stead. I have before shewed, God was no more obliged to enter into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peace with Christ for us, or any of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-spring, than he was to reconcile himself to the Fallen Angels, for they were his Creatures, and more glorious in their first Creation than Mankind were. The Surety of the Covenant was alone of God's finding, he procured him;<note place="margin">Joh <hi>33.24</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>He hath devised means that his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60037:99"/>
Banished might not for ever be expelled from him</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2</hi> Sam. <hi>14.14.</hi> Jer. <hi>31.11.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>For the Lord hath ransomed</hi> Jacob, and he sent Jesus: What could be an Act of higher, or greater Grace and Favour, than for God to vouchsafe, or provide such a Mediator and Surety for his Enemies? One so Great, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, Worthy, and Able, and one so willing to undertake to make our Peace, and bring us again home to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> And then as to us, this Covenant God entered into with Christ for us, must needs be of God's Free Grace: For as I have before hinted,</p>
               <p n="1">I. It was not of Constraint, I mean, there was no Necessity laid on God, or Jesus Christ thus to Love, Redeem, and Save us in respect of <hi>Motive</hi>; there was nothing in Man I say, that could move the Affections of God thus to do; and much less was there any thing in us, in respect of Merit; we deserved no such Love, either absolutely, or comparatively, because we were not only undeserving, but an ill-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving; nay, Hell deserving Creatures, being Rebels to God, Vile, Contemptible, and Base Creatures, even as loathsome as filthy Worms: <hi>What is Man, that thou art mindful of him?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> What is his Deformity, his Polution, his Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness? And O! What Cursed Enmity was there in our Carnal Mind? Yea,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>8.7.</hi>
                  </note> how much like to the Devil were we by Nature?</p>
               <p n="2">II. In that God hath manifested his Love and Mercy to so many, this shews his Infinite Grace to us-ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:60037:100"/>Object. <hi>May be you will say, Why not to more? Nay, Why not to all</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, Why to so many? Nay, why to any at all? Or, Why to such that are called? Why to us, and not rather to those that are lost? We being all naturally as vile and as bad as they; nay, perhaps there are some Sinners in Hell, that were not so bad as some of us once were, which he has magnified his Soveraign Grace and Favour unto.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Covenant of Peace is alone of God's Free Grace, because, as our Peace was made without us, not purchased by our Money, nor by any thing done by us; so the Promise of our having interest in the Blessings of this Peace, or the Application of the Blood of Atonement, are not Conditional Promises: I say, not on Conditional Promises, depending upon the corrupt and depraved <hi>Will</hi> of Man to perform, but they are alone free and absolute;<note place="margin">Jer, <hi>31.33.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I will put my Law in their inward part, and write it in their Heart; and will be their God, and they shall be my People; they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest; I will forgive their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and will remember their Sins no more—I will sprinkle clean Water upon them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <p>Ezek. <hi>36.25.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ezek. <hi>11.17.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ezek. <hi>36.26.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ezek. <hi>20.37.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>I will give them a new Heart; I will take away the Stone out of their Heart, and will give them a Heart of Flesh</hi>—Are these Promises made upon any Conditions to be performed by the Creature, or on previous Qualifications to prepare us for Grace; no, they are all free Promises, <hi>I will, and they shall</hi>; God it is that opens our Eyes, that works Faith in us, that makes us willing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60037:100"/>
to accept of that Peace he has made for us:<note place="margin">Zech. <hi>9.11</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>By the Blood of thy Covenant I have sent out the Prisoners out of the Pit, wherein there was no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> My Brethren, the Covenant of Peace from hence appears to be the Covenant of Grace, it was with Christ for us on hard Conditions, but to us in him, only by way of Free Promise.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That this Covenant is the Covenant of Grace, appears not only because it is wholly, or alone of Grace that we are brought into the Covenant, but also because by God's Free Grace we are kept in this Covenant, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in a State of Peace with God unto the end: <hi>They shall not depart from me; my Sheep hear my Voice, and they follow me, and I give unto them Eternal Life—and they shall never perish.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. <hi>10.28</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. But to proceed, 'Tis the Covenant of Grace in opposition to the Law, the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not of the Law.<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>1.14.</hi>
                  </note> (1.) <hi>For if they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promise made of none effect.</hi> Again, saith <hi>Paul, For if the Inheritance be of the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. <hi>3.18.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>it is no more of Promise, but God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promise.</hi> What is the Inheritance but God himself, in the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is not by our Obedience to the Law, but by Christ's Obedience thereto: 'Tis not, my Brethren, by our Obedience to any Law, not to the Gospel as a Law, for that would tend as much to make the Promise of God void, as the other:<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>3.21.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>For had there been a Law given that could have given Life, verily Righteousness should have been by the Law; —And then also Christ is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2.21.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60037:101"/>
(2.) In opposition to any after-Service which we could do, in order to make God, or Christ, any Compensation, or Return, by way of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for making our Peace, sometimes Men shew great Favour to the Poor in Distress, and pay their Debts upon the Condition that they shall Work it out, or make a Compensation that way; but so it is not here, for <hi>when we have done all we can do, we are but unprofitable Servants: Can Man profit God</hi>? Whoever gave any thing unto him?</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Covenant of Peace is wholly of Grace to us, because we are Quickned, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Called, Pardoned, Regenerated, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, have Faith, a new Heart, Repentance, Sanctification, and all things else whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by Vertue of this Covenant, in a way of Free Grace, or all is freely given to us of God.</p>
               <p>Let me give you two or three Reasons of this.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Why all is of God's Free Grace</note>1. Because God will have all the Honour to himself of our Salvation, he alone will have the Glory, and abase the Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because his Design herein is to Exalt and Magnifie his own Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Man might have no cause left him to boast nor Sacrifice to his own Drag, <hi>But that he that glorieth should glory in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Because God will have the Covenant of Peace to be <hi>sure to all the Seed, i. e.</hi> to all his People; but if it were not of Grace alone, it would not be sure, but an Uncertain and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60037:101"/>
Covenant, or on such Conditions that might, or might not be performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall shew you,<note place="margin">The great difference betwixt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, &amp; the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peace, is the Covenant of Grace as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with, or in opposition to the Covenant of Works: My purpose herein is to shew you the vast difference betwixt the Covenant of Grace, and the Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Covenant of Works was made with Man, or betwixt God and the first <hi>Adam: Adam</hi> was set up as the common Head, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative of all his Seed, and he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to perform all the Conditions in his own Person in that Covenant.</p>
               <p>But the Covenant of Grace primarily was made with our Lord Jesus Christ, or betwixt God the Father, and God the Son as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in the Name and behalf of all God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, he being set up from Everlasting, as their Covenanting Head.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Covenant of Works was made with Man, without a Surety; <hi>Adam,</hi> in his own Person, for himself, and for all his Seed, being obliged to perform perfect Obedience, or live and sin not; yet had he none to engage to God, or to undertake for him that he should thus do: But the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> was made solely upon the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking</hi> or <hi>Suretiship</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ; true, he was obliged to perform perfect Obedience to the same Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law of God, which <hi>Adam</hi> (and we in him) was required to do; yet it is said, That Christ was <hi>made a Surety of a better Covenant</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>7.22.</hi>
                  </note> and that not only in respect of the Promises there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60037:102"/>
which are better Promises, but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Oath of God, which renders this Covenant firm, together with Christ's Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Faithfulness to perform all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereof, and it being a full and free Covenant, and also ratified by the Death of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Covenant of Works was a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Covenant, as made with <hi>Adam:</hi> It was made upon mutual Restipulation between God and him; and in the second Addition of the said Covenant to the whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> God promised them, that upon their keeping this Covenant of perfect Obedience,<note place="margin">Exod. <hi>19.5, 6.</hi>
                  </note> he would be their God, and they should be his People, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me; and if thou keep my Laws, and obey my Voice, then thou shalt be a peculiar People unto me.</hi> And this also they Undertook,<note place="margin">Deut. <hi>5.27</hi>
                  </note> Promised, and Covenanted to to do; <hi>All that the Lord our God speak unto thee, we will hear it, and do it.</hi> But what saith the Lord to them? <hi>O that there was such an Heart in them!</hi> He knew well their great Inability and Averseness to do whatsoever he required.</p>
               <p>But the Covenant of Grace is an absolute Covenant as to us; as I have, and shall further shew you by and by <note n="*" place="margin">I repeat this often because I would have it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened on the mind of the <hi>Reader</hi>

               <p n="4">IV. The Covenant of Works, tho it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perfect Obedience, Personally to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Creature; yet it gave no strength to perform what it commanded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But in the Covenant of Peace whatsoever God's Law required of us to our Justification in his Sight, Christ <hi>covenanted</hi> and <hi>performed</hi> it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60037:102"/>
for us, and we in him. Hence the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>8.3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us:</hi> In us, Christ and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are here represented but as one Person; because what he did, we are said to do in him; <hi>Paul</hi> can't refer in this place to our inherent Sanctification, for so no Believer can fulfil the Law, because his best Works and Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are imperfect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, whatsoever Duties God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us as to our actual Justification, in our own Consciences, and as to our Sanctifica-also, he hath promised to give us his Spirit to perform and work in us.</p>

               <p n="5">V. The Covenant of Works laid all that broke it under God's denounced Wrath and Curse, and admitted of no Mercy, of no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28.</p>

that Curse Christ should be made on the behalf of the Elect.</p>
               <p>And by being made a Curse for us, he bore the Punishment due to us for our Sins, and satisfied Divine Justice; so that all our Sins, who do believe in Jesus,<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>8 12.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>One</hi> puts Men upon working, or doing for Life; the <hi>other</hi> puts them upon believing, and working from Life.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> promises Rewards for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Obedience, and threatens Wrath and Death for the Creatures Disobedience.</p>

                  <hi>The Letter kills—for Sin taking occasion by the Commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me— Sin revived,</hi>

                  <hi>and I dyed:</hi> That is, as to any hope of Life by the Law.</p>
               <p>But the Covenant of Grace admits of a Substitute, or of a Surety, to keep the Law for us; and God accepteth of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Suffering as imputed to us, to our free Discharge and Justification in his Sight: And hence the Gospel is called, <hi>The Ministration of the Spirit,</hi>

                  <q>The Nature of the Covenant of Grace (saith a Worthy Divine) is Absolute, or a Covenant of Promise, notwithstanding all the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onalty contained therein.

and Purpose of the Father, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</q>
The Covenant of Peace was not purchased by Christ; I mean, the Covenant it self, tho the Blessings in it were Christ's Purchase. (2.)
<q>The Covenant is Free and Absolute as to the Elect Personally considered; because the whole of the Foederal Conditions lay upon their Head, as undertaking for them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II
<q>If we consider the Covenant (saith he) in respect to its Application, or its being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually applied to the Elect in time; this is done absolutely in God's bestowing Grace, and the Gifts of the Promise to dead Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (or to Sinners, as Sinners.)

                     </note> There can be nothing freer than Life to a dead Creature; neither doth Life give a Title to Action, but it is the Principle of Action.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. All the Promises of the Covenant in the Promulgation of it, in its Original Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as respecting us, expresses the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it as most Free and Absolute: Thus it was to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David</hi>; and to us; <hi>I will be your God, and you shall be my People:</hi> It is not you shall have Peace upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that you do this or that, ye shall be Pardon'd, or then be Justified; No, but quite otherwise; <hi>But he that worketh not,</hi>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60037:105"/>
of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All is given absolutely of Free Grace. True, there are in the Covenant, Conditions of Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if a Man believes, he shall be saved; But who gives that Faith? Is it not God? Pray observe that Jesus Christ hath made our Peace, and Faith to receive the Atonement is given as an absolute Promise: Is not the Spirit so given? And pray, doth not God give the Spirit, before Faith can be exerted by us? Is not Faith <hi>the Fruit of the Spirit</hi>? And doth not the Fruit proceed from the Seed,<note place="margin">Gal <hi>5.22.</hi>
                  </note> and the Act flow from the Habit?</p>
               <p>Brethren, beware of them that Preach Peace to you, upon a Conditional Covenant; the Condition they speak of,<note place="margin">Reader, be not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I repeat 'tis so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in so great a case.</note> is your Repentance, Faith, Regeneration and Obedience.</p>
               <p>And alas, who is able to perform these hard Conditions? Besides, this is to turn the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, into a Covenant of Works; you must work for Justification and Peace, if you will have it; nay, and you shall be no further Justified, nor have Peace, than you are Sanctified, if you believe these Mens Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <p>But we say that Peace is made, and God hath promised that he will give the Spirit, even pour it out upon Sinners; he first pours out the Spirit of Grace, and then the Sinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or look to him whom they pierced, and receive the Blessing of Peace,<note place="margin">Zec. <hi>10.12</hi>
                  </note> or have the Minifestation of it to their Consciences. <hi>There is no Condition</hi> (saith Reverend <hi>Cotton</hi>) <hi>before

Faith, but a Condition of Misery, a lost Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> These Men render God like <hi>Pharaoh's Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,</hi> who would have their Tale of Brick, but find the <hi>Israelites</hi> no straw.</p>
               <p>They will not have Sinners to have Peace, without doing that for it, which indeed no Man is able to do; But O! let poor lost Souls look up to Christ, wait on him, attend on his Word, cry to him who hath <hi>received Gifts for the Rebellious also,</hi> i. e. the Gift of the Spirit, the Gift, (or rather) the Grace of Faith, the Gift of Righteousness.</p>
               <p>Will you have a Righteousness wrought out of your own Bowels, or by doing, or have none at all? Will you be saved by Works, and not by Grace? But to proceed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Absoluteness of the Covenant (saith this Author) appears as to us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> C.</note> in that all the Foederal, Intitling Conditions contained in it, are found in another, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Christ, and not in us, neither wrought in us, nor by us; for,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>9.16.</hi>
                  </note> whatsoever is wrought in us, is of Free Grace.</p>
               <p>My Brethren,</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>And of his own Will begat he us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not the Gospel require Faith and Repentance, as the Condition of Justification, and Eternal Life</hi>?</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Answ.</hi> I told you but even now, there are Conditions of Connexion by way of order and dependance of things one upon another:
<q>As
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60037:106"/>
in <hi>Logick</hi> (saith the same Reverend Divine) if a Creature be a Man, he is a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or if God be the first Cause, he is the Creator of all things: And in this sence (saith he) Creation is a Condition of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if a Man be Saved, he must be Created: So if a Man believe he shall be Saved, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a Condition of Connexion, a State of Grace is thus a Condition to a State of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by way of Connexion in the Promise; but one is not the Foederal Condition of another, but both come in as the Gift of Grace; in this sence the Covenant contains all the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Order and Dependance in the Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Performance; the hearing the Word is the <hi>Condition of Faith,</hi> but hearing is not a Foederal Condition; so the giving the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the Condition of Union to Christ and Faith, and Faith the Condition of receiving of Pardon, and living in Holiness and the giving of Pardon the Condition of receiving it, and Holiness the Condition of seeing God, and of having Eternal Happiness; but these kind of Conditions are not Foederal Intitling Conditions to the Promise, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Promise, and denote the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and Dependance of one promised Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit upon another.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God requires Faith and Repentance of them that shall be saved; but (1.) Not that the Creature can do either of these of himself, but to shew he will work Faith and Repentance in all whom he will save, or as he hath ordained the End, so he hath also ordained the Means.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:60037:106"/>(2.) But not that either of these are procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or Foederal Conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant blessings, or of Salvation, because all the Graces of the Spirit are contained in the Covenant as part of it; therefore neither Faith, Repentance, Regeneration, as the Creatures Part or Work, can be Conditions of it: These Men call Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> such a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Mercies granted are suspended till we perform the Condition. It is therefore, saith he, no more than an Act of ours. True, we have a good Bargain, as a Man that gives but Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ay Guineas of his own, Purchases an Hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, (as our <hi>Author</hi> observes) We must distinguish of the Ministry of Reconciliation, in respect of the Letter of it, and the Spirit of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. in the Letter of it, or meer exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Dispensation it kills, because the Sinner looks upon all these Conditions of dependance, Foederal Conditions, but the Spirit in its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry is absolute, according to the Original Contract, and the fullest Discovery in its highest freedom; therefore the Apostle says, <hi>The Spirit giveth Life.</hi> The believing <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> are said to be the Epistle of Christ, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and transcribed from the Original-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Contract; <hi>Not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God.</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>From hence we must distinguish between the Covenant in its Absolute <hi>Tenure,</hi> and the Ministry thereof, which is Conditionally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed, according to the Connexion, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Dependance of good Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60037:107"/>
in the Promise to a mix'd People: The Effects of the Ministry will either sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or harden, it will either work effectually by the Ministry of the Spirit, according to the Nature of an Absolute Promise, and unto such it becomes <hi>a Savour of Life, unto Life,</hi> or else it works only in the Letter, and unto such it <hi>Kills,</hi> or is a <hi>Savour of Death unto Death,</hi> or an Aggravation of Death and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But all its Divine Efficacy is according to the Purpose, <hi>Will,</hi> and Good Pleasure of God. But having occasionally spoken much before of the Absoluteness of the Covenant, I shall say no more, but Conclude at this Time.</p>

Nature on him, and yields Perfect Obedience to it; and to greaten its Glory, he died the Cursed Death of the Cross, to answer the Just Punishment it doth denounce upon Mankind, for the Breach thereof. Moreover,</p>
               <p n="5">V. This Covenant is well ordered in all things for our Good, both in respect of Grace here, and Glory hereafter; or in respect of what by it we are delivered from, and of those high Priviledges, Dignities, and of that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and Eternal Honour we are raised up unto hereby: But because I have lately upon another Text spoken unto these Things large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>two Sermons</hi> on the Covenant, I shall not add any thing further on this Account <note n="*" place="bottom">See a book Intituled, <hi>The everlasting covenant, a sweet cordial for a drooping Soul,</hi> - being Two Sermons Preached upon the Account of Mr. <hi>Henry Forty</hi>'s Funeral, Minister of the Gospel, and at his Request, from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is a Glorious Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It must needs be a Glorious Covenant in respect had to the Time when it was made, or entered into, between the Father and the Son; and this was, as you have heard, before the World began, even in Eternity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.</p>
               <p>Hence Jesus Christ 'tis said was a Lamb slain before the Foundation of the World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. and what <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did to him, was <hi>whatsoever God's Hand and his Counsel determined before to be done,</hi> Act. 4.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:60037:109"/>
                  <note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is a Glorious Covenant.</note>Certainly that Covenant that was so early, even from Everlasting, contrived by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Wisdom of God, and entered into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween such Glorious Persons as the Father and the Son, must be a most Glorious Covenant; and this, I say, in respect to the Time when, and to the Persons who entred into it, certainly it must be some great Thing that is contained in this Covenant that was so early, and by the Eternal God concluded upon.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It must needs be a Glorious Covenant, in regard that there was also a Council held about it in Eternity, for it was made as the Result of a Great and Glorious Council;<note place="margin">Act. <hi>2.23.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Him, being delivered by the Determinate Council and Fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken, and by Wicked Hands ye have Crucified and Slain.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Spirit then agreed, That the Second Person should assume the Nature of Man, and die to make our Peace; tho 'tis true elsewhere it is said.<note place="margin">Zech. <hi>6.13.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Counsel of Peace was between them both,</hi> viz. the Father and the Son; yet since it is ascribed to God without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Persons, and also seeing the Holy Ghost hath his part in this Covenant to act and do, in order to the actual and compleat Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the whole Transactions agreed on in that Glorious Council, I see no reason to exclude the Holy Ghost from being concerned therein.</p>
               <p>Moreover let us consider the great Things Consulted about in that Glorious Council.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was how God might be Just, or Magnifie his Justice, and yet be Gracious, and Magnifie
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60037:109"/>
his Mercy, and Infinite Love and Goodness; or how God might preserve his own Honour, and yet become our Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How Sin might be punished, and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Nature, and Infinite Evil that is in it, be exposed, and yet the guilty Sinner be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It is a Glorious Covenant, because in it there is a display of God's Highest, and most Glorious Wisdom; the Gospel contains the Manifestation of God's <hi>Hidden Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>the Wisdom of God in a Mystery</hi>; nay, <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a Glorious Mystery,<note place="margin">Col. <hi>1.27.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>To whom God would make known what is the Riches of the Glory of this Mystery.</hi> There is much of the Wisdom of God seen in his Works of Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; yea, and there is also great Mysteries hid in those Works of God, but the Chiefest and most Glorious Wisdom of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the Work and Covenant of Man's Redemption; <hi>Without Controversie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>1</hi> Tim. <hi>3.16.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>great is the Mystery of Godliness; God manifested in the Flesh, the Word was made Flesh.</hi> This is the Wonderment of the Holy Angels, and 'tis mervelous indeed, how an Infinite Nature should be Personally united to a Finite Nature, so as to make but one Person: What Wisdom of God is here displayed? O who can search out the depth of this Mystery?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It must needs be a Glorious Covenant in respect of that display of God's Glorious Love therein; <hi>God so loved the World,</hi> that no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Beings can conceive of it, neither Men nor Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:60037:110"/>And so I might speak of the Glory of his Justice, Power, Holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which amazing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shine forth herein.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Also in that this Covenant sets forth the <hi>Glory, Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Personal Excellencies</hi> of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In respect of his Person, as God-Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In respect of his Offices, of which I have already spoken.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is a Glorious Covenant in respect of those Things which we are hereby delivered from, and are also invested with, and raised up to possess—Is not that a Glorious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, by the Blessings of which, Sinners are delivered from Sin, which is the greatest Evil; and that brings them out of a State of Death, Wrath, the Curse, and Condemnation? And that which also gives them, through the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, an Interest in God, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Good; or which restores God to them to be their God forever? Consider what Glorious Gifts and Priviledges are given and granted in this Covenant? Is not that a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant in which God is given, Christ is given to the Soul? (But this I shall open more largely under the next Head.) But O! what Glorious Priviledges are contained here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as granted to all true Believers? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, What Glorious Grace is by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant procured for all the
Elect?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peace, a full Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
                  </note> And what a Crown and Kingdom do they hereby obtain a true Title unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Covenant of Peace is a full Covenant; there is nothing wanting in it,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60037:110"/>
either respecting the Glory of God, or our Good and Eternal Happiness.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is a full Covenant in respect of <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> Merit and Righteousness; my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, neither Divine Justice, nor the Law of God can require any more than what Christ hath by his Active, and Passive Obedience paid: God saith,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>3.17.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.</hi> Christ is called <hi>the Sun of Righteousness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. <hi>4.2.</hi>
                  </note> denoting that fullness of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is in him as Mediator; What is fuller of light than the Sun? And who is fuller of Righteousness than Jesus Christ? And as the Sun communicates its Light to all the Earth, even so Christ communicates his Righteousness to all the Elect; <hi>i. e.</hi> His Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is imputed to all that Believe: (not the Effects of his Righteousness) but his Active and Passive Obedience, is the Material cause of our Justification, and the Imputation of it, is the formal cause thereof, and from him by the Spirit an Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is also infused into the whole Body (to whom he is a Head of Influence) to their <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. This Covenant is a full Covenant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, in it, or in Christ (who is the Sum of the Covenant) there is a <hi>fullness of Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency:</hi> and in the application of it by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, There is a <hi>fullness of Efficacy</hi> to all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, <hi>He is the Head of the Body, the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. <hi>1.23.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Fullness of him that filleth all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ makes the Covenant Effectual or Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious to all his Members, filling all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60037:111"/>
with all grace by the Spirit, leaving not one believing Soul empty of what is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good. Doth the Soul want light? Christ will give it; <hi>He is the Light of the Gentiles:</hi> The Light of the World. Doth he want Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? Christ releases the Captives. Doth he need Rest? Christ gives the <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden</hi> rest:<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>11.28.</hi>
                  </note> In a word, Christ in the Covenant is <hi>Food</hi> to the <hi>Hungry, Cloaths</hi> to the <hi>Naked, Strength</hi> to the <hi>Weak, Health</hi> to the <hi>Sick, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> to the <hi>Faint-hearted, Succor</hi> to the <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Beauty</hi> to the <hi>Deformed, Riches</hi> to the <hi>Poor, Peace</hi> to the <hi>Troubled, Life</hi> to the <hi>Dead</hi> Christ is all in this Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It is a Full Covenant; because it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers not only all the wants of the Soul, but of the Body also:<note place="margin">Psal. <hi>111.5</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>He will give meat to them that fear him, he is ever mindfull of his Covenant:</hi> Meat to the Soul, and Meat to the Body. Also,<note place="margin">Psal. <hi>37.3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Trust in the Lord and do good, and so shalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</hi> All things both for the Body and Soul, which God sees is good for us we shall have; he will give Grace and Glory,<note place="margin">Pal. <hi>84.11.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and no good thing will he withold from them that walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> But yet, we must not be the Judges of what is good, but leave it to God. We may think that is good for us which he may see to be hurtful.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is a Full Covenant; because in it there is the Mediators Fulness Communicated to all such that are united to him as the effects thereof, 'tis not a <hi>Creature-Fulness</hi> that is in Christ; no, but the Fulness of God: <hi>For it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60037:111"/>
pleased the Father that in him all Fulness should dwell</hi>;<note place="margin">Col. <hi>1.19.</hi> Chap. <hi>2.9.</hi>
                  </note> — <hi>in him dwelleth the Fulness of the God-head Bodily:</hi> The Fulness of the God-head dwells as truly in the Son, as in the Father; and of his Fulness do all Believers partake, <hi>Of his Fulness all we receive,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore in this Covenant, we do not only receive Light, but the Fulness of Light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only Life, but the Fulness of Life, because Christ is our Life whom we receive in this Covenant.</p>

— He further argues,</p>

<q>That Covenant that contains in it the whole matter and form in Conditions and Promises of the Covenant of Grace, doth not Essentially differ from it; but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption doth contain in it the Conditions and Promises of Grace, yea, all things that pertain to Life and Godliness: And it contains in it all conditions upon which we may be partakers of any Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christ's Person, Offices, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Righteousness <hi>active</hi> and <hi>passive</hi>; there's no Covenant condition of Atonement, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation or Satisfaction unto the Justice of God: But it is here, Christ is the great fulfiller of the Law and satisfier of it;<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>10.4.</hi>

<q>From the vailed dispensation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace (saith he) before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, their Sacrifices and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Administration held forth in a Figure, that it was made with Christ and confirmed in him as the great Offering and Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Christ is there exemplified and set forth as the fulness of the Covenant of Grace, both in respect of Promises and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</q>

<q>When we plead (saith he) for any thing of the Covenant of Grace, it is the Promises of Life made to us in Christ, <hi>as Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi>; and to us in him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of obtaining and performing to us.</q>
               </p>

<q>Our Justifying acts of Faith is fixed on

Christ as the Sum of the Covenant of Grace, as satisfying for our Sins; and as to whom the Promises were made, and the great things promised, as the Fountain and Meritorious cause of all Blessings: He is given to us as the Covenant.</q>

               <p n="6">6
<q>There is (saith he) all Grace to be had in this Covenant, <hi>Frustra sit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora.</hi> There is no Grace but is given forth and received by us, by the Covenant between the Father and the Son, the gift of the Spirit, the Grace of Faith, Justification by his Blood; by him came all Grace, yea, all other sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Grace that came not from the Father, and through Christ is no Grace, and will not profit us.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7.
<q>Where the Covenanters Conditions and Promises are all from Free Grace and Love to us, there's a Covenant of Grace; but in that Covenant they call a distinct Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption, the Covenanters, the Conditions and Promises are all of Free grace and Love to us; God the Father from his Free grace and Love to us called his Son to this Undertaking and Covenanting with him; God the Son in our Persons (or in our behalf) from his Love and Free grace Covenanted with the Father, he came and freely offered himself to perform the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Conditions; the condition of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in all mediatorial perfections and performances, is freely promised and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us; the promise of Eternal life.

All Grace and Glory are promised, and given in this Covenant: that is a Covenant of Grace, wherein God is to us a God of all Grace.</q>

<q>If the Covenant of Redemption be not the Covenant of Grace, then there is more Covenants than the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace for Life and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but there is no more Covenants for Life and Salvation, but that of Works, and that of Grace, the <hi>Minor</hi> I think hardly any will deny — If Church Covenants be alledged they add nothing to this Grand Covenant, but are the accomplishments of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses thereof to whom it doth belong, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promised that they shall be Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in this Covenant Christ stipulates and we in him as we did in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> then; And when we stipulate being moved thereunto from the grace of the Promise, and enter personally into this Covenant, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing that Covenant which was made for us in Christ, 'tis called <hi>a laying hold of it:</hi> it is solemnly also own'd, professed and restipulated to, when we enter into Church Fellowship: the repeating and restipulating, and renewings of the same Covenant may be without changing the Covenant: For we find God often repeating this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and renewing it with his people in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and Establishment, as with <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. yet it was was the same Covenant:<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Chauncy.</hi>

                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:60037:119"/>1. Now let me add one or two arguments more to what this worthy Author hath said, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Covenant of Redemption, be not the Covenant of Grace, or Covenant of Peace and Reconciliation, which God calls his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; <hi>The Covenant of my Peace shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved saith the Lord:</hi> Then it will follow, that our Peace is made with God, or God is reconciled to us by a Covenant of Grace, which we enter into with him, which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Christ Merited for us in his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant of Redemption; and if it be so, how is it <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself?</hi> Indeed as far as I can see, this notion of two distinct Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of Redemption and of Grace, seems to be defended of late, on purpose to favour the grand Errors of our new <hi>Methodists</hi> viz. <hi>In the Covenant of Redemption,</hi> say they, <hi>Christ made God amends for our breach of the Law of perfect obedience, by himself alone, and for himself only, that so he might be a fit Mediator, and Merit a new Law of Faith and sincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi>; (for their Covenant of Grace is a Law of Obedience) <hi>which Law or Covenant he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his Death.</hi> So that now God, say they, enters into a Covenant with mankind, and if they perform the Conditions of it, or so far as they do, so far they shall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed, and shall have Eternal life provided they continue unto the end; and thus (as before I have hinted) Christ is our legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in the Covenant of Redemption, he fulfiled the Law of Works, or the strict
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60037:119"/>
Law of perfect Obedience: by giving God a satisfying recompence, And so he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished the Law of perfect obedience; but our Faith, Inherent-righteousness, Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-holiness and Sincere obedience, is our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Righteousness; or that which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies us at Gods Bar or in his sight: Now this dangerous Error, I say, seems to follow the allowing of two distinct Covenants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no distinction between the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption and the Covenant of Grace; because Redemption presupposeth Peace and Reconciliation, and not only Gods Reconciliation to us, but our reconciliation to him; for Redemption is not from the Curse of the Law and Wrath of God only, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from <hi>Sin, or a vain Conversation,</hi>

mankind, whom God regarded not, their Credit being for ever gone; there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Christ's suretyship in that said Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in respect had to those things, which Christ was to do for us, and also work in us; which he then engaged to the Father to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and if the Covenant of Redemption from Sin and Wrath was not confirmed by the Blood of that Covenant, one grand part of our safety and security is gone for ever.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, Our Lord Jesus Christ when he first entred into the Covenant with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">See the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant a sweet Cordial, <hi>p. 12, 13, 14, 15.</hi>
                  </note> agreed to be the Mediator and Surety thereof; also evident it is, that there are some Transactions where suretiship is required, which a Surety must undertake to do, and readily agree unto; even all such things which the Creditor requires and the nature of the Covenant calls for: So that there are some things that peculiarly belong to him as sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even so and in like manner it was here about the compleat accomplishment of the Covenant of Grace entered into between the Father and the Son in behalf of the Elect. Yet all the good we receive through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory part of the said Covenant, are but the effects, fruits or product of the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as it was made with Christ for us, as our Surety—Also among Men those things and Covenant Transactions betwixt the Creditor and the Surety which peculiarly appertain to him to perform and answer (though the poor debtor nevertheless is mainly concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) they being such things that must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

by the Surety for him, or the Debtor can have no benefit by it; yet the free grants to the Debtor in the said Covenant upon the Suretys engagement is never called a distinct Covenant in it self, but (as I said before) 'tis one and the same Covenant, our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant therefore is but a branch of Christ's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God the Father, in which he engaged to <hi>Spouse</hi> and Marry us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for ever: Therefore I know not what these Mens nice distinctions signifies, unless it be to amuse the world, or except it be for the worser purpose just now hinted.</p>
               <p>Brethren, The distinction lies not in two distinct Covenants Essentially differing from each other, but in the distinct parts of the said one intire Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">I. One part as it refers to Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> he is the Surety and we the Debtors whom he engaged for; his money and not ours pays all, and makes satisfaction to God. Christ is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer in this Covenant, and we the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. Christ is the Saviour, and we the Saved.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That part that appertains to Christ was upon conditions of what he was to do and suffer, he hath obtained all for us wholly by Desert and Merit, and we have all, every way of meer grace and favour particularly in the applicatory part thereof: Moreover, let it be noted that there is a difference in respect of the time of the making of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and of the Revelation, Execution and Application thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:60037:121"/>Christ in the Covenant first <hi>Articl'd</hi> with the Father to be Mediator and Surety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the execution of the Covenant actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharges those Offices, and all things that appertains to them, one thing being his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us home to God, or into the bonds of his Covenant.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Take here what the Reverend Assembly of <hi>Divines</hi> have said about the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,<note place="margin">Larger Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thechism.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Q. 30.
<q>Doth God leave mankind to perish in a state of Sin and Misery?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  <q>God doth not leave all mankind to perish in a state of Sin and Misery, into which they fell by the Breach of the first Covenant, called the Covenant of works; but of his meer love and Mercy delivereth his Elect out of it, and bringeth them into a state of Salvation, by the second Covenant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Covenant of Grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 31.
<q>With whom was the Covenant of Grace made?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  <q>The Covenant of Grace was made with Christ as the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with all the Elect as his Seed: Thus that Learned Assembly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it doth appear, that this opinion of two distinct Covenants was not received by that Assembly; they own but two Covenants <hi>i. e.</hi> that of Works and that of Grace, and I am sure the Scriptures bear witness of no other Covenant of Redemption, but that of Grace and Reconciliation, which includes Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and all Covenant-Blessings. My Brethren, That very Covenant made between the Father
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60037:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Son, was hidden or kept secret as to the clear manifestation of it till Christ came, and then it was manifested, and the clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of it is in the Gospel, which shows how God manifesteth the grace of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by offering Pardon and Peace to sinners, by revealing of Christ who is called the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and offering him to them for Life and Salvation; so that this Covenant contains all Grace, Mercy and Redemption.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Remarkable it is to see how that Learned Person that wrote the Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Ark of the Covenant,</hi> (who too boldly asserts the Covenant of Redemption a distinct Covenant from the Covenant of Grace) doth in divers places contradict himself herein, take some of his words,<note place="margin">Ark of the Covenant, <hi>p. 3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>So that I take(saith he) the meaning of these words, <hi>This is my Covenant with them, my Spirit that is upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. to be, This is my Covenant that I have made with thee upon their account, and for their behoof; or the Covenant that I have made with them: to wit, virtully when I Covenanted with thee, and made promises to thee for their behoof.</q>
He confesseth that the Covenant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was made with Christ primarily, and representatively, and with the Elect in him; and all promises of Grace was made to us in Christ in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: And what do we say more? but this is to overthrow his own Notion of two distinct Covenants.</p>
               <p>Nay, the same Author confesseth, that the grand thing he argues for, is to prove, that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60037:122"/>
there is nothing spoken of Christ's Seed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag. 5</hi>
                  </note> as parties with whom God deals in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and upon whom he layeth any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We say so too, Christ is only the Covenanting party for us, and on our behalf; and all the doing and suffering work is laid upon him, he is substituted Mediator, Surety, Saviour and Redeemer; 'tis enough we were to be the Saved, and Accepted and Justified in and by his Obedience and Merits: Moreover, all Commands concerning us are given to us from God in Christ as Mediator, but not to bring us into the Covenant, but as being his Redeemed People, as he is our King, we ought to obey and serve him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag. 21.</hi>
                  </note>Again, he saith,
<q>In this Covenant Christ received his Offices, Imployment, Trust, Powers and Authority. A great truth! (and in the next place he says) Christ is Lord Mediator of the new Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Is not the New Covenant the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, this they Confess; and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms Christ was chosen Mediator of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, let me infer upon him <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Jesus Christ in that Covenant he entred in with the Father, was constituted Mediator of the New Covenant, and he is Mediator of the Covenant of Grace, How can that Covenant be distinct, or Essentially differ from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace?</p>
               <p>Moreover, 'tis observable how this great Author, and Reverend <hi>Charnock</hi> differ one with the other, yet both assert the Covenants are distinct</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:60037:122"/>This Man says,<note place="margin">P. <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> that Christ was surety of the Covenant of Redemption; the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, and says,<note place="margin">

                  </note>
                  <q>The Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had no surety, but the Father and the Son took each others words.</q>
True, we say none was a surety for Christ to God in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor for God to us; but Christ in this Covenant was our surety to God, he undertook on our behalf;<note place="margin">Art. of the Cov. p. <hi>423</hi>
                  </note> one says Christ is Mediator (King, Priest and Prophet) of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption:</p>
               <p>The other says Christ is Mediator of the Covenant of Grace,<note place="margin">Charnock's Reconcil. p. <hi>273.</hi>
                  </note> but not the Mediator of the Covenant of Redemption.</p>
               <p>The mistake, I humbly conceive, lies in this, <hi>viz.</hi> They distinguish not between Christ's part and work in the Covenant as our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting head, and the Blessings we receive as the effects of his Mediation.</p>
               <p>But again, our <hi>Scotish Author</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Art. of the Cov. p. <hi>457</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>Christ is the Covenant of Grace comprehensively, he is the very compound, or there is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the Covenant; in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators Person, there is the little sum, or the whole Covenant—Consider this, how the Parties Articles, Mutual Stipulations, Promises, Proportion, and Blessings of the Covenant, are all some way abridged in Christ, and summed up in his Person.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. Christ is all the Parties of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, or rather both the Parties are comprehended in the Mediator's Person; he is both the Parties in three respects. (1.) Because of the Union of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60037:123"/>
in his Blessed Person, he is <hi>God-Man, God made manifest in the Flesh.</hi> (2.) Because the Person who is Mediator, is upon both sides of the Covenant, as being one with the Father and Holy Ghost, he is on God's part, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. And as he is one with us, he is on our side, Heb. 2.11.13. <hi>For both he that Sanctifieth, and they that are Sanctified, are all of one</hi>—(3.) He is not only upon both sides of the Covenant, but he contracts for both the Parties.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. Christ obtains the Consent of both Parties, <hi>p.</hi> 459.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The everlastingness of the Covenant is comprized in Christ, he is God everlasting, yea, an everlasting Mediator, he was set up from everlasting, <hi>p.</hi> 462.</p>
               <p>Now these things being granted by <hi>our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> what cause he hath to affirm, That the Covenant of Redemption, and that of Grace, are two distinct Covenants, I will leave to all Mens Considerations.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sam. Petto</hi> on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, p. <hi>18.23.</hi>
                  </note>But further, to confute this Notion, take what another <hi>Reverend Writer</hi> hath written on this Subject.
<q>The Covenant of Grace was made and established not only with us, but joyntly with Jesus Christ, and with us in him; so that both are but one and the same Covenant: For the great Transactions with Jesus, yea, even the giving and sending of him, and his accepting the Office of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and undertaking for us, are all of Grace, as well as what is promised to us through him; therefore the Covenant of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60037:123"/>
Grace must take in all that conduced (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than a meer Decree) to our Restorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eternal Salvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. There is (saith he) no Scripture Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for making these to be two Covenants, (one of Redemption with Christ, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Grace and Reconciliation made with us) that distinction which some use, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, for the Parts are <hi>coincident,</hi> seeing that which was made with him, was of meer Grace also, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and it is promised, that he <hi>should be given for a Covenant,</hi> Isa. 42.6. therefore it's of Grace we are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. There was Grace before the World was, and that must needs be in the Covenant as with Jesus Christ, which was for <hi>reconciling the World to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21. It is true Christ only is our Redeemer and Surety, not we in our own Persons; and Christ hath some peculiar Precepts and Promises appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to him, which are not afforded to us in the same manner and degree; yet this hindreth not the Oneness of the Covenant with him and us.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. The Covenant of Grace was made with Christ as a publick Person, a <hi>second Adam,</hi> and therefore with all his Seed in him.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>3. All in the Covenant as with us, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for, and promised in the Covenant between the Father and the Son, and so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make but one Covenant.</q>

               <p>But because in my two Sermons Preached and Published on the Everlasting Covenant, I have answered the Reverend Mr. <hi>S.

                     </gap>d, when I will make a New Covenant with the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>and the House of</hi> Judeth, ver. 8. <hi>Not according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that I made with their Fathers, in the Day when I took them by the Hand to lead them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt: <hi>Because they continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not,</hi> v. 9. For this is the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.—I will put my Laws in their Mind, and write them in their Hearts, and I will be to them a God,</hi> &amp;c. This being (as I said) the great and chiefest Gift,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60037:126"/>
and Grant in the Covenant, I shall proceed to shew how God comes in this Covenant to be our God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Originally and Primarily by vertue of that Covenant made with Christ, as our Head and Representative, thus he became our God; <hi>I ascend to my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and to your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By <hi>his own free Donation</hi>; through that Atonement Christ hath made, God gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to us to be our God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, by what ways Soever we become God's People, by the same ways he becomes our God; as I shall have occasion to shew you afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, What doth this import for God to be our God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">What it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to have God to be our God.</note>1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> not meerly our God <hi>by Creation,</hi> for so he is the God of the <hi>Fallen-Angels,</hi> and the God of all <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Reprobates</hi> in the World, they are his Creatures, or were made by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It doth not imply his being our God as he was the God of the whole House of</hi> Israel, which was by vertue of a Legal, and Typical Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; for tho in that Covenant he was their God, and an Husband to them, yet for all that, for their Disobedience he cast them off, and utterly rejected them, and now they are so no more his People, that Covenant and Covenant Relation, being quite dissolved and removed for ever: Therefore it follows, that was not the Covenant of Grace, into which all the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as such, were
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60037:126"/>
taken; the Covenant of Grace can never be removed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Neither is he our God simply by an external or visible Profession,</hi> or by vertue of our own external Personal Covenanting with him, for many of these God will disown and be ashamed to be called their God; 'tis one thing to have the <hi>Christian</hi> Name, and profess the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, and another thing to have a saving interest in God; Men may in this sense be in Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6.</note> and yet as withered Branches be cut off and cast into the Fire.</p>
               <p>But in the Affirmative.</p>
               <p n="1">I. God is our God in this Covenant by way of special interest, it denotes our peculiar Relation to God. (1.) <hi>As a Father</hi> is related to his Children, whom he either hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or adopted, even so God in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is our God and Father. (2.) Or, as a <hi>Husband</hi> is related to that Woman whom he hath in his most indeared Affections Espoused, and Married to himself. (3.) Or as an Heir is related to an Estate, or an Inheritance which was purchased for him, and made sure to him for ever. (4.) Or as a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> hath an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in such Persons whom he hath redeemed for himself, and bought and purchased for his own Service, and to be for him and not for another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, I shall endeavour to shew you what an amazing Blessing this Grant, or Gift in the Covenant of Peace is,</hi> i. e. for God to be our God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:60037:127"/>
                  <note place="margin">What it is for God to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to us.</note>I. It is a choice and precious Blessing for God to give himself to us according to that Grant to Christ in the Covenant, because it is a clear Demonstration of his Special, Peculiar, and Eternal Love and Election: No Man can say he was beloved from everlasting, till he is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called; 'tis not a Man's having great Riches, Honours, Pleasures, Sweet Relations, Wealth, Health, and Prosperity; no, but 'tis his having Saving Grace: To kiss the King's Hand is a great Favour, but it is a far greater Token of Special Love to be made his <hi>Queen,</hi> and <hi>Royal Consort,</hi> and to lie in his <hi>Bosome:</hi> O! what can be a greater evidence of Divine Love and Goodness, than for God to give himself to us to be our God in the nearest Relation that a Creature is capable of, or can be brought into with his Glorious Creator, and Blessed Redeemer; <hi>For this God to be our God, our Portion, the Lot of our Inheritance, our Shield, and our exceeding great Reward,</hi> who were once his Enemies and meer Vassals of Sin and Satan: What Tongue is able to express this Love, or Heart to conceive how great it is?</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is an amazing Priviledge, Grant, and Blessing, <hi>because</hi> God cannot give a greater Gift than this is: My Brethren, Is there any thing in Heaven, or Earth greater or better than God himself? What hath God to bestow that excels himself? God (as I may speak with Reverence) look'd round about on all things he had in Heaven and Earth, and saw nothing good enough to impart to his Elect
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60037:127"/>
and Beloved ones; and therefore gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them, who comprehends and infinitely excels all Excellencies in both Worlds: <hi>Now is the Fountain of the great Depths broken up,</hi> and Mercy and Divine Goodness flows down like a mighty River: O! what Thoughts of Love and Bounty was in the Heart of God to us, when he entered into this Covenant of Peace, with Jesus Christ for us? What make a <hi>Deed of Gift of himself to us?</hi> And on such a sure Foundation too? Be amazed O ye Heavens! One Smile of God's Face, is better than all the World; which made <hi>David</hi> say,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 73.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none on Earth that I desire besides thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Because when God gives himself to a poor Sinner, he gives all he is, and all he has, so far as it is communicable to Creatures;<note place="margin">

               <p n="1">I. <hi>Divine Goodness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Divine Goodness given in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> this is let out to all true Believers, the Goodness of God is given to them, not only laid up for them that fear his Name, but also it is imparted to them; and this of all the Attributes of God, seems to be the sweetest, it is one of the choice perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Nature, and that which renders God to be the Object of our Love, Joy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: As he is a great and just God, he is the Object of our Fear, and as he is a Faithful
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60037:128"/>

                  <hi>There is none good but one, and that is God</hi>; nothing that is good, truly good, but what is derived from God, the loss of God only made Man miserable; and the Damned being for ever deprived of God, is that which makes them eternally mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; And Sinners having interest in God, in the Goodness of God, this only tends to make them happy.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>What a Good is God?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Goodness in God may be considered under a twofold Consideration.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What a good God is, opened.</note>I. The Perfection and Excellency of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, I mean his <hi>Essential Goodness,</hi> this cannot be imparted to Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>His Communicative Goodness,</hi> or that which God hath wrought out, laid up, and which he lets forth to Believers;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>O how great is thy Goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee? Which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the Children of Men—The Earth is full of the Goodness of the Lord:</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>God is Absolutely Good</hi> in the Perfection of his Being, he is independently Good, there is nothing wanting in him, no defection, he subsisteth in and of himself, he needeth not us, and there can be no addition made to his Goodness to make it more than it is.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:60037:128"/>2. <hi>God is originally and essentially Good,</hi>

The Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels are God's Creatures still, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Beings, but their Holiness they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not, that is gone: God is the <hi>First Good,</hi> the <hi>Original Good,</hi> and <hi>Essentially Good.</hi>

               <p>THE last Day I shewed you what wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gifts, Grants, Blessings, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are contained in the Covenant of Peace; particularly, that <hi>God gives himself, and his Son Jesus Christ</hi> to all that are brought into it; he has promised to be our God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:60037:133"/>There is yet one great Blessing, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That as God gives himself to be our God, so he hath promised <hi>we shall be his People</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Believers are God's People by Virtue of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peace. Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Five things premised.</hi>
                  </note> this Grant and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is in the Covenant; <hi>And I will be their God, and they shall be my People,</hi> compared with Heb. 8.10. <hi>And I will be a God to them, and they shall be a People unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Let me by way of premise Note here four or five Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is a most gracious, high, and sublime Priviledge, (<hi>viz.</hi>) God to be our God is the first; and this is comprehended in it also as the second, and next in order to be esteemed by us, <hi>i. e.</hi> we shall be his People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this is granted only as an Act of God's Free Grace and Sovereign Goodness, through Jesus Christ: Brethren, it is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition of our doing this or that, that we procure this Blessing 'tis not, as the Promise run to the People of <hi>Israel</hi> under the <hi>first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> But 'tis an absolute Promise if there is any such in all the Word of God; <hi>I will be your God, and you shall be my People.</hi> Men nor Devils, Ungodly Relations, our own evil Hearts, nor our great Unworthiness shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hinder us from being God's People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God's giving himself to us, is the Spring, the Cause and Reason why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his People; we have not God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit, because we are Believers, or Penitent Persons, but he first gives himself his Spirit,<note place="margin">Cotton <hi>on the Cov. p.</hi> 55.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <q>God first gives himself in working of Faith (saith <hi>Reverend Cotton</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60037:134"/>
Faith can be there.</q>
Therefore Faith is called,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit</hi>; Man is passive in Regeneration, or in God's infusing the first Principle, Root, or Habit of Faith, and of all Grace in him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This implies, that we were once not actually God's People (notwithstanding the Design and Purpose of Grace that was in his Heart concerning us;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25.</note>) <hi>I will call them my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which were not my People; and her Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that was not Beloved</hi>;<note place="margin">

               <p n="5">5. <hi>They shall be my People</hi>; this denotes the certainty of their Special Vocation, and of our being his People for ever; <hi>He shall see his Seed, all that the Father hath given to me shall come unto me</hi>; that is, they shall believe in me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now in speaking unto this Promise, Grant, and Priviledge.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I shall first shew you in what Respect, or Consideration we may be said to be God's People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Shew you what kind of People God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant People are; I mean such that are actually owned to be his People.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Shew you what a great Blessing this is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Apply both these great Priviledges toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I shall wave several Acceptations, by which a People may be called God's People, that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60037:134"/>
I may directly come to the Business in Hand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may be said to be God's People,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>How we may be said to be the People of God. Joh.</hi> 10.16.</note> and he our God <hi>decretively,</hi> or by virtue of God's Eternal Election; God chose Christ as our Head, and all the Elect in him: See our Lord's Words; <hi>Other Sheep have I that are not of this Fold, them I must bring:</hi> He calls them his Sheep, and yet then they were ungodly and unbelieving ones: So he said to <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 28.10.</note> 
                  <hi>I have much People in this City</hi>; they were his People <hi>decretively,</hi> tho not <hi>actually</hi> his at that time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Elect were God's People Foederally, or by virtue of that Holy Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father and the Son (as I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and now that this Relation also arises from those Covenant Transactions, is most evident; for Jesus Christ struck Hands with the Father, in behalf of all God's Elect, to procure this Priviledge: But a little further to open this, pray consider that there is a Foederal Union and Relation, as when the Father of a <hi>Young Man,</hi> and the Father, or <hi>Guardian</hi> of a <hi>Young Damsel</hi> shall mutually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and Covenant, that they two shall be Man and Wife; even thus God the Father and God the Son Agreed and Covenanted in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all the Elect: Christ was, as I may say, their <hi>Guardian,</hi> yea, and also he Covenanted to Espouse and Marry them to himself for ever, and God the Father gave the Elect to Christ in this Covenant. Moreover, herein he had the advantage of others; for may be such a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60037:135"/>
Young Man, as before mentioned, might not Love the Person his Father Covenanted with her Guardian to be his Wife, or he might not be able to obtain her Affections, but Christ's Love was set upon his intended Spouse from everlasting, and also he knew how to gain our Love, and unite our Hearts to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that <hi>by sheding his Love abroad in our Hearts by the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 5.5. The Love of Christ, hath in it a Physical Operation.</p>
               <p>And thus, my Brethren, by Covenant, and the free <hi>donation</hi> of the Father, we become God's People, or in a remote sense, were thus brought into this Blessed Relation to him; <hi>Thine they were</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6.</note> by Election) <hi>and thou gavest them me.</hi>

                  <hi>Ye are not your own, for you are bought with a price,</hi> &amp;c. and it was that they might be a <hi>peculiar People</hi> unto God: Hence the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar People zealous of Good Works</hi>; or a famous or principal People, as the <hi>Greek</hi> Word renders it. Without this Price had been laid down, we had never been brought into this Relation unto God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are God's People by <hi>Renovation,</hi> or <hi>Regeneration, Of his own Will begat he us by the Word of Truth.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Doct. <hi>THAT there is a Covenant of Peace, made or agreed on, and stands firm in the behalf of all God's Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Am upon the <hi>Fourth General Head of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; Namely,</hi> to shew you what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60037:142"/>
granted, or vouchsafed to all those that are brought into Covenant with God.</p>
               <p>I have passed through an <hi>Induction of twelve</hi> Particulars, upon this account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> The last Priviledge, or Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that is hereby procured and granted, which I shall speak to now,<note place="margin">A Free Trade is opened by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peace.</note> is that of a <hi>Free Trade to Heaven:</hi> This, you know, is one of the great and chiefest Blessings that follows a Peace made between Princes and States on Earth.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>War stops up,</hi> or <hi>interrupteth all Trade</hi> and Commerce betwixt those Kingdoms and States that are at War one with another, (the sad and bitter Effects of this we in this Nation have lately felt, by means of the <hi>late War,</hi> which now is happily ended;) even so, my Brethren, all Spiritual Trade and Commerce betwixt God and Man, was stop'd, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted by that fearful War, which was occasioned by our Sin and Rebellion against God in the first <hi>Adam; The Flaming Sword that turned every way,</hi> was a Token of this: Poor Man could not now make any approach to God, no Trading to Heaven any more for Mankind, until his Peace is made, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">What is meant by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God.</note>1. God will not admit Sinners to receive any of his Special, Spiritual, Saving, and Soul-inriching Commodities, tho through his great Bounty and Goodness he doth give forth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gifts, or Earthly good things to his Enemies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor will God receive of Man any thing that he hath, or can do, or offer to him, until
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60037:143"/>
his Peace is made, and his Person accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his sight, for Sinners Hearts being departed from God, their very Prayers, and all their Services are Abomination unto him, and hateful in his Sight: So that all ways of Blessed Intercourse betwixt God and Man, were stoped up,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev</hi> 22.1.</note> and the Streams of that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by which all Spiritual Blessings must come to them, are stayed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Spirit: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Thieves, Pyrats,</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> were let out upon them, I mean <hi>Satan,</hi> and all the Powers of Darkness; and thus was Mankind brought to utter Beggery, for all their original Riches, or Righteousness, and Blessed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was utterly consumed by means of that first Act of Rebellion; nor was there any ways left to Mankind to get one Penny to help or relieve themselves in their Necessity.</p>
               <p>But no sooner was there News brought of this Covenant of Peace, or it was published to our first Parents in that Promise; <hi>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there was a Free Trade opened again for all Believers, tho it was then but darkly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Now in speaking unto this great Grant, Blessing, and Priviledge, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Shew you what I mean by this Free and Open Trade to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Prove that this Priviledge is granted as the Effects of the Covenant of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Shew you that this is the best Trade or Traffick in all the Earth,</hi> viz. <hi>our Spiritual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Heaven by Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Apply it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:60037:143"/>1. By this Trade or Traffick to Heaven,<note place="margin">What is meant by our Trade and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick to Heaven.</note> I mean, our free Intercourse or Access to the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God's free and kind distribution, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth the best of Heaven unto us, when we come or approach unto him by Jesus Christ, or <hi>in this new and living way,</hi> and that to the inriching of our Souls; not only, my Brethren, barely to supply our Wants, and pinching Necessities, but also to the making of us very Rich and Great.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I mean by it, God's Gracious Acceptance of our Persons, Duties, and all our Holy and Spiritual Performances, or Services, which is no small Favour and Blessing, but one of the greatest we can partake of; for this must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be premised, that God will never accept of any Man's Duties, till he first accepteth of his Person; for thus he first accepts of <hi>Abel</hi>; that is, of his Person,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord had a Respect unto</hi> Abel, <hi>and to his Offering</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4</note> he offered his Offering in Faith, he was a Believer, and God accepted of his Person in Christ, and so he doth of the Persons of all True Believers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved</hi>—in whom we are united and made Members of his Body, and it is in him that God looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, I shall endeavour to prove,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This Trade the effects of our Peace.</note> 
                  <hi>that this Trade, or Blessing of free Access unto God, is the Effects of the Peace made by Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Navigable River,</hi> by which we Trade to Heaven, by virtue of this Peace, is opened, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Spirit is poured forth; This is that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60037:144"/>
                  <hi>River that makes glad the City of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 46.4. <hi>The Saints Trade is in and by the River,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Holy Spirit so called.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c. and this it doth not only, in that it supplies God's People, or his Holy City with Water to drink, (which is indeed Water of Life) but also in that it is by it we Trade to Heaven, all our Spiritual Trade and Traffick, is in and through this River: Our Trade, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is a Trade of Merchandise—<hi>For the Merchandise of it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>is better than the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1.</note> Now this River <hi>proceeds from the Throne of God, and the Lamb,</hi> and that this River is opened by the Sacrifice of Christ, or by that Peace he hath made: See <hi>Acts</hi> 2.31. This <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus hath God raised up, whereof we are all Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses—Therefore being by the Right Hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father, the Promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear,</hi> Vers. 32.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Jesus Christ promised the Spirit to his Disciples upon his Ascention, and this Promise he graciously made good;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>being Justified by Faith, we have Peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by Faith into this Grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18.</note> &amp;c. Again he saith, <hi>And came and Preached Peace to you that were a far off,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father</hi>; that is, through the <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> who hath reconciled us to God: We are now admitted or introduced into the presence of the Father, and this with boldness;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12.</note> 
                  <hi>In whom we have Boldness and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess with Confidence, by the Faith of him:</hi> And
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60037:144"/>
this not only in Prayer, but also in all Holy Fellowship, Commerce, and Heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; <hi>Having therefore, Brethren, Boldness to enter into the Holiest by the Blood of Jesus:</hi> It was the Blood of Christ that opened this Trade, or procured this Access to Heaven for us, <hi>By a new and living way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>which he hath consecrated for us through the Veil, that is to say, his Flesh.</hi> Hence our Blessed Lord saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 14 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the Way, no Man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> Except this River had been opened, we could never have Traded to Heaven, and that this is done by Jesus Christ, or by the Peace which he hath made, I have thus fully proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, I shall shew you that this is the best Trade, or there is no Trade like unto it in all the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the Word of God declares it so to be;<note place="margin">What a Rich and Glorious Trade this Spiritual Trade is.</note> 
                  <hi>The Merchandise hereof is better than the Merchandise of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold.</hi> Now what Merchandise of this World, do Men account to excel that of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and fine Gold? But Spiritual Merchandise the great God declares, is better than these, or whatsoever else you can think, or speak of. Now this I shall further indeavour to make appear in this Method following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In respect of the Subject, these Merchandises enrich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In respect of the Nature of the Things Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in, or for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In respect of that Blessed Correspondent, who manages all our Affairs in Heaven, and that makes us Returns of all we venture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:60037:145"/>4. <hi>In respect of the Terms upon which we Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>I shall apply the whole</hi>—I shall speak briefly to each of these.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">The Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Trade inriches the Soul.</note> The Subject that these Merchandises inrich is <hi>the Soul,</hi> the Precious and Immortal Soul of Man, which all other Trades and Merchandise cannot in the least degree relieve the Wants of, much less inrich; but these Heavenly Merchandises doth this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is hereby the Soul of a Believer, or a Spiritual Merchant, comes to have God again; God to be his God, yea, a God in Covenant with him, and to be his Portion for ever (as you have heard.) 'Tis through Jesus Christ, or by the Peace he hath made, that this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is obtained; God is hereby our Father, and Christ is our Saviour, and the Spirit is our Sanctifier; whosoever will venture out by Faith, and Trade in these Seas, or on this Voyage, shall obtain a sure Interest in Christ, and in God through Jesus Christ for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because this Trade answers all the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the Soul,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19.</note> or all its Wants; <hi>My God shall supply all your need, according to his Riches in Glory by Christ Jesus:</hi> Graciously, nay, Gloriously, or according to his own Fulness, or rich Mercy, or Riches in Glory. Nay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not only supply the Needs of our Souls, but these Merchandises tend to inrich the Soul with Grace; yea, with all Grace. This Trade, or this Merchandise, puts a Crown better than that of Gold on its Head, and Chains about
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60037:145"/>
its Neck;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.19</note>

               <p n="1">1. Without Money, and without Price, without Money or Monies worth. We Trade for nothing, receive nothing for what we had, or give for it as you have heard.</p>

Keep up your Acquaintance with Jesus Christ, you that are Believers see to this; and you that are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners see that you get Union with him, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy self with him, and be at Peace,</hi>

They that can Trust most, are rich Dealers, the Poor you know can't Trust, they live upon their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, so some too much fetch their Comforts

from their liveliness in Duties, and lively Frames, or from their own Labour, but this is not to live by Faith, but such are rich that can Trust, or Believe, tho they with <hi>Thomas</hi> see and feel not. (2.) Such that are rich live high, they keep a Noble Table; I mean, eat the fat and drink the sweet of the Ordinances and of the Promises; and also they dwell above, they dwell on high, or enjoy Blessed Communion with the Father and the Son.

                     <hi>I know thy Poverty, but thou art Rich.</hi> (4.) Such that are more Heavenly than others, are the richest Saints. (5.) Such that are most rich in good Works. (6.) Such that can best bear Burdens, when Taxes or Burdens are laid on poor Men, they can't bear them, but the Rich can. (7.) Commonly the Rich are envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so <hi>Satan</hi> and wicked Men envy such Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that are most rich, Thieves seldom beset a poor Man's House; the more thou art temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, O Soul! the greater sign it is that thou art rich. (8.) Rich Men feed others, they feed the Poor; so such that are rich in Grace, and Experiences, feed other Christians; <hi>The Lips of the Righteous feed many.</hi> (9.) The Rich are better cloathed and adorned than others; so rich Believers are more Holy, more Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Meek and Lowly than others are: But I cannot enlarge on these Things, but must leave what I have said to the Blessing of God.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>I AM this Day to conclude with this great Subject: The last Thing I told you,<note place="margin">April <hi>3. 1698.</hi>
                  </note> that I should do, was to open the Nature of that Peace, which is made by vertue of this Covenant: The Method I shall take in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto this, shall be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, To give you a short Summary Account of what we have said, as to what is requisite to this Peace with God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Shew you the Nature of this Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Apply the whole we have said on this Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I have shewed you that Jesus Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,<note place="margin">A Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Account of what has been said as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to Peace with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> is the great Peace-maker between God and Man.</p>
               <p n="1">I. You have heard that we can have no Peace with God, until he is Reconciled, and this Christ has done; God in Christ is Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, his Justice is satisfied, and his Wrath by Christ's Obedience and Sacrifice is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:60037:154"/>II. Sinners must also (we have shewed you) be Reconciled to God;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2</hi> Cor. <hi>5.20</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye Reconciled to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho Sinners Peace may be made with God, by Jesus Christ, yet that Peace may not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by them, or they may not be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him; true, we have proved that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ undertook to do both these for all God's Elect; (as hath again and again been hinted.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have heard that Christ died on the Cross, so making Peace by satisfying Divine Justice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He also, as our Blessed High-Priest, sprinkles that Blood upon our Consciences, I mean, applies the vertue of it to our Souls: By the first Act he removes all Obstacles out of God's way, and by the second he removes all Obstacles out of the Sinner's way; so that the Reconciliation becomes Mutual.</p>
               <p>Now that which is requisite on the Sinner's part, in order to Peace and Reconciliation to God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being Reconciled to God.</note>1. Is that his Eyes be opened to see his wretched State and Condition by Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he is a Sinner, an Enemy to God, a Rebel; yea, a Cursed and Condemned Creature in the <hi>first Adam—</hi> Yet,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God in Christ is well pleased (or as I have shewn) is reconciled by his Wrath-appeasing Sacrifice, as the Way, Means, or Meritorious Cause thereof; and that that Enmity which is naturally in the Sinner's Heart, must be removed also.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:60037:154"/>3. He must believe, or come to Christ, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone upon him for Justification, Pardon, Peace, and Eternal Life; being convinced there is no other way to obtain these Blessings but by him only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the Grace of God being thus pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth upon the Soul by the Spirit, Faith is wrought in him to look to Jesus Christ; and so seeing and admiring the rich Bounty, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Unwordable Clemency of his offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and provoked Soveraign, this works Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or Godly Sorrow for Sin in every such Person; by which means he mourns,<note place="margin">Repentance how and when 'tis wrought in the Soul.</note> and is more or less in great bitterness of Spirit, in beholding how hateful Sin is to God, and also what Sorrows his Sins brought upon his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour. Hence it is called, <hi>A mourning for him,</hi> Zech. 12.10. For saith the Soul, now I see that my Sins Crucified my dear Lord, and let out his Hearts Blood; and thus was my Peace made.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Upon this the Believing and Sin-loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner resolves to lay down his Arms, and never any more to fight against God. Shall I (saith he) thus receive a Free Pardon of all my by-past Treasons, Sins, and Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my most Gracious Sovereign, refuse to lay down my Arms?—Shall I <hi>continue in Sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>6.1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>because Grace has abounded, God forbid?</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if Grace be infused into the Sinner's Heart, it will <hi>Teach him to deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. <hi>2.12.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and Worldly Lusts:</hi> And not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, to leave it, but also to loath it; it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Mind: yet Repentance is not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60037:155"/>
of Peace with God, but an effect of it, or of Christ's Merit, a Broken Heart being one Promise in the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Sinner hath not, cannot, have actual interest in the Blessings of this Covenant, or have Peace in his own Soul, without Union with Christ, which is accomplished by the Holy Spirit, and Faith of the Operation of God first of all, whereby it is, that the Soul is transplanted out of the <hi>first Adam,</hi> that dead stock into the <hi>second Adam</hi> that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit. Moreover know that the <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Relative Change</hi> is at one and the same time; and certainly all that deny that there is a Change of State, as well as a Change of Heart, <hi>err exceedingly.</hi> (1.) Because the Word of God positively declares, That by Nature the Elect are Children of Wrath,<note place="margin">Eph. <hi>2.3.</hi>
                  </note> as well as others; therefore more than under Wrath in their own Conscience; for in their own Consciences they may not apprehend they are the Children of Wrath before they believe;) Faith also must be somewhat more than an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Soul having that in its actual possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which it had not before. (2.) Because they that believe, God says, <hi>Are passed from Death to Life</hi>; that is, from a State of Death and Condemnation, into a State of Life and Justification: See <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. (3.) Because the Holy Spirit in Convictions, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the state of an Elect Sinner to himself, to be before Grace wretched and miserable, who is a true and faithful Witness, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie.

in him were Condemned by the pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sentence of the Holy God in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; so the <hi>second Adam,</hi> or all his, or all in him, are for ever Justified: And as whilst we remain in the <hi>first Adam,</hi> his first Sin is imputed to us, so not till we are in Christ is his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to our actual and personal Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imputed to us, tho I grant Foederally and Representatively in Christ it was imputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to all the Elect; yet 'tis through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Grace, or the infusion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby Faith is wrought, that the Soul receives the Atonement, and comes actually possessed with the Blessing of Peace;<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>15.13.</hi>

Christ is the Gift of God; yet certainly our Author for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that God the Father, and the Holy Ghost are given as well as Christ in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but when Christ is given, God the Father and the Holy Spirit is given; <hi>He that has the Son, has the Father also:</hi> All other things in the Covenant are (saith he) but as the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish of this <hi>Jewel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.
<q>Christ is the Covenant <hi>virtually,</hi> he is the just value of all the Bargain; he is of as much worth, as all that is promised: If you would know the worth of the Covenant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the worth of Jesus Christ.</q>
Moreover, my Brethren, they that have Christ, have all that is promised in the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Jesus Christ purchased all that good which is in the Covenant; when we say, God
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60037:161"/>
is our God, we must say, he is our God in Christ, or by Christ, or through his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Procurement.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.
<q>Christ is the Covenant comprehensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or summarily; he is the very Compound or Abridgment of the Covenant; he is the whole Covenant by way of Stipulation on our part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Jesus Christ is the only way of Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all Covenant Blessings, through whom we receive all we need, or that is Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us. Moreover, the Tender of the Covenant, and Interest in it, is contained in the free Tender of Christ, and Interest in him: Get Christ, be but in Christ, and thou art in the Covenant. Sirs, when God gives Christ to a Sinner, the whole Covenant is performed to that Person, and he that receives not Jesus Christ, shall never have one saving Benefit or Blessing thereof. And thus may Christ be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Covenant—But</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. From hence also we may infer the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful worth that there is in the Blood of Christ—It is not only precious Blood in respect had unto his Person whose Blood it is, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eternal Son of God; but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that Atonement it hath made, and that Wrath it has appeased, and that Peace it has procured, and in regard of those Infinite Blessings and Priviiedges it hath merited for us, and that precious Soul it Sanctifies. O prize this Blood! What will become of them that contemn and slight this Blood—and the Vertue and Efficacy that is in it? Or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60037:161"/>
it as the Blood of another Man, or as an unholy and unprofitable thing, it had been better for such if they had never been Born.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. We may moreover from hence see the absolute necessity there is of the Work and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Holy Spirit, in order to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Blood of the Covenant, and all Covenant Blessings unto us: The Holy Ghost deserves (my Brethren) equal Glory with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit must plant Grace in our Hearts, or be a Vital Principle in the Soul; it is he which infuses sacred Habits, from whence all Vital Acts proceed; by the Spirit we come to have the root of the matter in us, from whence all Spiritual Fruit flows; 'tis the Spirit that draws us to Christ, that unites our Souls to him, without it the Death of Christ profits no Man, it is he which sprinkles his Blood on our Consciences. O let our Mediations swim in the unlimited <hi>Ocean</hi> of Love and Divine Goodness, and magnifie all the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. We may furthermore learn from hence to see what absolute necessity there is of the Revelation of this Mystery through the Word or Holy Gospel, what signifies all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, doth naturally light in Man, discover any thing of our Redemption and Reconciliation by Jesus Christ: And from hence let us be moved to abhor those <hi>New</hi> and Cursed <hi>Notions,</hi> which at this Day so much prevail, which tend to raze the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true Christian Religion; for such
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60037:162"/>
that contemn all revealed Religion, contemn the Christian Religion. From hence also</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. We may perceive the Necessity of True and Saving Faith, and likewise the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency thereof; no Man is possessed of this Peace that has not the Faith of God's Elect; <hi>He that believeth not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. <hi>3.18.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>is Condemned already</hi>— and shall be Damned,<note place="margin">Mark <hi>16.16.</hi>
                     </note> unless he believes in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: Also you may hereby see what a strong ground here is for our Faith and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. From hence also we may see the Cause why the <hi>Holy Angels pry into this Mystery</hi>; this Love and Grace of God to Mankind, they <hi>bow down to look into these things,</hi>

                     </note> yea, look with admiration; And shall not we admire it, who are more especially concerned herein?</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Sinners be exhorted (from the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of the whole) to labour and strive to receive Jesus Christ—(And let such of you who think and hope you have received him, <hi>try</hi> your selves by what you have heard;) O, be exhorted to know in this your Day the things which belong to your Peace, before they are hid from your Eyes, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Believers, see that you labour after a <hi>strong Faith</hi> in Christ, and in the Covenant; for the measure of your Peace, will be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measure and degree of your Faith. O get a great Faith, and then your Peace will not be little, but like a River, yea, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abound in you.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. <hi>Tryal.</hi> Let all that hear me this Day, try themselves, examine themselves, whether they have Peace with God, or not? Take a few Rules to try your selves.</p>

                     <hi>Caution.</hi> Let none mistake me in any thing I have delivered in any of these Sermons about God's being Reconciled in Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so as to think he is at Peace, Reconciled, and well pleased with the Elect, whilst they remain in a State of Enmity against him, being vile and notorious Sinners: God can't but hate Sin whereever it is, and loath the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed. Sinner, when he looks upon them as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60037:163"/>
in the <hi>first Adam,</hi> or as in their Filthiness, for as such he hates and loaths them, but as he looks upon any Persons in Christ, so he loves them, and is at Peace, and well pleased with them; God sees not as Man sees, for he sees a Man Condemned and Justified at one and the same time; nay, as being in this World, and yet as being in the World to come, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sight of Things, or of Persons God hath, or how we are lookt upon and Justified in his sight in Christ, is one thing, and what the State of Persons are (or what Things and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may be said to be) as they actually are, or when they actually exist, (or in a proper Sense and Acceptation) is another thing; for it is <hi>ridiculous</hi> to say, That a Man in a proper Sense is actually or personally Condemned and Justified, Dead and yet Alive at one and the same time, or is in the <hi>first Adam,</hi> and yet in the <hi>second,</hi> or in a State of Wrath, and yet in a State of Grace, at one and the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Nay, and dangerous it is for any to say, that a wicked Man whilst he is so, is an Object of God's Delight, or that such a Person is actually Justified, and that God is at Peace, and well pleased with him, it being so direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Testimony of God's Word, and the Witness of the Divine Spirit. The Sum therefore of what I say and mean is this: When I say God in Christ is Reconciled to Sinners, <hi>viz.</hi> God having chosen his Elect in Christ from Eternity, was Reconciled to them in him as the Way and Means of the Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Peace, or of their Recovery out
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60037:164"/>
of the Fall, or out of their lapsed State fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen by him; but to say he was actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to them, personally considered from Eternity <note n="*" place="margin">Tho you have heard that I own a Foederal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion from Eternity.</note>, or from the Death of Christ, seems absurd and improper: For how could he be said to be Reconciled to this or that Person, before that Person had any personal Existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or Being; or if they had a Being, yet were Enemies to him, and loathsome Wretches, and under his denounced Wrath, and Curse, and in which State they remain before they are actually united to Christ, or are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called—Yet take notice that that which actually reconciles the Holy God to us is <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> alone, to which there can be no Addition made by any Collateral Work wrought in us, and done by us.
