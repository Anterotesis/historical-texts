            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is not vnknown to most part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that Sandwitch is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
townes in Kent, bordering vpon the
Sea, rich, and populous, and well stored
with substantiall and welthy inhabitants,
nere vnto which towne now standeth a very
olde house, (being the dwelling place of one
Goodwife Wattes, whose husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard)
which house is the onely remnant of
an other towne, which time hath ruinated &amp;
worne away, nowe called by the name of
old Sandwitch, in which house, being some
quarter of a mile from Sandwitch, wherein
as I said before, dwelleth one Goodwife
Watts, a very honest poore old woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wel-beloued
of the country, and of an honest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
amongst her neighbours, one that
takes great paines for her liuing, and most
willing to keepe her credit vpright.</p>
            <p>Upon the thirty of Iuly last past, 1609. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
satterday, there came vnto this old pore
womans house, a certaine wandring yong
woman, as it seemd great with child, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and decently apparelled, and being not
well able to trauell further, by reason of her
great belly, euen ready to be deliuered, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
succour of this kind-harted old woman
Mother Watts, and that she would graunt
her some help and comfort in this her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie,
<pb facs="tcp:20699:4"/>
and with weeping teares running
downe her cheeks, requested for Gods sake,
that some Christian-like charitie might be
shewed her, &amp; houseroome for that night of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
her for womanhood sake, otherwise
her selfe, and the babe within her body were
like to perish. This request of hers seemed so
reasonable, and the regard of her bigge belly,
drew such pittie and womanly nature from
this good old woman Mother Watts, that
she not onely granted her houseroome and
lodging for that night, but also sucker, helpe
and furtherance, (if it so stould happen) at the
painefull hower of her deliuerie: to be short,
this bigge belly wandring yong woman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thus by her humble intreaties obtained
lodging, where the very first night of her ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, fel into a most strange labor, where
her wombe was tormented with such gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
paine, that it much affrighted the old
woman Mother Watts, and in her minde
strook such a fear, that she immediatly called
in her neighbours, being women all of a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
forwardnes in such a busines: but
through the inward laboring of the womans
bodie, not any of them all knew how to shift
in such a dangerous case, wherefore amazed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they looked one of another, til such time as
one goodwife Hatch, the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, was sent for,
<pb facs="tcp:20699:5"/>
being a Midwife of a milde nature, and of
good experience, who at her comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so cunningly shewed her skill, that with
the helping hand of God, this distressed yong
woman was speedily deliuered, for which
dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t paines she gaue her vii. shillings, but
her wombe yeelded forth into the world a
kind of creature, but no childe rightly shapt,
for it was most strange &amp; dreadful to behold,
and droue the Midwife goodwife Hatch and
the rest of the company into a great fright, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
readie all to sinke downe dead to the
ground with feare, whether it were for the
sinnes of the Parents, or that God would
haue his Iustice, in the estranging of nature
for our sinnes here shewen, let the wiser sort
imagine: but surely this vnknowne woman
yeelded from her wombe such an abbortiue
and prodigious fruit, that this ages memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
cannot call to mind the like: for it had no
head, nor any signe or proportion thereof,
there onely appeared as it were two faces,
the one visibly to be seene, directly placed in
the breast, where it had a nose, and a mouth,
and two holes for two eyes, but no eyes, all
which seemed vgly, and most horrible to be
seene, and much offenciue to humane nature
to be lookt vpon, the other face was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to be seene, but retained a proportion
<pb facs="tcp:20699:5"/>
of flesh in a great round lump, like vnto a face
quite disfigured, and this was all of that
which could be discerned. The face, mouth,
eyes, nose, and breast, being thus framed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
like a deformed peece of flesh, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
no proportion of nature, but seemd as it
were a caios of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion, a mixture of things
without any discription, from the breast
downeward to the bowels it was smooth
and straight, all the other parts of the body
retained a most strange deformitie, for the
armes grew out at the toppe of the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
hauing neither ioynt nor elbow, but
round and fleshy, at the end of which armes,
grew two hands, with fifteene fingers, the
one hand had eight, the other seauen, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
shape, not like to the naturall fingers
of new borne children: also it had foureteene
toes, of each foote seauen, beeing as it were
like vnto geese or ducks feete. The wast and
middle as I said before, was straight and
without ioynts, but the lower parts were al
in a lump of flesh, like vnto a lambs paunch,
or such li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e loathsome thing to be seene, and
withall the legges so short, that they seemed
to haue no proportion. This miracle in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or rather Gods wonder, thus brought
into the worlde, quite disfigured from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
creation, as by the picture is rightly
<pb facs="tcp:20699:6"/>
deciphered, wrought such an amazement in
the beholders hearts, that for a time, they
were strucken almost sencelesse: the Roome
also where this childe lay, smelled so earthly
(for it was dead borne) that not anie of them
all could hardly endure the sent thereof.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20699:6"/>
Among other remembrances, this is to
be obserued for a thing of strangenesse, that
the woman her selfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, that this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
a little time before her deliuery, moued
in her belly, not like vnto other naturall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but as shee had beene possessed with an
euill spirit, which put her to extreame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Not many hours passed, before the reports
of this strange byrth was bruited abroade,
and the eares of the inhabitants there-about
dwelling, so filled with the newes thereof,
that they came in multitudes to behold it, in
such aboundance that it was wonderfull.</p>
            <p>But now againe to our purpose. On Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
beeing the last of Iulie, this new deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
woman, in reason seeming to bee weake
and sicklie, lying in her bed, desired the olde
woman her hostis, Mother Wattes (within
whose house shee lay) to goe into the towne, &amp;
to buy such necessaries as was needefull for
a weake woman in child-bed to haue, giuing
her money for the same purpose, the which
mother Wats most willingly did: But now
marke what in tht meane time hapned, &amp; let
all women in such a case co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what might
be done, &amp; how strongly nature in this newe
deliuered woman preuailed, for before Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Wats could returne from Sandwitch,
<pb facs="tcp:20699:7"/>
which was in lesse time then two houres, she
had got vp out of her bed, put on all her cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,
and was gone from the house, leauing
behinde her eight shillings, lying vppon the
Table, the child being dead, layde by it, with
an intent that the money should pay for the
burial of the same, all which at mother Wats
her returne, beeing found in this order, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to bee an accident most strange, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
she immediatly called in her neighbors,
where (making knowne vnto them all these
aforesaid proceedings) with a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
they certified the same vnto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
who vpon good consideration, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with the aduice of a reuerend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Minister, of Saint Clements church in
Sandwitch, one M. Simons, who verie
charitably gaue it buryall, &amp; withall, giuing
many godly admonitions to the people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this most stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge birth: from such like
terrible examples of Gods wrath, sweet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
bee mercifull vnto vs, for such like domb
warnings of our owne ouerthrowes as this
is, if wee be not graceles, may lead vs out of
the pathway of perdition, &amp; guide vs aright
into the true way of happines.</p>
            <p>Some other things concerning this
wonder is to be considered of, the one is, that
there was one of the Sergiants Wiues of
<pb facs="tcp:20699:7"/>
Sandwitch, that by the sight, and corrupted
smell proceeding from the child, receiued such
a conceit, that to this day she is not scarce
well, but sickly, and much decayed in health:
likewise, in the time of this womans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in Mother Watses house, it could not
be knowne by any meanes what she
was, from whence she came, nor whither she
was going, nor as yet it is not knowne for a
truth to what place she is trauelled, but for a
certaintie she was proued to be a wanderer,
&amp; supposed to be ones daughter in the Ile of
Tennet, but of what life and conuersation
she hath bene, and is of, none can iustly say
as yet, but surely the birth of her wombe hath
bredde much cause of feare.</p>
            <p>God in his other creatures, shewes the
like examples, onely to put vs in mind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
both by birds, beasts, foules, and

            <p>The Sea in like manner yeeldes forth

            <p>There be many I know that remembers

the hand of God for our amendments, yet
carelesly we still run astray, regarding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all these larum-bels sent from our
gentle redeemer.</p>
            <p>And if we doe consider thereof aright, we
are to make our prayers to God daily, that
in mercie he would looke vpon vs, and not
in this manner make a deformitie of
nature, examples of his heauie
indignation, threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs: from such and
all other the like, God
in his sweet mercie
deliuer vs all:
Amen.</p>
