            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOme Truths, as some Excellencies, are so much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their own Light, that the shortest and most tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
glimps can command our Assent to the one, and
give us a sufficient knowledge of the other. Such is that
of the inward worth of this Author, who as he was many ways
qualified for that piece of ancient character, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Eunap de Alypio in vit. Iambl. <hi>p.
29. (nature and austerity afforded him so small a portion
of body, and God's blessing on great faculties and equal
diligence, so rich endowments of Mind, that he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to some nearness to be all Soul</hi>) so will he be most fully
pourtrayed on the least Table. Any thing that was truly his,
that past under his last hand in his maturer Age, carries those
Signatures on it, whereby being dead he yet speaketh, <hi>articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lately</hi>
to those that knew him, and <hi>intelligibly,</hi> if they please
to believe it, to those which knew him not. And this single
Sermon of his, which is here offered the Reader, vndertakes to
make good what hath been said. Others have been willing to
gather up all his Reliques, which they can retrieve from any
Coast, that nothing which is so well qualified to receive, may
want its due veneration; And the publick is much obliged to
this their diligence. But for the <hi>compleat Image</hi> of this true
Son of the <hi>English</hi> Church, his temper, and the reasons of his
unmoved constancy to our Persecuted Mother, it will be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
drawn from this one appearance of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55788:3"/>
Conformable is the frame of the <hi>English</hi> Reformation, so
strongly guarded and secured inwardly from its own Principles,
Antiquity and Purity, of so straight and so clean, so plain and
unintricate a making, so clear and chrystalline both in its spring
and streams, that the simplest colours and the quickest hand will
give us the justest prospect, the vitallest picture of it. This
one parallel of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s taking away the <hi>high-places,</hi> &amp;c.
(being here perspicuously brought home by an uniform concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of suitable circumstances to the <hi>English</hi> Platform) su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceeding
the Readers solicitude, by supplying the want of any
larger collection of discourses and vindications in the point of
<hi>Schism,</hi> or <hi>Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Non-Communion</hi> with the Catholick
Church.</p>
            <p>Thus much was useful to he premised of the intrinsick value
of this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to engage the indifferent Readers survey, not to
anticipate his judgment of it. But the more extrinsick circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Preacher,</hi> and <hi>Auditory,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
of it, may deserve some farther reflection, in order to those
which were not foreseen, nor consequently at all considered by
the designer. The Scene was <hi>Paris,</hi> and if I mistake not, <hi>L'
Hostel de Blinville</hi> there, the place whither the <hi>most Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
then <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> his Highness, with his Family, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
for the Divine Offices of the Lords day. The avow'd
Design, for the fortifying of all his <hi>English</hi> Auditors, against
the infusions, to which that Clime (not the remoter of <hi>Rome</hi> or
<hi>Madrid</hi>) might possibly subject them. The <hi>Preacher,</hi> as great
a Prelatist as any whom unkind or jealous Brethren have ever
blasted under that title.</p>
            <p>His love and desire of the Peace of the Church so ardent, and
his Intercessions so constant for the Return of it, that he was
unwilling to be known to posterity by any other monument than
this, that <hi>He daily pray'd for the peace of the Church.</hi>

               <bibl>2 Kings XVIII. 22.</bibl>
               <q>But if ye say unto me, We trust in the Lord our
God: is not that he whose high places, and
whose Altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and
hath said to Iudah and Ierusalem, Ye shall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
before this Altar in Ierusalem?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>YOU may please to observe, that Detraction
sometimes mistakes her aim, and by a weak
assault commends that good which it intends
to villisie. Thus this Commander was here
sent to rail down <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that his cruel
Tongue might make, as 'twere, the Preface unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Sword. But so fond was his attempt, that no stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
Parasite could have more flatter'd him. So that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
this Prince's Worth ne're seems more fair, than in
the mouth of <hi>Rabshakeh.</hi> He's there tax'd for demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the High Places, and for the Subversion of so many
Altars; Actions that were enjoyn'd him by <hi>Moses:</hi> as if a
Man should accuse <hi>Henoch</hi> of Godliness, or <hi>Abraham</hi> of
his Belief: who would not take such Accusations as these
for no less than artificial Praises, as if some Orator had
laboured to commend these by an <hi>Irony: H<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>noch</hi> a good
man, but <hi>godly; Abraham</hi> holy no doubt, but that he was
<hi>faithful;</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a virtuous gallant Prince, wer't not
he's so <hi>Religious?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55788:4"/>
I could in Charity thus interpret these Words of <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shakeh,</hi>
were he not a Servant unto the King of <hi>Ashur:</hi>
but to speak truth, His Commission makes it plain that he
came to Rail: only his more friendly malice objects good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
instead of Sin, as if here Detraction had been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn'd
to commend an Enemy. You may thus far trust <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shakeh:</hi>
for in my Text he speaks exact Truth, to spite the
<hi>poor King</hi> of <hi>Iudah.</hi> This you'l easily find in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
parts of this Chapter: and withal you'l there see the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> in a lamentable estate, and yet indeed not so sad
as ours. Their fenced Cities all taken by the Arms of
<hi>Assyria,</hi> vers. 13. The Treasures of the King, and of the
Temple too, all consumed, <hi>vers. 15. Ierusalem</hi> it self, the
City Royal, besieg'd ('twas not yet lost, 'twas not so
bad here), <hi>vers.</hi> 17. and now <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> is sent to perswade
the King into Chains. He tells him, there was no hope in
his own strength: for though <hi>Assyria</hi> it self should be so
kind as to lend him Horses, yet (so low was he brought)
he could scarce find so many Troopers. No hope in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi>
his old known Confederates, they were a meer bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Reed. Nay, he dares add more, No hope at all in
God neither: for though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had indeed but reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Old</hi> Church, yet in <hi>Rabshakeh</hi>'s sense he had set up
a <hi>New one,</hi> he <hi>had forsaken</hi> God, <hi>and thrown down his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
and remov'd his High</hi> Glorious <hi>Places:</hi> and upon this
false Supposition, what a Rise is here taken by this fighting
Orator? <hi>But if ye say unto me, We trust in the Lord our
God, is not this he?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You see then 'tis no strange thing at all to find a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church oppressed by Arms, or by Orators. But
since my Text here is a part of <hi>Rabshakeh</hi>'s speech, I shall
leave the Soldier, and only follow him in this part of his
Oration. Where, for my more clear proceeding, I shall a
little invert the order of the words, and shall beseech you
to observe with me these Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55788:4"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> You may behold the Church of <hi>Iudah</hi> corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in these words, <hi>High places and altars, (i. e.)</hi> Altars in
high places: <hi>Secondly,</hi> these Corruptions reformed, <hi>whose
high places, and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and
hath said to Iudah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Reformation cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured;
<hi>But if ye say unto me, We trust in the Lord our God,
is not that he,</hi> &amp;c. Where it's silently tax'd of Novelty
and of Schism, indeed of no less than Apostacy it self, and
that for this cause they had no hope at all left in God.
Of these in their order. <hi>First,</hi> of the Corruptions, [<hi>High
places and altars.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Were bare Reason put to visit the Church of <hi>Iudah,</hi> her
Obliquities in the conceit of most men, might well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
pass for Trifles. For so God have his due Worship, a
man would think, what great matter is't where't be done:
The High Places may be as serviceable as the Court of the
Temple: and why may not his Sacrifice be slain as well at
<hi>Hebron</hi> as <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> But <hi>Israel</hi> must be judged by the
Laws; and in Points of so high coneernment must learn to
do, not what she fancies, but what that Text hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd;
<hi>Take heed thou offer not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. at the 13.
Thus <hi>Moses</hi> words were plain, That God hath enjoyn'd
but <hi>One</hi> only Altar, but only one for Burnt Sacrifice And
lest the violation of that Sacred Law should seem some
slight trivial thing, do but hear the Tenor of those severe
words in the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>Levit. What man soever there be of
the house of Isroel, that kills an Ox or a Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and
bringeth it not to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unto the altar that is before the Tabernacle, to offer
an offering unto the Lord, before the Tabernacle of the Lord,
Blood shall be imputed unto that man; he has shed blood, and
that man shall be cut off from among his people,</hi> in the <hi>4th</hi>
vers. of that Chapter. And in the same place, vers. 9. it's
again repeated, and extended too, that it may gain the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55788:5"/>
more hold and reverence: <hi>Whatsoever man there be of the
house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,</hi>
(it must extend to <hi>Iews</hi> and Proselytes) <hi>that offers a burnt
offering, or sacrifice, and brings is not to the door of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
even that man shall be cut off from among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
A Law sharp and terrible, fit indeed for Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>
and to be delivered in the voice of a Thunder: who
would not tremble at that Offence, in the Revenge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Beasts shall be esteemed as Men; to kill a Lamb, as to
commit a Murther: that man shall be cut off from among
his People; such Devotions are no less than Capital, nor
will God be satisfied for such Offences as these, till both Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Priest become a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>If you ask the Ground of this severe Edict, I might well
reply, That to yield a Reason, doth not still befit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of a Law. Yet <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, That God therefore
enjoined one only Altar, that thence it might become the
Sacred Emblem both of his Churches Unity, and his own.
<hi>We have,</hi> saith he, <hi>but one altar,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>For our great God is but One, and our twelve Tribes
make but one People only.</hi> There are Interpreters more
home, that plainly tell us, this Law was made for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
<hi>First,</hi> to prevent Schism; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> to prevent
Idolatry. First, <hi>Schism:</hi> For had leave been given to this
heady wrangling People, to do Sacrifice in many several
places, the Diversity of Rites such men would have soon
fallen into, might ere long have brought them into more
several Factions, than at that time they had Tribes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to prevent <hi>Idolatry,</hi> a Sin which for a long time
seem'd natural to the <hi>Iews;</hi> and what so fit course to keep
it off, as to admit of Sacrifice, but only in that Place
where the High Priest himself must look on, whom it so
much concern'd both in point of Conscience, and of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
too, to serve no God at all but the true One.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55788:5"/>
And 'tis worth observing with what height of Zeal this
strict Law was kept whilst the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church remained
yet Primitive. You may read the Story in the <hi>22d</hi> of
<hi>Ioshua.</hi> An Altar was set up on the other side <hi>Iordan</hi> by
the <hi>Reubenites,</hi> and the <hi>Gadites,</hi> and the half Tribe of
<hi>Manasses,</hi> their lot falling in those parts. News of this
strange structure is soon brought to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where it found
at once both the Tabernacle, and the High Priest: The
People murmur, the Army is straight drawn together; so
that the Forces prepared against <hi>Cananitish</hi> strangers, are
now designed to defend <hi>Moses</hi> Law against more than Two
Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> But prudently first an Embassy is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
<hi>Phineas</hi> is sent, and with him Ten Princes more
to expostulate with these men, with what intent they had
set up such an Altar as this, which must needs lye so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expos'd unto that great height of Misconstruction.
Their answer you may find, verse 22. <hi>The Lord God of
Gods, The Lord God of Gods he knows, and Israel shall
know, we have not built it in Rebellion,</hi> to offer there any
Sacrifice, but only to be a Witness betwixt us and you,
that though divided by <hi>Iordan,</hi> we have yet a share in
the self same Altar with you. For <hi>God forbid,</hi> say they,
that we should <hi>Rebel against the Lord, and turn this day
from following the Lord, to build an altar for Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Sacrifice, besides the altar of the Lord our God
which is before the Tabernacle,</hi> in the <hi>29th</hi> verse of that
Chapter. You see of so foul a Nature was this Offence
then esteemed, that by more than Nine Tribes 'twas held
cause enough of a War, and that a Civil War too, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Iews</hi> were to fight with <hi>Iews:</hi> and, but to take off
the suspicion where no such crime was, it brought more
than Two Tribes to the Apology you have heard, so high,
and so pathetical.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55788:6"/>
And yet in succeeding times how constantly did they vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate
this most severe Sacred Law? Mountains, and
Woods, and Plains, they would needs turn each place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Tabernacle. 'Twas then you would think the Holy
Land without doubt, whose more frequent Buildings were
Altars: but <hi>Palestine</hi> indeed was then farthest from God,
when she all thus seemed a Temple; and there was no
greater sign of <hi>Iudah</hi>'s Apostacy, than too many such signs
of Religion. Nay, so largely spread was this grand Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
that you'l easily find there was scarce a Man did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
it. Kings, and Priests, and People; some were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
others Spectators, and all bore a part in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Sacrifice. Thus <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the whole People
are tax'd, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 2, 3. And you need not doubt the
Priests were there too; for be the place where it would,
none by <hi>Moses</hi> Law could sacrifice but the Priests. Nay,
not only <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, but the succeeding Records of all
their good Kings still runs with this abatement; He walkt
in the ways of <hi>David</hi> his Father, <hi>but</hi> the High Places
were not taken away, the People still offer'd Sacrifice in
the tops of the High Places. It's thus said of no less
than Seven: <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Asa, Iehosaphat, Iehoash, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,
Azariah,</hi> and <hi>Iothan.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> thinks this
gross Corruption was as general, as if the <hi>Iews</hi> resolv'd to
make null <hi>Moses</hi> Law by an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Custom to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
and they had don't without doubt, were our Sins as
well able to abrogate a Law, as we well know they are to
break it. This is plain, that the Cardinal conceiv'd this
Abuse was grown into a Custom National, which had
there spread it self over all sorts and kind of Persons: So
that it found no open, no constant Opposition at all from
any body of men then considerable: Had it, 'tis clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
That Customs thus oppos'd, can put Humane
Laws in no danger. But I need not quote such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55788:6"/>
the very word there us'd, where the Text speaks
of those Kings, infers this Truth strongly enough. <hi>But
the High places were not taken away,</hi> the People still offer'd
Sacrifice in the High Places. For that Word, the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
when it's put singly, and without opposition, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
without doubt, the whole Nation which it points
at. Thus when God <hi>commands</hi> Moses; <hi>Speak now in the
ears of the people:</hi> Or in those Words to <hi>Pharaoh, Let
my people go:</hi> No doubt but that Word did point at each
several <hi>Iew;</hi> and though sometime it may well bear a
sence less general, yet it then implies so much the far
greater Number, that commonly what remains, is neither
a part eminent nor considerable. Nay, to go no farther
than my Text, 'tis plain enough from these Words of <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shakeh</hi>
(who having taken so many Cities, had now spent
some good time in <hi>Iewry,</hi>) that this Corruption was so
universally spread, without any visible, any noted part
to oppose it, that he conceived it the only true Service
of the God of <hi>Israel:</hi> With what Face else could He have
told the <hi>Iews,</hi> They had no hopes in their God, because
their King had quite overturned his Religion? Had there
indeed been any Number of Note that had oppos'd
this Corruption, is't at all probable it would have been
conceal'd in these <hi>Hebrew</hi> Histories? Their Pen men,
we know, were all Zealous enough to preserve the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Iudea;</hi> and yet in this particular we find a still
total silence: And if any man will needs hold the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they who call so much for <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Names,</hi> might
in Justice demand of this grand Undertaker, to shew a
List of those <hi>Iews,</hi> who from Age to Age, whilst
this Corruption held, did not at all worship in High
Places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55788:7"/>
But you'l demand perhaps, For how long a time was the
Hebrew Church thus corrupted? And indeed Learned
Men differ here. Some think this abuse began in the times
of <hi>Othoniel</hi> and <hi>Ehud,</hi> Judges: Others plac'd it in the days
of <hi>Gideon;</hi> admit either of these conjectures, and 'twill
be plain in Chronology, that this forbidden worship held
no less than six hundred Years; for all agree, <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
was the first who durst be so good, in those bad times, as
to reform this corruption. But grant we do abate of this,
since great Clerks conceive, that from the time that the
Ark was parted from the Tabernacle, which was no less
than ninety years, from the days of <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest, when
the Ark went Captive to <hi>Philistia,</hi> until they both met
again in the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 'twas lawful to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
at more than one only altar, because God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his more immediate Presence as well before the Ark, as
before the Tabernacle. For this reason I say (though
perhaps it hold not) grant we abate of that time; what
I find established by common consent, will prove large
enough to support all my whole intention. For no man
dares deny, the Text is so plain, in that Catalogue of
Kings I related, that this corruption held from the days
of <hi>Solomon</hi> unto the Reign of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and so no
less than upon the Point of three hundred years, as is
plain, by the computation of <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> and by the
most exact in Chronology.</p>
            <p>So then, three things are here very considerable; first,
the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Corruption, 'twas in the Censure of
Gods Law no less than the sin of Murther; and in the
Censure of the <hi>Iews,</hi> it deserved no less than the Revenge
of a plain Civil War. Secondly, the <hi>Extent</hi> of this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
it had spread it self throughout the whole face
of <hi>Iudea;</hi> so that all that was at that time, God's Visible
Church, was at once involv'd in this Error. For I need
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55788:7"/>
not now speak of the Ten Tribes; their high places were
made waste, as is plain enough from the Calves of <hi>Dan,</hi>
and of <hi>Bethel.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>Continuance</hi> of this Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
it held probably for six, but no man can deny, that
it <hi>remained</hi> in the Church of <hi>Iewry</hi> upon the point of three
Centuries of years.</p>
            <p>Hence 'twill follow clearly; the whole Visible Church
may be so far corrupted, that though she forsake not God,
and so run <hi>in Non Ecclesiam,</hi> to be no Church at all, yet
for a long time she may do Publick Worship in a most
gross forbidden manner; and this kind of Abuse may be
so dangerous, that upon its full discovery, both Prince
and People may be in conscience bound to embrace Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>Has God's Church of the Law been so foully blemished,
and may that of the Gosyel boast of a more constant Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Are the Promises of this kind more large to us, than
they were to that Church wherein God's own Son was
born? She in as plain Terms was then call'd the Spouse
of God: <hi>I will betroath thee unto me for ever,</hi> saith the
Lord, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. His People and his Flock: <hi>We are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his pasture, and the sheep of his hands,</hi> Psal. 95. Yea,
his Sons and his Daughters; <hi>Thou shalt call me, my Father,
saith the Lord, and shalt not depart from me,</hi> (Jer. 3. 19.)
True: the Gates of Hell shall not so prevail, but Christ
will still have a Church; and could the Gates of Hell
prevail against her that was betrothed God's own Spouse
for ever? That is, at least till Christ came. No, they
could not prevail to make her run <hi>in non Ecclesiam,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
no true Church at all; and yet they might prevail
to make her run <hi>in Corruptam Ecclesiam,</hi> into a Church so
much corrupt in her Publick Worship, that she might much
need a Reformation. And indeed, 'tis a strange thing that
any Christian Church which God has plac't among <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55788:8"/>
should be so puffed up with a thought of her own
strength, that she cannot fail in this particular. For 'tis a
Truth clear in the Text, that there's no Church of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
but like a Branch from the Vine, it may be quite cut
from Christianity. And which is worth observing, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> has indited this self-same Truth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the
<hi>11th</hi> chap. verse 21. <hi>Be not high minded, but fear; for if
God spar'd not the natural branches, take heed lest he spare
not thee.</hi> And that this Text implies the Christian <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
may be all cut off quite from Christ, is here the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and of the <hi>Remists</hi> Notes on that Text,
and of divers of their way.</p>
            <p>And to say the plain truth, that Text I named can well
bear no other comment, unless we'l fondly affirm, that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> warns the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to take heed of that mischance,
which yet indeed could not possibly fall out. And then
I beseech you observe, if that same Church which boasts
most of strength, may yet run <hi>in Non Ecclesiam,</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
no Church at all, she may much more run <hi>in Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
Ecclesiam,</hi> into a Church so corrupt in her Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that she may now need a Reformation.</p>
            <p>I say, she may run into a corrupt Church: and do but
consider her new claim of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and you'l easily
yield, 'tis a Victory to prove, that <hi>Rome</hi> may be conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
to make this appear, <hi>She may err,</hi> is enough to convince
her of no little part of her Errors. If you ask me to shew
more, I shall beg leave to reply, That' tis an Argument I
affect not; for I had much rather be employed in discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of good life, than in these of controversies; as holding
that, in all kind of Contentions, to be the most fit Christian
Prayer, <hi>Give peace in our time, O Lord.</hi> Yet since I <hi>here</hi>
meet with such Disputes and Waverings; in some I'le think
out of <hi>Conscience;</hi> in others, either out of <hi>Vanity,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
their time, or that under pretence of searching Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55788:8"/>
Truths, they may indeed drive a Trade; I must hence
hold it a Duty I owe unto most of those that now hear me;
yea, a Duty I owe to that venerable Church that baptiz'd
us all, though our now poor afflicted Mother, to keep the
Fruit of her own Womb from thus trampling on her; to
keep them, as much as in me lies, from being gull'd and
cheated from her Unity, and withal from communicating
too deeply in sin with those who have now cast her on the
ground.</p>
            <p>If you ask then for the corruptions of the <hi>Western</hi>
Church: suppose I instance but in one alone, She took the
<hi>Cup</hi> from the People: An Abuse set up against as clear Text
as e're the High Places were. <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> saith
our Saviour, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. And again (as they interpret
that Text), <hi>Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and
drink his blood, ye have no life in you,</hi> in that <hi>6th</hi> chap. <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Mark <hi>[ye have no life in you];</hi> I know they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
this, and make no question at all, but some witty
Scribe might have been as well able to defend the <hi>Iews;</hi>
who, for ought I know, might have said, as they do, That
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church had power over the Sacraments, (and
Sacrifices are no more) or by their new Doctrine of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance,</hi>
they might maintain much more probably, that
their High Places and Altars were but only us'd as Parts, as
Appurtenances, as Concomitants of the Tabernacle, than
these, that Shed-blood lies in the Host. For Shed-blood
it must be; This is my very Blood which is shed for you:
So that to tell us of Blood in the Body, of Blood running
in the Veins, is indeed to shew forth the Lord's Life, but
not, as he commands, to shew forth his death till he
comes. Nay, admit the Doctrine of <hi>Concomitance,</hi> (which
yet in this point is but a meer perfect fiction) yet Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns,
<hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi> And I appeal to your own Sences
themselves, whether to eat Christ's Blood, be to drink it.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55788:9"/>
Their Publick Service in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> is it not as
clearly against the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>How,</hi>
saith he, <hi>shall the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of
thanks, seeing he understands not what thou say'st?</hi> in the
<hi>16th</hi> verse of that chapter. Two things you see the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
there takes for granted; first, that the unlearned ought
to say <hi>Amen</hi> at God's Publick Service: Secondly, they
cannot joyn that consent of theirs, but to those words they
understand.</p>
            <p>I might instance in many more particulars; as in the
Adoration of <hi>Images,</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in the
Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and those other Articles of the
New Creed of <hi>Trent;</hi> whereof some are of dangerous
practise; nay, (as Learned men amongst themselves have
confess'd, <hi>Gerson, Espensaeus,</hi> and many others) they are of
practice, among the Vulgar at least (some doubt not to
add, and among the Learned too) no less than Idololatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
Others again are made Articles of Faith, which yet
for ought appears either in the Text, or in Antiquity, are
indeed not so much as probable Opinions: So that to say
truth, there are store of men who have not Ignorance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to believe such Articles. And yet the <hi>Western</hi>
Church has forced many Souls into the Faith of this New
Creed, both by the Prison and the Stake: And in this
Tyranny hath shewed her self far worse than e're old <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
did. For though we read of no visible conspicuous
number that did avoid the High Places, yet in Charity we
may think there were some few that did so, and yet in this
regard we read not so much as one either punished, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
by an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Magistrate.</p>
            <p>'Tis true then, that God's Church, yea, his Christian
Church, may be stained with some gross foul Corruptions.
But what? Because she may thus err, shall each giddy Brain
be allow'd to controul, or each private Hand to reform
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55788:9"/>
her? Admit this Disorder once, and let a Church be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
most Apostolick, yet you may be assured she shall ne're
want Reformers, if she have either Sons to be employ'd in
Rebellion, or Lands to be enjoyed by Sacriledge. A <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
then will dare to tell <hi>Moses</hi> to his face, That all the
Congregation is holy, as holy as himself, or the best em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in the Tabernacle; all Kings and Priests then; and all
this stir is rais'd, not so much that he dislikes the Order of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> but that indeed he likes his Revenue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in my Text there's care had of this. A Reformation
follows; but you'l find it brought in by no less than by
the Power Royal, <hi>whose high places, and whose altars
Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Iudah,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>This part affords Varieties; and I must therefore divide
it. Here's then first the Prime Agent in this Reformation
I nam'd, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the King. Secondly, the Extent of the
Reformation, 'twas only brought into his own Territories,
<hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Thirdly, the manner how he setled
it; 'twas done as well by teaching truth, as by reforming
corruptions: He took away the High Places, and he said,
<hi>Ye shall worship before this altar at Ierusalem.</hi> First, of the
Prime Agent, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the King.</p>
            <p>But to remove these Abuses here, did not this Prince first
abuse himself, to fit his hands for this work? Did <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
the King make his Person no less than plain Head of the
Church of <hi>Iudah?</hi> Were some Modern Tongues to have
supplied <hi>Rabshakeh</hi>'s place, this is the Theam, and this is the
Phrase they'd have chosen. And yet I assure my self this
pious Prince would have stood to't, that he was supreme
Governour, in all Causes, and over all Persons; so that
upon provocation given, he could no doubt have depos'd
the High Priest, as <hi>Solomon</hi> once did <hi>Abiathar.</hi> But yet (I
beseech you observe) 'tis one thing to burn Incense, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aher
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55788:10"/>
to enjoin that this Service be still duly done: One
thing to offer Sacrifice, another to command that no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
be offer'd, but on that one Altar at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> The first
of these belonged unto <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sons, the other to the Heirs
of <hi>David.</hi> To bar <hi>Hezekiah</hi> this Power in the Church,
were to impair his Royalties, and to deny that to the
Crown of <hi>Iudah</hi> which all Princes have still challenged;
yea, those without the Church, the Kings of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and
Monarchs of <hi>Assyria;</hi> Their Swords were Ecclesiastical.
Thus that King proclaims a Religious Fast, <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. And
<hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Dan. 3. 29. Thus from the beginning Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Princes have still done the like, and have let us see by
their Laws, that in point of Coercive Power they still kept
the Church-supremacy, as clearly appears in the <hi>Theodosian
Code,</hi> and in that of <hi>Iustinian</hi> in the <hi>Capitulars</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi>
the great, and such other collections. <hi>Iustinian,</hi> in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Novel, comes fully home in this point; <hi>Iubemus
beatissimos Archiepiscopos &amp; Patriarchas, (i.) Senioris Romae,
&amp; Constatinopoleos Novae Romae;</hi> We command, saith he,
(and as some Copies have it under the pain of Deposition
too) the most blessed Archbishop, and Patriarchs (i.) of <hi>Old
Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> then call'd <hi>New Rome,</hi> &amp;c.
If that Emperor might command all the Patriarchs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that in a business Ecclesiastical too, where then
lay the Church-supremacy? And these <hi>Novels</hi> of his were
in so high esteem with St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, that 'tis plain
in his Epistles, he decides Church-causes by them, and that
with an <hi>Ita decrevit Dominus noster Imperator;</hi> Our Lord the
Emperor hath thus rul'd it in his Laws.</p>
            <p>Besides, most plain it is, that the Old <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings held
the Work in my Text to belong to them as in chief. And
this Opinion God himself confirm'd; for throughout their
whole story you'l find, that Kings only are check'd when
the Church was corrupt, and they only prais'd when she
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55788:10"/>
mended. In those Scriptures we read but of Three Noted
Reformations, and they were all done by their Kings. By
King <hi>Asa,</hi> by this King in my Text, and the last by King
<hi>Iosiah.</hi> Those High Places alone were pulled down by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
which were set up to the worship of a false God. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
goes farther, and destroys them too, which were set up
for the false worship, though of the true only Deity. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
goes on, and removes the Groves, and such devices as
those which <hi>Solomon,</hi> and other Kings, having of old set
up, they were again renew'd in the wicked Reign of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But grant a Christian Church to be indeed corrupt, or
that really men think it is so, is't not allowed by Christ's
Law, either for Subjects, or others, against the Will of the
King, into whose care she's put, by force of Arms, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain,
or beat her to a Purity? A case of conscience you'l
find, whereby to resolve this, decided by our Saviour's
own Mouth, in the <hi>9th</hi> chap. of St. <hi>Luke;</hi> where entring,
saith the Text, into a Village of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Inhabitants
were so far from receiving the Doctrine he intended to
preach, that indeed they endur'd not his Person. Hence
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Two Sons of Thunder, begin straight
to shew their Temper; What! not receive Christ, nor
the Christian Faith! <hi>Master, shall we command fire from
heaven?</hi> For if Perswasion will not draw men unto the
Gospel thou bring'st, it must be done by Fire, or by
Sword. Our Saviour replies, <hi>Ye know not of what spirit
ye are:</hi> Ye understand not at all what thing 'tis to be a
Christian. I came not to destroy mens Lives, but to save
them; I came not to plant a Religion in Blood; no, I
leave that to <hi>Turks,</hi> and to <hi>Mahomet:</hi> Had that been my
Intent, you <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> had been no Apostles for me:
I would then have made choice of Commanders from an
Army, not of Fisher-men from their Nets. And yet in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55788:11"/>
these times have not we the like Sons of Thunder? What I
will they not receive the New <hi>Holy</hi> Discipline, the very
<hi>Scepter</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Throne</hi> of his Mediatorship (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they could do little, if they knew not how to cloath
their new Fancies in good Words), Lord, shall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Fire from Heaven? or if you will, Fire from Hell?
Shall we raise a Rebellion? Shall we by a Covenant swear
Christ into his Throne, or forswear the King out of his?
What think ye will be replied to these, and the like kind
of men, but <hi>ye know not of what spirit ye are?</hi> It's not
lawful by Blood to bring in Christian Faith; and is it
lawful by Blood to bring in that thing which they of late
call a Christian Government? It's not lawful to plant a
Church by such Force; and is it lawful thus to reform
it? They who think it is, truly for my part, I neither at
all know of what spirit they are, no, nor of what reason
neither; This I well know, of what spirit they are not;
they are of no spirit Evangelical.</p>
            <p>So then, to attempt to reform a Church in despite of
the Prince whom God has now placed her under, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
Royal Power, and can be indeed called but a more
zealous kind of Rebellion; since to cure a Church by such
drenches as these, is, no doubt, at the same time to give
Poyson to a Kingdom: and 'twas therefore decreed in that
most ancient Council of <hi>Eliberis</hi> (twenty years before
that of <hi>Nice,</hi>) <q>That if in hatred to Idolatry it self, a
private man would needs pull down Images, he should
by no means be esteemed a Martyr, if he lost his life in
that service.</q> And the Fathers there give their Reason,
because we have no example for this either from Prophets
or Apostles. No, 'twas their part to preach down High
Places, or Idols, but they well knew 'twas the Duty of
Kings, of Supreme Powers to remove them: And he can
be no Martyr for the first Table of the Law, who is in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55788:11"/>
same deed a Transgressor of the second: nor will God at all
thank him as a Reformer of his Church, who in the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
Act is no less than a plain Traitor to his Deputy. So
that as for Subjects to take up Arms against their Kings, is
by the Doctrine of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in all cases dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
so specially to do this in point of our Religion,
which so much commends and blesseth Patience, and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
and Martyrdom, either upon pretence to plant it
where it now is not, or to reform it where it has been
planted, is of all other kinds of Contentions or Wars,
the most <hi>Turkishly Antichristian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore to avoid Quarrels and Blood, 'twas <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
the King who here reforms the Church of <hi>Iudea;</hi>
But yet, durst he adventure alone upon an attempt so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and so great? No, you'l easily find in the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Text, that he had both a <hi>Council,</hi> and withal a
<hi>Rule</hi> to direct him; for if you read the 30, and the 31, of
the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Chron.</hi> you'l see this Reformation was made in
the time of a most solemn Passover, where the Priests and
Levites, the Princes and the People met; and when,
Saith the Text, chap. 30. ver. 30. <hi>Hezekiah had spoke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
words to all the Levites that taught the good knowledg
of the Lord.</hi> Yea, <hi>Iosephus</hi> seems to put into this Kings
mouth a <hi>Synodical Oration</hi> in the ninth of his <hi>Antiquities.</hi>
I say, when upon the Kings encouragement the Levites
had once taught that good Knowledg, then upon such
counsel, such direction as this, then came the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
For so <hi>Moses</hi> was plain in the blessing he gave upon
the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi: They shall teach Iacob thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Israel thy Law, Deut.</hi> 33. at the 10. And as he
had a <hi>Council,</hi> so 'tis as plain by the self-same words he had
a <hi>Rule</hi> too to go by, 'twas the <hi>good Knowledg of the Lord,</hi>
which is in <hi>Moses</hi> phrase <hi>his Iudgments and his Law:</hi> And
lest he should perhaps err in the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55788:12"/>
Text, he had the help of the best Comment too, as
you but now heard from the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> 'twas the sense
and practice of the Hebrew Church, whilst she was yet
Primitive.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was reformed by the Power
Royal, by a Power that made use of the like Counsel,
and like Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a truth I think none here doubts of; if
any do, 'twill be soon clear'd both from our Stories and
our Laws; that first <hi>Our Liturgy</hi> which Reform'd Gods
Publick Service, was compos'd by Bishops and others of
great Knowledg in Antiquity, many whereof attained
the Honour of Martyrdom: And then the Book of our
<hi>Articles</hi> which reformed the Theological Tenets, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Doctrines of our Church, were Compiled by <hi>Synods,</hi>
by Convocations, by the two Solemn Provincial Councils
of <hi>London,</hi> or if you will, the two National, because both
our Provinces concurr'd in the same truth, in the years 52
and 62. <hi>And that our Rule</hi> was the same they here used in
<hi>Iewry,</hi> Gods word interpreted by the Sense and Practice
of the Ancient Church, appears in the next Synod after,
where 'tis decreed in plain words, <q>That whosoever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to teach any truth as necessary to salvation,
which he is not able to make good by Text, as 'twas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the Fathers, and the Ancient Church,
shall be expos'd to Ecclesiastical Censure, and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Correction.</q> And we cannot think our Church
would enjoyn a <hi>Rule</hi> to her Sons, which yet she had
not kept her self. In this Point then we are hand in
hand with <hi>Iudah;</hi> the same Power, the same Council,
the same Rule. I go to the next following, <hi>The Extent of
the Reformation:</hi> 'twas only set up in his own Territories,
<hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55788:12"/>
Indeed <hi>Hezekiah</hi> wrote Letters, and sent to the remains
of the Ten Tribes, to joyn in this great Action with him;
but they, for the most part, contemn'd his Message, and
slighted his Attempt, <hi>2 Chron.</hi> 30. The King did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well: For 'twas to be much wished, that in a Design
so highly pious as this, all <hi>Israel</hi> would have been unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous:
But yet if <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and others, will refuse to hear,
<hi>Iudah</hi> must mend alone. How generally a Reformation
was desir'd in these parts of Christendom, by men of the
choicest Note, both for Learning and Piety, 'twere no hard
Task at all to shew you. Nay, in the very Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> Ten several Kingdoms and States desir'd the <hi>Cup</hi> for
the People, both by their Ambassadors, and their Prelates:
Many press'd for a Redress of Service in an unknown
Tongue; many for many other particulars: All were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd,
and the Reason plain; Order was there taken (you
may guess by whom), that there were more <hi>Italian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi>
sometimes by Twenty, sometimes by an Hundred,
than there were of all the World besides; so that in effect
all this Christendom would have reformed her self, had
not <hi>Italy</hi> oppos'd it. Nor can that be call'd a <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
('twas but <hi>Patriarchal</hi> at the <hi>largest</hi>) since the <hi>Bishops</hi>
of the <hi>East,</hi> and other great Churches, were not there, no,
nor those Three long since so most famous Patriarchs of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> who though
they may be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in that Tenet of the <hi>Procession of the
Holy Ghost,</hi> yet whatever Error they are in, in that point,
they are in no Heresie, as is confess'd by <hi>P. Lombard</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and has been oft made unanswerably good, by Men as
well vers'd in controversal Points, as any Christendom has
bred. But 'tis the Artifice of the <hi>Western</hi> Church, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the World, that those ancient parts are now fallen
from the Church, that so within the Curtains of their
own <hi>Patriarchate</hi> she may have General Councils, and an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55788:13"/>
universal Church; and so though she now make not near
a Third part of the Christian World, yet with the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
she dares profess her self the only Catholick Church,
and so damns all Mankind without her. Neither yet do I
deny, nay, I affirm it rather, That a true General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
could best prescribe Remedies unto so large a Disease;
but to convoke that, was extreamly difficult, and we are all
sure 'twas not done. For what Christian Princes can now
give safe conduct to the Bishops and Patriarchs of those
remoter parts of the Church? So then, if neither a true
General Council, nor free Patriarchal, could be had, were't
not strange Imprudence to refuse a Cure, because we could
not use the best Physicians? In this case no doubt it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
holds, what <hi>Gerson,</hi> the Learned Chancellor of
<hi>Paris,</hi> has spoken out without Limitation, and he (as <hi>Bell.</hi>
affirms) was, <hi>Vir doctus &amp; pius;</hi> he was a learned and a
good man too; and you shall hear that good mans words;
<hi>Nolo tamen dicere,</hi> &amp;c. <q>I will not say, faith he, but the
Church may be reformed by parts; yea, this is necessary,
and to effect it Provincial Councils may suffice, and in
some things Diocesan:</q> 'tis in his <hi>Tract. de Gen. Con. uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
obed.</hi> And indeed Particular Churches have gone far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this kind than our dear Mother e're dream'd of.
For <hi>four things</hi> there are chiefly of Synodical Cognizance,
<hi>Articles of Faith, Forms of Divine Worship, Theological
Conclusions for the Peace of each Church, and the points of
Ceremony.</hi> Only these Three last were the Subject of our
Reformation, we still adhering unto the <hi>Three Creeds,</hi>
which are the Faith of the Church Catholick. But whence
came <hi>Filio<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>
               </hi> in Two of these Three Creeds, if not in a
Provincial Synod? In a General, no man thinks it did:
And some Learned men ascribe that Addition of Faith to
the <hi>Eighth Synod of Toledo.</hi> And if a Provincial of <hi>Spain</hi>
may thus decide Points of Faith, I understand not why a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55788:13"/>
National of <hi>England</hi> may not be heard in far less matters.
Nay, in the Fourth of <hi>Toledo</hi> 'twas challeng'd by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as the proper Right of a National Synod, that it
might decide Points of Faith, as clearly appears in the 3.
<hi>Can.</hi> of that Council.</p>
            <p>You see then the Parallel still holds; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> reform'd
but his Two Tribes, and our <hi>English Princes</hi> but their own
Territories. I come to the last of this Second General.
The manner of the Reformation; He did as well teach the
truth, as reform the corruptions: <hi>He took away the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and he said, Ye shall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Ye shall worship before <hi>one altar;</hi> so his words are set
down, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. at the <hi>12th.</hi> He did not only remove
their Errors, as if that past Triumph might suffice them;
but for the future he enjoin'd the People to employ their
Devotion according to God's sacred Law. And did not
we so too? Witness our <hi>Catechisms,</hi> and our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> our
many Forms of <hi>Devotion</hi> to God, and our many enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of those Moral Duties we owe to the several ranks
of our Neighbours. 'Tis then but a Calumny, and a fond
one too, to call our Faith a Negative Religion, as if to
believe that some Men are erroneous, were the sole Article
of all our Churches Creed. Truth is, we may thank them
for it, that 'tis with us as with <hi>Iudah;</hi> our <hi>Profession</hi> must
needs now contain some <hi>Negatives: High places</hi> are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,
<hi>maim'd Sacraments</hi> must not be suffered, nor <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
ador'd; but yet they may soon see our <hi>Positive</hi> Tracts
are more large than our Polemicks, and that we have taken
more pains to make men good, than to make them Learned
or Judicious.</p>
            <p>I heartily wish I could in this regard as well defend
some Sons of our Church, as I am sure I can our Church it
self. For many mens ill carriage seem to divide the two
clauses here, which are so nearly join'd in my Text. They,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55788:14"/>
like well to remove High Places and Altars, in this regard,
none shall shew more Zeal than they; nay, under preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of such corruptions as these, if you please, remove
Church and all. But when we once come to this, <hi>Ye shall
worship before one altar;</hi> ye shall bow down, ye shall bend
your selves (for so the word here imports), ye shall be
devout, and religious; and this not only in your inmost
thoughts, but in your outward Forms of Deportment;
they like no such Reformation; 'tis enough to save them,
that they have learned to hate <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they are no
superstitious Persons. Let not such men deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
'T will one day rise up in Judgment, 'twill plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and severely too, that they have been bred
Members of such a reform'd Church, and yet neither in
their Devotions, nor their Lives themselves, have they
shew'd the least Reformation: What good will it do these
to have been so Christianly allow'd the Blessed <hi>Cup</hi> in the
Sacrament, when yet either they come not at all, or come
in their sins to receive it? What will it avail thee to have
God's Service perform'd in a Language thou <hi>understand'st,</hi>
when either very seldom thou hearest it read, or dost not
heed at all, though thou hear it? How will that poor man,
whom perhaps thou now pitiest, plead against thee at that
Last Bar of Christ's Judgment? I indeed came seldom, and
with small Devotion to that Sacrament, because I was there
robb'd of that sacred <hi>Cup</hi> which I know Thou thy self
had'st left me. I seldom came to God's Publick <hi>Service;</hi>
and being there, I fix'd my Mind on some secular Lusts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I could not understand it: And in punishment shall
I be equall'd to him who was <hi>allowed the Cup,</hi> and in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service might have <hi>understood</hi> both all Hymns and
Prayers? Believe it, the Reformation was made not to
boast of, but to use: And he who shall declare, that he
likes the thing, and yet is no whit the better for it, runs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55788:14"/>
at the best but into a kind of Covetousness, (a sin St. <hi>Paul</hi>
call'd Idolatry) for, with such miserable Churls, he loves
indeed to have the power of this great Wealth, and yet he
doth ne're mean to use it. But we ought to know, that
when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> has once removed these High Places here,
'tis to this great end especially, that thenceforth we should
be the more carefully devout before that allowed Altar at
<hi>Ierusalem:</hi> And yet when we have done this, we must
look for Scorns and Reproaches; For if <hi>Iudah,</hi> or any
Child of hers, be grown good, you may surely expect
there will be straight work for <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> as you'l see in my
last part, The Reformation censur'd, it's tax'd of <hi>Novelty,</hi>
and <hi>Schism,</hi> and the like. <hi>But if ye say, We trust in the Lord
our God, is not that he,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>'Twas in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s time, an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Traditon, that
this <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> was born a <hi>Iew;</hi> so that Father upon the
<hi>36th</hi> of <hi>Esay.</hi> Indeed so it often falls out, that <hi>Iudah</hi> has
no man a more bitter Enemy, than when one of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
becomes a Fugitive. Nor has our Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Church
been by any more violently oppos'd, than by the
hands who have left her, by the hands of those sicklemen,
whose persons she did once baptize.</p>
            <p>But leave the Man, come to his Words; <hi>If ye say unto
me, We trust in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. You see <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> himself
was grown so much a Divine, as to aver openly, That he
who puts his Hand to overturn that Religion he professes;
yea, that puts his Hand to overturn it too at the same
time while he likes it, pretend what he will, he trusts
not in God, he trusts perhaps in the <hi>Syrians,</hi> or in
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>Is not this he whose altars,</hi> &amp;c. He, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>'s
old God; and therefore 'twas no less than plain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
to leave him: These High Places and Altars, as he
conceiv'd, were his too: And to leave off to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55788:15"/>
in that Service they once us'd, what can this be less
than <hi>a Schism?</hi> And have not we been long since; nay,
are we not reproached even unto this day with the very
self-same Imputations? <hi>They have set up a new Church; they
are wicked Schismaticks:</hi> So that should the most modest
man entertain that Dream of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> of the transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
of Souls from one body to another, he would not
stick at all to affirm, that he who was <hi>once Rabshakeh,</hi> was
<hi>since</hi> some tart Pen-man of this latter Century.</p>
            <p>I'le speak first of that Tax, the reproach of <hi>Novelty:</hi>
And I beseech you mark how <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> has here fram'd his
Words. He strives to lay all upon this <hi>Present</hi> King; <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah
took away,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah said;</hi> No mention that
this Fact was enjoyn'd by <hi>Moses;</hi> aud practis'd too by the
<hi>Hebrew Church,</hi> whilst she was the Primitive. Thus let
but <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> once tell the tale, and a Church larely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
shall indeed appear to be but a late founded Church.
Ignorance may perhaps excuse this Commander here in my
Text; but some Learned men in our times are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
to blame: for you'l soon see how fond are their
main Exceptions, do but suppose their Words put into the
Mouth of <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> when as here in my Text, at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
he be-spake the besieg'd men upon the Wall; <q>Hear,
O ye <hi>Iews,</hi> will your aged Synagogue at length turn No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velist?
Your Fathers worshipp'd in these High Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
but ye now say, <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s the place; where was
the Church before <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> Was't no where, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible?
Were your Predecessors blinded with one joint
consent? Or are ye only become more clear of sight,
what! than <hi>Solomon</hi> the wise, or <hi>Asa</hi> the religious? Does
your God sometime forsake his Church, or will for Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of Years suffer it to be so constantly obscur'd? Let
not this pure Prince deceive you still with these fond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start
toys; for 'tis your <hi>Iudah's</hi> greatest Fame that she's
thought very Ancient.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55788:15"/>
What <hi>Iew,</hi> I wonder, could this speech move, unless
'twere to laughter? <hi>Where was their Church before Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah?</hi>
In the same place, and among the same People, and
'twas still the very self-same Church: I say, the same in
truth of essence (for so's a <hi>Thief</hi> a <hi>True</hi> man) but not in
condition or in quality: for formerly it was corrupt, now
reform'd by the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> formerly it had heen dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
<hi>diseas'd,</hi> but 'twas now <hi>cured</hi> by <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Let
them ask <hi>Naaman</hi> too, where was he before <hi>Elisha</hi> had
heal'd him? Would he not divide the Question, He was
long before, but he was withal Leprous: And <hi>Palestine</hi>
had still a Church, but God knows 'twas a corrupt one. So
then he who calls a reform'd Church <hi>new,</hi> because 'tis new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reform'd, might as well call <hi>Naaman</hi> a child too, because
after his cure the Text plainly says his flesh came again like
a child's. But in earnest, is our Age to be accounted from
our recovery? Or is a man no Older than his Health? By
this Philosophy they might perswade the Leper, that he
bore Office in the <hi>Syrian</hi> Court before he was a Year Old.
Let therefore the Modern <hi>Rabshakeh</hi>'s cease to upbraid us
with such known petty Cavils, our Church was no more
invisible than that of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and might as well be before
<hi>Luther</hi> was, as theirs before <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They tax us of <hi>Schism;</hi> which is questionless
a great sin, being in frequent Texts very sharply condemn'd
in Scripture. 'Tis then committed when there is a Scissure,
a Breach, an uncharitable Division made, betwixt those
men especially, which in point of Religion were once
joyn'd aud linkt together. So that were this Rupture
is, there is sin without doubt; all the Question is, on
which side the Crime must lie; sometimes it may lie on
both, but it ever lies on him that gives just cause of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
not ever on him that divides. <hi>Abraham</hi> did divide
from his Idolatrous Kindred, and so did St. <hi>Paul</hi> from his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55788:16"/>
old friends the <hi>Iews.</hi> The <hi>Orthodox Christians</hi> were forc'd
to do the like when <hi>Arrianism</hi> did prevail: and yet in
the opinon of these <hi>Rabshakehs</hi> themselves, neither <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
not St. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor those old Christians were Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.
Thus when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> once had reform'd the
Church of <hi>Iudea,</hi> no man can think a Conscientious <hi>Iew</hi>
would at all communicate in the service of these High
Places; he did divide from it without doubt, although
before, either by custom or ignorance, or the like, he did
it frequently without Scruple. And yet might such a <hi>Iew</hi>
be held guilty of Schism? no more sure than <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
who both did and enjoyn'd the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet the Holy
Ghost in this History here does in express terms commend
him; in the fourth verse of this Chapter he commends
him as much for reforming the Church as he does for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like <hi>David.</hi> So that to tax him, were indeed to affirm,
that the Spirit of God commends a Schismatick himself for
the very act of his schism.</p>
            <p>Thus then they are not still they who divide, but they
who give or continue the just cause of Division, who are
guilty of that sin we speak of. But yet since in Church-controversies
'tis not so easie to judg what makes that just
cause I nam'd, and that no wise man can think it fit it
should be left to each private judgment: since in such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
as these, men are extreamly apt to forget all bonds
of Peace, and for possession sometimes of a little suppos'd
truth, quit indeed their whole Estate of Charity: therefore
the Ancients do oft define schism by these two grand notes
or Characters.</p>
            <p>First, when men make Divisions in point of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the consent of their lawful Pastors: 'tis so defined
by <hi>St. Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>St. Ierom,</hi> and others. Secondly, when
men <hi>cast</hi> out of the Church Catholick, and so damn to
Hell all that hold not their opinions. And this <hi>St. Austin</hi>
doth oft times call schism in the <hi>Donatists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55788:16"/>
And now take Schism in what sense, under what note
you please, our Mother Church is guiltless of that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
First take it for a Division in Gods publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
She did no more in that point than what was here
done by <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> since she had as clear Text, and so as
just cause, To give the <hi>Cup</hi> to the People; to <hi>turn</hi> their
Devotions into a language they <hi>understood,</hi> as this King
here had, to bring the <hi>Iews</hi> from their Old Mass in high
places, unto that one Altar at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Nay the cause
we had, was more just than that of <hi>Iudah:</hi> because the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Western Church were all backt by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
Men were constrain'd into Errors; when yet we
read not at all that if a pious <hi>Iew</hi> would have kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto that one Altar at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he was either checkt
by their Kings, or opprest by their Priests, or condemn'd
to <hi>Tophet</hi> by their Sanhedrim.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take Schism for an opposition made against
our lawful Pastors: and our Church you'l find was not
guilty in this matter neither. For at that time when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was made, we were under our own <hi>Synods</hi> only,
and with what readiness they joyn'd in this grand Work,
you have heard in my second General. 'Tis true, that for
some hundreds of years we had been under a known Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power (but yet such a Power as came not amongst
us but by the breach of a great General Council, as is clear
from the last Canon of the first of <hi>Ephesus</hi>) A Power, I say,
Patriarchal, and so meerly of Ecclesiastical Right, not of
Divine Institution. A Power which in the Ancient Church
had been set up by <hi>Emperors,</hi> as that of <hi>Iustiniana prima</hi>
by <hi>Iustinian</hi> in his <hi>11th Novel:</hi> 
               <q>Nay 'twas openly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the great Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that all the
Patriarchs had gain'd their Power meerly by Custom,
and by Imperial Countenance:</q> So that 'tis a <hi>Power that
may be taken away,</hi> without all doubt taken away, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55788:17"/>
               <hi>Gerson</hi> the wise Chancellor of <hi>Paris</hi> would not have
written in <hi>France, De au<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eribilitate Papae. England</hi> went
f<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rther, and did indeed remove that, which others did but
say was removable: but removed it was before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
that removed it not, as men well know that
know our Laws; and so we were left but under our own
<hi>Synods</hi> only; to that now besides a General Council
which we are willing to hear, we can resist no lawful
Pastors but our own.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Take Schism for that monstrous height of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness,
when with the <hi>Donatists</hi> those men who
are but a part of the Church, dare call themselves the
Church Catholick, and so dare damn all the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who refuse to imbrace their opinions; I could name
you those who are guilty of this, but I am sure our Dear
Mother is not, who has been so mild to those that have
most highly oppos'd Her, that besides the Reproaches of
Novelty and Schism, you all well know she hath been long
reproached for her Charity. And yet when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> did in his full <hi>Synod</hi> against the
sense of the whole Church set up plain Rebaptization,
St. <hi>Austin</hi> defends him from the Tax of <hi>Schism,</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he began that Provincial Council with this charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Clause, <hi>Nemineni damnantes, nec a jure Communionis
quempiam, si diversum senserit, removentes,</hi> 
               <q>We decree
this, saith he, but yet we damn no man, nor do we bar
any from the Communion of <hi>Africk</hi> though he think
the quite contrary.</q> And how punctually have we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
this Rule of good old St. <hi>Cyprian?</hi> In these late
Church-Controversies, Opinions indeed, and Actions we
condemn (and so did that Father too) but yet we damn no
mans Person. For 'tis he Tenor of God Laws, <hi>Thou shalt
love thy Neighbour,</hi> his Person, <hi>as thy self;</hi> but 'tis not said,
Thou shalt love his <hi>Deeds</hi> or <hi>Opinions.</hi> For though what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55788:17"/>
men act or opine may be in it self damnable, yet (where
they are not wilfully perverse) customary breeding joyn'd
with ignorance or the like, may excuse the men from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And how far we have been, in such differences
as these, from debatring any Man or Communion, yea,
even those that heretofore did oppose, and now perhaps
do disdain us, I appeal to the first twelve years of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where men apparently known to have kept their
old opinions, were not only <hi>received</hi> into the Service of
our Church, but were <hi>admitted</hi> to the <hi>Eucharist</hi> it self,
the very highest act of Communion.</p>
            <p>And now I have gone through my Text, and shall only
add, That I scarce know any Scruple, any Query they
make, that may not well be solv'd from this Parallel.
They ask why their opinions should be condemn'd for
Errors, if we know not the <hi>precise time</hi> when they rose?
yes, the High Places here were gross Errors, and yet the
most learned dare not say, whether they rose in the time
of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> or in the days of King <hi>Solomon.</hi> They ask
whether our Forefathers were <hi>damn'd,</hi> who, we grant,
dyed in their Religion? And we demand, whether for so
many hundred years were all the <hi>Iews damn'd</hi> that did
worship God in High Places? I think they were not, if
they liv'd <hi>pious</hi> lives, and kept themselves from all wilful
ignorance. For then, tho the <hi>Errors</hi> of both Churches,
the Hebrew and the Christian too, were in themselves
no less than damnable; yet by ignorance, or by the like
Apology with this, tho they made no express repentance
for a sin they knew not; yet by the ordinary dispensation
of Divine Grace, the men, we think, escap'd damnation.
But I have one Query more, <hi>a Case of Conscience</hi> to leave
with you. <q>Suppose a Jew that had been rightly bred in
the Reformation of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> should at length fall
back to do Sacrifice in the High Places, upon confidence
that his Forefathers might well be saved in that Service,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55788:18"/>
whether were not this man indeed guilty of murther,
(<hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 4.) and so not in state of Salvation, unless by
express Repentance he turn back to God, for this very
Apostacy?</q> The <hi>Resolution</hi> is easy, it scarce needs <hi>Levi</hi>'s
help: and I beseech you let it be thought on, and then I
hope, to turn Apostate from a true Reformed Church will
be held no slight trivial matter.</p>
            <p>All this is to let you see the great Likeness betwixt the
<hi>two Churches</hi> I have nam'd, <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> both, were
reform'd, by a Power, by a Council and Rule most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable,
without Schism, without Rebellion; in both
the Ceremonies remain'd decent, the Service of God dayly,
and honourable, and which is more than this, tho they
both remov'd the forbidden Altars, yet both kept the old
Priesthood too. And since God in so clear Text did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the one, why should any man ever doubt the other?
And yet <hi>Iudah</hi> in my Text was almost eaten out by the
Sword: Alas, we are in this but too like her: Although
perhaps we are more like this poor Church, when she was
yet more miserable, when she mixed her tears with the sad
tenor of those words: Ps. 13. 7. <hi>By the waters of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
we sat down and wept, when we remembred thee, O Sion.</hi>
For let me assure you, 'twas a distressed reform'd Church
they there remembred, and no marvel then if that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
were in tears: either in tears of <hi>Repentance,</hi> that their
own foul sins had brought on this great Desolation: or
else in tears of <hi>longing</hi> to see that famous Church once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd,
to see God again serv'd in the beauty of holiness,
that their Ravished Souls might once more ascend in
Prayers and Hymns, or Hallelujahs, in one of the Old
Songs of <hi>Sion.</hi> Let us but sow in <hi>such</hi> tears as these, and
I should certainly hope we should e're long reap in joy; in
joy temporal, to see our King and our selves in Peace, and
in joy spiritual, to see that Church of God re-established
<hi>Which God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
