            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepossessed with a conceite of the presbyteriall government and paritie of Ministers (which, good man! was his ouersight) will not allow that by this word Angell should be ment the Byshop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or the Byshop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> or the Byshop of <hi>Pergamos</hi> &amp;c. and yet he opens this word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terme which is equivalent to <hi>Byshop,</hi> and that is <gap reason="foreign">

I am sure that learned and godly <hi>Calvin,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee speake much and inveigh greatly against the tyrannicall pride and pompe of the Prelates and Byshops in Poperie, yet he did never dislike of the calling it selfe, but doth confesse it to be of GOD, and to be of an ancient standing in the Church, even in the <hi>Prime</hi> and most <hi>Pure</hi> age of it; wherein hee saith there was alwayes one selected out of the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and set over them as an overseer or Byshop, <hi>ne</hi>

Therefore we thinke thus, that in the mother Cities there were Byshops, and that therefore this word Angell reacheth vnto them; and in the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches appending there were ordinarie Pastors, and that this title of Angell doth belong also unto them. Byshops and Ministers are Angells. I doe not now <note place="margin">Obseruation.</note> speake of their nature, but of their office. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to say as the matter is, this word <hi>Angell</hi> is <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>

               <hi>officij non naturae,</hi> a name that doth rather import the office then the nature of that thing which is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Thus S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> who was the Minister of <note place="margin">Probation.</note> Christ, is called the Angell of the Lord, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3. and I haue heard some learned Divines of opinion upon the mentioning of that place of the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. That <hi>Women ought to haue power on their heads because of the Angels</hi> (and it is <hi>Lyra's</hi> exposition too <note place="margin">Lyra.</note> upon that text) that by Angels there are understood Gods Ministers. The Apostles argument being this. Women when they come to Church ought to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and veyled, least they be occasions of sinne and a stumbling blocke to the Minister in the exercise and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19743:5"/>
performance of his holy function. For if they should appeare in the Congregation with their heads unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, their haire displayed, their breasts naked; what doe they know but that by gazing upon them, the Minister might withdraw his mind from his busines, and so be hindered or disabled for that time in the performance of his holy function? therefore ought the women to haue power on their heads, because of the Angels, that is, the Ministers. Howsoeuer that interpretation hold, sure I am that the Byshop of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> and the Ministers of the other Churches here in this Chapter are called Angels, <hi>To the Angell of the Church of Pergamos.</hi> This title brings to our <note place="margin">Use I.</note> consideration these two things. 1. The dutie of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, 2. The dignitie of our calling. First, our dutie. My beloued brethren of the Clergie, you are Angels, that is, Gods Messengers and Embassadors; and therefore with all diligence and faithfulnesse you must remember to deliver Gods word unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without adding or diminishing; for that is the propertie of a messenger. <hi>Thou shalt therefore receiue the word at my mouth and deliver it vnto them,</hi> saith the Lord to the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. Nay this meditation must ascend yet higher, you are Angels, and therefore ought yee as chearefully and readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Gods will here on earth even as the Angels do it in heaven, who stand ever in his presence readie prest to doe his commandement. They are spirits; you are men; both are Ministers. They <hi>ministring Spirits</hi> in heaven, you <hi>ministering Angels</hi> on earth; and therefore see that you giue none offence in any thing, but approue your selues as the Ministers of God in all puritie and alacritie; for these are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Angels. The second thing, that I told you <note place="margin">Use II.</note> this title or appellation pointed at, was the dignitie of our calling. The Ministerie, as the world goes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19743:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now a dayes, is a profession that is more subject to contempt and vile usage then any calling whatsoeuer. And therefore the Lord, that he might meete the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with those base conceits the wordlings haue of his servants, and the more to advance the honour of his owne ordinance, hee hath beene pleased in the scriptures to grace the Ministers of the word with as faire and honourable titles and appellations, as any other calling whatsoeuer. To what end should I now recite them all? Let it suffice that in the text they are called Angels. Doest thou thinke to rayle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile the <hi>Kings messenger,</hi> and yet be guiltlesse? and will'st thou kick and spurne against thy Pastor, the <hi>messenger of the Lord of hostes,</hi> and thinke to goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished? What man! Doest thou not esteeme high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Angels?</hi> how comes it about then that thou esteemest so basely of the <hi>Miuisters?</hi> oh my Christian brethren, deale not so foolishly, as to say or thinke it of thy Minister that he is but a base Pedanticall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or a poore bell'd preist. For, I tell you of a truth, the Lord will not suffer these flowts and scoffs to goe unrevenged. And the more his Ministers are scorned of wordlings, the more honor he lookes should be put upon them by you that are his servants, according to his owne example. And therefore howsoever the world thinkes of us, yet doe not you account of a Minister as of an ordinarie man; for he is an Angell upon earth. Let him not be twitted and scorned, let him not be sleighted and neglected, let him not be coursly and roughly entertained, but let him be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced and respected and honoured according to his place and calling; for he is an Angell. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you haue an excellent patterne in the <hi>Galathians,</hi> whose religious and chearefull entertainement of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is set downe for your imitation; to teach you with what reverence and affection you ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19743:6"/>
a good Minister, even no otherwise then they did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that was as an Angell. So he testifies of them. <hi>Yee received mee as an Angell of God. Galat.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly (before wee leaue this first part) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue here that the Angell is confined to his place. <note place="margin">Observat.</note> Hee is not a Minister <hi>at large,</hi> but the Angell of <hi>this Church.</hi> Not of all the Churches, but of this Church. The name of <hi>Oecamenicull</hi> or <hi>Universall Byshop</hi> was not heard of in those dayes. That is a later broode of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Let him be a <hi>Byshop,</hi> he is confined to his owne charge. Let him bee an inferiour <hi>Minister,</hi> Hee is confined to his proper cure, the first Angell at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the second at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the third at <hi>Pergamos.</hi> Hee must not step beyond his limits. I grant the Byshop hath a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger scope like vnto that <hi>prime and common intelligence</hi> the Philosophers speake of which regulates the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mobile</hi> in that most apparant <hi>diurnall motion</hi> common to all the Spheres; the inferiour Ministers being those other <hi>particular Angells or intelligences</hi> (according to that opinion) assisting each particular orbe in his owne proper <hi>periodicall motion;</hi> yet both are limited. If hee be a <hi>Byshop,</hi> hee is limited to his owne <hi>Diocesse,</hi> and hee must not be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a busy Bishop in another mans <hi>Diocesse.</hi> If he be an inferiour <hi>Pastor,</hi> hee hath his particular <hi>flocke</hi> too, <hi>whereof the holy Ghost hath made him a Byshop or an Overseer,</hi> as the word imports, and he must <hi>take heed unto that,</hi> Act. 20. No Pastor unconfined to some Church. No Byshop set over all Churches. It is true Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe that he had the care <note place="margin">Proleps.</note> of all the Churches, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. But first, it is one thing to haue a <hi>Christian care</hi> and another thing to haue a <hi>particular charge</hi> over all Churches. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apostle, and that office
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19743:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is non-dated long agoe. And I take it, this is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between an Apostle and a Byshop or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Pastor; that the Apostles were not confined to any set place, but were appointed to <hi>goe into all the world, and to preach the Gospell to every creature:</hi> but <hi>Byshops, and Pastors</hi> are confined to their owne Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuites and Churches; <hi>To the Angell of the Church of Pergamos.</hi>

            <p>I haue done with the <hi>Superscription,</hi> I come now <note place="margin">II.</note> to the Secretaries Commission, in this word, <hi>Write]</hi> It is the voyce of Gods spirit to Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> A word much used in scripture, but especially in this booke of <hi>Revelation</hi> very frequently. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Write</hi> the things that thou hast seene. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. 13.

So that what S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the <hi>whole</hi> Scripture, we may truly affirme it of <hi>this</hi> booke, that it is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>given from God by inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Which I note against the errour of all such as haue either <hi>doubted</hi> or <hi>denyed</hi> this booke to be in the <note place="margin">Use.</note> Canon of scripture, or of authenticall authority.

And therefore, because he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19743:7"/>
would graciously descend to our weakenesse, he hath used the Ministerie of his servants to deliver unto vs his holy Oracles; not that he needed their helpe at all, as Kings and great men neede their Secretaries, but onely to remember us of these 2. short instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. 1. To let us see our owne weakenesse, that we <note place="margin">Use.</note> are not able to sustaine Gods immediate presence, and 2. to teach vs a necessary and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use of the ministerie, which God hath established in the Church meerely for our benefit. Thirdly, <note place="margin">Observat. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Write.</hi> And why must these things be written? was it not enough to haue them delivered over by word of mouth from the father to the sonne, and so haue remained as a Tradition perpetually in the Church, but they must be written? But who is this that calls Gods actions into question? Wee see it was his will to haue these things written, and let us rest in that, and know that it was not expedient for vs that it should be otherwise. If they had not beene written; peradventure, nay without all peradventure, they would haue beene corrupted and received addition or diminution according either to the over-quick or over-dull capacities of men in the long line of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, but being once written, that feare is past.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The text will not admit of any addition, but it will plainely appeare to be interlined, and their can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now be taken from the text, but it will plainely appeare to be blotted out.</q> The Papists may tell us that the <hi>Canon of the Scripture</hi> is not perfect <note place="margin">Use.</note> unlesse we adde thereunto <hi>unwritten Traditions.</hi> But we know the Canon is perfect, <hi>Adoroplenitudinem Scripturarum</hi> saies <hi>Tertullian,</hi> I adore the perfection of the scripture, and we dare not adde any thing to it.

They may tell vs of a twofold word of God. <hi>Scriptum &amp; non Scriptum,</hi> the one <hi>written,</hi> the other <hi>unwritten.</hi> But we cannot admit of this distinction. If it be the the word of God, it is written; as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith excellently, <hi>Quod non legi, usurpare non debeo.</hi> I dare not make use of any thing as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique proofe that I read not written in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Write.</hi> Fourthly <hi>Write.</hi> Words you know are <note place="margin">Observat. 4.</note> but a winde and they quickly vanish in the aire with the sound, <hi>sed littera scripta manet,</hi> if they be once put in writing, then they stand upon a sure record both for our owne present use and the benefit of all posterity. And therefore when the Lord had wrought a great deliverance for his people, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith, <hi>This shall bee written for them that come after, and the people which are yet unhorne shall praise the Lord.</hi> They are not content to praise God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for his deliverance, but they will haue it <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe</hi> for them that come after, that they also may haue occasion thereby to praise the Lord. These things then must be <hi>written,</hi> both for their use that <hi>then lived,</hi> and also for our <hi>benefit,</hi> that by this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes they might the better be preserved in the Church, to be read and learned of us.

Now the word of God is called a sword in a double relation. 1. In relation to <hi>Christ,</hi> 2. In relation to <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, in relation to <hi>Christ</hi> the word that is the <hi>sword</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Observat 1.</note> is an embleeme of his Majestie and authority in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Church, and shewes him to be a King. Kings and Princes you know haue the <hi>sword borne before them,</hi> as an ensigne of their authority: So Christ our blessed Saviour is no sooner made King of the Church, but he hath this <hi>sword set up before him</hi> as a token of his Majestie, as you shall finde in the 2. <hi>Psalme. I haue set my King upon my holy hill of Sion, I will preach the law whereof the Lord hath</hi>

               <hi>said &amp;c, vers.</hi> 6. <hi>I haue set my King,</hi> there Christ is made an appointed King of the Church: <hi>I will preach the law,</hi> and there is the sword set up before him, whereby he is to governe the Church unto the end, and that is the preaching of the word. And hereof you haue a most manifest proofe in that description of Christ, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19. where he is set out in his full glory, <hi>Upon a white horse with many crownes on his head</hi> and with his heavenly guard and attendants about him, but where is the sword? It is presently said in the next words that <hi>out of his mouth there came a sharpe sword that with it he might smite the Nations and rule them with an iron rod.</hi> This place consorts wholly with the 2. <hi>Psalme.</hi> Yet that we might not at all doubt of whom this scripture is ment, his name is called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> that is, the essentiall word of the Father <hi>vers.</hi> 13. and <hi>verse</hi> 16. he is called <hi>King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi> By which it is plaine that in relation to Christ, this sword is an embleeme of his authority and dominion ouer the Church. And let us make this use of it, that seeing Christ <note place="margin">Use.</note>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:19743:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath set up the word in the Church for our gouerment, let us learne like obedient Subjects to submit our selues to Gods ordinance, and giue up our selues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be guided and governed by the scepter of Christs word. Let it haue such sway and authority in our hearts, that whatsoever we finde therein <hi>condemned,</hi> we may <hi>avoyd</hi> that, and whatsoeuer we finde therein <hi>commended,</hi> we may <hi>follow after</hi> that; and be sure we doe nothing, if it be possible, for which we haue not some ground in the scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In relation to <hi>Christians,</hi> the word of God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a sword, and that in a twofold respect. 1. In res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of that it worketh <hi>in them;</hi> 2. In respect of that it worketh <hi>for them.</hi> First for that it <hi>worketh in them;</hi> so this appellation of a sword setteth out the vertue and power and efficacie of the word of God. It is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full word and lively in operation, yea <hi>sharper then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

               <hi>of the soule and the spirit, of the joynts and the marrow and is a discerner of the secret thoughts and intents of the heart. Heb,</hi> 4. 12. No wonder then (as it hath beene observed) that in some congregations whilest the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister was speaking in the Pulpit, there appeared <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction</hi> in the <hi>hearts, teares</hi> in the <hi>eyes, blushes</hi> in the <hi>cheekes, feare</hi> in the <hi>consciences,</hi> and a kinde of <hi>horror</hi> over all the <hi>body</hi> of the auditorie. For why? it was not the power of him that spake, but the power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the word that he spake, which wrought all those passions and strange motions in the hearers.

               <hi>Iuvenal</hi> a Poet spake it of <hi>Lucilius</hi> another Poet. I may more truely affirme of a Preacher, that brandisheth this glittering Sword and layeth about him manfully to strike downe sinne and impietie, that he makes men

sometime to wax red, sometime to grow pale, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to swet and fret and scratch where it doth not itch, and to be so exceedingly mooved, as though they were sitting vpon nettles or standing upon thornes, and all this from the force and power of Gods word, which is liuely in operation, and pierceth deeper then a two-edged Sword and is privie unto all their secret and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some sinnes be they neuer so retired, and enveloped ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so closely in the inmost corner of the heart. So that, if men would rightly consider, it is the most foolish thing in the world for a man to resolue to liue in any <note place="margin">Use.</note> knowne sin, &amp; yet to desire to liue under the ministerie of the word. For well I wote that sin is a <hi>worke of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> &amp; cannot abide to be discerned, well I wote that sin is a <hi>sore</hi> in the soule &amp; cannot abide to be <hi>touched;</hi> and a man cannot liue under a preaching Minister, but he shall at one time or other haue his most secret Corruption ript up before his eyes, and his bosome and beloved sinne discerned and divided from him by the power of the word. Neither let men come and chide with the Minister and say that he hath made a sermon purposely against them, and to disgrace their persons in the face of the whole congregation. For, it may be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster never dream'd of them in particular, and if Gods word hath reached even to their soules and taken them tardie in their finnes; let them <hi>not quench the spirit, nor despise prophecie,</hi> but acknowledge the <hi>working</hi> of that word and the <hi>vertue</hi> of that Spirit, by which the Minister speakes so home unto the Conscience, which is able to <hi>discerne</hi> in it selfe, and to direct the tongue of his servants to <hi>disclose</hi> unto others <q>
                  <hi>Adams</hi> naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse under his Fig leaues, <hi>Ieroboams</hi> wifes dissemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under her maske, the jugling of <hi>Gehezi</hi> under a faire attendance, the bloody heart of <hi>Hazael</hi> under a sweet countenance, the sacriledge of <hi>Ananias</hi> under some charitable pretences; and the devouring of

widowes houses in the <hi>Pharisees</hi> under a coulour of long prayers.</q> What thinke you? Will any be so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately foolish as, when hee sees a Sword lifted up to smite, will runne directly under the stroke of it? Truely this is the case of all such as will needs liue in any knowne sinne under the doctrine of the word. For everie time that they come to Church, and that the Minister hath occasion to touch upon that point, they runne directly under the stroake of this Sword. And therefore if their soules be <hi>pierced,</hi> and their harts <hi>pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> and their consciences <hi>gashed,</hi> and their spirits <hi>woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> within them, they may even thanke themselues for it, and never chide nor complaineof the Minister.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>first reason,</hi> why the word is called a Sword in respect of Christians, namely for that it <hi>worketh in them.</hi> now come we to the <hi>second reason,</hi> why it is called a Sword in respect of Christians, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that it <hi>worketh for them.</hi> And so this appellation of a Sword doth import that excellent use that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <note place="margin">Observat. 3.</note> may make of the word of God in all his tryals and temptations, in that whole combate and spirituall warfare against sinne and Sathan. For in a combate the sword is a most usefull weapon, not onely for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and saving of our selues, but for offence and daunting of the enemie. And therefore the blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <note place="margin">Probetion.</note> when hee sets downe that same <gap reason="foreign">

not driue the adversarie out of the field; but the <hi>Sword</hi> of the spirit puts him to <hi>slight</hi> and giues him the <hi>foyle.</hi> This is plainely proved by our Saviours owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who, when <hi>Satan</hi> came to tempt him, puts him to the worse and made him flee out of the field by maine force of argument taken out of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For when Satan tempted him to <hi>distrust</hi> of Gods providence and to shift for himselfe, to satisfie his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with victualls of his owne provision, he repells this temptation, and beates it back with a <hi>Scriptum est, It is written, that manliveth not by bread onely, but by everie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> When he tempted him to <hi>Presumption,</hi> that he should not goe downe from the top of the temple the ordinarie way, but should take a shorter cut by casting himselfe downe from thence, he repells this temptation, and beates it back with a <hi>Scriptum est, It is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Lastly when he tempted him to <hi>idolatrie,</hi> by a faire promise of the whole world for but bending of his knee, he repells this temptation and beates it backe with a <hi>Scriptum est, It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.</hi> And by this meanes he made the divell <hi>avoyde</hi> and flee out of the field, for the text saith that <hi>upon this, the divell departed from him, and the Angels came and ministred unto him. Math.</hi> 4. And all this for our <note place="margin">Use.</note> instruction. That whensoever the divell shall come and tempt us either to <hi>pride</hi> or <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> or <hi>adultery,</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> sinne, we be sure to make use of the Sword of the spirit, that is, be furnished with plaine testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of holy Scriptures to repell and beate back all his temptations. Against <hi>Pride,</hi> remember that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Iames, God resisteth the proud:</hi> against <hi>covetousnes,</hi> remember that of the Apostle <hi>Paul, A covetous person (which is an idolater) hath no part nor portion in the Kingdome of God or of Christ:</hi> against <hi>adulterie,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

I must yet go on a little further with that mellifluous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>Qui vulg us non spernunt, sed doceant,</hi> that do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> the meanest, but rather teach them. <hi>Qui divites non palpent sed terreant,</hi> that do not flatter rich men in their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19743:15"/>
sinnes, but thunder against them. <hi>Qui minas principu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non paveant sed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temnant,</hi> that do not feare the threatnings of great men, but contemne them. <hi>Bern. de Consid. ad Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. lib</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6. And I haue learned a good <hi>Collect</hi> out of our <hi>Common prayer booke,</hi> which I shall ever put up to God in the behalfe of my selfe and the rest of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the ministerie. That God would grant unto his servants with all courage to deliver his word, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of St. <hi>Iohn Baptist, constantly to speake the truth, boldly to reproue vice, and patiently to suffer for the truths sake, through Iesus Christ our Lord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue done with the text and each particular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Appendix:</note> I proposed to speake of. I must now intreate leaue of you to run over it againe, not any more as an <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but as an <hi>Herald.</hi> For the <hi>Byshops armes</hi> of <hi>this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,</hi> grounded in this text, gaue me first occasion to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten on these words as a fit theame to be intreated on in this <hi>Synodicall</hi> assembly. And I will now for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, before we part, blazon those Armes. I doe not professe any great skill in that honorable science of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldrie,</hi> I am but a novice and of small understanding in it. And therefore if my termes be not so jump &amp; proper to Armorie, as they should, I must intreat your patience and pardon, who are better seene in the Art, then my selfe. In every Coate or <hi>Escutcheon</hi> (and so in this) there are two things observeable. The <hi>field</hi> and the <hi>charge.</hi> The field here is <hi>azure</hi> or sky-coloure, which is supposed to be the coloure of the heaven, if there be any coloure in it. <hi>Azure</hi> in blazoning moralized sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>puritie</hi> and sinceritie. This is a fit field to place Christ in. And it doth teach vs thus much, that the Byshops conuersation must be in heaven, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Observat.</note> saith, <hi>Our conuersation is in heaven, whence we looke for a Saviour &amp;c. Philip.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
            <p>We haue done with the <hi>field;</hi> for I will but touch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon every point, because I know before whom I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19743:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
speake; I come to the <hi>charge.</hi> For order sake we will make this partition of it. The charge is either maine and <hi>principall,</hi> or it is <hi>circumstantiall.</hi> The maine or principall charge is <hi>Christ,</hi> who is described in this text. Lord! what a great <hi>honour</hi> it is for a man to carrie <hi>Christ</hi> in his <hi>shield?</hi> But yet is it a farre greater <hi>grace</hi> to carry <hi>Christ</hi> in his <hi>heart.</hi> This doth teach that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <note place="margin">Observat.</note> must be an imitator and follower of Christ, as he hath him in his shield, so to hold him still in his heart, to expresse him throughout the course of his life, and to resemble him in all his actions. Now it is written ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly of Christ, that <hi>he went about into all the Townes and villages Preaching and doing good among the people.</hi> And I haue heard it of <hi>Richard,</hi> Byshop of this See, who for his sanctitie and holy life had the title of <hi>Saint</hi> put upon him. I haue heard it I say of him, that in everie three yeare he was wont to goe over all his Diocesse Preaching. I wish the Byshop that now is had as good meanes to doe this as he had then. I am sure there wants no good affection. And the desire of performing this businesse, if strength and meanes were answerable to the minde and intention, is as full and perfect in our present Diocesan, as ever it was in S. <hi>Richard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue done with the <hi>principall</hi> charge, the <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> followes, which is nothing else but a description of the maine charge, that is, of Christ. Now Christ here is set out unto our eyes in these three things. 1. in respect of the <hi>positure</hi> of his bodie 2. in respect of the <hi>habit</hi> 3. in respect of an <hi>adjunct.</hi> The site and position of his body, is sitting upon a bench. <hi>Sitting</hi> in blazoning moraliz'd signifies <hi>gravitie</hi> and constancie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Observat. 1.</note> you haue Kings and judges and other princes pourtraited for the most part <hi>Sitting</hi> in the place of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature. <hi>See King Iames his Paterne for a Kings inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration. Pag.</hi> 33. <hi>&amp; sequ.</hi> There is one thing more which <hi>Sitting</hi> imports, which is so well practised by our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19743:16"/>
               <hi>Diocesan,</hi> that I cannot slip it over in silence, and that is his <hi>residence</hi> and living upon his Charge. And indeed <note place="margin">Observat. 2.</note> where should a Byshop liue, saue in his Diocesse? He must be no <hi>flitter,</hi> he must be a <hi>sitter</hi> there. I am sure that the Angell brought that good newes of Christs birth unto the shepheards <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>as they were watching and attending their flock. Luke</hi> 2. and assure your selues that then shall a man meete with the best newes and receiue the greatest comfort, when he is in his proper place and busied about the workes of his owne calling. See <hi>Didac. Stella in Luke</hi> 1. <hi>verse</hi> 11. <note place="margin">Stella.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The second thing in this description is the habit, and that is a <hi>long glittering garment of beaten gold.</hi> Here are many observations. I will point onely at this one. It is of <hi>pure</hi> beaten gold and it is also a <hi>glittering</hi> garment. The life of the Byshop as it <hi>must be pure</hi> in it selfe <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blot;</hi> so it must <hi>appeare pure</hi> in the eyes of men <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

               <hi>blemish; Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good workes. Math.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>The third thing in the description is the adjunct, and that is a <hi>sword in his mouth.</hi> What is ment by the <hi>sword</hi> I haue told you aboue, here onely obserue that it <hi>is in his mouth.</hi> Not in his <hi>hand</hi> but in his <hi>mouth.</hi> The <note place="margin">Observat. 1.</note> 
               <hi>sword</hi> in the <hi>hand</hi> doth import <hi>Temporall</hi> power, but the <hi>sword</hi> in the <hi>mouth, Spirituall.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed challenge to himselfe both swords, applying that of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when they said to <hi>Christ, Ecce duo glady</hi> loe there be two swords, most foolishly to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his <hi>Spirituall</hi> swaggering in the <hi>Church,</hi> and his <hi>secular</hi> dominering over the whole <hi>world.</hi> But questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse he is but a meere usurper; and so we leaue him. But for our Byshops now, who are <hi>Lords</hi> also &amp; <hi>Ba-</hi>according to the Statutes of this <hi>Realme,</hi> they haue <hi>Temporall jurisdiction,</hi> wee grant it, and a <hi>sword</hi> put into their <hi>hands,</hi> but whence had they it? Surely not from <hi>Christ,</hi> but from the <hi>Prince.</hi> Christ it was that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19743:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
put the sword <hi>in their mouthes;</hi> and if they haue at any time (as they haue, and that worthily too) an other sword put into <hi>their hands;</hi> this is not the <hi>guist</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> they lay no claime unto it so; but the <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and so they acknowledge it. Secondly, the <note place="margin">Observat. 2.</note> sword here is in <hi>Christs mouth,</hi> as you see. I told you that by the sword was ment the word. This then tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that the Byshop is not to deliver any doctrine unto the people that he hath not fetched from Christs mouth. <hi>What I haue received from Christ that I haue delivered unto you.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. There is but one thing behinde, and that is the colour of the sword It is <hi>gules</hi> that is, red: <hi>Red</hi> in blazoning doth signifie <hi>blood.</hi> This is then a bloody sword, and it doth teach, that the <note place="margin">Observat. 3.</note> Byshops doctrine must be so <hi>piercing and sharpe,</hi> that it draw <hi>blood</hi> upon offenders. I haue spoken fully to this already. I will therfore cease to prosecute it any further. I will adde this one thing onely, that the sword both of Byshop and Minister must be like to the <hi>sword of Saul and Ionathan, which never returned emptie from the slaughter of the mighty;</hi> and most happie of all other <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> shall he be at the last judgement whose <hi>sword</hi> shall be found the most <hi>red</hi> of all by the <hi>blood</hi> that he hath drawne with it upon <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi> I haue said. <hi>Consider what</hi> I haue said, and <hi>the Lord giue you a right understanding in all things.</hi>
