         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Ye heard a little before the Councils Letter ſent to Biſhop <hi>Boner,</hi> ſignifying the good News of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> to be not only conceived, but alſo quick with Child, which was in the Month of <hi>Novemb.</hi> the 28 day. Of this Child great talk began at this time to riſe in every mans mouth, with buſie preparation and much ado, eſpecially amongſt ſuch as ſeemed in <hi>England</hi> to carry <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hearts in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bodies. In number of whom here is not to be forgotten nor defrauded of his condign Commendation for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Affection toward his Prince and her Iſſue, one Sir <hi>Richard Southwell,</hi> who being the ſame time in the Parliament-Houſe, whereas the Lords were occupied in other Affairs and matters of Importance, ſuddenly ſtarting up, for fulneſs of joy burſt out into theſe words following: <hi>Tuſh my Maſters,</hi> quoth he, <hi>what talk ye of theſe matters? I would have you take ſome order for our Maſter that is now coming into the World apace, leſt he find us unprovided,</hi> &amp;c. By the which words both of him, and alſo by the aforeſaid Letters of the Council, and the common talk abroad, it may appear what an aſſured Opinion was then conceived in mens Heads of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and quick with Child: inſomuch that at the ſame time, and in the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, there was eftſoons a Bill exhibited, and an Act made upon the ſame, the words whereof, for the more evidence, I thought good here to exemplifie, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
            <div type="Act_of_Parliament">

                  <hi>ALbeit we the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled, have firm hope and confidence in the goodneſs of Almighty God, that like as he hath hitherto miraculouſly preſerved the Queens Majeſty from many great immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perils and Dangers, even ſo he will of his infinite Goodneſs give her Highneſs ſtrength, the rather by our continual Prayers, to paſs well the danger of deliverance of Child, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it hath pleaſed him (to all our great comforts) to bleſs her: yet foraſmuch as all things of this World be uncertain, and having before our eyes the dolorous experience of this inconſtant Government, during the time of the Reign of the late King</hi> Edward VI. <hi>do plainly ſee the manifold Inconveniencies, great Dangers and Perils that may enſue this whole Realm if foreſight be not uſed to prevent all evil chances, if they ſhould happen: for the eſchewing hereof, we the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, for and in conſideration of a moſt ſpecial truſt and confidence that we have and repoſe in the King's Majeſty, for and concerning the Politick Government, Order and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of this Realm in the time of the young years of the Iſſue or Iſſues of her Majeſties Body to be born, if it ſhould pleaſe God to call the Queens Highneſs out of this preſent life during the tender years of ſuch Iſſue or Iſſues (which God forbid) according to ſuch order and manner as hereafter in this preſent Act his Highneſs's moſt gracious Pleaſure is, ſhould be

                     </gap>erily truſteth that Almighty God (who hath hitherto preſerved the Queens Majeſty, to give this Realm ſo good an hope of certain Succeſſion in the Blood Royal of the ſame Realm) will aſſiſt her Highneſs with his Graces and Benedictions, to ſee the Fruit of her Body well brought forth, live and able to govern (whereof neither all this Realm, nay all the World beſides, ſhould or could receive more comfort than his Majeſty ſhould and would,) yet if ſuch chance ſhould happen, his Majeſty, at our humble deſires, is pleaſed and contented not only to accept and take upon him the care and charge of the Education, Rule, Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Iſſues as of this moſt happy Marriage ſhall be born between the Queens Highneſs and him; but alſo, during the time of ſuch Government, would by all ways and means ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, travel, and employ himſelf to advance the Weal, both Publick and Private, of this Realm and Dominion thereunto belonging, according to the ſaid Truſt in his Majeſty repoſed, with no leſs good will and affection than if his Highneſs had been naturally born amongſt us. In conſideration whereof, be it enacted by the King and the Queens moſt excellent Majeſties, by the Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame,</hi> &amp;c. As it is to be ſeen in the Act more at large ratified and confirmed at the ſame Parliament, to the ſame intent and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>¶ Thus much out of the Act and Statute I thought fit to rehearſe, to the intent the Reader may underſtand not ſo much how Parliaments may ſometimes be deceived (as by this Child of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> may appear) as rather what cauſe we <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> have to render moſt earneſt thanks unto Almighty God, who ſo mercifully, againſt the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Expectation, and working of our Adverſaries, hath helped and delivered us in this caſe, which otherwiſe might have opened ſuch a window to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to have entred and repleniſhed this Land, that peradventure by this time <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſhould have enjoyed no great quiet in their own Country: The Lord therefore make us perpetually mindful of his benefits. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee then how man doth purpoſe, but God diſpoſeth as pleaſeth him. For all this great Labour, Proviſion and Order taken in the Parliament-Houſe for their young Maſter long looked for, coming ſo ſurely into the World, in the end appeared neither young Maſter nor young Miſtris that any man yet to this day can hear of. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, as the labour of the Lay-ſort was herein deluded, ſo no leſs ridiculous it was to behold what little effect the Prayers of the Pope's Church men had with Almighty God, who travelled no leſs with their Proceſſions, Maſſes and Collects, for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py deliverance of this young Maſter to come, as here followeth to be ſeen.</p>

Our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities be multiplied on our head, and our ſins be encreaſed up to Heaven, and we our ſelves having offended, and our Princes and our Prieſts, for theſe our ſins, have deſerved an Hypocrite to our Prince, our ſins have deſerved a Tyrant to our Governor, that ſhould bring our life to bitterneſs.

               <head>Concerning the Child-bed of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as it was rumoured among the People.</head>
               <p>LOng perſuaſion had been in <hi>England,</hi> with great expectation, for the ſpace of half a year or more, that the Queen was conceived with Child. This Report was made by the Queen's Phyſitians, and others nigh about the Court; ſo that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were puniſhed for ſaying the contrary: and commandment was given, That in all Churches Supplication and Prayer ſhould be made for the Queen's good Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; the Certificate whereof ye may read before in the Letter of the Council ſent to <hi>Boner;</hi> and alſo the ſame moreover may appear by Proviſion made before in Act of Parliament for the Child.</p>
               <p>And now foraſmuch as in the beginning of this month of <hi>June,</hi> about <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> the time was thought to be nigh that this young Maſter ſhould come into the World, and that Midwives, Rockers, Nurſes, with the Cradle and all, were prepared and in a readineſs; ſuddenly, upon what cauſe or occaſion it is uncertain, a certain vain Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was blown in <hi>London</hi> of the proſperous Deliverance of the Queen, and the Birth of the Child; inſomuch that the Bells were rung, Bonfires and Proceſſions made, not only in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and in moſt other parts of the Realm, but alſo in the Town of <hi>Antwerp</hi> Guns were ſhot off upon the River by the Engliſh Ships, and the Mariners thereof rewarded with an hundred Piſtolets or <hi>Italian</hi> Crowns, by the Lady Regent, who was the Queen of <hi>Hungary.</hi> Such great rejoycing and triumph was for the Queens Delivery, and that there was a Prince born: yea, divers Preachers, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one the Parſon of St. <hi>Anne</hi> within <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> after Proceſſion and <hi>Te Deum</hi> ſung, took upon him to deſcribe the proportion of the Child, how fair, how beautiful, and great a Prince it was, as the like had not been ſeen.</p>

For the People were certified, that the Queen neither was as then delivered, nor after was in hope to have any Child.</p>
               <p>At this time many talked diverſly. Some ſaid this Rumor of the Queens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was ſpread for a policy; ſome other affirmed, that ſhe was deceived by a Tympany or ſome other like Diſeaſe, to think her ſelf with Child, and was not; ſome thought ſhe was with Child, and that it did by ſome chance miſcarry, or elſe that ſhe was bewitched; but what was the truth thereof the Lord knoweth, to whom nothing is ſecret. One thing of mine own hearing and ſeeing I cannot paſs over unwitneſſed.</p>
               <p>There came to me whom I did both hear and ſee, one <hi>Iſabel Matl,</hi> a Woman dwelling in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtree</hi> in <hi>Horn-Ally,</hi> not far from the Houſe where this preſent Book was printed, who before witneſs made this Declaration unto us, <hi>That ſhe being delivered of a Man-Child upon</hi> Whitſunday <hi>in the morning, which was the 11th. day of</hi> June, 1555. <hi>there came to her the Lord</hi> North, <hi>and another Lord to her unknown, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then about</hi> Old-Fiſhſtreet, <hi>demanding of her if ſhe would part with her Child, and would ſwear that ſhe ne'er knew nor had any ſuch Child. Which, if ſhe would, her Son (they ſaid) ſhould be well provided for, ſhe ſhould take no care for it, with many fair Offers if ſhe would part with the Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that came other Women alſo, of whom, one they ſaid ſhould have been the Rocker; but ſhe in no wiſe would let go her Son, who at the writing hereof being alive, and called <hi>Timothy Malt,</hi> was of the age of Thirteen years and upward.</p>
               <p>Thus much, I ſay, I heard of the Woman herſelf. What credit is to be given to her relation, I deal not withal, but leave it to the liberty of the Reader, to believe it they that liſt; to them that liſt not, I have no further warrant to aſſure them.</p>
               <p>Among many other great preparations made for the Queens deliverance of Child, there was a Cradle very ſumptuouſly and gorgeouſly trimmed, upon the which Cradle for the Child appointed, theſe Verſes were written both in Latin and Engliſh.</p>
