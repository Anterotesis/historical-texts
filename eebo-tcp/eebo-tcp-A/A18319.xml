         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

so to be proued, to bee as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
First, that the formes of torture in their seueritie
or rigour of execution, haue not bene such and in such maner
perfourmed, as the sclaunderers and seditious libellers haue
<pb facs="tcp:8059:3"/>
sclaunderously and malitiously published. And that euen the
principall offender Campion himselfe, who was sent and
came from <hi>Rome</hi> and continued here in sundrie corners of
the <hi>Realme,</hi> hauing secretly wandered in the greatest part
of the shieres of <hi>Englande</hi> in a disguised sort, to the intent to
make speciall preparation of treasons, and to that ende &amp; for
furtherance of those his labors, sent ouer for more helpe and
assistance, and cunningly and traiterously at <hi>Rome</hi> before
he came from thence, procured tolleration for such prepared
rebels to keepe themselues couert vnder pretence of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie
and permissiue obedience to her Maiestie the state
standing as it doth, but so soone as there were sufficient
force whereby the <hi>bull</hi> of her Maiesties depriuation might
bee publikely executed, they shoulde then ioyne altogether
with that force vpon peine of curse and damnation: that very
Campion, I say, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conference had w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him by learned
men in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tower, wherin he was charitably vsed, was neuer
so racked, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was presently able to walke, &amp; to write,
&amp; did presently write &amp; suscribe al his confessions, as by the
originales therof may appeare. A horrible matter is also
made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> staruing of one Alexander Briant, how he should
eate clay out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles, gathered water to drinke from the
droppings of houses, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such other false oftentations of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie:
where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatsoeuer Briant suffered
in want of foode, he suffered the same wilfully &amp; of extreme
impudent obstinacie against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde &amp; liking of those that
dealt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. For certaine traiterous writings being founde
about him, it was thought conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by conference of hands
to vnderstand whose writing they were, &amp; thereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her Maiesties name commaunded to write, which he
coulde very well doe, and being permitted to him to write
what he woulde himselfe, in these termes, that if he liked not
to write one thing, he might write an other or what he lysted
(which to doe being charged in her Maiesties name was his
duetie, and to refuse was disloyall and vndutifull:) yet the
man woulde by no meanes be induced to write any thing at
<pb facs="tcp:8059:3"/>
all. Then was it commanded to his keeper to giue vnto him
such meate, drinke, and other conuenient necessaries as he
woulde write for, and to forbeare to giue him any thing for
which he would not write. But Briant being thereof aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
and oft moued to write, persisting so in his curst heart
by almost two dayes and two nightes, made choise rather to
lack foode, then to write for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sustenance which hee might
readely haue had for writing, &amp; which he had indede redely &amp;
plentifully, so soone as he wrote. And as it is sayde of these
two, so is it to be truely sayde of other, with this, that there
was a perpetuall care had, and the Queenes seruantes the
Warders, whose office and act it is to handle the racke,
were euer by those that attended the examinations specially
charged, to vse it in as charitable maner as such a thing
might be.</p>
            <p>Secondly it is said, and likewise offered to be iustified,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer any of these Seminaries, or such other pretended
Catholiques which at any time in her Maiesties raigne
haue bene put to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> racke, were vpon the Racke or in other
torture demanded any questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their supposed conscience,
as what they beleeued in any point of doctrine or faith, as
the Masse, Transubstantiation, or such like: but onely with
what persons at home, or abroad, and touching what plats,
practises and conferences they had dealt about attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her Maiesties estate or person, or to alter the Lawes
of the Realme for matters of Religion, by treason or by
force, and howe they were perswaded them selues, and
did perswade other touching the Popes <hi>bul</hi> and pretense
of authoritie, to depose Kings and Princes, and namely,
for depriuation of her Maiestie, and to discharge subiectes
from their allegeance, expressing herein alway the Kingly
powers and estates, and the subiectes allegeance ciuily,
without mentioning or meaning therein any right that
the Queene as in right of the Crowne, hath ouer persons
Ecclesiasticall being her subiectes. In all which cases,
Campion &amp; the rest neuer answered plainely, but sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:8059:4"/>
decei<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ully and traiterously, restraining their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of allegeance onely to the permissiue forme of the
Popes toleration. As for example, if they were asked,
whether they did acknowledge them selues the Queenes
subiectes and woulde obey her, they woulde say, Yea: for
so they had leaue for a time to doe. But adding more to the
question, and they being asked, if they woulde so acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and obey her any longer then the Pope woulde so
permit them, or not withstanding such commandement as
the Pope woulde or might giue to the contrary, them they
eyther refused so to obey, or denyed to answer, or said, that
they coulde not answere to those questions without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
which very answere without more saying, was a
plaine answere to all reasonable vnderstanding, that they
woulde no longer be subiectes, nor perswade other to be
subiectes, then the Pope gaue licence. And at their very
arraignement when they laboured to leaue in the minds of
the people and standers by, an opinion that they were to
dye, not for treason, but for matter of faith and conscience
in doctrine, touching the seruice of God, without any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
or purpose against her Maiestie, they cryed out
that they were true subiectes, and did and would obey and
serue her Maiestie. Immediately, to proue whether that
hypocriticall and sophistical speach extended to a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie
of their obedience, or to so long time as the Pope so
permitted, or no, they were openly in place of Iudgement
asked by the Queenes learned counsell, whether they
would so obey and be true subiectes, if the Pope comma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the contrary: they plainely disclosed them selues in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
saying by the mouth of Campion, this place (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Court of her Maiesties Bench) hath no power to
enquire or iudge of the holy Fathers authoritie, and other
answere they would not make.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that none of them haue bene put to the racke or
torture, no not for the matters of Treason, or partnership
of treason or such like, but where it was first knowen and
<pb facs="tcp:8059:4"/>
euidently probable by former detections, confessions, and
otherwise, that the partie so racked, or tortured, was guyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and did knowe, and coulde deliuer trueth of the thinges
wherewith he was charged: so as it was first assured, that
no innocent was at any time tormented, and the racke was
neuer vsed to wring out confessions at aduenture vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeinties,
in which doing, it might bee possible that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
in that case might haue bene racked.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that none of them hath bene racked or tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
vnlesse hee had first sayd expressely, or amounting to
asmuch, that he wil not tell the trueth, though the Queene
commaund him. And if any of them being examined did say
he could not tell, or did not remember, if hee woulde so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
in such maner as Christians among Christians are
beleeued, such his answere was accepted, if there were not
apparant euidence to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wilfully said vntruely. But
if he said y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his answere in deliuering trueth, shoulde hurt a
Catholike, and so be an offence against charitie, which they
said to be sinne, and that the Queene coulde not commande
them to sinne, and therefore, howsoeuer the Queene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
they would not tell the trueth, which they were
knowen to know, or to such effect: they were then put to
the torture, or els not.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that the proceeding to torture was alway so slowly,
so vnwillingly, and with so many prepararations of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
to spare themselues, and so many meanes to let
them know that the trueth was by them to be vttered, both
in duetie to her Maiestie, &amp; in wisedome for themselues, as
whosoeuer was prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at those actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, must needes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in her Maiesties ministers, a ful purpose to follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
example of her owne most gratious disposition: whome
God long preserue.</p>
            <p>Thus it appeareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> albeit by the more generall lawes
of nations, torture hath bene, and is lawfully iudged to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in lesser cases, and in sharper maner for inquisition of
trueth in crimes not so neere extending to publike danger,
<pb facs="tcp:8059:5"/>
as these vngratious persons haue committed, whose conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
and the particularities thereof it did so much import
and behoue to haue disclosed, yet euen in that necessarie vse
of such proceeding, enforced by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offenders notorious obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie,
is neuerthelesse to be acknowledged, the sweete tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of her Maiesties milde and gratious clemencie, &amp;
their slaunderous lewdenes to be the more condemned, that
haue in fauour of haynous malefactours, and stubborne
traytors, spred vntrue rumors and slaunders to make her
mercifull gouernment disliked vnder false pretence, &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of sharpenesse and crueltie, to those against whome
nothing can be cruel, and yet vpon whome nothing hath
bene done, but gentle and mercifull.</p>
