            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE general Applause wherewith the <hi>History of the Bucaniers</hi> hath been rececived, could have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects, than easily to perswade the Pulisher of that Piece, to undertake the Second Volume thereof. Especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the same points which deserved the Credit and Commendation of the first, did seem to subsist for the like esteem and reception of the second. These were the fidelity of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both here and there published, the Authors having been not onely Eye-witnesses, but also Actors in the transactions they report: the candor and sincerity of the Stile; the variety and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness of these Voyages, the greatness of the Attempts here related, the unparallel'd, and undaunted Courage of the <hi>Bucaniers,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:59013:3"/>
strangeness of their performances, the novelty of their Exploits; and withal, the glory and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of Valour, which here is seen to be inherent to our English Nation, and as pregnant of great Actions in the present, as in the former Ages. Unto which points may be added, in this Second Volume, for its recommendation, the grand discovery of a new passage into the South-Sea, beyond the Streights of <hi>Ferdinando de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallanes</hi> and <hi>le Maire,</hi> through an open and in no-wise dangerous Ocean, without those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable perils both from Rocks, Currents, and Shoals, which hitherto have rendred the two passages aforementioned, altogether unaccessible to Trading; a Navigation performed by Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> and his Companions, many degrees beyond what Sir <hi>Francis Drake, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob le Maire, Noord,</hi> or <hi>Magallanes</hi> himself, who first Circumnavigated the World, ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto in their Sailings. This Discovery alone, as hugely beneficial to Mankind, so may it seem sufficient of it self to recommend this present piece unto the publick, even as extremely necessary to all such as Navigate the Ocean; and no less delightful unto those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose Studys are directed to the search of <hi>Nature,</hi> to the Arts of <hi>Mathematick</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation.</hi> Besides which point, both of Art, Curiosity, and Usefulness, we have given unto
<pb facs="tcp:59013:3"/>
us here, by Mr. <hi>Ringrose,</hi> an exact account of many places in the South Sea; the very Draughts and Maps of many Ports, Islands, Bays, Gulfs, Points, and Coasts, hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the greatest part of <hi>Europe</hi>; their appearance at Sea; their soundings, landings, and bearings; together with what variety of Winds and Weather, of Currents and Calms, and other Observations the <hi>Bucaniers</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in those parts. All which things, as they manifest unto us the inquisitiveness of the Author, so ought we highly to applaud his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity and <hi>Genius,</hi> who all along the course of this Voyage, not onely fought with his Sword in the most desperate Engagements and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of the <hi>Bucaniers</hi> against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but with his Pen gave us a true account of those Transactions; and with his Pensil hath delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us the very <hi>Scenes</hi> of those Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Thus we find him totally employed towards our information and instruction at home, while he endured the greatest fatigues and hardship abroad: at the same time making <hi>Quadrants</hi> at Sea, that others sate idle and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring upon the Decks; at the same time ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt, and almost naked, and starving upon a desart Island, and yet describing, even more exactly than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, the Gulf of <hi>Ballona,</hi> otherwise called of <hi>San Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59013:4"/>
where he was cast away. These things, I say, as they are not undeserving of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est praise and commendation in this ingenious Gentleman Mr. <hi>Ringrose</hi> their Author, so shall the <hi>Curioso</hi>'s of Nature and Posterity it self be his eternal debtors for their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with these writings.</p>
            <p>Some imperfect account of these transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both short and in many things defective, I gave the last year unto the publick, at the end of the second Impression of the <hi>History of the Bucaniers.</hi> But such as that Relation was, I had no better then to give; neither had I then seen the present Journal of Mr. <hi>Ringrose</hi>; and that same account being received from the hands of some of the <hi>Bucaniers</hi> themselves at <hi>Wapping,</hi> it was esteemed fit, both by me and others, to be published at that time. But as the Author of those Papers mistrusting both his own memory and sufficiency, remitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in that Narrative unto the Journal of Mr. <hi>Ringrose,</hi> and desireth by this alone to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, or supplied either in what he was mistaken or deficient; so now this <hi>Diary</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing published, I hope I have vindicated my self from any fault in History, having brought these papers to light, by which those others were before-hand both acknowledged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be amended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59013:4"/>As to any other <hi>Journal</hi> of this Voyage, I shall not concern my self in the least with their veracity, nor meddle with their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; knowing, that if any other person did take it, that no person in the Voyage was so able as Mr. <hi>Ringrose.</hi> Yet I know that divers <hi>Narratives,</hi> in many points differing from one another, have at several times been made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of one and the same Battel, one and the same Siege, Voyage, Journey, or other trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action. And indeed all humane Affairs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever reported by several persons, though all were present at the same times and places of their circumvolution, are necessarily subject to some diversity in the rehearsal; one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son observing, omitting, contracting, dilating, understanding, or mistaking, one particular point or part of any transaction more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>Having premised thus much, I shall here onely declare, that what here is asserted, shall be supported by Mr. <hi>Ringrose</hi> himself, when ever he returneth into <hi>England</hi>; yea, and owned for truth by Captain <hi>Bartholomew Sharp,</hi> as the chiefest actor in these Affairs, assoon as he cometh home again: and if any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can shew unto the World any Journal of the same Voyage more compleat, more exact, more elaborate, more curious, and informing,
<pb facs="tcp:59013:5"/>
than Mr. <hi>Ringrose</hi> hath done, he shall deserve the <hi>Laurel</hi> for me.</p>
            <p>The case being thus stated concerning the present <hi>Narrative</hi> or <hi>Journal,</hi> I hope no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the future will asperse or misconster the sincerity of my Intentions, in relation to the publick. This I speak under that due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment I ought to have, for being traduced, the last year, by some persons, who being transported with too much passion and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, would have no body else to be an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the person and valorous Actions of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> or the rest of the <hi>Bucaniers,</hi> but themselves. As if to publish a <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the unparallel'd Exploits of that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maican Hero</hi>; to give him this commendable title; to say, that both he and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had acted beyond mortal men in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>; to compare them to <hi>Alexander, Julius Caesar,</hi> and the <hi>Nine Worthies of Fame</hi>; to propose them unto our English Nation, as the truest patterns of undaunted and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Courage, that ever it produced, were to disparage the Conduct of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan</hi> and his Companions; as if all this were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended onely to diminish the glory of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and eclipse the splendour of his and their valorous Triumphs. Methinks, if En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy reacheth thus far, with the same reason,
<pb facs="tcp:59013:5"/>
or unjust measure, those persons may say, that to publish this present Journal, is to divulge nothing else than a <hi>Satyr</hi> against Captain <hi>Sharp</hi>; and that Mr. <hi>Ringrose</hi> who every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where admireth his Conduct, and extolleth his Actions unto the Sky's, yea and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himself, and concerned in the same Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, did mean nothing else than to traduce both his own and Captain <hi>Sharps</hi> name, as infamous unto Posterity. For my part, I judge my self so far distant from blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the least, or disparaging Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> or his Heroick Actions; that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I have shewed my self to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est admirer of his personal Valour, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: yea, I think that I have done more, towards the advantage, both of the Honour, and Credit of that great Commander, by soliciting and publishing that Translation, than all the Authors of our <hi>English</hi> Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. And I could unfeignedly wish, that these persons who pretend to be so passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> and his huge De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, as to Misinterpret the sincere respects and service, I have endeavoured to perform unto his Merits, would outdo what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done in this particular, and give us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a more full, exact, and true account of his Exploits, or the best <hi>Panegyrick</hi> of his
<pb facs="tcp:59013:6"/>
Prowess, that ever was Written; and then experiment whether I did not readily embrace the Printing such a thing at my own cost and charge, and rather render them ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thanks for his Commendations, than carp at their Actions for Penning, or Printing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the <hi>History of the Bucaniers,</hi> did mistake himself in two or three points, relating to Sir <hi>Henry Morgan?</hi> Must, therefore the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher be blamed for faithfully Printing, what was most faithfully Translated? Must the Saddle be set upon the wrong Horse, and the faults of the Author, be imputed unto the Printer? Thus if Mr. <hi>Ringrose</hi> should happen to commit any mistake in these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Papers, that blame should be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mine; and happy should be all Authors, if so readily their errours could be discharged upon the Publishers. Besides, what Authors can there be found so accurate in all things, as not to be subject now and then to some little lapses of their Pen? Were it so in <hi>John Esquemeling</hi>; as he ought to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for any small <hi>peccadillo</hi> not wittingly nor willingly committed, concerning what he relateth of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> so am I hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto perswaded, that he never designed to
<pb facs="tcp:59013:6"/>
offend that great person, or falsely traduce his memory, in the least. My Argument is: because he himself had the hand of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bucanier in those Affairs, he himself was a Sharer in those Bootys, an Actor in those En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and could no more blame Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morgan</hi> for leading unto those Attempts, than blemish himself for following unto them. Another Reason, even more prevalent, is, that he all along speaketh more honourably of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> than of any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Bucaniers, though they were his own Country-men, either <hi>Francis Lolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> or <hi>Roche Brasiliano,</hi> whereof the one was a <hi>Dutch</hi> man, and the other was born in <hi>France.</hi> So that to say, that he representeth the <hi>English</hi> Bucaniers, as the worst of men, is plainly to forget, that he relateth ten times greater villanies of his own Nation and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People; and that the partiality they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of, if any such can be found in that Author, is rather bent against the <hi>French</hi> and other Nations, than the <hi>English.</hi> Doth he in any place of his History, lay all the faults and cruelties of the <hi>English</hi> Bucaniers upon Sir <hi>Henry Morgan?</hi> Or do we believe that if committed without order, as in most Armys many things are so done, the General or Commander in Chief, ought to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:59013:7"/>
for them? Or if those things were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by order, that the Spaniards had not deserved them at the hands of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniers?</p>
            <p>Ay, but he mistaketh the Pedigree of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan.</hi> Truely, a great fault, and unpardonable in <hi>John Esquemeling,</hi> a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner to our Nation, and an illiterate Buca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier, that he should not be better read in our English History. So did he also mistake his very name, calling him Captain <hi>John Morgan,</hi> for <hi>Henry</hi>; but that that fault was rectified in the Translation. As if every private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ought to be thoroughly acquainted with the <hi>Christian</hi> name of his General, and know whether he was Baptized <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Thomas, Richard,</hi> or <hi>William</hi>! Now what dishonour can it be reputed, unto the merits of Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morgan</hi> to be misrepresented by <hi>John Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quemeling,</hi> for the Son of a Rich Yeoman in <hi>Wales,</hi> whenas at the same time he saith, that he was of <hi>good quality in that Country, even as most who bear that name in</hi> Wales <hi>are known to be?</hi> Doth not all our English Nation know the Family of the <hi>Morgans</hi> to be one of the Ancientest, and best Qualified in all <hi>Wales,</hi> or <hi>England</hi>; and that to be descended of a rich Yeoman of the same Family, is as great an hounour, and as honourable a Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb facs="tcp:59013:7"/>
as any private Gentleman needeth to pretend unto?</p>
            <p>But then Sir <hi>Henry Morgan</hi> did not burn <hi>Panama.</hi> And what disgrace were it, to that worthy person, if he had set fire unto it, for those reasons he knew best himself? Certainly no greater dishonour than to take and plunder the said City. Thus are these persons so far transported with passion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> as to bereave him of the glory of his greatest Actions, whether true or false. For whether he fired the Town or not, (for that Question I shall not make mine) this I am sure, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly so reported, and believed here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> viz. <hi>that the English had set fire unto it</hi>; that unto this day the Bucaniers do believe it to be so; and consequence unto this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief Mr. <hi>Ringrose,</hi> in these Papers saith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in some place or other, that <hi>Panama</hi> was once burnt by Sir <hi>Henry Morgan</hi>; that the Spaniards themselves never believed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this Fact otherwise, neither will they easily be perswaded to the contrary unto this very day, as I am credibly informed by those persons who lived in <hi>Spain</hi> at the same time that the news of the taking of <hi>Panama</hi> was brought into <hi>Spain,</hi> and who have been resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there for these many years since. For
<pb facs="tcp:59013:8"/>
what concerneth, what is now Published, that the Governour of <hi>Panama</hi> fired the Town him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is rather believed by the Spaniards to be a sham of the Governours making, thereby to save his own Bacon, against whom they rail as the greatest Coward that ever was, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the Town, and flying to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, at the approach of the English. How then, say they, could he fire it himself, or give orders to have it fired, when we know he was upon the Spur, thirty or forty Miles distant from thence? Had he done it, he would have set fire unto every House, before he had left the Town, and not so many Hours after the English were in possession of the place, and he at such a distance from it. Thus both the English Nation, and the Spanish having agreed, to give the honour of this Action either truely or false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unto Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> I cannot but admire that those who pretend to be the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of his merits, should endeavour to devest him of it.</p>
            <p>What concerneth two or three points more, relating to Sir <hi>Henry Morgan</hi> in the <hi>History of the Bucaniers,</hi> I shall not undertake to Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for <hi>John Esquemeling,</hi> in case he hath mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented them. All that I shall say, is this, that that worthy person is not the first General or Chief Commander, whose Actions have been
<pb facs="tcp:59013:8"/>
misconstrued or misunderstood by the common Souldiers, and consequently ill represented by them at home. Neither is any thing in this World more subject to glosses, and false repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, than the Heroick Actions of great men, by their Servants, or inferiours. If this be the case of <hi>John Esquemeling,</hi> and that he was Male-contented whith his Fortune at <hi>Panama,</hi> what is that to me? What fault was that of mine? I'th' mean while, why have not these persons, so zealous of the honour of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> given us the true Journal of his huge Exploits, but rather suffer his famous Actions to lye dormient for so many years in <hi>England,</hi> at the same time that other Nations have Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed them abroad? And then why must I be blamed by these persons, his admirers, for doing for the renown of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan</hi> what I could, if I could not do so much, as I would willingly have done?</p>

                     <hi>First days march.</hi>
                  </note> and divided into Companies, as was mentioned in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we began our march towards <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> serving us for guides in that unknown Country. Thus we marched at first through a small skirt of a wood, and then over a bay almost a League in length. After that, we went two Leagues directly up a woody valley, where we saw here and there an old Plantation, and had a very good path to march in. There we came to the side of a River, which in most places was dry, and built us Houses, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Huts to lodge in.</p>
               <p>Unto this place came unto us another <hi>Indian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An</hi> Indian <hi>Commander joyneth them.</hi>
                  </note> who was a chief Commander, and a man of great parts, named Captain <hi>Antonio.</hi> This <hi>Indian</hi> Officer encouraged us very much to undertake the Journey of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be our Leader; saying, he would go along with us now, but that his Child lay very sick. However, he was assured, it would dye by next day; and then he would most certainly follow and overtake us. Withal, he desired we would not lye in the grass, for fear of monstrous <hi>Adders,</hi> which are very frequent in those places. Breaking some of the stones that lay in the River, we found them shine with sparks of Gold. These stones are driven down from the neighbouring Mountains in time of floods.<note place="margin">

we remained in all 327 men, with six <hi>Indians</hi> to conduct us. That night some showers of rain fell.</p>

                  </note>The next day of our march we mounted a very steep hill, and on the other side, at the foot thereof, we rested on the bank of a River, which Captain <hi>Andraeas</hi> told us, did run into the South Sea; being the same River on which the Town of <hi>Santa Maria</hi> was situated. Hence we continued our march until noon, and then ascended ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mountain extreamly higher than the former. Here we ran much danger oftentimes, and in many places, the Mountain being so perpendicular, and the path so narrow, that but one man at a time could pass. We arrived by the dark of the evening to the other side of the Mountain, and lodged again by the side of the same River, having march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that day, according to our reckoning, about eighteen miles. This night likewise some rain did fall.</p>

beads, which were bigger than ordinary pease; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath which the red lining of the Crown was seen. In his nose he wore a large plate of gold, in form of an half Moon; and in each ear a great golden ring, nigh four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in diameter, with a round thin plate of Gold of the same breadth, having a small hole in the center, and by that hanging to the ring. He was covered with a thin white cotton robe, reaching unto the small of his legs, and round its bottom a fringe of the same three inches deep. So that by the length of this Robe, our sight was impeded, that we could see no higher than his naked Ankles. In his hand he had a long bright Lance, as sharp as any knife. With him he had three Sons, each of them having a white Robe, and their Lances in their hands, but standing bare-headed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; as also were eight or nine persons more of his Retinue, or Guard. His Queen wore a red Blanket,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Attire of the Queen.</hi>
                  </note> which was closely girt about her wast: and another that came loosely over her head and shoulders, like unto our old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion striped hangings. She had a young Child in her arms, and two Daughters walked by her, both Mariageable, with their faces almost covered with stripes or streaks of red, and about their Neck and Arms, almost loaden with small Beads of several colours. These <hi>Indian</hi> women of the Province of <hi>Darien,</hi> are generally very free, airy, and brisk; yet withal very modest, and cautious in their Husbands presence, of whose jealousie they stand in fear. With these <hi>Indians</hi> we made an exchange, or had a truck, as it is called, for Knives, Pins, Needles, or any other such like trifles; but in our dealing with them we found them to be very cunning. Here we rested our selves for the space of one day; and withal, chose Captain <hi>Sawkins</hi> to lead the Forlorn, unto whom, for that purpose, we gave the choice of Fourscore men. The King ordered us each man to have three Plantans, with Sugar-canes to suck, by way of a Present. But when these were consumed, if we would not truck we must have starved; for the King himself did not refuse to deal for his Plantans. This sort of Fruit is first reduced to mash, then

                  </note>On <hi>April</hi> the Ninth we continued our march along the banks of the River abovementioned, finding in our way here and there a House. The owners of the said Houses would most commonly stand at the door, and give, as we passed by, to every one of us, either a ripe Plantane, or some sweet <hi>Cazave-root.</hi> Some of them would count us by dropping a grain of Corn for each man that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; for they know no greater number, nor can tell no farther then Twenty. That night we arrived at three great <hi>Indian</hi> Houses, where we took up our Lodgings, the weather being clear and serene all night.</p>

But if it was so that we were tired in travelling by Land before, certainly we were in a worser condition now in our <hi>Canoas.</hi> For at the distance of almost every stones cast, we were constrained to quit, and get out of our Boats, and hale them over either Sands or Rocks: at other times over Trees that lay cross and filled up the River, so that they hindred our Navigation; yea, several times over the very points of Land it self. That night we built our selves Huts to shelter in upon the River side, and rested our wearied Limbs until next morning.</p>

                  </note> our pain and labour was rather doubled than diminished; not only for the difficulties of the way, which was intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but chiefly for the absence of our main body of men, from whom we had parted the day before. For now hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no news of them, we grew extreamly jealous of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> and their Councels, suspecting it a design of those people thus to divide our Forces, and then cutting us off, betray us unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> our implacable Enemies. That night we rested our selves by building of Huts, as we had done, and hath been mentioned before.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday morning, the next ensuing day,<note place="margin">

                  </note> we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued our Navigation down the River, and arrived at a beachy point of Land; at which place another Arm joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same River. Here, as we understood, the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Darien</hi> did usually Rendezvous, whensoever they drew up in a Body, with intention to fight their ancient Enemies the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Here also we made a hault, or stayed for the rest of our Forces and Company, the <hi>Indians</hi> having now sent to seek them, as being themselves not a little concerned at our dissatisfaction and jealousies. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon our Companions came up with us, and were huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glad to see us, they having been in no less fear for us, than we had been at the same time for them. We continued and rested there that night also, with design to fit our Arms for action, which now, as we were told, was nigh at hand.</p>

Unto the point above-mentioned, the <hi>Indians</hi> had hitherto guided our Canoas with long Poles or sticks; but now we made our selves Oars and Paddles to row with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and thereby make what speed we could. Thus we rowed with all hast imaginable, and upon the River hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to meet two or three <hi>Indian</hi> Canoas that were laded with Plantans.<note place="margin">

the distance of half a mile, more or less, from the Town of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> whither our march was all along intended. The place where we landed was deeply muddy, insomuch, that we were constrained to lay our paddles on the mud to wade upon, and withal, lift our selves up by the boughs of the trees, to support our Bodies from sinking. Afterwards we were forced to cut our way through the woods for some space, where we took up our Lodgings for that night, for fear of being discovered by the Enemy, unto whom we were so nigh.</p>

As soon as we came out of the Woods into the open ground, we were descryed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had received before-hand intelligence of our coming, and were prepared to receive us, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conveyed away all their Treasure of Gold, and sent it to <hi>Panama.</hi> They ran immediately into a large <hi>Paliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> Fort, having each Pale or Post twelve foot high, and began to fire very briskly at us as we came.

and made themselves Masters thereof. In this Action there were not fifty of our men that came up before the Fort was taken; and on our side only two were wounded, and not one killed. Notwithstanding within the place were found two hundred and threescore men, besides which number, two hundred others were said to be absent, being gone up into the Countrey unto the Mines to fetch down Gold, or rather to convey away what was already in the Town. This golden Treasure cometh down another branch of this River unto <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mountains, where are thought to be the richest Mines of the <hi>Indies,</hi> or, at least, of all these parts of the Western World.

                  </note>Among these Canoas, it was my misfortune to have one that was very heavy, and consequently sluggish. By this means we were left behind the rest a little way, our number being only four men, besides my self, that were embarked therein. As the Tyde fell, it left several shoals of sand naked; and hence, we not knowing of the true Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, amongst such variety of streams, hapned to steer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a shoal, above two mile, before we perceived our error. Hereupon, we were forced to lye by until high water came; for to row in such heavy boats as those are against the Tide, is a thing totally impossible. As soon as the Tyde began to turn, we rowed away in prosecution of our Voyage, and withal, made what hast we could, but all our endeavours were in vain, for we neither could find, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake our Companions. Thus about ten of the clock at night, the Tyde being low water, we stuck up an Oar in the River, and slept by turns in our Canoa, several show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of rain falling all the night long, with which we were throughly pierced to the skin.</p>
               <p>But the next morning, no sooner day was come, when we rowed away down the River,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as before, in pursuit of our people. Having gon about the space of two Leagues, we were so fortunate as to overtake them. For they had lain
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59013:16"/>
that night at an <hi>Indian</hi> Hut, or <hi>Embarcadero,</hi> that is to say, <hi>landing place,</hi> and had been filling of water till then i'th' morning. Being arrived at the place, they told us, that we must not omit to fill our Jars there with water, otherwise we should meet with none in the space of six days time. Hereupon we went every one of us the distance of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile from the <hi>Embarcadero,</hi> unto a little Pond, to fill our water in <hi>Calabazas,</hi> making withal what hast we could back unto our Canoa. But when we returned, we found not one of our men, they all being departed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready got out of sight. Such is the procedure of these wild men, that they care not in the least whom they loose of their company, or leave behind. We were now more troubled in our minds than before, fearing lest we should fall into the same misfortune we had so lately overcome.</p>
               <p>Hereupon we rowed after them, as fast as we possibly could, but all in vain. For here are found such huge num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s of Islands, greater and lesser, as also Keys about the mouth of the River, that it was not difficult for us, who were unacquainted with the River, to loose our selves a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time amongst them. Yet notwithstanding, though with much trouble and toil, we found at last that mouth of the River, that is called by the <hi>Spaniards, Boca chica,</hi> or the <hi>Little mouth.</hi> But as it hapned, it was now young flood, and the stream ran very violent against us. So that though we were not above a stones cast, from the said mouth, and this was within a League broad, yet we could not by any means come near it. Hence we were forced to put ashoar, which we did accordingly, until the time of high-water. We haled our Canoa close by the bushes, and when we got out, we fastned our Rope unto a Tree, which the Tyde had almost covered, for it floweth here nigh four fathom deep.</p>
               <p>As soon as the Tyde began to turn, we rowed away from thence unto an Island,<note place="margin">

                  </note> distant about a League and an half from the mouth of the River, in the Gulf of <hi>San Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel.</hi> Here in the Gulf it went very hard with us, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

any wave dashed against the sides of our Canoa, for it was nigh twenty foot in length, and yet not quite one foot and a half in breadth where it was at the broadest. So that we had just room enough to sit down in her, and a little water would easily have both filled and overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. At the Island aforesaid, we took up our resting place for that night, though for the loss of our company, and the great dangers we were in, the sorrowfullest night that until then, I ever experimented in my whole life. For it rained impetuously all night long, insomuch that we were wet from head to foot, and had not one dry thred about us; neither through the violence of the rain, were we able to keep any fire burning wherewith to warm or dry us. The Tide ebbeth here a good half mile from the mark of high water, and leaveth bare wonderful high, and sharp pointed rocks. We passed this heavy and tedious night without one sole minute of sleep, being all very sorrowful to see our selves so far and remote from the rest of our compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as also totally destitute of all humane comfort. For a vast Sea surrounded us on the one side, and the mighty power of our Enemies the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other. Neither could we descry at any hand the least thing to relieve us, all that we could see being the wide sea, high Mountains and Rocks; mean while our selves were confined to an Egg-shell, instead of a Boat, without so much as a few cloaths to defend us from the injuries of the weather. For at that time none of us had a shooe to our feet. We searched the whole Key, to see if we could find any water, but found none.</p>

               <p>ON Munday <hi>April</hi> the Nineteenth, at break of day, we halled our Canoa into the water again,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They put out to Sea again in the Canoa.</hi>
                  </note> and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Island aforementioned: both wet and cold, as we were, we rowed away towards the <hi>Punta de San Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> or <hi>Point St. Lawrence.</hi> In our way we met with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Islands which lye stragling thereabouts. But now we were again so hard put to it, by the smalness of our ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and being in an open sea, that it was become the work of one man, yea sometimes of two, to cast out the water, which came in on all sides of our Canoa. After strugling for some while with these difficulties, as we came near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of those Islands, a Sea came and overturned our Boat,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>And are cast away.</hi>
                  </note> by which means we were all forced to swim for our lives. But we soon got unto the Shoar, and to the same place our Canoa came tumbling after us. Our Arms were very fast lashed unto the inside of the Boat, and our Locks as well cased and waxed down as was possible; so were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our Catouche Boxes and powder-horns. But all our Bread and fresh water was utterly spoiled and lost.</p>
               <p>Our Canoa being tumbled on shoar by the force of the waves, our first business was to take out and clear our Arms.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Another ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.</hi>
                  </note> This we had scarcely done, but we saw another Canoa run the same misfortune at a little distance to Leeward of us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst a great number of Rocks that bounded the Island.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59013:18"/>
The persons that were cast away proved to be six <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the Garison of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> who had found an old Canoa, and had followed us to escape the cruelty of the <hi>Indians.</hi> They presently came unto us, and made us a fire; which being done, we got our meat and broyled it on the coals, and all of us eat amicably together. But we stood in great need of water, or any other drink to our Victuals, not knowing in the least where to get any. Our Canoa was thrown up by the waves to the edge of the water, and there was no great fear of its splitting, as being full six inches in thickness on the sides thereof. But that in which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> came, split it self against the Rocks, as being old and slender, into an hundred pieces. Though we were thus shipwrackt and driven ashoar, as I have related, yet other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and at other times, is this Gulf of <hi>San Miguel</hi> a meer Mill-pond for smoothness of water.</p>
               <p>My company was now altogether for returning, and to proceed no farther,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They consult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</hi>
                  </note> but rather for living amongst the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> in case they could not reach the Ships we had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us in the Northern Sea. But with much ado I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them to go forward at least one day longer, and in case we found not our people the next day, that then I would be willing to do any thing which they should think fit. Thus we spent two or three hours of the day in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting about our affairs, and withal keeping a man to watch and look out on all sides, for fear of any surprizal by the <hi>Indians,</hi> or other Enemies. About the time that we were come to a conclusion in our debates, our watchman by chance spyed an <hi>Indian</hi>; who, as soon as he saw us, ran into the woods. I sent immediately two of my company after him, who overtook him, and found that he was one of our friendly <hi>Indians.</hi> Thus he carryed them unto a place not far distant from thence, where seven more of his company were, with a great Canoa which they had brought with them. They came unto the place where I was with the rest of my company, and seemed to be glad to meet us on that Island. I asked them by signs for the main bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59013:18"/>
of our Company; and they gave me to understand, that in case we would go with them in their Canoa, which was much bigger than ours, we should be up with the Party by the next morning. This news, as may easily be supposed, not a little rejoyced our hearts.</p>
               <p>Presently after this friendly invitation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Author sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the lives of the</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</note> they asked who the other six men were, whom they saw in our company, for they easily perceived us not to be all of one and the same coat and <hi>lingua.</hi> We told them they were <hi>Wankers,</hi> which is the name they commonly give unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their own Language. Their next question was, if they should kill those <hi>Spaniards?</hi> but I answered them, No, by no means, I would not consent to have it done. With which answer they seemed to be satisfied for that present. But a little while after, my back being turned, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany thinking that they should oblige thereby the <hi>Indians,</hi> beckned unto them to kill the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> With this, the poor Creatures perceiving the danger that threatned them, made a sad shreek and outcry, and I came time enough to save all their lives. But withal, I was forced to give way and consent, they should have one of them, for to make him their slave. Hereupon I gave the Canoa that I came in unto the five <hi>Spaniards</hi> remaining, and bid them get away and shift for their lives, lest those cruel <hi>Indians</hi> should not keep their word, and they run again the same danger they had so lately escaped. Having sent them away, mean while I rested my self, here I took a Survey of this Gulf, and the mouth of the River, the which I finished the same day, and do here present unto the view of the Reader.</p>

                  </note> joyning company with those <hi>Indians,</hi> we were got into a very large Canoa, the which for its bigness, was better able to carry twenty men, than our own that we had brought to carry five. The <hi>Indians</hi> had also fitted a very good Sail unto the said Canoa; so that having now a fresh and strong gale of wind, we set sail from thence, and made therewith brave way, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite joy and comfort of our hearts, seeing our selves so well accommodated, and so happily rid of the miseries we but lately had endured. We had now a smooth and easie passage, after such tedious and laboursome pains as we had sustained in coming so far since we left <hi>Santa Maria.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the point of <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> mentioned above, is a very great ripling of the Sea, occasioned by a strong current which runneth hereabouts, and which oftentimes almost filled our Boat with its dashes, as we sailed. This evening, after our departure from the Island where we were cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it rained vehemently for several hours, and the night proved to be very dark. About nine of the clock that night we descryed two fires on the shoar of the Continent, over against us. These fires were no sooner perceived by the <hi>Indians</hi> of our Canoa, but they began to shout for joy, and cry out, Captain <hi>Antonio,</hi> Captain <hi>Andraeas,</hi> the names of their <hi>Indian</hi> Captains and Leaders; and to affirm, they were assured those fires were made by their Companions. Hence they made for the shoar towards those fires, as fast as they could drive. But so soon as our Canoa came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the breakers, nigh the shoar, out came from the Woods above threescore <hi>Spaniards</hi> with Clubs and other Arms, and laying hold on our Canoa on both sides thereof, halled it out of the water quite dry. So that by this means we were all suddainly taken and made their prisoners. I laid hold of my Gun, thinking to make some defence for my self, but all was in vain; for they as suddainly seized me between four or five of them, and hindred me from acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I'th' mean while our <hi>Indians</hi> leaped over board, and got away very nimbly into the Woods; my Companions
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59013:20"/>
standing amazed at what had hapned, and the manner of our surprizal. I asked them presently if any of them could speak either <hi>French</hi> or <hi>English:</hi> but they answered, No. Hereupon, as well as I could, I discoursed to some of them, who were more intelligent than the rest, in <hi>Latin,</hi> and by degrees came to understand their condition. These were <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had been turned here ashoar by our English party, who left them upon this Coast, left by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them nearer unto <hi>Panama,</hi> any of them should make their escape, and discover our march towards that City. They had me presently after I was taken into a small Hut which they had built, covered with boughs, and made there great shouts for joy, because they had taken us; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing in their minds to use us very severely for coming into those parts, and especially for taking and plundering their Town of <hi>Santa Maria.</hi> But mean while the Captain of those <hi>Spaniards</hi> was examining me, in came the poor <hi>Spaniard</hi> that was come along with us, and reported how kind I had been to him, and the rest of his Companions, by saving their Lives from the cruelty of the <hi>Indians.</hi>

                  </note>The Captain having heard him, arose from his seat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and embraced me, saying, that we Englishmen were very friendly Enemies, and good people, but that the <hi>Indians</hi> were very Rogues, and a treacherous Nation. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he desired me to sit down by him, and to eat part of such Victuals as our Companions had left them when they were turned ashoar. Then he told me, that for the kindness I had shewed unto his Countrymen, he gave us all our Lives and Liberties, which otherwise he would certainly have taken from us. And though he could scarcely be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his mind to spare the <hi>Indians</hi> lives, yet for my sake he did pardon them all, and I should have them with me, in case I could find them. Thus he bid me likewise take my Canoa, and go in Gods name, saying withal, he wished us as fortunate as we were generous. Hereupon I took my leave of him, after some little stay, though he invited me to tarry all night with him. I searched out, and at last
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59013:20"/>
found my <hi>Indians,</hi> who for fear had hid themselves in the bushes adjoyning to the neighbouring woods, where they lay concealed. Having found them, the Captain led me very civilly down unto the Canoa, and bidding my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and the <hi>Indians</hi> get in after me; as they at first halled us ashoar, so now again they pushed us off to Sea, by a suddain and strange vicissitude of fortune. All that night it rained very hard, as was mentioned above; neither durst we put any more ashoar at any place, it being all along such, as by Mariners is commonly called an <hi>Iron Coast.</hi>

Being come up with us, and in view, it proved to be of our own English Company, who mistaking our Canoa for a Spanish <hi>Periagua,</hi> was coming in all hast to attack us. We were infinitely gladded to meet them, and they presently conducted us to the rest of our Company, who were at that instant coming from a deep Bay, which lay behind a high point of Rocks, where they had lain at Anchor all that night and morning. We were all mutually rejoyced to see one another again, they having given both me and my Companions for lost.</p>

then an Island seven Leagues distant from the Bay afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. On the highest part of this Island the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> keep a watch, or <hi>Look-out,</hi> (for so it is termed by the Sea-men) for fear of Pyrates, or other Enemies. That evening we arrived at the Island, and being landed, went up a very steep place, till we came to a little Hut where the watchman lodged. We took by surprizal the old man who watched in the place, but hapned to see us not, till we were got into his Plantane walk before the Lodge. He told us in his examination, that we were not as yet descryed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Panama,</hi> or any others that he knew; which relation of the old fellow much encouraged us to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with our design of surprizing that rich City. This place, if I took its name rightly, is called <hi>Farol de Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> or in English, <hi>Plantane-watch.</hi>

                     <hi>The</hi> Bucaniers <hi>take a Bark of</hi> Panama.</note>Here, not long before it was dark that evening, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bark came to an anchor at the outward side of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, which instantly was descryed by us. Hereupon, we speedily Manned out two Canoas, who went under the shoar and surprized the said Boat. Having examined the persons that were on board, we found she had been absent the space of eight days from <hi>Panama,</hi> and had landed Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at a point of Land not far distant from this Island, with intention to fight and curb certain <hi>Indians</hi> and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, who had done much hurt in the Country therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. The Bark being taken, most of our men endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get into her, but more especially those who had the lesser Canoas. Thus there embarked thereon to the number of one hundred thirty and seven of our company, together with that Sea-Artist, and valiant Commander, Captain <hi>Bartholomew Sharp.</hi> With him went also on board Captain <hi>Cook,</hi> whom we mentioned at the beginning of this History. The remaining part of that night we lay at the Key of the said Island, expecting to prosecute our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the next day.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59013:21"/>
lesser than the former, yet was furnished with better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Departing from the Island, we rowed all day long over shoal water, at the distance of about a League from land, having sometimes not above four foot water, and white ground. In the afternoon we descryed a Bark at sea, and instantly gave her chace. But the Canoa wherein was Captain <hi>Harris</hi> hapned to come up the first with her, who after a sharp dispute took her. Being taken, we put on board the said Bark thirty men. But the wind would not suffer the other Bark in chacing to come up with us. This pursuit of the Vessel did so far hinder us in our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and divide us asunder, that night coming on presently after, we lost one another, and could no longer keep in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together. Hereupon we laid our Canoa ashoar, to take up our rest for that night, at the distance of two miles, more or less, from high water mark, and about four Leagues to Leeward of the Island of <hi>Chepillo,</hi> unto which place our course was then directed.</p>

In our way as we went, we espyed another Bark under sail, as we had done the day before. Capt. <hi>Coxons</hi> Canoa was now the first that came up with this vessel. But a young breese freshning at that instant, she got away from him after the first onset, killing in the said Canoa one Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two others. We presently conjectured that this Bark would get before us unto <hi>Panama,</hi> and give intelligence of our coming unto those of the Town; all which hapned as we had foreseen. It was that day two of the clock in the afternoon, before all our Canoas could come together, and joyn one another as it was assigned at <hi>Chepillo.</hi>

away from the said Island, to the intent we might at least be able to surprize and take their Shipping, and by that means make our selves masters of those Seas, in case we could not get the Town, which now we judged almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be done.

So that the ship of <hi>Don Diego de Carabaxal</hi> came between us two, and fired presently on me to Windward, and on him to Leeward, wounding with these broad sides, four men in his Canoa, and one in that I was in. But he paid so dear for his passage between us, that he was not very quick in coming about again and making the same way. For we killed with our first volly of shot, several of his men dead upon the decks. Thus we also got to Windward, as the rest were before.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59013:23"/>
At this time the Admiral of the <hi>Armadilla,</hi> or <hi>Little Fleet,</hi> came up with us suddainly, scarce giving us time to charge, and thinking to pass by us all with as little or less damage, as the first of his Ships had done. But as it hapned, it fell out much worse with him, for we were so fortunate, as to kill the man at the Helm. So that his Ship ran into the wind, and her Sails lay a back, as is usually said in Marine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. By this means we had time to come all up under his stern, and firing continually into his Vessel, we killed as many as came to the Helm. Besides which slaughter, we cut asunder his main sheet and brace with our shot. At this time the third vessel, in which Captain <hi>Peralta</hi> was, was coming up to the aid of their General. Hereupon Captain <hi>Sawkins,</hi> who had changed his Canoa, and was gone into the <hi>Periagua,</hi> left the Admiral to us four Canoas, (for his own was quite disabled) and met the said <hi>Peralta.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him &amp; Captain <hi>Sawkins</hi> the dispute, or fight, was very hot, lying board on board together, and both giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving death unto each other as fast as they could charge. In the mean while that we were thus engaged, the first ship tackt about, and came up to relieve the Admiral. But we perceiving that, and foreseeing how hard it would go with us, if we should be beaten from the Admirals stern, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to prevent his design. Hereupon two of our Canoas, to wit, Captain <hi>Springers</hi> and my own, stood off to meet him. He made up directly towards the Admiral, who stood upon the quarter deck, waving unto him with a Handkerchief so to do But we engaged him so closely, in the middle of his way, that had he not given us the Helm,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Vessel which was to relieve the Admiral being thus put to slight, we came about again upon the Admiral,<note place="margin">

our men in the <hi>Periagua,</hi> though at a distance from us. At that time we came so close under the stern of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that we wedged up the Rudder; and withal, killed both the Admiral himself, and the chief Pilot of his ship; so that now they were almost quite disabled and dis-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned likewise,<note place="margin">

Hereupon, two thirds of their men being killed, and many others wounded, they cryed for Quarter, which had several times been offered unto them, and as stoutly denyed until then. Captain <hi>Coxon</hi> entred on board the Admiral, and took with him Captain <hi>Harris,</hi> who had been shot through both his Legs, as he boldly adventured up along the side of the ship.<note place="margin">

                  </note>Thus coming up close under <hi>Peralta</hi>'s side, we gave him a full volley of shot, and expected to have the like return from him again. But on a suddain we saw his men blown up that were abast the Mast; some of them falling on the deck, and others into the Sea. This disaster was no sooner perceived by their valiant Captain <hi>Peralta,</hi> but he leaped over board, and in spight of all our shot, got several of them into the ship again; though he was much burnt in both his hands himself. But as one misfortune seldom cometh alone, mean while he was recovering these men to reinforce his ship withal, and renew the fight, another Jar of powder took fire forward, and blew up several others upon the Fore-castle. Among this smoak, and under the opportunity thereof, Captain <hi>Sawkins</hi> laid them on board, and took the ship. Soon after they were taken, I went on board Captain <hi>Peralta,</hi> to see what condition they were in. And indeed, such a miserable sight I never saw in my life.

For not one man there was found, but was either killed, desperately wounded, or horribly burnt with Powder.

                  </note> I went after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on board the Admiral, to observe likewise the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Ship and men. Here I saw what did meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly astonish me, and will scarcely be believed by others than our selves who saw it. There were found on board this ship but twenty five men alive, whose number before the fight had been fourscore and six, as was said above. So that three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and one, out of so small a number, were destroyed in the Battle. But what is more, of these twenty five men, only eight were able to bear Arms, all the rest being des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wounded, and by their wounds totally disabled to make any resistance, or defend themselves. Their blood ran down the decks in whole streams, and not scarce one place in the ship was found that was free from blood.</p>

                  </note> Captain <hi>Sawkins</hi> asked the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, how many Men there might be on board the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test ship that we could see from thence, lying in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Island of <hi>Perico</hi> above-mentioned, as also in the others that were something smaller. Captain <hi>Peralta</hi> hearing these questions, disswaded him as much as he could from attempting them; saying, that in the biggest alone there were Three hundred and fifty men, and that he would find the rest too well provided for defence against his small number. But one of his men, who lay a dying upon the deck, contradicted him as he was speaking, and told Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sawkins,</hi> there was not one man on board any of those ships that were in view; for they had all been taken out of them to fight us in these three vessels called the <hi>Armadilla,</hi> or Little Fleet. Unto this relation we gave credit, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a dying man; and steering our course unto the Island, we went on board them, and found, as he had said, not one person there. The biggest ship of these, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59013:25"/>
was called <hi>La Santissima Trinidad,</hi> or the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> they had set on fire, made a hole in her, and loosened her fore-sail. But we quenched the fire with all speed, and stopt the leak. This being done, we put our wounded men on board her, and thus constituted her for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to be our Hospital.</p>

                  </note>Having surveyed our own loss and damages, we found that eighteen of our men had been killed in the fight, and twenty two were wounded.

Neither was this repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation undeservedly conferred upon them, as may easily be inferred from the relation we have given of this bloody Engagement. As the third ship was running away from the fight, she met with two more that were coming out to their assistance; but withal, gave them so little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they returned back, and dared not engage us. We began the Fight about half an hour after Sun-rise, and by noon had finished the Battle, and quite overcome them. Capt. <hi>Peralta,</hi> mean while he was our Prisoner, would often break out into admirations of our Valour, and say, surely, <hi>We Englishmen were the valiantest men in the whole world, who designed always to fight open, whilst all other Nations invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the ways imaginable to barricade themselves, and fight as close as they could.</hi> And yet notwithstanding, we killed more of our Enemies than they of us.</p>

               <p>THe famous City of <hi>Panama</hi> is situate in the latitude of nine degrees North. It standeth in a deep Bay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Present state of</hi> Panama.</note> belonging to the South Sea. It is in form round, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only that part where it runs along the Sea-side. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it stood four miles more Easterly, when it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Sir <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> as is related in the History of the <hi>Bucaniers.</hi> But by him then being burnt, and three times more since that time by casualty, they removed it to the place where it now standeth. Yet notwithstanding, some poor people there are still inhabiting at the old Town, and the Cathedral Church is still kept there, the beautiful building whereof maketh a fair shew at a distance, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> at <hi>London.</hi> This new City, of which I now speak, is much bigger than the old one was, and is built for the most part of brick, the rest being built of stone, and tiled. As for the Churches belonging thereunto, they are not as yet finished. These are eight in number, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the chiefest is called <hi>Santa Maria.</hi> The extent of the City comprehendeth better than a mile and a half in length, and above a mile in breadth. The Houses for the most part are three stories in heighth. It is well walled round about, with two Gates belonging thereunto, excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where a Creek cometh into the City, the which at high-water letteth in Barks, to furnish the Inhabitants with all sorts of Provisions and other Necessaries. Here are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59013:26"/>
Three hundred of the Kings Souldiers to Garrison the City; besides which number, their <hi>Militia</hi> of all colours, are one thousand one hundred. But at the time that we arrived there, most of their Souldiers were out of Town; insomuch, that our coming put the rest into great conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they having had but one nights notice of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in those Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence we were induced to believe, that had we gone ashoar, instead of fighting their ships, we had certainly rendred our selves masters of the place; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considering, that all their chief men were on board the Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iral; I mean, such as were undoubtedly the best Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Round about the City, for the space of seven Leagues, more or less, all the adjacent Country is <hi>Savana,</hi> as they call it in the Spanish Language, that is to say, plain and level ground, as smooth as a sheet; for this is the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word <hi>Savana.</hi> Only here and there is to be seen a small spot of woody Land; and every where this level ground is full of <hi>Vacadas,</hi> or <hi>Beef Stantions,</hi> where whole droves of Cows and Oxen are kept, which serve as well as so many <hi>Look-outs,</hi> or <hi>Watch-Towers,</hi> to descry if an Enemy is approaching by land. The ground whereon the City standeth, is very damp and moist, which rendreth the place but of bad repute for the concern of health. The water is also very full of worms, and these are much prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to shipping; which is the cause that the Kings Ships lye always at <hi>Lima,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Peru,</hi> unless when they come down to <hi>Panama</hi> to bring the Kings Plate; which is only at such times, as the Fleet of <hi>Galeones</hi> cometh from <hi>Old Spain</hi> to fetch and convey it thither. Here in one night after our arrival, we found Worms of three quarters of an inch in length, both in our Bed-cloaths and other Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>

The second ship was of about Three hundred Tuns burthen, and not above half laded with bars of Iron, which is one of the richest Commodities that are brought into the South Sea. This vessel we burned with the lading in her, because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretended not to want that Commodity, and therefore would not redeem it. The third was laden with Sugar, being of the burthen of one hundred and fourscore Tuns, more or less. This vessel was given to be under the Command of Captain <hi>Cook.</hi> The fourth was an old ship of sixty Tuns burthen, which was laden with slower of Meal. This ship we likewise burnt with her lading; esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both bottom and Cargo, at that time, to be useless unto us. The fifth was a ship of Fifty Tuns, the which, with a <hi>Periagua,</hi> Captain <hi>Coxon</hi> took along with him when he left us.</p>

                  </note> Captain <hi>Coxon</hi> being much dissatisfied with some reflections which had been made upon him by our company, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to leave us, and return back to our ships in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Seas, by the same way he came thither. Unto this effect, he perswaded several of our company, who sided most with him, and had had the chiefest hand in his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to fall off from us, and bear him company in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or march over-land. The main cause of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, was the backwardness in the last Engagement with the <hi>Armadilla</hi>; concerning which point, some stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to defame, or brand him, with the note of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize. He drew off with him, to the number of threescore and ten of our men, who all returned back with him in the Ship and <hi>Periagua</hi> above-mentioned, towards the mouth of the River of <hi>Santa Maria.</hi> In his company also went back the <hi>Indian</hi> King, Captain <hi>Antonio,</hi> and Don <hi>Andraeas,</hi> who being old, desired to be excused from staying any longer with us. However, the King desired we would not be less vigourous in annoying their enemy and ours, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> than if he were personally present with us.

So that if he pleased to send us five hundred pieces of Eight for each man, and one thousand for each Commander, and not any farther to annoy the</hi> Indians, <hi>but suffer them to use their own power and liberty, as became the true and natural Lords of the Country, that then we would

On the next day the Merchant who carryed them, returning to <hi>Tavoga,</hi> brought unto the Captain a golden ring for a reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of said present.

The day of this action, as I find it quoted in my Journal, was <hi>May</hi> 22. 1680. When they came unto the Rivers mouth, they put themselves into Canoas, and were piloted up the River towards the Town by a Negroe, who was one of our Prisoners.

But here at <hi>Puebla Nueba,</hi> the Inhabitants were too well provided for the reception of our party. For at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a mile below the Town, they had cut down great Trees, and laid them cross the River, with design to hinder the ascent of any Boats. In like manner on shoar before the Town it self, they had raised three strong breast-works, and made other things for their defence. Here therefore Captain <hi>Sawkins</hi> running up to the breast-works, at the head of a few men, was killed; a man who was as valiant and couragious as any could be,<note place="margin">

But as we were getting in, being strangers unto the place, we unwittingly ran our ship on ground, nigh unto a Rock which lyeth on the westward shoar: for the true Channel of the said Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is nearer to the East than West shoar.

With this he returned on board our ships, being much troubled in his mind, and grieved for the loss of so bold and brave a partner in his Adventures, as <hi>Sawkins</hi> had constantly shewed himself to be. His death was much lamented, and occasioned another party of our men to mutiny, and leave us returning over land, as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Coxon</hi> and his company had done before.</p>
               <p>Three days after the death of Captain <hi>Sawkins,</hi> Captain <hi>Sharp,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sharp <hi>chosen.</hi>
                  </note> who was now Commander in chief, gave the ship which he had taken in the River of <hi>Puebla Nueba,</hi> and which was of the burthen of one hundred Tuns, more or less, unto Captain <hi>Cook,</hi> to Command and Sail in. Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal, that the old vessel which he had, should go with those men that designed to leave us; their Mutiny, and our Distraction being now grown very high. Hereupon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sharp</hi> coming on board <hi>La Trinidad,</hi> the greatest of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59013:30"/>
our ships, asked our men in full Councel, who of them were willing to go or stay, and prosecute the design Captain <hi>Sawkins</hi> had undertaken, which was to remain in the South Sea, and there to make a compleat Voyage; after which, he intended to go home round about <hi>America,</hi> through the Straights of <hi>Magallanes.</hi> He added withal, that he did not as yet fear, or doubt in the least, but to make each man who should stay with him, worth one thousand pound, by the fruits he hoped to reap of that Voyage. All those who had remained after the departure of Captain <hi>Coxon,</hi> for love of Captain <hi>Sawkins,</hi> and only to be in his company, and under his Conduct, thinking thereby to make their fortunes, would stay no longer, but pressed to depart. Among this number I acknowledge my self to have been one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Many leave them.</hi>
                  </note> as being totally desirous in my mind, to quit those hazardous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and return homewards in company of those who were now going to leave us. Yet being much afraid and averse to trust my self among wild <hi>Indians</hi> any farther, I chose rather to stay, though unwilling, and venture on that long and dangerous Voyage. Besides which danger of the <hi>Indians,</hi> I considered that the Rains were now already up, and it would be hard passing so many Gullies, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity would then be full of water, and consequently cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate more than one single peril unto the undertakers of that Journey. Yet notwithstanding, sixty three men of our company were resolved to encounter all these hardships, and to depart from us. Hereunto they took their leave of us, and returned homewards, taking with them the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings Son, and the rest of the <hi>Indians</hi> for their guides over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. They had, as was said above, the ship wherein Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Cook</hi> sailed to carry them: and out of our Provision as much as would serve for treble their number.</p>
               <p>Thus on the last day of <hi>May</hi> they departed,<note place="margin">

Here we caught very good Tortoise, and Red Deer. We killed also <hi>Alligators</hi> of a very large size, some
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59013:31"/>
of them being above twenty foot in length. But we could not find but that they were very fearful of a Man, and would fly from us very hastily when we hunted them. This Island lyeth S. S. E. from the mouth of the River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned. On the South-East side of the Island is a shoal, or spit of sand, which stretcheth it self the space of a quarter of a League into the Sea. Here therefore, just within this shoal, we anchored in the depth of fourteen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom water. The Island on this side thereof maketh two great Bays, in the first of which we watered, at a certain pond not distant above the cast of a stone up from the Bay. In this pond, as I was washing my self, and standing under a <hi>Manzanilla</hi>-tree, a small shower of rain hapned to fall on the tree, and from thence dropped on my skin. These drops caused me to break out all over my body into red spots, of which I was not well for the space of a week af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Here I eat very large Oysters,<note place="margin">

now was very frequent in all places. About five of the clock in the evening we set sail from the Island of <hi>Cayboa,</hi> with a small breez, the wind being at S. S. W. Our course was E.

               <p>Little better then a calm we had also the third day of our Navigation. Mean while a current drove us to the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

About six of the clock that evening, we were nigh ten Leagues distant W.S.W. from them. Much like unto the former weather we had the fourth day of our Sailing, with little wind in the forenoon, and rather less than more in the afternoon. I judged about the middle of the day, we were at the distance of twenty Leagues S. S. W. from the said Islands.</p>
               <p>Thursday <hi>June</hi> the Tenth, we had very small and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble winds. This day I reckoned that we had made hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

a S. by E. way, and a S. by W. from our departure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven by a current, according to the observation I made, into the Latitude of six degrees and thirty minutes.</p>
               <p>This day we saw much Tortoise floating upon the Sea.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Hereupon, we hoisted out our Boat, and came to one of them, who offered not to stir until she was struck; and even then not to sink to the bottom, but rather to swim away. The sea hereabouts is very full of several sorts of Fish, as <hi>Dolphins, Bonitos, Albicores, Mullets,</hi> and <hi>Old Wives, &amp;c.</hi> which came swimming about our ship in whole shoals. The next day, which was Friday, we had likewise very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wind; which was no more than we had all Thursday night, with some showers of rain. That day we had an observation, which was six deg. N. latitude. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fresh wind came up at S. W. our course being S. S. E. On Saturday we had in like manner, about seven in the morning, a fresh breeze at South. So we stood W. S. W. with cloudy weather, and several showers of rain.

                  </note> we might in all probability lye there undiscryed, and our Enemies the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in the mean time might think, that we were gone out of those Seas.

During the time of our stay at this Island, we lengthned our top-sail-yards, and got up top gallant masts; we made two stay-sails, and refitted our ship very well.

we had a land breez to help us, which lasted for the space of six hours, more or less. So that at noon we found our selves to be five Leagues and a half distant to the South West from <hi>Gorgona.</hi> This day the <hi>Spaniards</hi> our prisoners, told us, in common discourse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A deep Coast.</hi>
                  </note> that in most part of this low-land Coast, they find threescore fathom water. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon we had from land a very strong breez: mean while we continued making short trips off and in. That night we had much rain for the greatest part of the night, which occasioned the next morning, being the third day of our Navigation, to be very cloudy until ten of the clock. About that hour it cleared up, and then we saw the Island of <hi>Gorgona</hi> at E. N. E. being distant about twelve Leagues more or less from us. We had the wind all this day at S.W. where it continued, seldom varying above two points of the Compass to the Westwards. Night being come, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten of the clock, Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> ordered me to speak unto Captain <hi>Cox,</hi> and bid him go about and stand off from the shoar, for he feared least <hi>Cox</hi> should come too nigh unto it.

Yet notwithstanding at eight of the clock it cleared up, and neither then could we see him. From hence we concluded, and so it proved, that we had lost him in the obscurity of the night, through his obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in standing in too long, and not coming about when we spoke unto him. Thus our Admirals ship was left alone, and we had not the company of Captain <hi>Cox</hi> any longer in this Voyage, till we arrived at the <hi>Isle of Plate,</hi> where we had the good fortune to find him again, as shall be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hereafter.

               <p>The next day we had both a fair day, and a fresh wind to help us on our Voyage. We observed that Cape <hi>Passao</hi> maketh three points, between which are two Bays.

The Cape representeth with much likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the brow of an <hi>Alligator</hi> or <hi>Cayman.</hi> At South Cape <hi>Passao</hi> appeareth thus.</p>

though it were just before us, and not altogether two Leagues distant from us. But as soon as it cleared up, we stood in towards the Land, until we came within a mile of the shoar. Here having sounded, we found seven fathom and a half water, under which was a light and clayey ground. The Coast all along is very mountainous, and likewise full of high and towring Cliffs. When we soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Tyde was almost at low-water. Here it ebbeth and floweth nigh four fathom perpendicular. From this Cape the land runneth along S. E. for the space of three or four Leagues, with huge high-land Cliffs, like unto those of <hi>Callis</hi> over against <hi>England.</hi> Being past this Cape, high-land South from us, is <hi>Cape St. Lawrence.</hi>

From thence to windward is seen a very pleasant Country, with spots here and there of woody land; which causeth the Country all over to look like so many enclosures of ripe Corn fields. To Leeward of the said Hill, the Land is all high and hilly, with white Cliffs at the sea-side. The Coast runneth S. W. till it reacheth unto a point of Land, within which is the Port of <hi>Manta,</hi> as it is called. This Port of <hi>Manta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

But their long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Voyages, he added, were occasioned by their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at too great a distance from the shoar. Moreover, he told us, that had we gone unto the Islands of <hi>Galapagos,</hi> as we were once determined to do, we had met in that Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with many Calms, and such Currents, that many ships have by them been lost, and never heard of to this day.

We cut also six foot of our bolt-sprit, and three foot more of our head. Most of the time that we remained here, we had hasey weather. Only now and then the Sun would happen to break out, and then to shine so hot, that it burnt the skin of the necks of several of our men. As for me, my lips were burnt in such manner, that they were not well in a whole week after.</p>

                  <hi>August</hi> the twenty third, this day the wind was S. W. by S. and S. S. W. In the morning we stood off. The Island <hi>Solango,</hi> at N.E. by N. appeareth thus:</p>

               <p>At S. by W. and about six Leagues distance from us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Point</hi> St. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</note> we descryed a long and even hill. I took it to be an Island, and conjectured it might be at least eight Leagues distant from the Continent. But afterwards we found it was a point of Land joyning unto the Main, and is called <hi>Point St. Helena,</hi> being continued by a piece of Land which lyeth low, and in several places is almost drowned from the sight; so that it cannot be seen at two Leagues distance. In this low-land the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have convenience for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Pitch, Tar, Salt, and some other things, for which purpose they have several houses here, and a Fryar, who serveth them as their Chaplain. From the Island of <hi>Solan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> unto this place, are reckoned eleven leagues, more or less. The Land is hereabouts indifferent high, and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise full of Bays. We had this day very little wind to help us in our Voyage, excepting what blasts came now and then in snatches. These sometimes would prove pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fair unto us, and allow us for some little while a South course. But our chiefest course was S.E. by S. The point of <hi>St. Helen</hi> at South half East, and about six Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, giveth exactly this appearance as followeth.</p>

               <p>Here we found no great current of the Sea to move any way. At the Isle of <hi>Plata,</hi> afore described, the Sea ebbeth and sloweth nigh thirteen foot perpendicular. About four Leagues to Leeward of this Point is a deep Bay, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Key at the mouth of it, which taketh up the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of its wideness. In the deepest part of the Bay on shoar, we saw a great smoak, which was at a Village be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Bay; unto which place the people were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Point above-mentioned. This afternoon we had a small Westerly wind, our course being S. S. W. Hereabouts it is all along a very bold shoar. At three of the clock after noon, we tackt about to clear our selves of the Point.<note place="margin">

But the sail proved to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, then a pair of Bark-Logs, which arriving on shoar, the men spread their sail on the sand of the Bay to dry.

But they offered not to stir, which gave us to understand, they knew us not. We could perceive from the ship a great path leading unto the Hills. So that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59013:44"/>
we believed this place to be a <hi>look-out,</hi> or watch-place, for the security of <hi>Guayaquil.</hi> Between four and five we dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the point, and then we descryed the <hi>Point Chandy,</hi> at the distance of six Leagues S. S. E. from this point. At first sight it seemed like unto a long Island, but withal, lower then that of <hi>St. Helena.</hi>

                  </note> this day at noon we took the other ship wherein Captain <hi>Cox</hi> sailed into a Tow, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day a greater hinderance than before unto our Voyage. Thus about three in the afternoon we lost sight of land, in standing over for <hi>Cape Blanco.</hi> Here we found a strong current to move unto the S. W. The wind was at S.W. by S. our course being S. by E. At the upper end of this Gulf, which is framed by the two Capes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, standeth the City of <hi>Guayaquil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Guayaquil.</note> being a very rich place, and the <hi>Embarcadero,</hi> or Sea-port unto the great City of <hi>Quito.</hi> Unto this place likewise, many of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Lima</hi> do usually send the Money they design for <hi>Old Spain</hi> in Barks, and by that means save the Custom that otherwise they should pay unto the King by carrying it on board of the Fleet. Hither cometh much Gold from <hi>Quito,</hi> and very good and strong broad-cloath, together with Images for the use of the Churches, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of considerable value.

This was the Town unto which Captain <hi>Sawkins</hi> intended to make his Voyage, as was mentioned above. When ships of greater burthen come into this Gulf, they anchor without <hi>Lapina,</hi> and then put their lading into lesser Vessels to carry it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town. Towards the evening of this day, a small breez sprung up, varying from point to point. After which, about nine of the clock at night we tacked about, and stood off to Sea, W. by N.</p>

                  </note>As soon as we had tackt, we hapned to espy a Sail N.N.E. from us. Hereupon, we instantly cast off our other Vessel, which we had in a Tow, and stood round about after them. We came very near unto the vessel before they saw us, by reason of the darkness of the night. As soon as they espied us, they immediately clapt on a wind, and sailed very well before us; insomuch, that it was a pretty while before we could come up with them, and within call. We halled them in Spanish, by means of an <hi>Indian</hi> prisoner, and commanded them to lower their top-sails. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, they would soon make us to lower our own. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, we fired several Guns at them, and they as thick at us again with their <hi>Harquibusses.</hi> Thus they fought us for the space of half an hour, or more, and would have done it longer, had we not killed the man at the Helm; after whom, none of the rest dared to be so hardy as to take his place. With another of our shot we cut in pieces and disabled their main-top halliards. Hereupon, they cryed out for Quarter, which we gave them, and entred their ship. Being possessed of the Vessel, we found in her five and thirty men: of which number twenty four were Natives of <hi>Old Spain.</hi> They had one and thirty fire arms on board the ship for their defence. They had not fought us, as they declared afterwards, but only out of a <hi>bravado,</hi> having promised on shoar so to do, in case they met us at Sea. The Captain of this Vessel was a person of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his Brother, since the death of <hi>Don Jacinto de Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahona,</hi> killed by us in the Engagement before <hi>Panama,</hi> was now made Admiral of the Sea <hi>Armada.</hi> With him we took also in this Bark, five or six other persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. They did us in this fight, though short, very great damage in our Rigging, by cutting it in pieces. Besides which, they wounded two of our men. And a third man was wounded by the negligence of one of our own men, occasioned by a Pistol which went off unadvisedly. About eleven of the clock this night we stood off to the West.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>What informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had from the Prize.</hi>
                  </note> we hoisted out our Canoa, and went aboard the Bark which we had taken the night before. We transported on board our own ship more of the Prisoners taken in the said vessel, and began to examine them, to learn what intelligence we could from them. The Captain of the vessel, who was a very civil and meek Gentleman, satisfyed our desires in this point very exactly, saying unto us: <hi>Gentlemen, I am now your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner at War by the over-ruling providence of fortune; and moreover, am very well satisfyed that no money whatsoever can procure my ransom, at least for the present at your hands. Hence I am perswaded, it is not my interest to tell you a Lye; which if I do, I desire you to punish me as severely as you shall think fit. We heard of your taking and destroying our</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madilla, <hi>and other ships at</hi> Panama, <hi>about six weeks after that Engagement, by two several Barks which arrived here from thence. But they could not inform us whether you designed to come any farther to the Southward; but rather, desired we would send them speedily all the help by Sea that we could. Hereupon, we sent the noise and rumour of your being in these Seas, by land unto</hi> Lima, <hi>desiring they would expedite what succours they could send to joyn with ours. We had at that time in our Harbour two or three great ships, but all of them very unfit to sail. For this reason, at</hi> Lima, <hi>the Vice-Roy of</hi> Peru <hi>pressed three great Merchant ships, into the biggest of which he put Fourteen brass guns; into the second, Ten; and in the other Six. Vnto these he added two Barks, and put seven hundred and fifty Souldiers on board them all. Of this number of men they landed eightscore at</hi> Point St. Helena; <hi>all the rest being carryed down to</hi> Panama, <hi>with design to fight you there. Besides these Forces, two other men of War, bigger than the afore-mentioned, are still lying at</hi> Lima, <hi>and fitting out there in all speed to follow and pursue you. One of these men of war is equipped with thirty six brass guns, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thirty. These ships, beside their complement of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have four hundred Souldiers added unto them by the</hi> Vice-Roy. <hi>Another man of war belonging to this number,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59013:46"/>
and lesser than the afore-mentioned, is called the</hi> Patache. <hi>This ship consisteth of twenty four guns, and was sent to</hi> Arica <hi>to fetch the Kings Plate from thence. But the Vice-Roy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received intelligence of your exploits at</hi> Panama, <hi>sent for this ship back from thence with such hast, that they came away and left the Money behind them. Hence the</hi> Patache <hi>now lyeth at the Port of</hi> Callao, <hi>ready to sail on the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or news of your arrival thereabouts: they having for this purpose sent unto all parts very strict orders to keep a good look-out on all sides, and all places along the Coasts. Since this, from</hi> Manta <hi>they sent us word, that they had seen two Ships at sea pass by that place. And from the</hi> Goat Key <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we heard, that the</hi> Indians <hi>had seen you, and that they were assured, one of your vessels was the ship called</hi> la Trinidad, <hi>which you had taken before</hi> Panama, <hi>as being a ship very well known in these Seas. From hence we concluded that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was to ply, and make your Voyage thereabouts. Now this Bark wherein you took us prisoners being bound for</hi> Panama, <hi>the Governour of</hi> Guayaquil <hi>sent us out before her departure, if possible to discover you. Which if we did, we were to run the Bark on shoar and get away, or else to fight you with these Souldiers and fire arms that you see. As soon as we heard of your being in these Seas, we built two Forts, the one of six Guns, and the other of four, for the defence of the Town. At the last Muster taken in the Town of</hi> Guayaquil, <hi>we had there eight hundred and fifty men, of all colours; but when we came out, we left only two hundred men that were actually under Arms.</hi> Thus ended the Relation of that worthy Gentleman. About noon that day we unrigged the Bark which we had taken, and after so doing sunk her. Then we stood S.S.E. and afterwards S. by W. and S.S.W. That evening we saw Point <hi>St. Helena</hi> at North half East, at the distance of nine Leagues more or less.</p>
               <p>The next day, being <hi>August</hi> the 26th, in the morning we stood S.<note place="margin">

                  </note> That day we cryed out all our pillage, and found that it amounted unto 3276 Pieces of Eight, which was accordingly divided by shares amongst us. We also

punished a Fryar,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Their cruelty towards a Fryar.</hi>
                  </note> who was Chaplain to the Bark afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and shot him upon the deck, casting him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board before he was dead. Such cruelties though I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred very much in my heart, yet here was I forced to hold my tongue and contradict them not, as having not authority to oversway them. About ten of the clock this morning we saw Land again, and the Pilot said we were sixteen Leagues to leeward of <hi>Cabo Blanco.</hi> Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we stood off and in, close under the shoar; the which all appeared to be barren land.</p>
               <p>The morning following we had very little wind;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eight of their men destroyed at</hi> Gallo.</note> so that we advanced but slowly all that day. To windward of us we could perceive the Continent to be all high land, being whitish clay, full of white Cliffts. This morning in common discourse, our Prisoners confessed unto us, and acknowledged the destruction of one of our little Barks, which we lost in our way to the Island of <hi>Cayboa.</hi> They stood away, as it appeared by their information, for the <hi>Goat-key,</hi> thinking to find us there, as having heard Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sawkins</hi> say, that he would go thither. On their way they hapned to fall in with the Island of <hi>Gallo,</hi> and understanding its weakness by their <hi>Indian</hi> Pilot, they ventured on shoar, and took the place, carrying away three white women in their company. But after a small time of Cruising, they returned again to the aforesaid Island, where they stayed the space of two or three days: after which time they went out to sea again. Within three or four days they came to a little Key four Leagues distant from this Isle. But mean while they had been out and in thus several times, one of their prisoners made his escape unto the Main, and brought off from thence fifty men with fire-arms. These placing themselves in Ambuscade, at the first volly of their shot, they killed six of the seven men that belonged unto the Bark. The other man that was left took quarter of the enemy; and he it was that discovered unto them our design upon the Town of <hi>Guay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aquil.</hi> By an observation which we made this day, we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59013:47"/>

To Leeward of <hi>Manta,</hi> a League from shoar, in eighteen fathom water, there runneth a great current outwards. About eleven in the forenoon we weighed Anchor, with a wind at W.N.

                     <hi>A strange story</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Were it not for a windward Current which runneth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shoar hereabouts, it were totally impossible for any ships to get about this Cape; there being such a great current to Leeward in the offing. In the last Bark which we took, of which we spoke in this Chapter, we made Prisoner one <hi>Nicolas Moreno,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Nation, and who was esteemed to be a very good Pilot of the South Sea. This man did not cease continually to praise our ship for her sailing, and especially for the alterations we had made in her. As we went along, we observed many Bays to lye between this Cape and Point <hi>Parina,</hi> of which we shall soon make mention hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the night the wind came about to S. S.E. and we had a very stiff gale of it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Point</hi> Parina.</note> So that by break of day the next morning, we found our selves to be about five Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to windward of the Cape afore mentioned. The Land hereabouts maketh three or four several Bays, and groweth lower and lower, by how much the nigher we come unto <hi>Punta Parina.</hi> This Point sheweth it self at first sight thereof like unto two Islands. Between four and five of the clock that evening, we were West from the said Point.</p>
               <p>The next day likewise, being the last day of <hi>August,</hi> the wind still continued S. S. E. as it had done the whole day before. This day we thought it convenient to stand far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out to sea, for fear of being descryed at <hi>Paita,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paita.</note> which

now was not very far distant fromus. The morning proved to be hasey. But about eleven we espied a Sail, which stood then just as we did, E. by S. Coming nearer unto it, by degrees we found her to be nothing else than a pair of Bark-logs under a sail, which were going that way. Our Pilot advised us not to meddle with those Logs, nor mind them in the least,<note place="margin">

                  </note> for it was very doubtful whether we should be able to come up with them or not; and then by giving chace unto them, we should easily be descryed and known to be the <hi>English Pirates,</hi> as they called us.

               <p>On <hi>Saturday, September</hi> the Fourth, about break of day, we saw the ship again, at the distance of a League, more or less, and not above a mile to windward of us. They stood out assoon as they espied us, and we stood directly after them. Having pursued them for several hours, about four of the clock in the Afternoon, we came up within the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

of half our small Arms shot, to windward of them. Hereupon they perceiving who we were, presently lower'd all their Sails at once, and we cast dice among our selves for the first entrance. The lot sell to larboard; so that twenty men belonging to that watch, entred her. In the Vessel were found Fifty packs of <hi>Cacao</hi>-nut, such as <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> is made of, many packs of <hi>Raw-silk, Indian cloth,</hi>

               <p>The next day being come, we transported on board our ship the chiefest part of her lading. In her hold we found some Rigging, as had been told us by <hi>Nicholas Moreno</hi> our Pilot, taken in the former Vessel off of <hi>Guayaquil:</hi> but the greatest part of the Hold was full of Timber. We took out of her also some Osenbriggs, of which we made Top-gallant sails, as shall be said hereafter. It was now nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, as they told us, since they set sail from <hi>Guyaquil</hi>; and then they had onely heard there of our Exploits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Panama,</hi> but did not so much as think of our coming so far to the Southward, which did not give them the least suspicion of us, though they had seen us for the space of two or three days before at Sea, and always steering after them; otherwise they had made for the land, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to escape our hands.</p>
               <p>The next morning likewise we continued to take in the remaining part of what goods we desired out of our Prize.<note place="margin">

We gave them a fore-sail to sail withal; all their own water, and some of our flour to serve them for Provisions; and thus we tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them away, as not caring to be troubled or encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with too many of their company.

and <hi>Don Baltazar,</hi> both Gentlemen of Quality taken with him; Captain <hi>Peralta,</hi> Captain <hi>Juan Moreno,</hi> the Pilot, and twelve slaves, of whom we intended to make good use, to do the drudgery of our ship. At this time I recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that we were about the distance of thirty five Leagues, little more or less from Land.

               <p>ON <hi>September</hi> the Ninth we continued still to make a S. W. by S. way, as we had done the day before.

               <p>On the 18th, we made a S. by W. way. We reckoned our selves to be in Lat. 19. D. 33. S. The weather was hasey; and the wind began to dye this day by degrees.</p>
               <p>The next day, being the 19th, we had very small wind. I reckoned thirteen leagues and an half, by a S. W. by S. way; and our whole Westing from <hi>Paita</hi> to be 164 leagues in Lat. 20. D. 06. S. All the afternoon we had a calm, with drizling rain.</p>

But being come nigh the place where we designed to land, they found, to our great sorrow and vexation, that we were descryed; and that all along the shoar, and through the Country, they had certain news of our arrival. Yet notwithstanding our discovery, we would have landed, if we could by any means have found a place to do it in. But the sea ran so high, and with such a force against the rocks, that our boats must needs have been staved each in one thousand pieces, and we in great danger of wetting our arms, if we should adventure to go on shoar. The Bay all round was possessed by several parties of horse; and likewise the tops of the hills, which seemed to be gathered there by a general alarm through the whole Country, and that they waited onely for our landing, with design to make a strong opposition against us. They fired a gun at us, but we made them no answer, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to our ship, giving over this enterprize until a fairer opportunity. The hill of <hi>Arica</hi> is very white, being occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the dung of multitudes of Fowls that nest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the hollow thereof.<note place="margin">

We asked our Pilot concerning these ships, and he told us that one of them was mounted with six guns, and the other with onely four.

                  </note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest; and ordered them to go up and search the valley adjoyning and belonging to the Town. We found the said valley to be very pleasant, being all over set with Fig-trees, Olive-trees, Orange, Lemmon, and Lime-trees, with many other fruits agreeable to the Palat. About four miles up within the valley, we came to a great Sugar-work, or <hi>Ingenio de azucar,</hi> as it is called by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where we found great store of Sugar, Oyl, and <hi>Molossus.</hi> But most of the Sugar, the owners had hidden from us in the cane it self. As we marched up the vally, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched along the hills, and observed our motion. From the tops of the hills they often tumbled down great stones up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, but with great care we endeavoured to escape those dangers, and but the report of one Gun would suddainly cause them all to hide their heads. From this house, I mean the Sugar-work above-mentioned, Mr. <hi>Cox,</hi> my self, and one <hi>Cannis</hi> a Dutchman (who was then our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) went unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with a flag of Truce. They met us very civilly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They agree with the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</note> and promised to give us fourscore Beeves for the Ransom of the Sugar-work, and upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that it should not be spoilt nor demolished. With them we agreed, that they should be delivered unto us at the Port, the next day at noon. Hereupon Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> in the evening sent down unto the Port twenty men, with strict orders that our forces there should offer no violence in the least unto those that brought down the Beeves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59013:57"/>Sunday, <hi>October</hi> the 31st. This day being employed in casting up some accounts belonging to our Navigation, I reckoned that <hi>Hilo</hi> was to the Eastward of <hi>Paita,</hi> one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty and seven leagues. This morning the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came unto our Commander Captain <hi>Sharp,</hi> with a flag of Truce; and told him, that sixteen Beeves were already sent down unto the Port, and that the rest should certainly be there the next morning. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we were ordered to prepare our selves to retreat, and march back unto the Port, and there embark our selves on board our ship. My advice was to the contrary, that we should rather leave twenty men behind to keep the house of the Sugar-work, and that others should possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Hills, thereby to clear them of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their <hi>look out.</hi> But my counsel not being regarded, each man took away what burthen of Sugar he pleased, and thus we returned unto our vessel.<note place="margin">

               <p>The next morning being <hi>November</hi> the first, our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain went unto the top of the Hills afore-mentioned, and spoke with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves,<note place="margin">

                  </note> concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their agreement. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the Cattle would certainly come down this night. But in case it did not, that the Master or Owner of the Sugar-work was now returned from <hi>Potosi,</hi> and we might go up and treat with him, and make, if we pleased, a new bargain for the preservation of his House and Goods; whose interest it was, more than theirs, to save it from being demolished. With this answer our men returned unto us, and we concluded to expect until the next day for the delivery of the Beeves.</p>
               <p>On the following day about eight in the morning, there came in unto us a Flag of Truce from the enemy, telling us,<note place="margin">

Noon being come, and no Cattle appearing, we now having filled our water, and finished other concerns, resolved to be revenged on the Enemy, and do them what mischief we could; at least, by setting fire on the Sugar-work. Hereupon, threescore men of us marched up the valley,<note place="margin">

Upon the shoar we could not discover this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, above fifty men of our Enemies Forces, which caused us to suspect the rest were run away from their Colours, and had deserted in the dark of the night. If this were so, we were equally afraid of each other, and as we quitted the Land, being jealous of their multitudes, so they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned their stations for fear of our Encounters. All the while we lay in the Port of <hi>Hilo,</hi> we had a fresh wind but now being come out from thence, we found it was almost stark calme. Hereabouts runneth a great Sea all along this Coast, as we experimented at <hi>Arica</hi>; insomuch, that there is no landing except under the favour of some Rock or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the fourth in the morning, we saw the Port of <hi>Hilo</hi> at E.N.E. at the distance of nine Leagues,<note place="margin">

               <p>The next day unto this, we had an indifferent fresh wind at S.S.E. We reckoned a S. W. half west way, and by it, that we had made twenty Leagues. The day was very fair and sun-shiny, and the sea very smooth</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 6th, we had a clear night the last past, and the day proved very fair and clear, like unto the former. We reckoned by a S. W. by W. way, about twenty one leagues. In the afternoon it was almost stark calme.</p>

                  </note> In the afternoon of this day, I was sent down unto the Bay of <hi>Coquimbo,</hi> with a party of twenty men, to carry thither both goods taken in the Town, and provisions for the ship. It is two leagues and a half from the Town unto the Port; one league on the Bay, the rest being a very great road, which leadeth from the Bay unto the City. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> promised that the Ransom should be collected and paid in by the next day. This day also there dyed one of our <hi>Negro</hi> slaves on board the ship.</p>
               <p>The following day in the morning, I returned back unto the Town, with the men I had brought down the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Onely six of them I left behind, to look after our Canoa's at the end of the Bay. When I came up into the City,<note place="margin">

Thus we departed from <hi>la Serena,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with us what plunder we could find, having sent two parties before loaded with goods unto the ship, as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above.

When we came to the Sea-side, being half way unto our ship, we received advice that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had endeavoured, by an unusual stratagem,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A stratagem discovered.</hi>
                  </note> to burn our ship, and by these means destroy us all. They acted thus: They up blew a horses hide like unto a bladder, and upon this float a man ventured to swim from shoar, and come under the stern of our ship. Being arrived there, he crammed Okeham and Brimstone, and other combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, between the Rudder and the Stern-post. Having done this, he fired it with a match, so that in a small time our Rudder was on fire, and all the ship in a smoak. Our men both alarmed and amazed with this smoak, ran up and down the ship, suspecting the prisoners to have fired the vessel, thereby to get their liberty and seek our destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At last they found it out where the fire was, and had the good fortune to quench it, before its going too far. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon as they had put it out, they sent the boat ashoar, and found both the hide afore-mentioned, and the match bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at both ends, whereby they came acquainted with the whole matter. When we came unto the Store-house on the shoar-side, we set at liberty the Fryar our prisoner, and another Gentleman who was become our Hostage for the performance of the Ransom.

that the weather was very hot. We had still but little wind.</p>
               <p>The next day, <hi>December</hi> the 12th, we had very fair weather, and by a clear observation made this day, we found Lat. 30 D. 06 S.</p>

                  <hi>December</hi> the 13th. By a W. S. W. way, we made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two leagues. By observation we found Lat. 30 D. 45 S. D. M. four leagues and two thirds.</p>
               <p>On the 14th in the morning, we had a handsom shower of rain, which continued for some while. Then, about eight of the clock, there sprang up a S. S. W. breeze. My reckoning was by an E. S. E. way, fourteen leagues. And by observation, we found this day 30 D. 30 S.<note place="margin">

               <p>The following day, we had an indifferent fresh wind on both tacks. Our way was W. S. W. and by it we reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thirty four leagues.

               <p>But on the next ensuing day, we had no small breez, but rather hard gusts of wind. These grew so high, that they forced us to take in our top-sails. We made a S. W. half S. way, and forty five leagues.</p>
               <p>On the 17th we had likewise high winds, and withal a S. W. sea. Our way W. by S. By observation taken this day, we found Lat. 30 D. 51 S. In the afternoon we had a S. S. E. wind, our course being S. W.</p>

                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59013:67"/>The 19th we had both cloudy and windy weather. My reckoning was a S. W. by S. way, and here upon fifty eight miles. Yesterday we were assured by our Pilot, that we were now in the Meridian of the Island of <hi>Juan Fernandez,</hi> whither our course was directed for that present. What occasioned him to be so positive in his assertion, was the seeing of those great birds,<note place="margin">

               <p>On the 20th, we had cloudy weather in the morning on both tacks. We made a S. W. and half S. way, and by it fifty two leagues. By observation we found this day Lat. 32 D. 20 S. Difference of Meridian was now one hundred and twenty three leagues.</p>
               <p>The next day likewise we had cloudy weather; yet by observation we found a W. way. On the 22d by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation we found and E. way proved.</p>

Having told my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation unto our Pilot, he gave me for answer, that he had made many Voyages by this Island, and yet never saw any either fowl or fish more than I. Our reckoning this day was an E. S. E. way, and hereby thirty six leagues. Our latitude by observation was found to be 33 D. 30 S.</p>
               <p>Saturday, <hi>December</hi> the 25th. Yesterday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, at three of the clock, we saw the other Island, making two or three hammocks of land. This morning we were about eight leagues distant from it, the Island bearing E. S. E. from us. At eight the same morning, we were right at breast with it. Here therefore are two Islands together, the biggest whereof is three leagues and an half in length,<note place="margin">

                  </note> nearest N. W. and S.E. the other, and lesser, is almost one league, and no more in circumference. At ten of the clock we sent off from the ship one of our Canoa's, to seek for the best landing and anchoring for our Vessel. As we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, both Islands seemed unto us nothing but one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire heap of rocks.

By a clear obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the middle of the Island, I found here Lat. 33 D. 45 S. and M. D. to be ninty nine leagues. In the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of this day, we came to an anchor at the South end of the Island, in a stately Bay that we found there, but which lyeth open from the South, to the South-East winds. We anchored in the depth of eleven fathom water, and at the distance of onely one furlong from the shoar. Here we saw multitudes of Seals covering the Bay every where, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that we were forced to kill them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Many Seals.</hi>

               <p>Sunday, <hi>December</hi> the 26th. This day we sent a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa to see if we could find any riding secure from the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly winds; these being the most constant winds that blow on these Coasts. The Canoa being gone, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander sent likewise what men we could spare on shoar, to drive Goats,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They kill Goats.</hi>
                  </note> whereof there is great plenty in this Island. They caught and killed that day to the number of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score, or thereabouts. The Canoa returning unto the ship, made report that there was good riding in another Bay, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the North side of the Island, in fourteen fathom water, and not above one quarter of a mile from the shoar. Moreover that there was much wood to be had, whereas in the place where we had first anchored, not one stick of wood nor tuft of grass was to be found.</p>
               <p>The next day, being the 27th, between two and four of the clock in the morning,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A great storm.</hi>
                  </note> we had a tempest of violent winds and fierce showers of rain. The same day we got in two hundred jars of water, bringing them the full distance of a league from the place of our riding.<note place="margin">

                  </note> In the mean while, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were employed to catch Goats, as they had done the day before.</p>
               <p>On the 28th of the said month, in the morning I went with ten more of our company, and two Canoas, to fetch water from the land. Being come thither, and having fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

our jars, we could not get back unto the ship, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Southerly wind that blew from off the Ocean,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Author in great danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </note> and hindred our return. Thus we were forced to lie still in a water-hole, and wait till the wind were over for a safer opportunity. Mean while, the violence of the wind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, our ship was forced to get under sail, and make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, not without danger of being forced ashoar. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon she sailed out of the harbour, to seek another place of anchoring. At noon I ventured out, to try if I could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ship, but was forced in again by the wind and a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging sea. Thus we lay still for some while longer, till the evening came on. This being come, we ventured out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain both Canoa's together: but the winds were then so high, that we were forced to throw all our jarrs of water over-board to lighten our boats, otherwise we had inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perished. I ought to bless and praise God Almighty for this deliverance; for in all humane reason, the least wave of that tempest must have sunk us. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we came that night to our place or harbour, where we expected to have found our ship (called <hi>False wild har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>) but found her not. Hereupon not knowing what to do, we went ashoar, and halled up our Canoa's dry. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done this, we ascended higher within the Island, along a <hi>Gulley,</hi> for the space of half a mile, there to clear our selves of the noise and company of the Seals which were very troublesome on the shoar. Here we kindled a fire,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Multitudes of Zeales.</hi>
                  </note> and dryed our clothes, and rested our selves all night, though with extream hungry bellies, as having eaten very litte or nothing all the day before. In the sides of the hill, under which we lay, we observed many holes like Coney-holes. These holes are the nests and roosting-places of multitudes of birds that breed in this Island, called by the <hi>Spaniards, Pardelas.</hi> One of these birds, as we lay drying and warming our selves, fell down into our fire.<note place="margin">Pardelas.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning being come, very early before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, we went farther to the Northward, to seek for our ship which we feared we had lost. But we were not gone far,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59013:69"/>
when we soon espied her at sea. Hereupon we passed a point of land, and entered a certain Bay, which was about a mile deep, and not above half a league over. Into this Bay we put, and instantly made a fire, thereby to shew the ship whereabouts we were. Here we found good watering and wooding close unto the shoar. In this Bay also we saw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sort of amphibious Animal, the which I imagined to be the same, that by some Authors is called a <hi>Sea-Lyon.</hi> These Animals are six times bigger than Seals.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Their heads are like unto that of a Lyon, and they have four fins not unlike unto a Tortoise. The hinder parts of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are much like fins, but are drawn after them, as being useless upon the shoar. They roared as if they had been Lyons, and were full of a certain short and thick hair, which was of a Mouse colour; but that of the young ones was something lighter. The old ones of these Sea-Lyons are between twelve and fourteen foot long, and about eleven or twelve foot in thickness, or circumference. A Seal is very easily killed, as we often experimented, but two of our men with great stones could not kill one of these Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
               <p>That day in the afternoon there came a Canoa from on board the ship with Provision for us,<note place="margin">

                  </note> they fearing least we should be starved. In like manner the Lanch came with men to cut wood. They told us that the ship came to an Anchor in the other Bay, but that within half an hour the Cable broke, and they were forced to leave their Anchor behind them and get out to Sea again. Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, we made our beds of Fern, whereof there is huge plenty upon this Island; together with great multitudes of Trees like unto our English Box, the which bore a sort of green Berries, smelling like unto <hi>Pimiento,</hi> or Pepper. All this day the ship was forced to ply off at Sea, not being able to get in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the thirtieth. The morning of this day we employed in filling water, and cutting down wood. But in the afternoon, eight of us eleven, went aboard the ship,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59013:69"/>
all in one and the same Canoa, sending her ashoar again with Provisions for the men that were there. This day in like manner we could not get into the Harbour, for no sooner the ship came within the parts of Land, but the wind come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Bay, blew us clear out again. Thus we were forced to ply out all that night, and great part of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day.</p>
               <p>On the next day having overcome all difficulties,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and many dangers, we came to an Anchor in the afternoon, in fifteen fathom water, at the distance of a Cable length from shoar. Here it was observable, that we were forced to keep men ashoar on purpose to beat off the Seals, mean while our men filled water at the Sea side, at high-water mark, for as much as that the Seals covet hugely to lye in fresh water. About this Island fish is so plentiful, that in less then one hours time, two men caught enough for all our whole company.</p>

                  </note> this day the weather was very clear and setled again. We caught every day in this Bay, where we now were, great plenty of fish; and I saw the same day a shoal of fish a mile and more long.</p>
               <p>On the next day being the eleventh, we filled our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and carryed our wood on board the ship. Moreover,<note place="margin">

Being come on board, they told us, they had espied three sail of ships, which they conceived to be men of War coming about the Island. Within half an hour after this notice given by our Boats, the ships came in sight to Leeward of the Island. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we immediately slipt our Cables, and put to Sea, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all our men on board that were ashoar at that time.

               <p>Being got out of the Bay we stood off to Sea, and kept to windward as close as we could. The biggest of these Spanish men of War,<note place="margin">

The second named <hi>San Francisco,</hi> was of the port of six hundred Tuns, and had ten guns. The third was of the carriage of three hundred and fifty Tuns, whose name I have forgot. As soon as they saw us, they instantly put out their bloody flags, and we, to shew them that we were not as yet daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did the same with ours. We kept close under the wind, and were, to confess the truth, very unwilling to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59013:71"/>
fight them, by reason they kept all in a knot together, and we could not single out any one of them, or separate him from the rest. Especially considering, that our present Commander <hi>Watling</hi> had shewed himself at their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be faint hearted. As for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, they might have easily come unto us, by reason we lay by several times: but undoubtedly they were cowardly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and peradventure as unwilling to engage us, as we were to engage them.</p>
               <p>The following day being <hi>January</hi> the thirteenth, in the morning we could descry one of the fore-mentioned men of war, under the Leeward side of the Island; and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the rest were at Anchor thereabouts.

               <p>Saturday <hi>January</hi> the 15th, we had hasey weather. This day we made by a N. E. by N. way eleven Leagues. The same hasey weather continued in like manner the 16th. But about ten that morning the wind dyed away. Our reckoning was a N.E. by N. way, and thirty six Leagues.</p>

                  <hi>Watling</hi> our Commander, and twenty five men more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the ship in two Canoas, with design to seek for, and take the Island of <hi>Yqueque,</hi> and there to gain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the posture of affairs at <hi>Arica.</hi> We were at the distance of twelve leagues from shoar, when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the ship.</p>

At four in the afternoon this day, returned one of our Canoas, bringing word that they could not find the Island, though they had searched for it very diligently. At night came the other, being brought back by a wrong sign given us by the first Canoa. This second Canoa had landed upon the Continent, and there found a track, the which they followed for some little space. Here they met a dead Whale, with whose bones the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had built a Hut, and set up a Cross. There lay also many pieces of broken Jars. They observed likewise, that hereabouts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coast were many Bays, good landing, and anchoring for ships. That evening about seven of the clock, a fresh gang departed from the ship to seek for the same Island, mean while we lay becalmed all night, driving about a league to leeward.</p>

The Barque where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they used to bring it, was then gone for water, when our men landed upon the place.

for this piece of cruelty, whenever we come to fight at</hi> Arica. These words were found at the latter end of this expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Arica,</hi> to contain a true and certain prophesie, as shall be related hereafter.</p>
               <p>The other old man being under examination, informed us, that the Island of <hi>Yqueque</hi> afore-mentioned,<note place="margin">

                  </note> belonged unto the Governour of <hi>Arica,</hi> who was Proprietor thereof; and that he allowed unto these men a little wine, and other Necessaries, to live upon for their sustenance. That he himself had the superintendance of forty or fifty of the Governours slaves, who caught fish and dryed it, for the profit of the said Governour; and he sold it afterwards to the inland Towns, and reaped a considerable benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. That by a Letter received from <hi>Arica,</hi> eight days ago, they understood there was then in the Harbour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> three ships from <hi>Chile,</hi> and one Bark. That they had raised there a Fortification mounted with Twelve Copper Guns. But that when we were there before, they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed out of the Town unto the neighbouring stantions, all their Plate, Gold, and Jewels, burying it there in the ground, and concealing it after several manners and ways. The which whether it were now returned or not, he could not easily tell. That there were two great places, the one at ten, the other at twenty five leagues distance from <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> at which Towns lay all their strength and treasure. That the day before had passed a Post to declare our having been at <hi>Coquimbo.</hi> That the <hi>Embargo</hi> laid on all vessels going to the Northward, was now taken off; so that a free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage was allowed them. That by Land it was impossible to go from hence unto <hi>Arica</hi> in less than four or five days, for as much as they must carry water for themselves and Horses for the whole journey. At last, that those Arms that were brought from <hi>Lima</hi> unto <hi>Arica,</hi> as was mentioned above, were now carryed away from thence unto <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> All these things pleased us mighty well to hear them. But however, Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> was still much dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, by reason we had shot the old man. For he had

Besides the things above-mentioned, our prisoners inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, that at <hi>Arica</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had built a breast-work round about the Town; and one also in every street, that in case one end of the Town were taken, they might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend the other. We stood off and in for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of this day. In the afternoon we were eight leagues and an half distant from shoar, with a fresh wind.

Unto these men we left strict orders, that if we made one smoak from the Town, or adjoyning fields, they should come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us towards the harbour of <hi>Arica</hi> with one Canoa; but in case we made two, that they should bring all away, leaving only fifteen men in the Boats. As we marched from our landing place towards the Town, we mounted a very steep hill, and saw from thence no men, nor Forces of the enemy; which caused us to hope we were not as yet des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed, and that we should utterly surprize them. But when we were come about half of the way unto the Town, we espied three horsemen, who mounted the <hi>Look-out</hi> hill; and seeing us upon our march, they rid down full speed towards the City, to give notice of our approach. Our Commander <hi>Watling</hi> chose out forty of our number, to attaque the Fort, and sent us away first thitherwards, the rest being designed for the Town.<note place="margin">

But our rage encreasing with our wounds, we still advanced, and at last beat the enemy out of all, and filled every street in the City with dead bodies.

against us, and beating us from place to place, we were in a very distracted condition, and in more likelihood to perish every man, than escape the bloodiness of that day. Now we found the words of Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> to bear a true prophesie, being all very sensible, that we had had a day too hot for us, after that cruel heat in killing and murdering in cold blood, the old <hi>Mestizo Indian</hi> whom we had taken prisoner at <hi>Yqueque,</hi> as before was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Being surrounded with difficulties on all sides, and in great disorder,<note place="margin">Sharp <hi>is chosen anew.</hi>
                  </note> as having no head nor leader to give orders for what was to be done, we were glad to turn our eyes unto our good and old Commander Captain <hi>Bartholomew Sharp,</hi> and beg of him very earnestly to commiserate our condition, and carry us off. It was a great while that we were reiterating our supplications unto him, before he would take any notice of our request in this point. So much was he displeased with the former mutiny of our people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, all which had been occasioned by the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Mr. <hi>Cook.</hi> But <hi>Sharp</hi> is a man of an undaunted courage, and of an excellent conduct, not fearing in the least to look an insulting enemy in the face, and a person that knoweth both the Theory and practical parts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, as well as most do. Hereupon, at our request and earnest petition,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They retreat with great difficulty.</hi>
                  </note> he took upon him the command in chief again, and began to distribute his orders for our safety. He would have brought off our Surgeons, but that they had been drinking in the mean while that we assaulted the Fort, and thus would not come with us when they were called. They killed and took of our number twenty eight men, besides eighteen more that we brought off, who were desperately wounded. At this time we were all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream faint for want of water and victuals, whereof we had had none all that day. Moreover, we were almost choaked with the dust of the Town; this being so much raised by the work that their great Guns had made, that we could scarcely see each other. They beat us out of the Town, and then followed us into the <hi>Savanas,</hi> or open fields,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59013:77"/>
still charging us as fast as they could. But when they saw that we rallyed again, resolving to dye one by another, they then ran from us into the Town, and sheltred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under their breast-works. Thus we retreated in as good order as we could possibly observe in that confusion. But their Horsemen followed us as we retired, and fired at us all the way, though they would not come within reach of our Guns; for their own reached farther then ours, and out-shot us more than one third. We took the sea-side for our greater security; the which when the enemy saw, they betook themselves unto the Hills, rowling down great stones, and whole Rocks to destroy us. In the mean while those of the Town examined our Surgeons, and other men whom they had made prisoners. These gave them our signs that we had left unto our Boats that were behind us, so that they immediately blew up two smoaks, which were perceived by the Canoas. This was the greatest of our dangers. For had we not come at that instant that we did, unto the sea-side, our Boats had been gone, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already under sail, and we had inevitably perished eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man. Thus we put off from the shoar, and got on board about ten of the clock at night, having been invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a continual and bloody fight with the enemy all that day long.</p>

Nothing now could appease them, nor serve their turn, but a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the rest of the company, and a departure from us.

In the morning we went in a Canoa, being several in company, to seek for a place to lay our ship in. Amongst the Islands along the shoar, we found many brave holes, but little or no water in them, which caused us to dislike what we had found. On one of the said Islands we hapned to find a hat, and many empty jarrs of water, which shewed us that some people had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there.

               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 2d. This morning we saw land, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like several Keys to us at N. W. by N. and at seven leagues distance. It was the land of <hi>Puerto de Velas,</hi> and appeared thus.</p>

                  </note>This evening our Captain called us together, and asked our opinions concerning the course we ought to steer. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving discussed the points by him proposed amongst us, we all resolved to bear up for <hi>Golfo Dulce,</hi> and there to careen our Vessels.

               <p>Friday, <hi>June</hi> the 3d. The night before this day was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair, and we had a fresh wind, our course being S. E. This morning we saw no land. In the evening the wind came about at S. S. W. and S. W. by S.</p>

               <p>Sunday, <hi>June</hi> the 5th. Last night we lay by for all, or the greatest part thereof. This morning we saw the Island of <hi>Cano</hi> above described, which bore E. S.

               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 6th. All the night past we had rain, and with it but little wind. Yea, scarce enough to carry us clear off from the Island afore-mentioned. Towards morning we had a fresh wind at N. N. W. So then we stood out S. until morning, and this being come, we stood N. E. by E. The land runneth from <hi>Punta Mala</hi> to <hi>Golfo Dulce,</hi> and <hi>Punta Borrica,</hi> E. S. E. half S.

               <p>The West-end of <hi>Golfo Dulce</hi> is very high land, and a high rock lye close off it.

               <p>The next day, being <hi>June</hi> the 7th, we weighed anchor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

at young flood, and got about two leagues higher. At evening we came again to an anchor in the depth of seven fathom and a half water. It rained this day until eight of the clock,<note place="margin">

               <p>Wednesday, <hi>June</hi> the 8th, at day break we weighed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor again, with a fresh Sea-breeze. The higher up we went, the deeper we found the Gulf, and at last no ground even with thirty fathom of line. This day we sent our Canoa away to seek water and a good place to lay our ship in. Having landed, they found one <hi>Indian</hi> and two boys, all which they made prisoners and brought aboard.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They take three prisoners.</hi>
                  </note> Here we used them very kindly, giving them victuals and cloaths, for they had no other than the bark of a tree to cover their nakedness withal. Being examined, they informed us that a Spanish Priest had been amongst them, and had made Peace with their Nation, ordering them strictly not to come near any ship nor vessel that had red Colours; forasmuch as that they were English-men, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly kill them. Being asked where now the Priest was? they answered he was gone to a great Spanish Town, which was distant from thence four sleeps up in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. After this, the <hi>Indian</hi> left the two boys which were his children, with us, and went to fetch more <hi>Indians</hi> unto us, from a Plantane-walk or grove, situate by a river a league off, or thereabouts. We came to an anchor in a Bay close by one of the <hi>Indian</hi> Keys, where two fresh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were within a stones throw of each other, in twenty seven fathom and a half water, and at a cables length from the mark of low water. The <hi>Indians</hi> whom our prisoner went to seek, came to us several times, selling unto us Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Plantanes, and other necessaries that we usually bought of them, or truckt for with other things. We also made use of their bark-logs in tallowing our ship, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern they did us good service. Their Darts are headed with iron as sharp as any razor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59013:88"/>Here one of the prisoners which we took at the Gulf of <hi>Nicoya,</hi> informed us, by what means,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A peace forced upon the</hi> Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>of</hi> Darien.</note> or rather stratagem of War the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had forced a peace upon the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Province of <hi>Darien,</hi> since our departure from thence. The manner was as followeth. A certain Frenchman who ran from us at the Island of <hi>Taboga</hi> unto the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was sent by them in a ship to the Rivers mouth, which disem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogueth from that Province into the South-Sea. Being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, he went ashoar by himself in a Canoa, and told the <hi>Indians,</hi> that the English who had passed that way, were come back from their adventures in the South-Sea. Withal, he asked them, if they would not be so kind and friendly unto the English men, as to come aboard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them on shoar? The poor deceived <hi>Indians</hi> were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry joyful to understand this good news; and thus forty of the chiefest men amongst them went on board the Spanish vessel, and were immediately carryed prisoners at War to <hi>Panama.</hi> Here they were forced to conclude a peace, though upon terms very disadvantageous unto them, before they could obtain their liberty.</p>
               <p>These poor and miserable <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Golfo dulce,</hi> would come every day into our company,<note place="margin">

Mean while we were careening our ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, we built a house upon the shoar, both to lodge and eat in; and every day we caught plenty of good fish.

On <hi>June</hi> the 21. we weighed anchor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and went a league higher than the former place. Here we watered, and in the mean while left men below to cut wood.</p>

                  <hi>July</hi> the second, we made a S. East way, and our recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was 64 by it. By observation I found Lat. 5 <hi>d.</hi> 20. North. At noon the same day we had a fresh gale at S.W. with some rain.</p>

                  <hi>July</hi> the fifth we had a clear night the last past, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, a fresh gale. By this we made a S.E. way. Our Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude this day gave us 2 <hi>d.</hi> 20. North. This morning we saw Land Southward of us lying in low hammocks.

               <p>Wednesday <hi>July</hi> the 6th, we turned up along shoar, and by observation took this day, Lat. 2 <hi>d.</hi> 02 N. Hereabouts every new Moon is experimented a windward current. In the evening of this day we were close in with low land. We had windy weather and a great Sea.</p>

               <p>This day at noon we had a clear observation, which gave us Lat. 01 <hi>d</hi> 22 North.</p>
               <p>Sunday <hi>July</hi> the tenth, last night past we stood off to Sea, thereby to keep clear of the shoar. This days obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation shewed us Lat. 01 <hi>d.</hi> 31. North. About noon the same day we hapned to espy a Sail,<note place="margin">

We bore up one point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, thereby to hinder her lasking away; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the evening lost sight of her again. However, our great ship got up with her, and about eight of the clock at night made her a Prize.

Thus this same bottom became doubly fortunate unto us, being twice taken by us in the space of fourteen Months. For she had on board her now twenty one thousand pieces of Eight, in eight Chests, and in bags sixteen thousand more, besides Plate.</p>
               <p>Munday and Tuesday the 11th and 12th of the said Month we made in for the shoar.

who had made a great fire on shoar, which as we judged, was designedly done to give intelligence of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival.

This vessel looked mighty big; so that we thought she had been one of their chiefest men of war, who was sent to surprize or destroy us. Notwithstanding, our brave Commander Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> resolved to fight her, and either to take the said vessel, though never so big, or that she should take us. Unto this effect, coming nearer unto her, we easily perceived she was a Merchant ship of great bulk, as most of your Spanish Vessels are, and withal, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deeply laden. Being up with them, those within her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red three or four Guns at us first, thinking to make their party good against us. But we answered them briskly, with a continual volley of small Arms, so that they soon ran down into the Hold,<note place="margin">

their Captain, and one Seaman, and also wounded their Boat-swain; which loss of their Commander daunted them so suddenly, he being a man of good repute in those Seas. Captain <hi>Sharp,</hi> with twelve more of our Company, entered her the first. In this Vessel I saw the beautifullest woman that I ever did see in all the South Sea. The name of the Captain of this Vessel was <hi>Don Diego Lopez,</hi> and the ship was called <hi>el Santo Rosario,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Rosary.</hi> The men we found on board her, were about the number of forty, more or less.</p>
               <p>Having examined our prisoners, they informed us, that the day before they set sail from <hi>el Callao</hi> (from which Port they were going towards <hi>Panama</hi>) our men whom they had taken prisoners at <hi>Arica,</hi> were brought in to that place.<note place="margin">

Thus, leaving onely the fore-mast standing in the said vessel, we turned her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as we had done the others before, together with all the prisoners in her, giving them their liberty not to be encumbred with them; and withal, being desirous to spare our provisions as much as we could. We detained onely one man, named <hi>Francisco,</hi> who was a <hi>Biscainer,</hi> by reason he reported himself to be the best Pilot of those Seas.

These supplys consisted chiefly of three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Horse and Foot, all of them being armed with fire-arms. Besides this, they had made for the defence of the Town, a breast-work along the sea-side, and the great Church which lyeth at the outermost part of the Town. From these places, as also from a hill that covereth the Town, they fired at our men, who were innocently rowing towards shoar with their Canoas. This preposterous fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring was the preservation of our people.

land, or do any thing else in relation to the taking of the place. We judged there could not be less then one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty fire-arms, and four times as many Lances upon the shoar, all in a readiness to hinder our people from landing. Within the Town our Pilot told us, there might be to the number of one hundred and fifty Families, more or less.</p>

               <p>The next day, <hi>August</hi> the 30th, we had misty weather. We made a W.S. W. way, and by it five leagues and one third. In the afternoon of this day, the wind freshned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, having been but little before, and we stood E.S.E.</p>
               <p>The last day of <hi>August</hi> we had very fair weather. I believed now that the wind was setled at S. E. and S. S. E. We made a S. S. W. way, and twenty one leagues and two thirds.</p>

               <p>Sunday <hi>September</hi> the 18th, in the night last past a wind sprang up at S.S.E. which the morning of this day freshned at S. E. We made a W. S. W. way, and by it eighteen leagues. Moreover, this day we had a clear observation that shewed us Lat. 21 <hi>d.</hi> 30 S.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the fourth, we had a clear night and a very fresh wind. We reckoned a S. E. by S. way, and thereby forty three leagues. An observation taken shewed us, that we were in Lat. 41 <hi>d.</hi> 34 South. This day also fell several showers of rain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the fifth, we had a windy night the last past, and a clear day. We reckoned a S.S.E. half E. way, and forty four leagues and two thirds. By an observation made, we found Lat. 43 <hi>d.</hi> 26 South. The weather now was very windy, causing a huge tempestuous sea. The wind at N.W. and N.W. by N. blowing very high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the sixth, this day the wind was still at N.W. and yet not so fresh as it was yesterday, the weather very foggy and misty. As for the wind it came in gusts, so that we were forced to hand our top-sails, and sprit-sail. We reckoned a S. E. half S. way, and thereby forty three leagues and one third of a league. The Seas now were not so high, as for some days past. In the evening we scudded away under our fore course.</p>
               <p>Friday, <hi>October</hi> the 7th. Last night was very cloudy,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59013:100"/>
and this day both dark and foggy weather with small rain. We made a S. E. way, and thirty leagues and two thirds. A fresh wind at N. N. W. and N. W. We keep still under a fore course, not so much for the freshness of the wind, as the closeness of the weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the 8th, we had a clear night the night before this day, and withal a strong gale;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A great storm.</hi>
                  </note> insomuch that this day we were forced to take in our fore-sail, and loosen our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, which was soon blown to pieces. Our eldest Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men said that they were never in the like storm of wind before. The Sea was all in a foam. In the evening it dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a little. We made a S. E. half E. way, and eighteen leagues, with very dark weather.</p>
               <p>Sunday, <hi>October</hi> the 9th. All the night past we had a furious W. N. W. wind. We set our sail a drough,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They drive at a great rate.</hi>
                  </note> and so drove to the Southward very much, and almost incredibly, if an observation had not hapned, which gave us Lat. 48 15 S. We had a very stiff gale at W. N. W. with a great Sea from W. which met with a S. S. W. Sea as great as it. Now the weather was very cold, and we had one or two frosty mornings. Yesterday in the afternoon we had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great storm of hail. At noon we bent another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen.</p>
               <p>Monday, <hi>Octob.</hi> the 10th. This day brought us a freshwind at N. W. and N. N. W, We made a S. E. half E. way, and by it forty four leagues. By observation we found Lat. 49 D. 41 S. I reckoned my self now to be East from <hi>Paita</hi> sixty nine leagues and an half.</p>
               <p>Tuesday, <hi>October</hi> the 11th. Last night we had a small time calm. This day was both cloudy and rainy weather. The wind at S. W. and S. S. W. so furious, that at ten of the clock this morning we scudded under a main sail. At noon we lower'd our fore-yard while we sailed. We made a S. E. by E. way, and thirty leagues.</p>

               <p>WEdnesday, <hi>October</hi> the 12th. All the night before this day we had many high winds. I reckoned an E. S. E. way, and twenty leagues; for our vessel drove at a great rate. Moreover, that we were in Lat. 50 D. 50 S. So that our Easting from <hi>Paita</hi> by my account ought to be one hundred and one leagues, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>This morning about two hours before day, we hapned by great accident to espie land.<note place="margin">

                  </note> It was the great mercy of God, which had always attended us in this Voyage, that saved us from perishing at this time; for we were close a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoar before we saw it; and our fore-yard, which we most needed in this occasion, was taken down. The land we had seen was very high and towering; and here appeared to be many Islands scattered up and down. We steered in with what caution we could, between them and the Main, and at last, God be praised, arrived at a place or rather Bay, where we perceived our selves to be land-lockt, and as we thought pretty safe from the danger of those tempestuous Seas. From hence we sent away our Canoa to sound and search the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> named <hi>Henry Shergall,</hi> as he was going into our sprit-sail top, hapned to fall into the water, and was
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59013:101"/>
drowned before any help could be had unto him, though we endeavoured it as much as we possibly could. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident several of our company did interpret as a bad <hi>Omen</hi> of the place; which proved not so, through the providence of the Almighty, though many dangers were not wanting here unto us, as I shall relate.</p>
               <p>We came to an anchor in the depth of forty fathom Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more or less,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They came to an anchor.</hi>
                  </note> and yet at no greater distance than a stones cast from shoar. The water where we anchored was very smooth, and the high lands round about all covered with snow. Having considered the time of the year, and all other circumstances, we resolved, that in case we could find a sufficient stock of provisions here,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They resolve to stay here.</hi>
                  </note> we would stay the longer, that is, until Summer came, or something more, before we prosecuted our intended Voyage homewards through the Straights of <hi>Magallanes</hi>; which now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be careful how to find. That day of our ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this Bay, we shot six or eight brave Geese,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They kill Geese and Fowls.</hi>
                  </note> and some smaller fowl besides. Here we found also many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Mussel-banks; all which were very plentifully stockt with that kind of fish. We buryed our dead man on the shoar, giving him several Volleys for his Funeral-Rites, according to the custom. In the night of this day our anchor came home, so that we were forced to let go a grapling to secure our selves. But still every flaw of wind drove us. Hereupon we set our sprit-sail,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They are in danger.</hi>
                  </note> and ran about a mile into another Bay, where we let go another anchor, and thus anchored again. The first anchor, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the biggest in our ship, we lost by this accident, the cable being cut by the rocks. Unto these Islands afore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Captain gave the name of <hi>His Royal Highness the Duke of</hi> Yorks <hi>Islands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thursday, <hi>October</hi> the 13th. This day we began to moor our ship,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They moor their vessel.</hi>
                  </note> she driving as we easily could perceive with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flaw of wind that blew. The tide sloweth here full seven foot up and down. We moored our Vessell into a rockey point, being a key whereof there be many in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59013:102"/>
circumference of this Bay. The ground of the bottom of the said Bay we found was hard and sandy, being here and there rockey. This evening we brought on board great store of Lamperts, of which we made a kettle of broath, that contained more than all our company could eat.</p>
               <p>On Friday <hi>October</hi> the 14th, we killed several Geese. As also many of another sort of Fowl like unto an Eagle, but having a bigger beak,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A strange sea-fowl.</hi>
                  </note> with their nostrils rising from the top of the middle of their beak by a hand trunk. This Fowl liveth on Fish, but we saw none. Yesterday in the evening there fell a great fleet of snow on the hills, round about the Bay, but none where we were at anchor. Moreover, this day in the evening we caught Lamperts in great quantity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Multitudes of Lamperts and Mussels.</hi>
                  </note> being three times as many as we could eat. Our men in ranging the Keys for Game, found grass plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above a fathom long, and a knot tyed at the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In like manner on other Keys they found Mussels and Lampert shells. From these things we presently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">

                  </note> with large hail-stones. About midnight the wind came to North with such great fury, that the Tree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which our Cable was fastned on shoar, gave way, and came up by the Roots. All those gusts of wind were mixt with violent storms of rain and hail. Thus we fastned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto other trees.

                  <hi>October</hi> the 18th. In the night past we had much rain and hail. But the day was very clear. Hereupon we made an observation, which gave us Lat. 50 D. 40 S. Moreover, this day we had pretty warm weather.</p>

But the third, who was a lusty boy about eighteen years of age, was taken, and him they brought on board the ship. He was covered onely with a Seals skin, having no other cloathing about him: His eyes were squinted, and his hair was cut pretty short. In the middle of the <hi>Doree</hi> they had a fire burning either for dressing of victuals, or some other use. The <hi>Doree</hi> it self was built sharp at both ends, and flat bottom'd. They had a net to catch <hi>Penguins,</hi> and a club like unto our bandies, called by them a <hi>Tomahunks.</hi> His Language we could not understand, but withal he pointed up the Lagoon, giving us to understand, that there were more people thereabouts. This was confirmed by our men, who also said they had seen more. They had Darts to throw against an Eenemy pointed with wood.</p>

                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59013:103"/>On the next day, being <hi>October</hi> the 28th, in the evening our Canoa went from the ship again to seek for more <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> They went into several <hi>Lagoons,</hi>

               <p>On the 29th we had in like manner a very fair day, and also a smooth wind at S. S. E. Our <hi>Indian</hi> this day poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us, that there were men in this Country, or not far off from hence, with great beards.

                  <hi>November</hi> the first, this day was also fair, and we had a small wind as before, at N.N.E.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the second, last night I took the Polar distance of the South star of the Cocks foot, and found it to be 28 <hi>d.</hi> 25. I observed also the two <hi>Magallan</hi> Clouds, of which I made mention in this Journal before, and found them to be as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the lesser 14 <hi>d.</hi> 05. and the greater 14 <hi>d.</hi> 25. The morning of this day we hoysted an end our top-masts, and also brought too a Main-top-sail, and Fore-sail, and finished our filling all the water we needed. At the same time the wind hung Easterly, and I was still much tormented with the Gripes as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the third, this morning we hanged our Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">

                  </note> the greatest piece of work we had to do, after those violent storms above-mentioned. In the afternoon we halled in our two biggest Harsers; and also our biggest Cable from the shoar. For the three days last past we had a very great and dark fog between us and the Eastward shoar. We had now very little wind in the Cove where we were, but abroad at sea there blew at the same time a stiff gale at S.S.E. Moreover, we could perceive now, the stormy weather being blown over, much small fry of fish about the ship, whereof we could see none, as was mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before. This day we had a very clear and calme eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                  </note> And this morning a small breeze sprang up at N. and N.N.E. which afterwards wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about unto S. and S.S.E. This morning we hoisted our Main and Fore-yards; and likewise fetcht off from the shoar our other harser and Cable, into the depth of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fathom water. Our resolutions were now changed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59013:104"/>
for a departure, in order to seek the mouth of the <hi>Straights</hi> of <hi>Magallanes,</hi> seeing that we could not winter here, for want of Provisions, which we could not find either on the Continent, or about these Islands afore-mentioned. The weather now was very warm, or rather hot, and the Birds did sing as sweetly as those in <hi>England.</hi> We saw here both Thrushes and Black birds, and many other sorts of those that are usually seen in our own Country.</p>
               <p>Saturday <hi>November</hi> the fifth, this morning brought us a wind at N.N.E. hereupon, we warped unto a rocky point,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They sail away</hi>
                  </note> thereby to get out of the Cove where we lay. For our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor came home unto us as we were carrying our Warp out. At this time a second breeze came up very fresh in our stern; so that we took the opportunity thereof, and went away before it. By noon this day we hoisted in our Canoas, and also turned away loose unto the sea our <hi>Indian Doree.</hi> As for the <hi>Indian</hi> boy whom we had taken in said <hi>Doree,</hi> we kept him still prisoner, and called him <hi>Orson.</hi> Our Cove at our departure from this place, looked thus, as I took then the description thereof. When we were come out into the Channel, the weather grew stark calme. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now and then we had a small breeze, sometimes from one quarter, and then from another. By this slackness of wind we observed, that the Current hoisted us to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. On the East-side of this Lagoon, we perceived the <hi>Indians</hi> to make a great smoak at our departure.</p>

               <p>SUnday <hi>November</hi> the sixth, this morning we had lost the sight of land, so that we could see it no more. All the night last past, and this day, we were under our two Courses and Sprit-sail. The weather this day was hasey. My reckoning was a S.W. half South way, and by it twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one Leagues. We had now an indifferent high Sea, and a fresh wind at N.N.W.</p>

                  </note> last night was both rainy and fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gey, but in the morning it cleared up. The wind for the most part was at W. and W. N. W. But at noon it came about at W. S. W. Our reckoning was a S. W. by S. way, and by it twenty Leagues. We found by observation Lat. 52 <hi>d.</hi> 03. We now steered away S.S.E. the wind being at that time at W.S.W. In the evening of this day I found a variation of the Needle to N.E. to the number of 15 <hi>d.</hi> or better. I was still troubled with the Gripes as I had been before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the eighth, we had a fair night the last past. About midnight the wind came to N.N.W. This day ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the break of day, we all were perswaded that we had seen Land, but at noon we saw that it was none, but only a Cloud. The wind was now at North. My reckoning was a S.E. half East way, and thirty two leagues and one third of a league. We had an observation that gave us 53 <hi>d.</hi> 27 South. The whole day was very fine and warm, and we saw great numbers of Fowles and Seales.</p>

was cloudy. Hereupon we lay by under a main-course. After midnight we sailed East, and E. by N. with a fresh wind at W. N. W. and not any great Sea. The day it self was cloudy, and toward noon we had some rain. So at two in the afternoon we lay by under a Main course, the wind being fresh at N. W. I reckoned an E. N.

Hereupon we were forced to lower the yard, and unbend the sail, lying for a little while under a Mizen. But that also soon gave way. So that all the rest of this day we lay a hull in very dark weather, foggy and windy, with a huge sea, which often times rowled over us. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon it seemed to abate for some space of time; but soon after it blew worse than before, which compelled us to lower our Fore-yard.</p>

               <p>Sunday <hi>November</hi> the 13th, all the night past we had a fresh wind between S.W. and W.N.W. with sometimes mists of small rain. In the evening we enjoyed a fine leading gale at W. N. W. together with both clear and wholesome weather. We made a S.E. way, and by it forty two leagues and two thirds. This day an observation gave us Lat. 56 <hi>d.</hi> 55 South. We still experimented a great S. W. current.

new sprit-sail, and about three this morning we also set our main-sail. At one after-noon, the wind came about N. E. and N. N. E. which in the evening blew very fresh, with cloudy weather.</p>

                  <hi>November</hi> the 29th. The night proved very cloudy, and the wind blew very fresh at E. N. E. and N. E. by E. This morning it was at East, both with snow, and hail. Towards noon the weather cleared up, and we found by an observation taken, Lat. 49 D 45 S. Our reckoning was a North way, and thirty leagues. This day we had a short Eastern sea, and withal, a very cold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening. I took the Sun, and hereby I found variation 26 D. 30. unto the North East. This night the wind came about W. and W. N. W. continuing so all the night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 30th. This day the wind was N. and N. N. E. with some clouds hovering in the sky. At this time we had already almost four hours of night.<note place="margin">

               <p>Tuesday <hi>December</hi> the first. The latter part of the night past was very cloudy, and also sometimes rainy. About midnight we had a furious and violent <hi>Tornado,</hi>

forcing us in a moment to hand in our top-sails. At five in the morning we set them again, and at eleven, we had another <hi>Tornado,</hi> forcing us to hand our top-sails the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time. We made a N. N.

In the evening the wind freshned, with cloudy weather.</p>

Last night we experimented a very furious whirle-wind, which notwithstanding, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, did pass about the length of our ship, to West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of us. However, we handed in our top-sails, and halled up our low-sails, in the brails. After the whirle-wind came a fresh storm of large hail-stones, in the night, and several <hi>Tornados</hi>; but God be thanked, they all came large of our ship. We now made a great way under a fore-course and sprit-sail. At four of the clock this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our fore-sail split, whereby we were forced to lower our fore-yard. At half an hour after ten we hoysted it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with a furious S. W. wind. We made a N. E. by E. way, and by the same forty seven leagues and an half. By observation we now had Lat. 46 D. 54 S. We riffed our fore-sail, with respect to the violence of the wind. But in the evening, this rather increased, and we had a very great Sea. Our standing rigging, through the fury of this gale, gave way in several places, but was soon mended again.</p>

                  <hi>December</hi> the 6th. We had a clear star-light-night the last and a fair morning this day, with a fresh gale at S. W. At noon we took in our fore-top-sail. We reckoned a N.

               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the 7th. The night was both windy and cloudy. At one in the morning, we took in our top-sails, and at three, handed our sprit-sail, and so we scudded away before the wind, which now was very fresh at West. This morning a gust of wind came and tore our main-sail into an hundred pieces, which made us put away before the wind, till we could provide for that accident. My reckoning was a N. E. three quarters E. way, and by the same thirty three leagues. By observation we found Lat. 39 D. 37 S. We had now a great Sea, and a fresh wind
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59013:111"/>
At three in the afternoon we set another fore-sail; the first being blown to pieces. Moreover, at the same time we furled our sprit-sail. At five the wind came at W. S. W. with very bad weather. This day our worthy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Captain <hi>Sharp,</hi> had very certain intelligence given him, that on Christmas-day,<note place="margin">

That night the wind encreased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the 8th. The night past was both cloudy and windy; the wind often varying between the N. W. and S. W. points. This morning it varyed between W. and N. W. by W. About noon this day, we brought a new main-sail to the yard, but did not set it then, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there blowed too much wind. I reckoned a N.

In the afternoon we had one or two squalls of wind and rain; but the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of both fell at stern of us. In the evening it blew again very hard.

                  </note> but our ship now began to complain of several leakes, through our tedious and long Voyage. This afternoon we hoysted up our main-yard and set up back-stays and main-swifter; whose ring-bolt gave way, but was mended. In the evening of this day we had but little wind.</p>

                  <hi>January</hi> the 4th. All the night past was very cloudy; but this forenoon it cleared up. Yesterday we put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad our main-top-sail, studden-sails; but took them in at night. At four this morning we set our larboard stud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-sail, and before noon fitted up top-gallant masts, and yard. We made a N. W. way, and by it forty leagues and two thirds.

                  <hi>January</hi> the 8th. This evening last past, we had little better than a calm. At nine this morning, we had a fresh wind at S. S. E. with dark weather, so that we thought it convenient, to take in our main-top-sail. But, at noon we set it again, and also, our larboard top-studden-sail with both top-gallant sails. We made a N. W. way, and by it thirty four leagues. By an observation made we found Lat. 01 D. 55 N. We had now extream hot weather, and a very small allowance of water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the 9th. Last night we took in top-sails all night, the wind then whiffling between S. and W. points. We had nowithstanding, for the most part very little wind. The morning of this day was rainy, and thereupon, with good diligence, we saved a bompkin of water. There was now a great ripling sea, rising very high; and it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that sometimes and somewhere hereabouts, is to be seen an enchanted Island; which others say, and dare assert,<note place="margin">

This afternoon we had very dark and calm weather, looking, as if we should have much rain. Now, reckoning up my meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an I found my self E. from my departure, seven hundred and two leagues. In the evening we had very rainy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a cockling sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the 10th. All the night past was cloudy. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight sprang up a small breeze varying all round the compass. At five this morning we had a breeze at S. E. and a very clear sky, which afterwards continued to freshen, with the same clearness as before. We made a N. W. by N. one quarter N. way, and by the same two leagues and two thirds. By a clear observation we had now Lat. 03 D. 16 N. At four this evening the wind was at E. S. E. the weather being violent hot; in so much, that our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of water was tedious unto us for its shortness. At the same time we had an indifferent smooth sea from the E.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the 11th. All the night past we had little or

no wind. But about two in the morning, the wind fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again at E. N. E. and brought both a clear and hot day. We made twenty three leagues by a N. W. one quarter W. way. This days observation gave us Lat. 04 D. 06. N. In the afternoon we had a shower of rain; and afterward a fresh wind at E. N. E. But the evening grew dull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the 12th. In the night past we had two or three squalls of wind, and some showers of rain. In the mean while the wind blew fresh at N. E. and N.

               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the 16th. We had a clear night, and a very fresh wind at N. E. and E. N. E. with a long homeing sea. My reckoning was a N.

I reckoned my self now, East from my departure five hundred fifty three leagues. We had a cloudy evening.</p>

                  <hi>January</hi> the 17th. All the night past we enjoyed a fresh wind, and so this day also, at N. E. by N. We made a N.

                  <hi>January</hi> the 18th. All the night past was both cloudy and windy. At six this morning our sprit-sail-top-mast broke. I reckoned a W. N.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dared we be so bold, as to put in there at <hi>Barbado's</hi>; for hearing of a Frigat lying there, we feared least the said Frigat should seize us for Privateers, and for having acted in all our voyage without Commission. Thus we stood away from thence for the Island of <hi>Antego.</hi>

I reckoned a way of twenty five leagues. So that I was now by my account, to Eastward of my departure one hundred fifty one leagues.
