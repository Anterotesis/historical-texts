            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MAHOMET, (whom ſome doe call <hi>Muhamet,</hi> and the <hi>Turkes mehemet,</hi> that is to ſay, loued or prayſed,) was an <hi>Arabian;</hi> &amp; borne in a village (nigh to <hi>Mecque</hi>) called <hi>Itrarip,</hi> about the yeere, of our Lord &amp; ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt 600. at ſuch time as the Emperor <hi>Heraclius</hi> gouerned in <hi>Grecia,</hi> &amp; king <hi>Dagobert</hi> reigned in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> his father was named <hi>Abdala,</hi> which word may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, the ſeruaunt of God, though in deede he was
<pb facs="tcp:13080:8"/>
a Gentile and very Idolator. But <hi>Mahumet</hi> being an Orphan at the age of eight yeares, was left in the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one of his vncles, named <hi>Abutaliph,</hi> who cauſed him to be inſtructed by a <hi>Iewe</hi> in the <hi>Mathematical</hi> and naturall <hi>Sciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and after that to be married at the age of fifteene or ſixteene years, and then inſtructed him in the trade of Merchandize, which hee practized both in Egipt and Sury, wher not a litle he frequented the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but chiefely with a Moncke of the order of ſaint Benet called Iohn, (as the Biſhop of <hi>Ptolomais</hi> or <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To which knowledge whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had attaigned &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered with himſelf, that it was no great difficult matter vnder the ſhadow of Religion, ſo to draw to him the <hi>Arabians</hi> being but groſſe, rude, and Idolators: he therefore abſented himſelfe out of companie and remayned ſecret by the ſpace of two yeares. And after that preſented himſelfe to the people ſaying, that all the while of his abſence, he was with the <hi>Angell Gabriell</hi> who taught and gaue to him the law of God; and that to beleeue in Idols was fooliſh &amp; vaine. But perceiuing, that at that time, his woords could obtaine ſmall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, he inuented another policie. For which purpoſe he had an Eſclaue called <hi>Zeidimy</hi> to whom he told that the will of God was, that all men ſhould be free, &amp; therfore dyd giue him immediatly his libertie, wherby fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery part, all the Eſclaues in a countrey repayred to <hi>Mehemet,</hi> and gaue him ſuch credit, that whatſoeuer hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, they obeyed him: In ſo much as this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13080:8"/>
thus drawne togethers, brought no litle dread and feare to ſome great and welthie families in <hi>Mecque,</hi> as were the <hi>Caraxins, Haximins,</hi> and <hi>Benimitains,</hi> who vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the intelligence of the drawing togethers of this wicked packe, tooke armour againſt them. Whereof <hi>Mehemet</hi> getting intelligence, fled immediatly, and retired himſelfe to the towne of <hi>Almedine,</hi> ſithens cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Medinathalmaby,</hi> which is ſo much to ſay, as <hi>Medin</hi> of the Prophet, where he began in ſuch ſort to preach to the Iewes, that in ſteede to beleeue him, they beat him in ſundrie fights and his Eſclaues alſo. So as in one of theſe skirmiſhes <hi>Mehemet</hi> gat ſuch a ſtroke ouerthwart his face, that not onely hee loſt two of his ſore teeth, but alſo was left for dead in a dike ther, wherin he was caſt: though in the ende he ouercame the Iewes. And becauſe the <hi>Arabians,</hi> (which indeede be diſcended from <hi>Iſmaell</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Agar</hi> his wiues maide,) were called <hi>Agarins;</hi> hee cauſed to be ordained (in that it was not honorable for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to carie the name of a woman ſeruant,) that from thence forth they ſhould be named <hi>Sarazins,</hi> deducted from the name of <hi>Sara,</hi> the lawfull wife of <hi>Abraham,</hi> alledging that <hi>Iſmaell</hi> was engendred of <hi>Sara</hi> and not of <hi>Agar</hi> hir maiden. The which name of <hi>Sarazins,</hi> ſo long endured, vnto ſuch time as the Turkes dyd abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh both the name and the nation, as heereafter I will declare. <hi>Mahumet</hi> hauing thus crept into credit among ths ignorant and rude people, that hee was a Prophet and meſſenger of God, hee acquainted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with a Lady of no litle wealth and riches; named <hi>Tadiga</hi> or <hi>Cadiga</hi> being a widow, and ſo to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb facs="tcp:13080:9"/>
hee behaued himſelfe towards hir, that hee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried hir, although hee had three other wiues beſides hir, whereof the one was called <hi>Anoſſe,</hi> the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſſe,</hi> and the third named <hi>Seick,</hi> or <hi>Zeich,</hi> whom he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed from one that was one of his bringers vp, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a Concubine that he had called <hi>Marie</hi> a Chriſtian woman of the ſect of the <hi>Iacobits.</hi> And than he began to publiſh his damnable law that it was lawfull for any man to haue foure wiues. Howbeit, thorough the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of this Lady, <hi>Mahumet</hi> was wonderfull re'nforced and ſtrengthened, in ſuch ſort, as that thorough his welth that hee dyd get, he was able to wage ſoldiours. Whereby partly by ſorce, and partly by good oppini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was had in him, all his neighbours obeyed him, and ſo as his trayne growing to ſuch a number thorough the multitude of <hi>Sarazins</hi> that repaired to him, the Emperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> (who at that time had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his dominion, both the countries of <hi>Surie, Egipt,</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi>) ſerued himſelfe with theſe people in his warres againſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Howbeit, it ſo afterwards came to paſſe, that at a pay of the Emperours army, among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at that time vvere certaine bands of the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> ſo as mony vvas not ſo plentie there at that inſtant, able to pay the vvhole army: And that hee, which had the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the pay of the army among vvhom the bands of <hi>Sarazins</hi> alſo were attending for their vvages, vndeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly gaue anſvvere to the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> that the Emperor had not mony ynough, there to pay the <hi>Chrictians,</hi> that vvere Souldiours; and therfore they being but dogges, ought not to demaund for vvages.

            <p>IN the yeere of our Lord God 1250. or there abouts at ſuch time as king Lewes (otherwiſe called S.

The Lord of this countrie was called Aloadin or Aladin which ſignifieth Diuine or of God.</p>
            <p>THE Hiſtories of the ſayde paſſage doe name it <hi>le viel de la Montaigne</hi> (as alſo do Hayton and Paul the Venetian, who were then liuing.) This territorie is, as it were a plaine, enuironed round about with mountaines, into the which, was but one onelie entrie &amp; paſſage: vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which, Aladin aforeſayde cauſed a great fortreſſe to be builded named Tigado. All the ſayd plaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally<note place="margin">Tigado.</note> is very fertile and pleaſant to the eye, by reaſon of the faire medowes, brookes, woods &amp; groues, wherwith the ſame doth plentifully abound. Beſides which naturall contents, this Aladin had furniſhed the ſaid plaine euery where with beautifull Gardins, vergers, rich palaces, and houſes of pleaſure, in moſt ſumptuous wiſe that could be deuiſed; and therewith cauſed the ſame to be enhabited with the fayreſt young men &amp; women of the beſt faces that any where he could finde. For which purpoſe too he waged certaine ſoldiors, to awaite and watch the getting of ſuch young men and beautifull women. Hayton ſaith that this Aladin cared for no manner of Religion. Paul the Venetian ſayeth that hee was a Mahemetiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13080:23"/>When Aladin had thus ſurpriſed any young man, hee was brought to this caſtle of Tigado, and within a litle time on ſome faire day when the ſunne dyd ſhine verie cleere, one ſhould come and bring this man (thus taken) a drinke, which would enforce him ſo ſtrongly to ſleepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſhould ſo remaine a very long ſpace without any manner of moouing or feeling as though he were plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead. Than would he cauſe him to be borne into this vallie and ſo thorough his faire palaices and gardens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his beautifull women, and withall, to be clothed in rich apparell. So as, whan hee waked hee found himſelfe an other man, &amp; as though comde into a new world. In ſuch his galantrie, hee was ſtraight wayes enterteygned feaſted with the Ladies there, and wonderfullie welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with the ſhew of all manner of paſtimes and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all kinde of pleaſures: which youth and luſt could deſire, and this ſo long as all that day would endure. At night after a certain banquet prepared, whervpon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, the like drink as before, to make him ſleepe, againe was giuen him. Thus being made to ſleepe; his ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparel was taken of, &amp; his former garments put on, &amp; ſo brough againe into the ſaid fortreſſe from whence he went, and into ſuch place as might be much vnlike to that which he had beene before. So as vpon his awaking, he ſhould ſoone perceiue himſelfe in an obſcure &amp; euill ſented old chamber cleane chaunged, from the place, where he could not but remember he had beene before. When Aladin vpon conference with him, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the place where hee had beene was Paradice, and that it was in his power to ſend him thether whan hee would, if therefore the young man had minde to

continue ſuch bleſſedneſſe for euer it was graunted vpon condition that he would take courage and hardineſſe to aduenture his life and to die for him in ſuch ſeruice as vpon occaſion hee would commaund.

And thus ended the Empire of the Caliphes of Baudraz which vnto that time had endured aboute ſixe hunderd yeeres.</p>

            <p>Thus proceeded the ſaid Mammeluchs, to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and rule in Egipt, and did chooſe their Souldains either vpon chriſtians that became renies or that were chriſtians children, bought as aboueſaid, and educated in that forme of religion &amp; trained ſo, to the warres as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue is declared, albeit therwere none of theſe Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luchs that durſt goe alone through the city wher they were, but by expreſſe commandement of their Emyrs, who were their ſuperiors; they ſhould goe two at the leaſt togethers: and to bee briefe, theſe Mammeluchs had the authoritie and dominacion ouer all the people of Egipt &amp; Surie, from the time they chaſed the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans out of Surie vntill that Selim the great Turke, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is mencioned, vtterly ouethrew them &amp; their name for euer.</p>

It was not impoſsible but that the fortreſſe might be eaſilie wonne and gotten, conſidering that the enemie had gotten one of the Bulwarks of the fortreſſe, and that the fortreſſe beeing but narrow of it ſelfe, was in manner on euerie part continually aſsalted, which beeing conſidered by thoſe, that could skill in warres, dyd greatly mooue them, chiefely when they perceiued that ayde ſo ſecretly came. The meane time by the commaundement of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth of that name, certaine ſouldiors were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the ende that by his example, other Princes might the better bee encouraged to giue ſuccors to the order of the <hi>Ioannits,</hi> and therefore hee commaunded that one hundreth pound of golde ſhould bee giuen to <hi>Cambiano,</hi> Lieuetenant of that order in Rome, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine furniture of ponder to bee deliuered to him out of the Caſtall of ſainct <hi>Angelo</hi> at Rome, that nothing ſhould on his part ſeeme to want, that poſsiblie he could doe.

The fifteenth day of this month, the whole Nauie of the <hi>Turks,</hi> about night paſſed this port, and becauſe the night was darke, wee could not perceiue the inconuenience of their nauie, for we learned ſo much after that their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies though they were left in manner vnarmed, they could not well bee towed from the place they had them,
<pb facs="tcp:13080:76"/>
and chiefely for lacke of water, they were enforced to departe from the port of <hi>Vulturno,</hi> and perhaps the feare of your Nauie, which they vnderſtoode (as I was enformed) to be a hundred and fiftie ſhips riding at an ancre in the port of <hi>Meſſana,</hi> was likewiſe the cauſe that they would not ride in the port of <hi>Saint Paule,</hi> but plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſhips aboue <hi>Porto Muſetto,</hi> and a good part of their gallies at <hi>Saint Georges,</hi> howbeit their ſhips &amp; gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are not ſo farre in ſunder, but if your Graces nauie ſhould come at the ſudden, in the feare that they are in, they would make ſpeede, a pace to their nauie, if they were further off diſtant.

And if their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhould be that there were none other way but to dye, they hoped to leaue ſuch victory to the enemie, that the ioy and pleaſure, which they would gaine therby, ſhould coſt them the beſt blood that remained in the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Soldiours that the <hi>Turks</hi> than had.

               <p>The three Meſſengers hauing thus receaued the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders anſwere, containing greater courage than good hap, returned to the great Maiſter, who calling again the Counſail togethers, &amp; hearing the valiant anſwer of the defendours, was likewiſe deſirous to heare the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the meſſengers, <hi>Caſtriota</hi> was of opinion, that inſomuch as the defendours were yet Maiſters of the dikes, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres might be kept, &amp; that he <hi>Caſtriota,</hi> (if he were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded) would take the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Fortres in charge, and that rather he would loſe his life, than to forſake the place.

               <p>The Spaniard agreeing in opinion with <hi>Caſtriota,</hi> thought conuenient, that the place ſhould not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; for that the dikes and Rampers of the Fortres for the moſt part were yet not beaten in ſunder, and that a meruailous vnitie of mynde was reſident in the defendours, ioyned with a liuely courage and deſire to come to hand ſtrokes with the enemie, which in manner promiſed an aſſured victorie to the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</p>

to thend that the barbarous enemie might vnderſtand, with what kinde of men he had to doe, to the repreſſing of his temerarious arrogance and pride: Leaſt, in forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the place, the enemié would perhaps think it were done through feare.

Nor truely the prudent <hi>Poet</hi> (diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the wars beetwixt the <hi>Latins</hi> and the <hi>Ruteli,</hi>) was of other minde, ſayeng <hi>Vrget Praeſentia Turni,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Turnus</hi> prouoked the courage of his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, by which moſt euident reaſons it was iudged that <hi>Valet</hi> the prince of the order of the <hi>Ioannits</hi> ſhould haue done both manfully and moſt prudently according to his function, if according to his determination hee had ben preſent at the defence of the breach among his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, if the <hi>Turks</hi> had aſſalted the ſame. The ſame time the king of <hi>Argire</hi> with ſeauen gallyes &amp; ten other ſhips, in which were two thouſand and two hundred ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, came to the aide of the <hi>Turks</hi> army in <hi>Malta.</hi> Who ſeeming to be very ſory, that he was not there at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the warres, required of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> to haue ſo much honour ſhewed him, that both for the declaration of his good will, for the exployt of ſome notable ſeruice &amp; to proue what courage reſted in his owne ſouldiours he might haue the formoſt place with-his ſouldiours to aſſalt the fortres of <hi>Saint Michael,</hi> which not onely was graunted to him, but alſo <hi>Muſtapha</hi> cauſed two thouſand choſen ſoldiors of the army of the <hi>Turk,</hi> to be ioyned to him, which being granted to him, about 90 ſmall ſhips were commanded to be brought from <hi>Porto Muſetto,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water of <hi>Marza,</hi> for that vpon that ſide the king of <hi>Argire</hi> purpoſed vpon the water to giue the aſſault vnto the fortres. Which when the <hi>Prince Valet</hi> did perceue, as alſo, hauing had intelligence of this the <hi>Turks</hi> preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; deuiſe, by a certaine fugitiue that came out of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13080:90"/>
campe to him. Immediately he called before him two of the beſt practiſed &amp; faithfull pilots, that were in <hi>Borgo,</hi> &amp; of them demanded by what meanes the <hi>Turks</hi> might be enbarred from the approching to the foote of the wall of the ſortreſſe. The pilots anſwered that their opinions were, if of maſts of ſhips, and other timber ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethers at the ends with ringes of Iron, and thereof as it were a long chaine to be made, and the one end ther of to be ſaſtned from the corner of the caſtle of Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> vnto the other ſide, where the enimie with their boates were determined to enter, the enimies deuiſes ſhould bee vtterly ſtopped in that behalfe. This pollicie liked the great Maiſter in ſuch ſort, that in the night following, the chaine was ended, and placed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The <hi>Turkes</hi> in the dawning of the morning, ſeeing this chaine placed to enbarre their pretences, were ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, not knowing how to land the ſouldiours: but while the king of <hi>Argire</hi> and his company were in this maſe, a fugitiue a Chriſtian, a man of meruailous hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, (to which kinde of perſons, raſhneſſe ſerueth for vertue, and deſperation in ſtead of conſtancy) came to the king, and promiſed that he would breake this chaine afore aid. Wherevpon (taking an axe with him) did enter into the water, after whom followed two or three others, to aide and help him, and ſo ſwimming to this chayne, this fugitiue began to ſtrike at this chayne with his axe. Which when the Chriſtians in <hi>Borgo,</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, about fiue or ſixe of them with their ſwords draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en did on their part by and by ſwimme likewiſe to the deſence of the chayne, where, after killing two of that company, thoſe Chriſtians did put the other to flight.
<pb facs="tcp:13080:91"/>
After that, none was ſo bold to put in proofe the like againe: Neuertheleſſe, the king of <hi>Argire,</hi> dyd not leaue his purpoſe, for the xv day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> at the breake of day, he proceded to the aſſalt, both by land and vvater.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> perceuing the pretence of the <hi>Argiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> had prepared the moſt part of their Artillerie to be laied towards that place vvhere the <hi>Argirians</hi> came to giue the aſſalt. So as, vpon the repaire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Artillerie of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> vvere vnbended with ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence by the ſpace of three houres, during the time of the aſſalt, that with the bullets of the Canon &amp; other Artillerie, about two thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> were torne in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; drowned, with twelue of their ſhips. Howbeit the moſt part of their ſhips approching to the Chaine, &amp; perceauing the ſame to enbarre them to land where they purpoſed, they turned the ſhipps vpon an other part towards the Fortres of <hi>Saint Michael,</hi> but doeing nothing, they likewiſe vvere enforced to retourne. Vpon the land, likewiſe, it vvas meruailouſly fought, ſo as many <hi>Turks</hi> vvere ſlaine, and two hundred of our <hi>Chriſtians</hi> vvanting, among vvhome <hi>Frederic,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Dom Garza, Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Sicell,</hi> vvas torne in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vvith an Iron Bullet, alſo one <hi>Gordio</hi> a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: <hi>Francis Senoghera,</hi> vvith his Neuew <hi>Iohn, Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniards</hi> borne, and knights of the <hi>Ioannits, Medina,</hi> there, likewiſe was vvounded to death, vvho after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dyed of the ſame.</p>
               <p>But the Prince <hi>Valet,</hi> perceauing in what perills the ſtate of vvhole <hi>Malta</hi> ſhould ſtand in, if many ſuch battailes vvere often fought, vvhan as, thoſe that were vvearie, both day and night ſhould continually haue

to doe with the freſh and new Soldiours of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to haue no maner of ſupply of ſoldiours, ſent to ſuccour them. Therefore the ſeuententh of <hi>Iuly,</hi> he ſent a meſſenger into <hi>Sicilia,</hi> who by ſwimming paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Caſtle at the vtter bay: leading to the water of <hi>Marza,</hi> and from thence eſcaped vnknowen through the middeſt of the enemies, vnto the Cittie of <hi>Malta,</hi> and ſo from <hi>Malta</hi> taking ſhipping, came with diligence to <hi>Meſſana.</hi> To this meſſenger, <hi>Valet,</hi> gaue letters, by the which he required that he might haue thoſe two Gallies of his owne, there remaining, and the ſame to be furniſhed and ſent with thoſe number of knights of the <hi>Ioannits,</hi> as were remaining at <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and with ſo many other ſoldiours as might fill and repleniſh thoſe Gallies. And that, vpon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming nigh to <hi>Malta,</hi> they ſhould abide a loofe before the Port, vnto ſuch time they had a conuenient ſigne made vnto them whether they might ſafely enter the Port yea or no.</p>
               <p>At which time that the meſſenger of <hi>Malta,</hi> came to <hi>Meſſana,</hi> there came thether a fleet of ſhips out of <hi>Spain</hi> that brought in the ſame ſundry knights of the order of <hi>Ioannits,</hi> of diuers nacions. Whan as the Viceroy purpoſed to ſend away to <hi>Malta,</hi> the two gallies written for, he firſt thought meet to write to the great Maſter certaine letters Ciphered by two ſeuerall little ſhipps, wherby he ſignified to the great Maſter, that with thoſe he ſent the two Gallies for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he wrote howbeit he required that the Gallies might haue aſſured ſigne made vnto them, whan they came in ſight of the Iland, whether they might enter without euident peril or no.</p>

Whereby the knights of the order, reſting at <hi>Meſſana,</hi> could not tell how to ſend ſafely the two Gallies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>Malta.</hi> Notwithſtanding conſidering that the great Maiſter ſo earneſtly vvrote to haue them, &amp; that they thought, <hi>Vbirerum agitur ſumma, vnius particulae pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculum, minus eſſe metuendum.</hi> Where the vvhole affaires reſt in daunger, the perill and loſſe but of a part &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle thereof for the conſeruacion of the reſt ought the leſſe to be regarded and feared, they determined vvith themſelues to commit the two Gallies to the guiding of Fortune; alwaies aforeſeeing, that all thoſe knights of the order, ſhould not paſſe in that hazard, but onely fortie of them ioyned vvith a good number of ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that furniſhed vp the two Gallies. With theſe paſſed Captain <hi>Salazar,</hi> an <hi>Hiſpaniard,</hi> in a bote towed by the Gallies, into the Iland of <hi>Goza</hi> vvho after from

thence paſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into <hi>Malta</hi> to eſpie both the ſtate of the Citie, and the <hi>Turks</hi> Armie. The meane tyme, the <hi>Turks</hi> not forgetting, the great ouerthrow and repulſe that they receaued at their late aſſalt at <hi>Saint Michaels,</hi> and not a litle deſirous to reuenge the ſame, therefore they began vvith terrible ſury theyr batterie againe, againſt the Fortres of <hi>Saint Michaell,</hi> in ſuch ſort, as that ſo much as the defendours repaired vp in the night, the <hi>Turks</hi> by day by their Artillery ouerthrew and brake.</p>
               <p>While the enemies Artillerie, dyd their feate, the <hi>Turks</hi> deuiſed theyr bridge, vvhich they finiſhed, and dyd ſett ouer the dyke before the Sunne ryſing, the twentith of <hi>Iuly,</hi> vvhereby they might come to hand ſtrokes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvith our <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Which being perceaued by the defendours, and conſidered, vvhat detriment the bridge vvould import, if the ſame vvere ſuffered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Immediately <hi>ſeignior Pariſoto</hi> the great Maiſters Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uew, and <hi>Agleria,</hi> knights of the Order, vvith a good company of other ſoldiours, iſſued forth of entent to haue burned the bridge.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13080:93"/>But our Chriſtians on their part with no leſſe valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant courage reſiſted them, &amp; with very force, what by Gunſhot, arrowes, wildefire &amp; handſtrokes, at laſt they compelled the <hi>Turks</hi> to retire from the aſſalt, with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible loſſe. With this victory, the harts of the defenders in ſuch manner encreaſed that they cared nothing for the malice of the enemie. And becauſe there was not ſo often ſkirmiſhing on our ſide, as was wont, and that the artillery of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſide, began to ſtay from ſhoting, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſuppoſed, that there was few ſouldiours left on liue in the fortres, &amp; that their furniture of pouder, ſhot, and other things, were ſpent. Which ſtay from ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing &amp; ſhooting, was rather done of purpoſe by the counſaile and deuiſe of the <hi>Prince Valet,</hi> then for any want of thoſe matters in the fortres, &amp; for a good cauſe, conſidering that he heard of no maner of certaine aide, at that time, &amp; that euery day more &amp; more the enemies fury &amp; malice did grow the greater, hee thought it not requiſit, to conſume his garriſons &amp; other furnitures i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely &amp; to no purpoſe. But the <hi>Turks</hi> perceyuing, that by theſe often aſſalts of theirs, theyr pretences toke litle ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they determined with themſelues to prooue what they could by myning, and one mine they had in maner brought to paſſe, beefore our <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did perceiue the ſame, &amp; to the end they might blinde the eyes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, they cauſed two gallyes towards the water, to aproch the wals of the towne of <hi>Saint Michael,</hi> &amp; to beate at the ſame with theyr artillery, ſuppoſing by the ſame that the garriſon to haue forſaken their charge, &amp; to haue aided the reſt, would haue neglected the cuſtody of the wals of the caſtle, &amp; ſo by this mine, to haue entred into
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13080:93"/>
the fortres. But the defenders, vnderſtanding the ſubtile pollicies of the <hi>Turks,</hi> by the meanes &amp; prudence aſwell of certaine of the garriſon, as chiefely of one of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignebearers ther, brought vtterly to naught the mine of the enimy, by a contermine. For the enſigne bearer firſt entring the mine of the enemy, with a lanterne in hand, &amp; caſting certain arteficial fire among the enemies in the mine, that whether the enemy would or no, hee draue them out of the mine. For which good ſeruice done, the great maſter rewarded this worthy enſigne bearer with the gift of a chaine of gold wayeng fiue pounds, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Virtus virtutem parit, ea<expan>

The next day after which was the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> certaine of the garriſon of the fortres iſſued forth, &amp; with pouder burnt to peeces the bridge which the <hi>Turks</hi> before had deuiſed &amp; layed ouer the dike, which worthy deed ſo done, turned to the whole fortres a wonderfull commodity. For the next day after, at the Sun ſetting the <hi>Turks</hi> aſſalted agayne the fortreſſe, vpon that part which was garded by <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Roffo,</hi> where by the ſpace of three houres, it was valiauntly foughten on each ſide, but in the ende the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> repulſed the <hi>Turkes,</hi> leauing beehinde them three hundred ſlaine. And on the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> part remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dead, <hi>Roffo</hi> himſelfe with one <hi>Bareſo,</hi> and certaine other ſouldiours.</p>
               <p>This while during the aſſalt the <hi>Turks</hi> in ſuch ſort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed their great artillery with continuall ſhot, that none of the defenders durſt ſcarce ſhew his head to looke into the dike, but immediatly he was diſpatched,
<pb facs="tcp:13080:94"/>
but for all that, where occaſion of any worthy ſeruice was at that inſtant to be ſhewed, the ſouldiours of the fortreſſe would not ſpare his life, to execute the ſame. As well appeared in <hi>Calderonio</hi> the <hi>Hiſpaniard,</hi> who when hee doubted that the enimy was breaking that part of the wall of bulwarke, called the bulwarke of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> hee iſſued immediatly to eſpy and know the ſame, but in a moment hee was ſlaine with the bullet of an arquebuſe. Whoſe infortunity as to ſome it would haue beene a terrour and feare, ſo was the ſame not the leſſe an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the reſt, to endeauour to doe the like ſeruice. For when they perceiued that the enemy did what they could to fill vp the dike of the fortreſſe, they of the garriſon determined rather to ende their liues with honour, then to come into the handes of a moſt cruell enemy, and therfore concluded togethers to iſſue forth that night vpon the enemy, and to enbar them of their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon a hundred of the garriſon iſſued forth, part where of were <hi>Ioannits</hi> and part ſouldiours that tooke wages, and ſo worthely gaue charge vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, that they enforced them to forſake the dikes and to flie away a pace, leauing behinde them ſlaine foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore <hi>Turks,</hi> and ten killed of our ſide, among whom of the Chriſtian part remayned dead two knights of the order <hi>Giouanni Cantabro,</hi> and one <hi>Macrino,</hi> whole heads the cruell <hi>Turks</hi> had cut from their bodies, and planting them vpon ſpeares, did ſet them in the valie of <hi>Saint Sauiors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to be viewed of the fortreſſe. That day at night, thoſe that were in the citie of <hi>Malta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> made many bone fires, and therewith ſhot of their arquebuſes, ſhewing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13080:94"/>
thereby a great token of reioyce: Which both thoſe that were beſeged, and the <hi>Turks</hi> alſo hard very well, whereby the <hi>Turks</hi> ſuppoſed, that either the Nauie of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> began to approch the Iland of <hi>Malta,</hi> or elſe ſuch ſupply of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were landed, that was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to encounter with the <hi>Turks</hi> Armie there.

               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> the meane time filled the dike of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which thing cauſed that neither the <hi>Turkes</hi> could be endamaged by the Caſemacts of the dyke being cloyed vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet by the Flankers from the Bulwarke of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Theſe often aſſalts, this <hi>Baſſa</hi> dyd not make, in that he had any great hope to vvinne theſe Places, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhew him ſelfe to execute the function and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an expert Generall, and to ſatisfie the minde of his <hi>Prince Solimane,</hi> vvho had commaunded them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to winne the places, or elſe there to loſſe their liues about the ſame.</p>

               <p>Howbeeit the two <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Gallyes continued theyr courſe vnto <hi>Pozalo,</hi> from whence by theyr let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they gaue intelligence to the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> of occurrants to them happened in theyr voyage.

               <p>Beſides that, they ſaid, they did ſee the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with incredible hardineſſe defend their places, &amp; that no peece of artillery of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſide, was at any time vainely blowen of, whereſore the <hi>Turks</hi> affirmed, they had right good cauſe, to bee weary and repent &amp; to deteſt ſuch wars, which made them to eſchew vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fight, and vtterly to flie away, and chiefely ſuch as were <hi>Renegants,</hi> that had forſaken the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith and become <hi>Turks.</hi> For which cauſe there was right ſtrait watch ſet by the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and commandement giuen by him, that either they ſhould winne the towne, or elſe to looſe their liues all, for ſo had <hi>Soliman</hi> their prince commaunded.

               <p>The enemies, the meane tyme, vnder the corner of the Dike vvhere <hi>Boninſegna</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a vvorthie Knight of the <hi>Ioannits</hi> had his charge, began to myne, vvhich vvhan the defenders perceued, they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the ſame vvith an other myne, &amp; thereby brought the myne of the enemie to none effect.</p>
               <p>During this tyme, vvhile a Fugitiue vvas comming from the enemie towards <hi>Borgo</hi> &amp; ſwimming the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>Turks</hi> tooke him, vvhich vvas meruailous hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that vvere vvonderfully deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know of the eſtate of the <hi>Turks</hi> Armie, and of their Counſaills.

               <p>Howbeit the pretences of the <hi>Turkes</hi> could not ſo prudently be vvrought, but through the vigilances of the defendours, the ſame vvas eſpyed, and ſo came to paſſe, that theyr Mynes came to none effect, and
<pb facs="tcp:13080:99"/>
the <hi>Turks</hi> ſlaine in their owne Mynes, vvith loſſe alſo of ſuch barrells of Pouder, as they had layed there, vvhich the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> recouered from them.</p>
               <p>With theſe offences and difficulties, the hopes of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Pial,</hi> the <hi>Baſſas</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> being vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowen, they vvith the reſidue of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines entred in Counſaill to know vvhether it vvere expedient to tarrie any longer, or elſe to retourne home: Whereof the moſt part, vvere of aduiſe, that they ſhould depart.

Whereby they might vnderſtand vvhat the pleaſure of the Prince vvere for them to doe in ſuch behalfe: and in the meane tyme, by force or guile, to ſeeke ſome good Fortune of victorie. Which in deede the Enemies prooued and attempted more often, than that they gained thereby.</p>
               <p>For as they themſelues vvere vnquieted, ſo they purpoſed not to lett bee in reſt the poore <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſometime in exerciſing their vſuall fury vvith Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſometyme either myning, or entrenching, or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the dikes, or elſe aſſalting ſome breach to theyr owne loſſe: howbeit, all vvhich that they dyd, they executed the ſame vvith meruailous diligence and in ſmall time. Therefore vvhan as, <hi>Robles</hi> Maiſter of the Tents, in the night came to view the ruine and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of a part of the vvall, he vvas ſuddenly ſmitten in the head vvith a bullet of an Harquebuze, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dyed, to the great lamentacion of all ſuch

as had knowne him. For in him vvere reſident ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie good artes; vvith vvhich he profited much thoſe that vvere beſeeged. Wherefore the Great Maiſter ſent a notable gentleman right expert in the vvarres, that vvas Coronell of the Fautery (vvhome vnto that time he kept about him ſelfe;) to be generall of the Fortres of <hi>Saint Michaells,</hi> vvho vvith ſuch ſinguler prudence guided his charge, vvith vvatching, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailling, and prouidence, that ſo often as the Enemies gaue attempt to that peece, they vver alwaies repulſed, vvith no litle detriment &amp; loſſe. The meane time thoſe two gallies vvith thother ſhips of the <hi>Turks</hi> (vvhich (as before I did tell you) vvere eſpied by the two <hi>Chriſtian</hi> gallies of <hi>Malta,</hi>) arriuing among the <hi>Turks</hi> Nauie, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed vnto <hi>Pial Baſſa,</hi> the Admirall, that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nauy vvas in redineſſe to come to <hi>Malta,</hi> vvho dreading the ſodaine comming of that Nauie, commaunded 70. of his long ſhips to be put in a redineſſe, leauing 40. ſhips in the Port of <hi>Muſetto,</hi> being the reſidue of his Nauie, which vver vtterly out of furniture, &amp; vnarmed both of men &amp; tackle: the maſts of which 40. ſhips, wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed about making of bridges, &amp; other neceſſaries, for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalting of the places in <hi>Malta,</hi> &amp; the men therof likewiſe wer ſpent with ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry diſeaſes, &amp; fights wherin they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: Therfore <hi>Pial,</hi> for certaine daies, abode all the day time nigh the ſhore of <hi>Malta,</hi> about a place ther called <hi>Maiaro,</hi> &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time he ſtaied abrode vpon the high Sea; abiding the comming of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> nauie. But he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceuing none to come, he landed his company again: &amp; forſomuch as that the furniture of powder began to decaie in the <hi>Turkes</hi> Campe, therfore vvas giuen that

of euery thirty barrels of Pouder, in euery ſhip twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or fiue &amp; twenty barrells according to the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted porcion ſhould be taken. Whereby the <hi>Turks,</hi> vvith greater fury than euer they did before, battered the vvalles of both the Townes, vvith ſuch great peeces of Artillery as are called <hi>Baſiliſcois:</hi> vvhereof euery bullet ſhot out of the ſame waieth two hundreth pound, and in compaſſe ſeauen ſpannes. With theſe peeces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie the vvalls of the Fortres of <hi>Saint Michael,</hi> vvere throwen downe and made flat. Likewiſe at that time, <hi>Muſtapha Baſſa,</hi> in ſuch ſort at <hi>Borgo</hi> beat the Bulwark of <hi>Caſtile</hi> vvith Artillery, that in maner the ſame vvas ouerthrowen. Whan as the enemies perceaued that both the townes vvas vtterly made voide, both of their vvalls and other peeces of Fortificacion, ſo as the <hi>Turks</hi> might looke vpon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> on them: vvithout further tarrieng: the <hi>Turks</hi> vpon the eightenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at noone tyme of the day, vvith their vniuerſal armie gaue charge vpon both the towns, at the vvhich the Enemies, vvere three times put back, and thriſe returned, and in the end the <hi>Turks</hi> were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly repulſed, after fiue houres fight.</p>
               <p>In this moſt dreadfull aſſalt, the inuincible courage of the <hi>Prince Valet,</hi> was apparant to each one, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his Curace, and formidable with his Picke in hand, was ſeene beefore the reſt of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> moſt valyantly fighting. Whoſe manfull preſence, not onely gaue courage to his ſoldiors ther, but alſo moued vp the harts of the boies &amp; women in ſuch extremity to doe notable ſeruice. For ſo it commeth to paſſe oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>Magis homines mouentur exemplis quam verbis.</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:13080:100"/>
That men are more ſtirred forwards with examples of well doeing, then by onely doeings. Of this great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Turks,</hi> a part of them had gotten downe into the dikes of <hi>Borgo,</hi> and there tarried, and to the end they ſhould not bee damaged with the flankers of the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> they fortefied themſelues on the flanke with earth and fagot, which they accompliſhed right quickly. And for this purpoſe they did the ſame, that they might vnderminde and ſape the walls, about the which they had occupied the ſpace of fiftie yards.</p>
               <p>When the garriſon of <hi>Borgo</hi> vnderſtoode the polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who thus had gotten into the dike, they immediatlie cauſed certaine of the great artillery to be ſhot off, alongſt that part of the dike, wherewith &amp; with fire alſo hurled into the dike, a great ſort of the <hi>Turkes</hi> with theyr fortyfication in the dyke, were deſtroyed. The next dey after the enemyes renewed at the ſame places, their fights agayne, euer ſupplyeng the places of their wearied ſouldiours, with freſh men. But firſt of all, enſuing theyr vſuall cuſtome, they beat at both the townes with their artillery vntill night, then about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when the Moone ſhined vpon the earth, this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſalt with raging cruelty and force began, which at the firſt made our <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſomewhat afraied, who hauing yet memory of their former manhoode, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſo behaued themſelues, with their wilde fire, ſhot, &amp; other weapons, that the enemyes were enforced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part right euelly handled, into their campe, after three houres fighting.</p>
               <p>That day, another mine of the enemyes was found made towards the fortyfication of the bulwarke of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13080:101"/>
in the which were perceyued to bee a hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> who vvere all ſlayne, and the mine broken. Nor for all that, the day following the enemy was quiet, but ſeauen times inuaded thoſe places agayne, and ſending freſh ſouldiors, who not onely with vveapon, but alſo with bags of pouder and fire, continued their fight. At the which <hi>Boninſegna</hi> hauing his face burned, loſt an eye. Likewiſe, at that inſtant the enemy aſſalted the fortres of <hi>Saint Michael,</hi> at a place called <hi>Sperone,</hi> aſſayeng at that part, to haue entred the fort, wher <hi>Centio Aquitano,</hi> vvith an inuincible courage, mounting on the ramper, vvith his <hi>Picke</hi> moſt manfully fought to the ouerthrow of ſuch of the enemyes, as enterpriſed to aſcend the ramper, &amp; after killing one of the enemies, to the feare of the reſt, beeing ſhot thorough one of his armes vvith the ſtroke of an harquebuze, and retyring himſelfe, vntill hee had dreſſed his wound, manfully hee retourned againe to his place, &amp; from thence he departed not vntill ſuch time as the enemy forſooke the aſſalt, &amp; hee remayned victorious. Thus the <hi>Turks</hi> at both the places, with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous loſſe of their ſouldiours were repulſed, leauing the victory to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of which our <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were then ſlaine, to the number of an hundred, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the moſt part were torne in peeces, with the <hi>Turks</hi> artillery. Among whom at the ruine of the bulwarke of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was ſlaine one <hi>Frago,</hi> and at the fortres of <hi>Saint Michael, Scipio Prato, Giouanni Baptiſta Soderino, Paulo Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niporto, Marino Fagiano, Ruffino,</hi> all knights of the order of the <hi>Ioannits,</hi> and ſundrie others, worthie of longer life. The <hi>Turks</hi> againe wrought an other mine, at the fortres of <hi>Saint Michael,</hi> which when the defenders per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13080:101"/>

               <p>And albeit that daye and others after, the enemie prooued both vvith theyr Scaffolds againe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing their Fortificacions that vvere caſt downe, and other Ingins, to driue the defenders from the vvalls: yet all their pollicies and labours, through the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancies and vertues of the Defenders, came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

from them certaine barrels of Pouder, and putting the enemyes to flight, but alſo deſtroyed the <hi>Turks</hi> mine, performed their owne mine. In this manner things paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on both ſides, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> the generall, being very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous &amp; right expert in the art <hi>Militarie,</hi> conſidering that the moſt part of the ſommer was ſpent, and that longer he could not well abide, and that ſtifly to ſtand &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue againſt an enemie, openeth oftentimes an aſſured way vnto victory, hee determined therefore with his whole power to aſſault agayne the Fortres of <hi>Saint Michaell,</hi> wherefore he cauſed to bee brought forth the chiefe ſtanderd of <hi>Solyman</hi> his prince, vpon the top wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of was a globe of fine gold, and commanded with the ſame, the ſouldiours to giue the aſſalt, and with force to enter the towne, thorough the ruines there made.

<pb facs="tcp:13080:105"/>
according to the vocation of each ſouldiour, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> promiſed either mony or honours, mixing threatnings to ſome, &amp; gentle words of deſire, to others. The <hi>Turks</hi> through <hi>Muſtaphais</hi> pretence, whether they were ſtirred vp vvith his fayre promiſes, or enforced through his threatnings, they ran freſhly againe to the aſſalt, where the conflict of each part was vvonderfull furyous, but in the end the <hi>Turks</hi> vvere enforced to retire. For our <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had made a dyke, and in the ſame had cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched two field peeces, with vvhich they beate on the flanke, a ſcaffolde couered with ravv hydes againſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which the enemyes had gotten in there. And at the firſt ſtroke, the ſcaffold was beaten in peeces with the artillery, and forty <hi>Turks</hi> vnder the ſcaffold vvere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo torne in peeces, with the bullets of the ſame. And the ſame night thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that garded in <hi>Borgo,</hi> the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> iſſued forth vpon the <hi>Turks,</hi> and brake downe all the places of defence of the enemy, nigh vnto the bulwark, &amp; beſides wanne a ramper from the <hi>Turks,</hi> vvhich exceeded in height any peece of fortyfication that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had left to defend themſelues, and from the ſame ouerthrew the <hi>Turks,</hi> and dyd put them to flyght</p>
               <p>By this, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> vnderſtoode right well, that the <hi>Turks</hi> had no great will to fight, and that theyr courages deminiſhed, for at that ramper for the garde of the ſame, were left in manner three hundred <hi>Turkes,</hi> and our <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that gaue the charge vvere not aboue twenty fiue perſons, and yet thoſe three hundred as it ſeemed durſt not abide our twenty fiue.

            <p>For my owne part (ſir) I am in opinion, that not onely the griefe but the ſhame is to all noble mindes, as to your ſelfe in common.

            <p>But chiefely the <hi>Germaine</hi> princes fayling, whom the many attempts of the <hi>Turks,</hi> againſt their ſtate hath continually, with offenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And vvhich to feare, is more fearefull.

            <p>And for thoſe our brothers, vvhich is the ſecond point in our griefe propounded,) I know not vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it vvere better fitting to deplore their condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then to deteſt their hatefull Impietie, vvho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvitched with the fayre ſhoe of a frayle and very ſmal good, renounce the euerlaſting and Celeſtiall riches, abiure Chriſtian Religion from Heauen diſcended, and by the ſonne of Almightie GOD, to vs men deliuered, vvhich onely all other meanes ſhut vpp, makes free paſſage, and layes open the path that leades to eternall Bleſſedneſſe, and the Kingdome of Heauen.</p>
            <p>Theſe things as I firſt ſayde, (deare friend) are to bee pittied, and vvherein vve are vvith all endeauour to labour, leaſt at any tyme the lyke may happe to vs, or vve brought to the ſame paſſe, then vvhich in miſerable miſerie there is neither ſtate nor place more abiect.</p>

their faſhions, lawes, counſayles, and diſcipline, with thoſe other of vs <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then none will deny me I am ſure, but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe cauſes, vvhich extoll kingdomes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths, to great wealth, much power, and high eſtimation, religion before the reſt is to bee preferred, which religion containeth in it a double function, one is moſt excellent and deuine, and the ſame for which at firſt religion, was by heauenly prouidence, enſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into mansminde: this (as I ſayd formerly) beeing the onely and moſt certaine guide, conducting to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall bleſſedneſſe, then which was neuer greater gift granted to men by Almighty God, whoſe operation is ſuch, as in regard thereof it drawes our affections to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme all riches, all pleaſures, kingdomes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes, or what may bee thought precious in this life, to bee vilde and of no valew: according to that ſaying, what ſhall it auayle mortality, to obtaine the dominion of the world, ſo in the end he make ſhipwracke of his owne ſoule.</p>
            <p>A ſecond function of religion is polliticall, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to publike gouernment, and to contayne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in obedyence, and dew obſeruation of lawes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all antiquetyes beare witneſſe, that whoſoeuer well and wiſely haue founded cityes, ſocietyes, or common wealthes, they haue alwayes had this part of religion much reſpected: which as it nothing detracts from the maieſty of religion, ſo doth it make the ſame, to bee holden in higher reuerence, whilſt the vſe and profit thereof, extends it ſelfe in each mans eye, to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning of all humane affayres, and preſeruation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb facs="tcp:13080:121"/>
well planted ſtate. Of that firſt and excellent part, we haue no purpoſe to ſpeake, for it little appertaines to the argument in hand, wherein it ſhall iuffice thus much alone bee ſaid, that all the lyſe of euery <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> man, ought eſpecially to bee ſpent in giuing thanks, to that deuine deity, by whoſe goodneſſe we haue our ſoules illuminated, with the bryght beames of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, all cloudes of erronyous darkneſſe driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, wherewith the mindes of ſuch as are ignorant in the ſame bee hourely blinded, whereby wee may finde, how much better by infinit degrees, the condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is, rather then that of the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who miſled by the lyes of that wicked Impoſter, and following his damned poſitions, diuerting from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall path of ſaluation, are carryed headlong in theyr misbeliefe to hell torments, and euerlaſting damnation: but let the vrging of this point, be the office of deuines, and now againe to my purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Then let vs come to the poynt, which is proper to our queſtion, wherin it ſhall be nothing pertinent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any profeſſed religion, bee true or falſe, (for that as beefore is ſaid, appertaynes to the ſoules ſaluation) but where of the vvhole ſubſtance vvill cenſiſt in this, that what religion ſoeuer receyued, may be ſincerely &amp; carefully obſerued, by the ſupportacion of ſuch a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, onely kingdomes and nations, haue gathered great wealth, and attayned to great eſtimation, power, and dignity, as may be manifeſtly proued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both by forceable reaſon, and many memorable examples. For whereas it was apparant, that the chiefe and beſt meanes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large any Empire, is appropriate to the true knowledge
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13080:121"/>
of managing armes, and the glory of millitary profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which two thinges, are ſpecially reſpected, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and diſcipline, of both theſe, religion I ſay is the principall foundation, whereby it alwayes came to paſle, that euery nation aduaunced at any time to greatneſſe, haue euer beene ſtudious, and moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preſeruers of the ſame.</p>
            <p>In mayntayning which poſition omitting num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that may bee named, I will content mee with the <hi>Romaines,</hi> who farre ſurpaſſed all other people in wiſedome, as in wealth, valour, and glory.</p>
            <p>For theſe graue and true experienced men, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the conſiderations of religion, were of great force, both to beautifie their ſtate, and enlarge theyr Empire, in no one thing laboured more then the true obſeruation of the ſame, poſſeſſing theyr people ſtill with opinions of feare and reuerence towardes theyr Gods. To which alwayes ſo great beliefe was giuen, as nothing was euer executed in publike or priuate, which was not attempted, as hauing the Gods the firſt authors thereof. So as what euer of their affayres were finiſhed, what new deſignes taken in hand, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedicion put in practiſe, what fortune of war aſſayed which was not done, the Gods firſt conſulted, nor did they labour any other thing in thoſe theyr vowing and rendring vowes, dedication of Temples, obſeruation of progedies (wherein the wiſe of that age were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ceremonious) with ſacrifice and ſupplications, beſeeching the good will of the Gods, but to perſwade the people that whatſoeuer was done was all by the pleaſure &amp; permiſſion of the ſame gods, who obſeruing
<pb facs="tcp:13080:122"/>
euery action of mans life, becomes ſharpe chaſtiſers of wrong and wickedneſſe, but moſt ſeuere reuengers of theyr owne neglected or contemned deitye, whereby it came to paſſe, that amongſt thoſe <hi>Romaines,</hi> no cryme was accompted ſo haynous, as that of an oth or faith plighted &amp; broken: and of this religion how great the eſtimation was, it may perfectly appeare, by that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple onely, when as the counſell, with ſo great dilligence laboured, to diſwade them from thoſe aſſemblyes of the Tribunes, determining in the fauour of the people to propound certaine lawes, againſt which the Senate in opoſition, could giue no other let, but that the conſulls ſhould proclaime, the leading forth of the legions in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedicion, from the attendance of which warfare, whilſt the people had no power to reſiſt, neither could the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye of the Tribunes giue any redreſſe, they before hauing in that caſe ſworne their obedyence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull, and ſeeing no other meanes, how to rid them of their religious oath then by the death of the ſayd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cull, conſulted amongſt themſelues to kill him: whereof they had put the practyſe in full executyon, if it had not further beene tould them, that no religon could bee diſſolued by any contryued miſchiefe: holding murder as it ſeemed, in a leſſe degree then the violatyon of theyr faith. Which one thing, euer held their ſouldiers ſo obſeruant to the will of their commanders, to whom they had once giuen the aſſurance of the ſame, that that people which in a ſetled peace, was neuer but ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and rebellious agaynſt theyr ſuperiors, the ſame in war were euer found quiet &amp; contented, bound one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this military oath, whereof by peace alwayes they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13080:122"/>
became diſcharged. To which againe may be ſaid, ſo great was their regard, that they would prefer the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the ſame, before the preſeruacion of their owne liues: ſubmitting their heads euen to the block, if at any time according to the manner of thoſe wars the Conſull ſhould giue in command for any ſeruice not well executed, that a Capitall decimating amongſt them, ſhould be made, and by this it came to paſſe, that through the doubtfull daunger of death, both by the enemie and their commander propounded: their ſouldiours alwaies in vvarres vvere aſſured to doe the vtmoſt of their iudeuours to ouercome: choſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye valiantly fighting, then be vanquiſhed, leaſt in the feare of an incertaine death, vvhoſe perill they might perhaps auoide by bouldneſſe and reſolution, they might incure that certaine ſlaughter, from auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vvhereof, Religion cut of all hope: For vvhich cauſe, I Iudge that no vviſe man will deny mee but Religion as in euery publike deſigne, ſo eſpecially in the affaires of vvarre, is a moſt firme foundation.</p>
            <p>Now whether that this part of religion is either of the <hi>Turks</hi> or vs <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not more ſincere care and ſacred conſtancie obſerued, I rather leaue it to euery mans pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar opinion, then therin to deliuer my owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſome things I will note by the vvay: as they come into my minde. Firſt ſince that the eſpeciall parts of religion conſiſteth principally in this, that all things be referred to that ſupreme power by whoſe wil we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue euery humane action to be gouerned, it is vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how far the <hi>Turks</hi> for this point ſurpaſſe vs, hauing that opinion with ſuch firmnes ſetled in their minds &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13080:123"/>
attributing ſo much to the deuine prouidence, that ther in they ſeeme rather to exceede to much, then beleeue to little, vvhilſt neceſſarily they vvill tye vvhat euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls vs, vnto fate, by no humane counſells or prouiſion auoidable: For vvhich cauſe they ſuppoſe that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame fate a certaine limit of time is aſſigned euery mans lyfe, vvhich neither can be prolonged beyond the ſame, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any meanes of vs ſhortned, &amp; therfore vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the appointed houre of death ſhall come, of neceſſitie the ſame muſt be vndergone: in vvhich houre, vve are as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to dye, though priuately ſhut vp in any chamber &amp; deuided by all meanes from danger, as if a man vver conuerſant in the heat &amp; fury of fight, vvher a thouſand vveapons vver bent againſt his boſome, vvhich death, if not by heauen decreed, there amongſt theſe vveapons of as great ſafetie may a man aſſure himſelfe, as in his owne chamber: now this opinion though it may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, in ſo much as thus it attributeth to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of deſtinie or fate, yet to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter handled, it brings this gteat good, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> become therby more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The great part of whom doe ſo diſpute of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, as though it had no humane affaires, nor could haue anie in conſideration, being a moſt damned doctrine, &amp; vnworthie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maieſtie of heauen, for ſo with one ſtroke they vtterlie cut of all religion: For in vaine then ſhould we praie, vow, ſacrifice, or by anie other act of grace, beſech the goodneſſe of almightie God, craue his aſſiſtance, or deſire he ſhuld behold vs in mercy, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vve are aſſured before hand, that none of all theſe he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or can regard: which impediment is bereaued the <hi>Turkes</hi> whilſt they are quite forbidden the ſtudie of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> (though I am not ignorant how that wicked ſeducer <hi>Mahomet,</hi> had therin a further meaning: <hi>viz:</hi> leaſt by the knowledge therof, the great vanitie &amp; ſmal grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the promulgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his lawes might apeare,) ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath this ignorance proued profitable to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> for the maintenance of their opinion in Religion. But whether the ſtudie of <hi>Philoſophie</hi> bringeth more good or hurt it is not my purpoſe here to diſpute, reſeruing it for a longer argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; more oportune time &amp; place. Now this opinion thus planted in the mindes of the <hi>Turks,</hi> makes them fearful of the deuine maieſtie, and inflames the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d regard of religion: By which it comes to paſſe, that though this their ſeruing of God be full of error, yet ſhall wee finde euery where many excellent ſignes of their blynd deuoſion, commending their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſame: For none the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they doth with greater reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce repaire to their temples, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate with al humility, crauing pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſins by the
<pb facs="tcp:13080:124"/>
aſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, holding all holy things in high veneration, wherein omitting other, they ſo much reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, not onely theyr owne Prieſtes, and religions, but euen thoſe of ours, as they accounted it in the higheſt degree of ſin, to iniury any one of them any way, which hath ben approued by infinit examples of pirates, of whom a number (as often it hath fallen out) hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any Prieſt of ours, haue preſently ſet him at liberty, leaſt by retayning the ſeruant of God, they might ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by importune the ſame God to reuenge his wrong.</p>
            <p>Another thing to their great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation is, that none then they more carefully looke to the conſeruation of their lawes, none puniſhing the publike breach thereof in whoſoeuer, more ſeuerely. For which there is neuer heard with them, any blaſphemy agaynſt God, any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultryes committed, or ought elſe wherin ther is offence, either in the violation or negligent obſeruation of the ſame. And yet for all this, I am not Ignorant that by the ſame impious &amp; execrable law, more haynous ſins are permitted, but that it may appeare, how ſtrickt euen the mightieſt are in preſeruing their ſaide lawes, wee haue in this age a memorable preſident teſtyfied in the perſon of the great Emperour <hi>Solyman,</hi> which I will heere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. This <hi>Solyman</hi> amongſt thoſe number of excellent choſen women, who are kept ſpecially for the kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines (for it is permitted by the law of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> that euery <hi>Turke</hi> may hould ſo many concubynes as he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mayntayne,) calling one among the reſt more often then any other, &amp; ſhe perceyuing therby, how the Emperour was mightely poſſeſt with hir loue, by a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning drift ſo much effected with him, as ſhee obteyned
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13080:124"/>
hir freedome, (for it is to be noted, that as well boyes as girles, ſo ſhut vp in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> are his ſlaues,) after which beeing by Coatch ſent for as at other times to come &amp; accompany the ſaid Emperour, made anſwere, how ſhe much admired, what reaſon the great <hi>Signeor</hi> had, who beeing a prince of ſo much maieſtie doubted nothing publikely, to enfringe the holy law of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> by which it was prouided in playne words, that no man in ſuch ſort ſhould accompany free women, &amp; therby ſo grieuouſly to offend, euen in the view of his people, whoſe eyes were all caſt vpon him. Now the Emperour much moued with this anſwere, as likewiſe brideling for the preſent the heate of his deſire, demanded the next day, of the learned in theyr lawes, whether by law it might be admitted any man to keepe free women, for theyr concubines, whervnto when he had receaued an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that it was not lawfull, and not enduring the want of that wench, whom he loued entitely, the ſayd <hi>Solyman</hi> for that reaſon married hir. Now I neede not on the contrary part to recount, how <hi>Chriſtions</hi> carry themſelues in the like caſes, leaſt I further exulcerate thoſe wounds by handling, which I am ſure by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing will not be cured.</p>
            <p>The next place to religion, whether eſtabling any common wealth, or inlarging a dominion, is worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed to diſcipline, wherein beetwixt vs and the <hi>Turkes,</hi> the very truth is, in my opinion, that there is admitted no compariſon, whilſt diſcipline is a thing with them of high eſtimation, but with vs of little or no account, &amp; that this is ſo, it appeares cleerely in this that euery yeere the great Emperour at certaine ſeaſons
<pb facs="tcp:13080:125"/>
ſends his inquiſitors abroad through all parts of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, to make election of the choiſe children to be found of an aſſigned age, which inquiſitors where they come, calling together all the ſayd children of the ſame place, ſelect from amongſt them, ſuch whoſe toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inclination ſheweth itſelfe, either by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the members, or countenaunce fit for their purpoſe, thoſe they take, whom bringing to the court, there by eſpeciall maiſters prouided, be they inſtructed in all manner of martiall diſcipline, by which &amp; through much exerciſe, their bodies and mindes are confirmed to endure euery labour, nor is there any one entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their warfare, but ſuch as by much exerciſe are invred to this diſcipline: whereas on the other ſide it is hourely ſeene, that our armyes for the moſt part, doe ſtand of men, both rude and vnexperienced in all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall demeanours or diſcipline.</p>
            <p>This aboue named diſcipline, hath in it a triple vſe, wherof the firſt is the true knowledge of things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to the warres, this drawing with it an inabling of the bodies forces: by which it falles out, as we haue often ſeene theyr ſtrength approued, that an arrow ſhot from a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> bow, hath clouen the ſhanke of a gallie oare, where the wood hath beene nine inches thicke, ſo as the head of the ſame arrow, hath ſhewed it ſelfe on the other ſide: whereas ſuch ſouldiours as wee put in pay, without conſideration, are choſen in companies ignorant of all things appertayning, &amp; then for the moſt part learning the vſe, and art of theyr weapons, when there is more need valyantly to manage them.</p>
            <p>Another commoditie of diſcipline is, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13080:125"/>
the bodye to the enduring of labour and wants, inables the minde to an inuincible reſolution, in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all extremities, which miſery, or the ſcarcity of things, may caſt vpon man.</p>
            <p>For theyr mindes accuſtomed to continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, cannot bee daunted with paynes, ſpare diet, or other inconueniences, wherwith it is daily acquaynted, content conſiſting, not in many, but neceſſary things: ſo as wee ſee theyr great armyes long time, often kept together with ſmall prouiſion, theyr fleetes and land preparations, executing aught with exceeding expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon, whilſt a huge part of baggage, ordenarily (attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other campes) giues to them no let.</p>
            <p>Whereas both our land and ſea forces, are ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combred, with loadings of houſhould prouiſion, our ſouldyours euer faynting without the affluence of euery thing, theyr bodyes impatient of labour, and this not onely when they want not things neceſſary, but if they abound not with delycates, ſo as to our ſhame bee it ſpoken, a man may obſerue in our campes, thoſe exceſſes of feaſtings and needeleſſe fare, which euen in the plentifulneſſe of peace, myght in Cities perhaps ſeeme riotus, where amongſt other things ill beſeeming, it irkes me to thinke, that men ſhould bee brought to ſo much niceneſle, as in a fleet, to haue Snow carryed, for cooling their wine.</p>
            <p>The third vſe of diſcipline is the profit of obedience, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which there is no one greater vertue in the exerciſe of armes. This as it is with the <hi>Turks</hi> more in eſtimation then euer in any age the like hath ben ſeene with other nations. So of all people in the contrary heereof wee
<pb facs="tcp:13080:126"/>
are deſperately diſeaſed, euen to the death, our ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors being mutinous, factious, diſobedient, who faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by no rules of diſcipline, conteined in dutie, by no regard o puniſhment, in their owne camps, themſelues to themſelues for the moſt part work more miſchieſe, then vvhat at any time they receaue from the weapons of the enemie: vvhich foule faults to our greater ſhame, is as common to the captaines &amp; commanders, as the priuate ſouldiours, a number of whom ſtudyeng their perticuler reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, their priuate ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or (then which vvith men of vvar there is naught more odious) their ſeruyle gayne, betray their countrie, neglect their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces command, and vvithout executing aught vvorthie their truſt and imployment, cauſe often Impediments through malitious enuie of a nothers glory, to vvhat ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer might be worthely executed: Such things I ſaie, vvith vs, men dare dayly do, freed from feare of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo as I cannot name a place in ſhame or diſhonor baſer, vvhether theſe or the like vvith euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Infamie, haue not brought vs.</p>
            <p>Next now enſues that I ſpeake of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> valor and vertues, no meane cauſes or of ſmall regard in the inlarging of any Empire, vvherein if I ſhould affirme that they doe much excell vs, I might ſo both become iniurious to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> name, and procure my ſelfe more enuie then I affect. Yet truth is truth, by vvhom foeuer deliuered, and well I may ſay that true valour is vvith the <hi>Turkes</hi> of more accompt vvhen to the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant alone the paſſage to all militarie promotions is layd open, vvhere any ones merit towards his countrie by any manly act performed, ſhall aduance him through
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13080:126"/>
all degrees of dignitie, euen to that vvhich is next the higheſt with vs, on the contrary Nobility being of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reconing, ſuch for the moſt part euery vvhere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, who though they ſhew ſmal or no teſtimonie either of valor or vertue, yet ſupported by the greatnes of their blood, manage matters as they liſt. This being that one thing which ſo much hath exaſperated y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minds of many worthy <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſeruitors, that flying fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe enſignes wher they found no place for their vertue: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who for their good parts fairely intreat them, &amp; according to the proofe any one makes of his vvorth, doth ſo prefer him to euery roome of Honor: their condicion in that point being exceding commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, vvho demand not vvhence the man is, but vvhat he is, neither holding that vertue and valor are guiſts of granfathers inheritance, like to riches &amp; thoſe other of Fortune. Yet for all this, I muſt not deny but that nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ought much to be eſtemed, being in it ſelfe of great might to ſtir vp the minde to honorable actions: and a rich ornament to all ſuch as haue vertue thervnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined. But barely to prefer nobility before valor &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or for any mans gentry ſolly to commend him to the greateſt functions in a common wealth, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d an army, that vtterly I diſalow, as full of danger to any ſtate: I highly reuerence the kinred of kings &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whom to haue placed in great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, is not alone without peril, but profitable. For if authoritie be of eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in all humane affaires, in thoſe of the wars eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it is a moſt material point, wherin the Soule and lyfe of good gouerning, chiefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth: as hauing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alwaies attendant, no one thing more furthering,
<pb facs="tcp:13080:127"/>
as I haue ſaid euery warlike deſigne; &amp; therfore to ſuch all ſouldiors &amp; captaines without repining, ſubmit their greatneſſe, not being ſubiect to enuie &amp; miſreports, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom euery man forceth himſelfe for the formoſt, becauſe the teſtimonie of their valor &amp; vertue ſhewen in their princes preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cannot be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed by the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations of any backbiter, whereby as often it happens, men doe diſpaire of a due reward. In theſe things ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would thus be vnderſtod, that wher ther wants a due mixture of their parts together, compounded: it is better in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit by the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> preſident to prefer in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand a man endwed with vertue lacking thoſe exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior badges of great blood, then that any ſupported by nobilitie, ſhould bear ſway Indigent of thoſe perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which at firſt begot all true Nobilitie.</p>

ſocietie &amp; the ſtudies of peace, which vvith ſo infinit a deſire we hunt after, as all charge, all expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time, &amp; mony, all care &amp; dilligence is held both light &amp; litle, for obteining the ſame. And this appeareth firſt by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great numbers of Prieſts, Mounks, Freers, &amp; other religious, poſſeſſing great power, &amp; wealth, with large lands, and ſtately erected monaſteries, wherwith the plentiſul cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Europe,</hi> are euery vvhere peſtered: to vvhom a great part both of <hi>Chriſtendomes</hi> reuenues &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities be comd. This I doe not diſalow but much commend the pietie &amp; wiſedome of our anceſtors, who haue bene ſo bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiful in beſtowing to holy vſes, ſo liberal towards the maintenance of Gods ſeruice, releueing the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the poore, and both nouriſhing &amp; cheriſhing the ſtudies of Arts &amp; euery good literature. Another thing with vs is, that our ſeates of Iuſtice prolong the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of cauſes, with many quiddetyes, &amp; delayes, which is the ſole reaſon that we ſee ſo many lawiers &amp; Iudges, ſo many attorneys, ſolicitors, clarks, notaries, aduocates &amp; proctors, to whom ſo great rewards &amp; large fees are aſſigned, as this practiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law (lyke to that other) hath drawen with it no litle part of the welth of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Againe, the Scholes of good learning are by vs vvith great charge mainteined, to which many repaire, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the accompt that learned men daily liue in, doe ſpend either all, or the greateſt part of their life in that profeſſion. Laſtly (good god) what coſt is beſtowed in euery handi craft thing, what huge foundations hourly laid, what ſtate &amp; abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of publike &amp; priuate build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, what ſuperfluety in enſignes of honor, picturs, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp; plate, what delicacy in euery houſhold prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:

What riot in feaſtings: what pride &amp; expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in apparell: vvith how great ſtipends are the maſters in theſe Artes maintained, all which as they greatly beutifie our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> countries, maligne the <hi>Turks</hi> in regard of vs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare rude &amp; vnpoliſht: ſo are they vtterly ill fitting for martiall affaires, or enlarging of an Empire, vvhilſt they conſume &amp; waſt a great part of that wealth which were better beſtowed in the wars.</p>
            <p>Now vvith the <hi>Turkes</hi> all theſe things are in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ether ſmall or none. Their Preiſts &amp; Religious are very few, their lyuing litle, ſupplyed with things onely neceſſary. Their law determinations want demurs, and delatory plees receauing ſentence at the firſt or ſecond hearing; vvithout toſſing ſo many volumes of the ciuill &amp; <hi>Canon Codices;</hi> with their comments: ſo many yeere bookes of the common lawes courſe, wherby ſo great ſtore of counſells &amp; aduocates, ſuch quantitie of clarks and notaries are in ſmall requeſt.</p>
            <p>Ther is amongſt them no orders of Monks &amp; Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, no Pyles of ſtately builded Palaces; no ſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their dayly port, but thrifty cariage, ſpare dyet, vvherein the hands of cunning cookes haue no med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: the <hi>Turkes</hi> neither caring or crauing theſe things, but ſpending vvhat they haue in theyr needfull prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the vvars, vvhere vvealth and rewards are peculiarly appropriate to the valiant.

Againe it is well knowen, that many great commanders ther are, who caſting away their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate counſels &amp; conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, prefer the publike good: yet euen theſe haue ſuch for inferiour leaders, who are no leſſe, (if not more) faulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the ordinary ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: the greater part of whom follow the ſeruice for gaine, and make a traficke of the warres. Who when a muſter of men is to paſſe, and pay to bee made, beelie their number, either borrowing, or ſubborning baſe fellowes, to fill vp ſuch roomes as are fayling, whereby it fals out that the payes bee euer ſtrong, but the companies weake.</p>
            <p>Now none of all theſe defaults bee conuerſant in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> campe, where the ſouldiour is euer ſeruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and at commaund, executing what they haue in charge carefully, reſeruing their heat of courage to encounter the enemy, which with high reſolution they both vndertake and maintayne: nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, with a firſt ouerthrow, nor diſcouraged with the enemies ſecond good ſucceſſe, whereby to leaue the field, but valiauntly fighting conteyned, more by the force of their lawes, &amp; the puniſhment therof, then by feare of the enemy, keepe theyr aſſigned ranckes, expecting the beſt, and enduring the vtmoſt of good or bad fortunes chances, who alwaies bearing in mind, the fearefull ſpectacles of thoſe theyr barbarous chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ther may be cauſed, etermine either to depart

the field as victors, or if fortune enuie theyr valour, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there to receiue an honeſt death, from the edge of the enemies weapon, then at home to be ſtrangled, or haue his throat cut, by a hangman. Againe whilſt the valour, of the leader ſtriues with the obedience of the ſouldyour, who neuer haue their priuate counſels, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from the publike good, we find them to performe moſt excellent offices: in theyr ſeuerall places both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their king and country.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch obſeruations (true honoured <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) as formerly I ſayde, haue long poſſeſt my minde, touching the greatneſſe of this <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, which if you allow, I ſhall the better like, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, conceale them to your ſelfe I pray, leaſt they may chance into ſuch mens hands, as may detract from the eſtimation of my iudgement.</p>
