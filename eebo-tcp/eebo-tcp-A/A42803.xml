            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My profeſſion hath taught me, that from the higheſt
Judge there lies no writ of Error, no appeale; what
then? remaines, but that I firſt beſeech Almighty
God the Authour and finiſher of all good works, to
enable me to diſcharge honeſtly &amp; effectually ſo great

to acknowledge your Majeſties favour. Some enemies
I might feare, the common enemie of ſuch ſervices, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> is ſtill attendant on your Royall ſtyle; A

from his Crowne, nor can any danger reſult
thereby to ſubjects liberties, ſo long as both admit the
temperament of law and Juſtice, ſpecially under ſuch
a Prince, who to your immortall Honour hath publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
this to the whole world for your maxime, that
the peoples liberties ſtrengthens the Kings Prerogative,
and the Kings Prerogative is to defend the peoples li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
Apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</p>
            <p>Kings as Kings are never ſaid to erre, onely the beſt
may bee abuſed by miſinformation; this the higheſt
point of Prerogative that the King can doe no wrong;
if then by the ſubtilty of miſinformers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the ſpecious
falſe pretences of publique good, by a running and
cloſe contrivance of their waies to ſeduce the Sacred
Royall Perſon, it bee ſurprized and over wrought to
command contrary to law, and be executed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
this commands will be void &amp; theſe King innocent

the colour of a void command, made void by juſt

            <p>Touching juſtice, there is not a more certaine ſigne
of an upright Judge, then by his patience to bee well
informed before ſentence given, and I may boldly ſay,
all the Judges in your Kingdome may take example by
your Majeſtie, and learne their duties by your practiſe,
my ſelfe have often beene a witneſſe thereof to my no
little admiration.</p>
            <p>From your patience, pleaſe you give mee leave to
preſſe to your righteous judgement, and exemplifie it
but in one inſtance. When your Lords and people in
your laſt Parliament preſented your Majeſtie a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning their rights and liberties, the Petition
being of no ſmall weight, your Majeſtie after mature
deliberation, in few but moſt effectuall words; (<hi>ſoit

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96527:4"/>
renowne you for juſt Judgement to all poſterity.</p>
            <p>Let us hartily pray that this Parliament may bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the advancement of Sacred Religion, and to
that end that the moſt Reverend Prelates, ſitting on
the right hand of your Kingly ſide, bee moſt forward
therein, to whom it is moſt proper.</p>
            <p>That the Nobles girt with their ſwords in their
creation, and moſt eſpecially rewarded and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

renowned Acts of their Anceſtors, whoſe lands
and honours they inherite, and how renowned this
Land hath beene through the whole World for
Art and Armes, and labour to reſtore it to its
ancient ſplendor: The beſt way to preſerve peace,
is to bee well fitted for War.</p>
            <p>But were this Nation never ſo valiant or weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
if unity bee not among us what good will riches
doe us, or your Majeſtie but inrich the conquerour, he
that commands all hearts by love, hee onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
aſſuredly; greatneſſe without goodneſſe can
at beſt but commmand bodies.</p>
            <p>It ſhall therefore bee my harty prayer, That ſuch a
knot of love may be knit betwixt the Head and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that like Gordius knot it never bee looſed: That
all Jeſuited forraigne ſtates who looke a ſquint upon
our Hieruſalem may ſee themſelves defeated of all
there ſubtill plots and combinations of all their wicked
hopes and expectations to render us, if their miſchiefe
might take effect, a people in conſiderable at home, and
contemptible abroad.</p>
            <p>Religion hath taught us (<hi>Si Deus nobiſcum quis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranos,</hi>)
and experience I truſt will teach us (<hi>Si ſumus
