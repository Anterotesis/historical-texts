            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a memorable ſaying of an ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Moralist, <hi>Curae leves loquuntur, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
ſtupent:</hi> And the like may be ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſorrowes; when they come once to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the heart, they stupifie it, and obstruct thoſe
paſſages, by which it ſhould eaſe it ſelfe of them.
This hath been our particular caſe: Our being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of our livelyhoods (for how ſmall a Trifle
this enſuing Remonſtrance will manifest) hath filled
our hearts with ſorrow: But when wee conſidered,
not onely the hand from whence this oppreſſion co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
(even that which pretexdeth to the infallible
weild of the Sword of Juſtice) but withall that
through our ſides ſuch a fatall ſtroke is given to one
of the moſt famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities of Chriſtendome:
this ſad proſpect did ſo farre ſurcharge us with griefe,
that it caſt us for a long time into a fit of Muſing,
till at last (the fire being kindled) we ſpake with our
tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100541:3"/>
And now that the ſtring of our tongue is untyed,
our earneſt deſire is, that none of theſe its ſorrowfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
may be miſ-interpreted by any. And to that
end wee have prefixed this advertiſement, to prevent
three miſtakes, which are all we can poſſibly imagine the
malice of our greatest enemies can any way phancy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this our Remonstrance.</p>
            <p>I. The firſt is, That perhaps it may be groundleſſe,
becauſe we have not therein ſet down the expreſſe words,
either of thoſe Protections by which we might ſecurely
have expected an Indempnity, or of thoſe Orders by
which we ſuffered.</p>
            <p>To which wee anſwer, That the reaſon hereof was
partly to avoid tediouſneſſe, and therefore we gave
onely ſome ſhort hints in the margent. And partly
becauſe (being diſperſed) wee could not poſſibly have
the true Copies of all of them by us. And to publiſh
any thing that was but ſuppoſititious, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with our conſtant endeavour ſtill to maintaine
the truth, notwithſtanding whatſoever difficulties
to the contrary. But yet (to prevent all miſtakes as
neere as we can) wee have here inſerted the true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of ſuch as wee had by us: whereby the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader will not onely gueſſe at the reſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
eaſily imagine what rigour and malice there was
uſed in the execution of them, which we aſſure him
are as much (or more) then he can poſſibly phancie.
For they being to deale with an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, which
then had a reverend esteeme over the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:100541:3"/>
muſt counterfeit <hi>Jacobs</hi> voice as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he could in their Orders, though their hands were
farre rougher then <hi>Eſaus</hi> in the execution of them. And
accordingly (though now it is too apparent it was but
onely in mockery) we had ſent us theſe two following
Protections.</p>

            <p>This Warrant was iſſued out the more ſuddenly, and
proſecuted the more violently, in regard that our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections
were then in procuring: But the rigorous
proſecution of this, made thoſe to be of little or no
uſe, more then the name, unleſſe it was to ſhut the
Stable doore after the Steed was stolne. For under
pretence of <hi>Papiſts, Malignants,</hi> &amp;c. there was
ſcarce a Scholar in all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity which eſcaped
examination: And left our Colledge-Chappels, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries,
or Treaſuries, or even the privateſt Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net

ſhould (perchance) have been converted into Stables
for <hi>Horſes,</hi> or Magazines for <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,</hi>
they ſearched them all ſo ſtrictly, and
plandered them all ſo throughly, that nothing which
they liked eſcaped their fingers, our ancient Coynes not
excepted.</p>
            <p>When wee had ſeen their unparallel'd rigour here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and how wee were ſleighted when wee admitted our
juſt Complaints against it, wee did not much regard
whether they had any Commiſſion or not for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they did to us afterward. But like Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

take us downe and fit us for the great stroke, when
they ſhould pleaſe to lay it upon us. And therefore

            <p>This, wee hope, will ſatisfie the indifferent Reader
concerning the truth and ground of our Sufferings.</p>
            <p>II. But lest a ſecond mistake ſhould ariſe, That
(ſuppoſing them to be true, yet) they are not (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
ſo great as we pretend, becauſe that for the
moſt part wee have given but a ſleight glance at
them; wee held it very requiſite to give this further
Advertiſement:</p>
            <p>1. That in matters of this nature, a man ought
not to macerate his ſoule too much by reflecting on
his owne miſery, lest the devill thereby get an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
upon him, to tempt him to a melancholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.
2. Though wee deſire hereby to move every
compaſſionate Chriſtian to a fellow-feeling of our
miſeries; yet have wee endeavoured (as much as we
could) to forbeare the long inſisting upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
leſt wee ſhould offend his eares instead of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his compaſſion. For as in Muſique the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of a diſcord may be omitted, if it be not too
long produced; ſo have wee ſtudied to temper theſe
harſh notes to the tender eare of the Chriſtian Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,
<pb facs="tcp:100541:6"/>
by making a ſpeedy tranſition from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.
3. We had ſo many matters of complaint,
(and might have had many more, if wee had been
all together to conferre our ſufferings) that this
ſmall remonstrance would have ſwelled to (an
<hi>lliada malorum)</hi> a just Volumne, if we had not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
endeavoured to compriſe an <hi>Ilias in a Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell,</hi>
by instancing onely in ſome, and reducing
thoſe to as ſmall a modell as posſibly we could. And
to this end alſo wee have uſed as much plainneſſe of
ſpeech in our expresſions, as ingeniouſneſſe of the
truth of the thing it ſelfe. And indeed if wee ſhould
but a little have indulged our penne the liberty of a
Rhetoricall flouriſh, wee ſhould thereby have made
our ſufferings (which in themſelves are almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
beliefe) to have ſeemed altogether incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>III. But our greateſt aur laſt feare is, leaſt the
intollerable weight of thoſe heavy preſſures under
which wee have ſo long groaned, have (perhaps) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from us ſome expresſions which may not ſeem
altogether to become perſecuted Chriſtians. And
in this we ſubmit our ſelves wholly to the candour of
the charitable Reader, deſiring him to interpret all
things in the beſt ſenſe. For though wee have uſed
our endeavours to avoid all manner of expresſions
which might ſeeme to ſavour of malice, yet carrying
about us thoſe pasſions which accompany fleſh and
blood, it is imposſible but wee ſhould ſomtimes ſlip.
<pb facs="tcp:100541:6"/>
Wee know very well, and acknowledge, that Prayers
and teares are the onely defenſive weapons of a
Chrſtian againſt perſecutions: And if any thing,
which is not fully confonant hereunto, hath paſſed
from our pen, wee deſire it may be imputed to out
many infirmities; ſeeing we are ſtill ready to pray for
our Perſecutors, that God would open their eyes, that
they may yet ſee and repent of thoſe many and great
wrongs which they have done to him, his true Religion
and Service, to his Annointed our gracious Soveraigne,
as alſo to us in particular, and other their fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Which if it would pleaſe him to grant unto them,
wee might quickly recover the temporall peace of this
diſtracted Kingdome; and they the poſſibility of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
everlaſting peace in the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>

The Univerſities Complaint.</head>
            <p>THough an Apology for our long ſilence might
better become us then any other forme of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing,
yet were there ſome that thought it better
to fit downe in the ſhade of coole patience, and
ſweeten the ſad proſpect of our owne miſeries, by
reflecting on the great publike woes of this Kingdome, then
incurre the ſuſpicion of querelous natures, ſuch as are apt to
cry out onely at the imagination of being hurt. But ſeeing
our miſeries are reall, and our ſufferings not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt us, as againſt that famous Univerſity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by right, wee are ſtill actuall members; And that the
adverſe party, hath hitherto made ſo much advantage of
our tameneſſe, as to ſteal away our livelyhood from us, and
conceale the Theft: though our owne Mothers mouth be
ſtopped, by violently ſeizing her preſſe, and thereby not
ſuffered to ſpeake, but (like <hi>Apollo's</hi> Statue of old) juſt as
the evill ſpirit ſpeakes in her, which at this time utters
little elſe but diſloyalty and Rebellion: yet ſeeing it hath
pleaſed the hand of providence to give us this happy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
freely to bewaile our owne miſeries; We are at
length reſolved to doe Juſtice to theſe Mens iniquity and
our owne innocence, that our Fellow-Subjects may know,
(and if they leave ſo much learning as to ſpeak in another
language, the whole world may hereafter underſtand) how,
and by what A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s the <hi>Knipperdullings</hi> of this Age (who

thinke ſhortly to make themſelves Kings of this <hi>Sion)</hi> have
reduced a glorious and renowned Univerſity, almoſt to a

yeers, then the Apoſtate <hi>Julian</hi> could effect in all his raigne,
<hi>viz.</hi> broken the heart-ſtrings of Learning and Learned men,
and thereby luxated all the joynts of Chriſtianity in this
Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The particulars whereof, and the barbarous courſes taken
to bring theſe deſignes to effect, as we ſhall truly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
ſet them downe, ſo we feare not to appeale to any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
Judge, whether if the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> or even
the Turks themſelves, had over-run this Nation, they would
more inhumanely have abuſed a flouriſhing Univerſity, then
theſe pretended advancers of Religion and Learning have
done; it being a conſtant cuſtome (if not alſo the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
in the fierceſt encounters of the moſt enraged parties,
to exempt and priviledge Scholars from, if not protect them
by their Martiall proceedings.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore with the firſt occaſion, (as wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
from whence they pretended any cauſe of this rage and
perſecution againſt us, (though the meere conſcience of ſo
ſenſleſſe a Rebellion cryed up onely by the illiterate herd,
might afford reaſon enough for them to look aſquint upon
all Scholars <hi>quâ tales)</hi> The contribution of a ſmall pittance
of money to our Soveraignes extream neceſſity before any
Warre was thought on by us, is made to be our impardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
crime, (though not then prohibited by any Order or
Ordinance) which (added to the tenderneſſe of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in refuſing their wicked conſederacie, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Covenant)</hi> by the help of their Legiſlative engine, has
bereaved us of all, and caſt us from our livelyhoods, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

            <p>For when His Sacred Majeſty (whom they made to be
the firſt Grand Delinquent, and whoſe Crowne-Revenues
and Eſtate, together with His Townes, Ships, and Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines,
they ſequeſtred and ſeized on) daigned (by His
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100541:8"/>
Royall Letters to acquaint his poore Univerſity with his
ſtrange wants, even of ſuſtenance for his very houſhold:
Our hearts burned within us, to heare our living Founder,
whom we expected to be made (by that time) <hi>a great and
glorious King,</hi> (as was promiſed him) ſhould almoſt ſtarve
while we had bread on our Table. Whereupon out of our
poverty, a ſmall and inconſiderable ſumme of money was
collected and tendered, as a Teſtimony not onely of our
Loyalty to him as King, or of our gratitude as our moſt
gracious and bountifull Protector and Benefactor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of our Charity to him as a Chriſtian, then in extreame
want and neceſſity. Wee hope our Perſecutors will pardon
us this expreſſion, ſeeing our <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> may with leſſe
danger of Treaſon abſtract <hi>Charles</hi> from <hi>King,</hi> then their
bullets; And this was the firſt flower out of which they
ſuckt all that venome which ſhortly after they diſgorged
upon us.</p>
            <p>Hereupon His Sacred Majeſty (knowing well how
eager that partie was in revenging the leaſt ſeeming provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and being informed of that Cloud which was then
hanging over us and ours, for that action of Humanity, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and Chriſtianity) out of His care and tenderneſſe,
proffered to ſecure our Colledge plate (if wee were content
to depoſit it in his hands) which their intended Revenge,
had already ſwallowed without any Grace, ſo much as of
the <hi>Publick Faith:</hi> and therefore wrot his moſt gracious
Letters to us to take an exact ſurvey of it, not only for the
weight, but alſo of the forme of every piece, together with
the Names, Armes, and Mottoes of the reſpective Donors,
that if (perhaps) his Majeſty could not preſerve it intire as
it was, he might reſtore it hereafter in the ſame weight and
forme, and with the ſame markes: All which he graciouſly
inſured upon his Royall word.</p>
            <p>It behoved not us to refuſe protection from that hand
to which God (for that end) had entruſted a Scepter,
eſpecially conſidering the concurrence of Actions about
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100541:9"/>
that time. It is not unknowne to moſt part of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that not long before this, the zealous Brethren of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Suffolke</hi> had packt themſelves together in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
rout, to give the firſt Eſſay of a Popular Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
How happily this work did thrive in their hands,
has been already publiſhed to the Kingdome, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of the two magnificent houſes of the Counteſſe <hi>Rivers</hi>
(with many other gentlemens houſes of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
are ſtill diſmal I witneſſes.<note place="margin">Vid. Mercur.</note> So that (having
found the ſweat of their labours) the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
would in all likelyhood have proſecuted
the <hi>great work</hi> as farre as <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ruſtic. 2.</note> for a leſſe prize then our
Univerſity plate, (thanks be to God and our good Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.)
And we had good reaſon to fear the increaſe of their
Army, if they had come neer us, ſeeing the inferiour part of
the Town had provided Arms, and yet had no Commanders;
and ſome that durſt diſcharge a Muſquet, made it their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
to terrifie us, and diſturb our ſtudies by ſhooting in at
our windows.<note place="margin">This particular appeareth by a paper delivered into the Regiſters Office, under the hands (if not alſo upon the Oathes) of Maſter <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Terne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Walker,</hi> both of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge, who had Muſquets ſeverall times diſcharged in at their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, as alſo divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> And therefore leſt
our Plate ſhould become a bait
to have our Libraries rifled, our
Colledges pulled down, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
our throats cut, we thought
it our wiſeſt courſe to ſecure all,
by ſecuring that in His Majeſties
gracious hands.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe reaſons (which no
judicious man will eſteem other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then weighty) we endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to convey away ſome part of
our Plate about the beginning of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1642. (which by the way
was before either His Majeſties Standard was erected, or
His Proclamation iſſued out to that end: However many of
us, and others have ſuffered for it, as fomenters of this
Warre.) But within a few dayes after, (ſee how the juſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100541:9"/>
grounds of our feares concentrated) one Maſter <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
Burgeſſe for the Towne of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and then newly
turn'd a Man of Warre, was ſent downe by his Maſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
at the invitation of his Maſters below, (as himſelfe
confeſſed) to gather what ſtrength hee could to ſtop all
paſſages that no Plate might be ſent: But his deſignes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fruſtrated, and his opinion as of an active ſubtile man,
thereby ſomewhat ſhaken and endangered, hee hath ever
ſince bent himſelfe to worke what revenge and miſchiefe
he could againſt us. In purſuit whereof, before that month
was expired, downe he comes againe in a terrible manner
with what Forces he could draw together, and ſurrounds
divers Colledges, while we were at our devotion in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Chappels, taking away Priſoners, ſeverall Doctors of
Divinity, Heads of Colledges, <hi>viz. D. Beale</hi> Maſter of <hi>S.
John's</hi> Colledge, D. <hi>Martin</hi> Maſter of Queens Col. and D.
<hi>Sterne</hi> Maſter of Jeſus Col. men of ſuch eminent worth and
abilities, as render them above the reach of our commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and theſe he carryes with him to London in triumph:
And though there was an expreſſe Order from the <hi>Lords</hi>
Houſe for their impriſonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which met them
at <hi>Tottenham-High croſſe,</hi> (wherein notwithſtanding there
was no Crime expreſſed) yet were they led captive through
<hi>Bartholomew Faire,</hi> and ſo as farre as <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and back
through the City to priſon in the <hi>Tower,</hi> on purpoſe that they
might be houted at, or ſtoned by the rabble-rout.</p>
            <p>Since which time, now above three yeares together they
have been hurried up and downe from one priſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at exceſſive and unreaſonable charges, and fees exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from them, farre beyond their abilities to defray, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all their goods plundered, and their Maſterſhips and
Livings taken from them, which ſhould preſerve them
from famiſhing. And though in all this time there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any accuſation brought, much leſſe proved againſt any
of them; yet have they ſuffered intolerable impriſonment
over ſince, both by Land and Water, eſpecially that in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100541:10"/>
the Ship, where for ten dayes together, they (with many
other Gentlemen of great rank) were kept under deck,
without liberty to come to breath in the common aire,
or to eaſe nature, except at the courteſie of the rude Saylors,
which oftentimes was denyed them. In which condition,
they were more like <hi>Gally-ſlaves,</hi> then free-borne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and men of ſuch quality and condition; and had been
ſo indeed, might ſome have had their wills, who were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
with the Merchants to
ſell them to <hi>Argiers,</hi>

place, as hath been ſince notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
knowne upon no falſe or
fraudulent information.</p>
            <p>And now that we are mentioning our Reverend and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Heads of Houſes, we may not omit, what our long exile
from the ſaid Univerſity will not ſuffer us otherwiſe then by
certaine Report to be apprehenſive of: Namely, that a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great number of them are ſince in the ſame condition
with us, that is, deprived of all, and baniſhed: Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
the Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Biſhop
of <hi>Exeter,</hi> againſt whom their malice could invent no more
then that he was a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> nor pretend any thing, but that,
being Vice-chancellour, hee did according to his office
preach a learned and pious Sermon in Saint <hi>Maries, March</hi>
27. 1645. being the day of His Majeſties moſt happy inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration.
To whom wee may adde that moſt reverend and
learned man, Doctor <hi>Collins,</hi> His Majeſties Profeſſor of
Divinity, whoſe extraordinary worth and paines had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
him in that place almoſt thirty yeares, and made his
name famous, and his perſon deſirable in every Proteſtant
Univerſity in Chriſtendome: And yet his Loyaltie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
cauſed our new pretended Reformers to think him
unworthy ſo much as of a Countrey Cure, (for they ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
likewiſe both his Livings) though ſince, as wee heare,
they have reſtored him to his Profeſſors place, which none
of them are able to diſcharge, and he living in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100541:10"/>
durſt not deny. Thus likewiſe have Doctor <hi>Comber,</hi>
D. <hi>Pask,</hi> D. <hi>Coſin,</hi> and D. <hi>Lany,</hi> been deprived of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Maſterſhips and Livings, and ſome of them alſo
plundered of their goods, though all of them be very
eminent for their Learning, Prudence, Judgement and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
among all that know them, and have no prejudice of
them. And for concluſion (as the epitome of all) wee adde
D. <hi>Holdſworth,</hi> whoſe univerſall approbation put him up-the
troubleſome office of Vice-chancellour-ſhip for three
yeares together in the beginning of theſe troubles; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Trienniall office was expired, his perſon was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon and impriſoned, firſt in <hi>Ely-houſe,</hi> then (becauſe
they thought that was not expenſive enough, though they
had plundered him of all) they thruſt him into the
<hi>Tower</hi> onely for his Loyaltie in ſeeing His Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
executed for the printing of ſuch Declarations at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> as were formerly printed at <hi>York;</hi> which though
the Committees before which he appeared have alwaies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt him as <hi>Licenſing</hi> the Kings Books, yet hath hee
ever denyed it, (for the manner, though not for the matter)
proſeſſing himſelfe before them, not to be ſo ſawcy as to offer
to <hi>Licenſe</hi> any thing which His Majeſty commanded to be
printed: but yet ſtill enjoyning the Printer (as he would
anſwer the contrary at his perill) that the thing might be
performed according to His Majeſties Command.</p>
            <p>And that the whole Body of the Univerſity might fare no
better then the Heads; not long after the carrying up of
the firſt three, they gave us an Argument of a ſad preſage.

all the encouragement any of

perpetually to be harrowed by
Plundering and redious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
to betray their
Loialty, Learning, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
to the advancement
of this preſent Rebellion, till

whom Poſterity will honour
(henceforth as much for his

Doctor <hi>Samuel Ward</hi> (a man
of knowne integrity and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
approbation even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe who were his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaties
in this Cauſe) took the wings of a dove to flye away
and be at reſt: whoſe dying words (as if the cauſe of his
Martyrdome had been written in golden letters upon his
heart) were breathed up to heaven with his parting ſoule,
GOD BLESSE THE KING.</p>
            <p>And though the grave reſolutions of all the Reverend
Profeſſors of Divinity and Law in ſo famous an Univerſity
ought to be more ſacred and powerfull with them then the
noiſe of their new Teachers and obſtreperous <hi>American</hi>
Lay-Lecturers, yet they are not aſhamed, after all theſe
(upon mature deliberation and conſultation with the reſt of
the Learned men of that famous Univerſity) have publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unanimouſly declared their proceedings to be flatly
contrary to <hi>Chriſtian Religion and Loyalty,</hi> (and have ſtood
therein even to impriſonment and death) to perſwade the
ſilly abuſed multitude, that all is for the <hi>Defence of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is their wild fury confinable within thoſe banks,
it ſwels yet higher: for as the Tyrant wiſhed that <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100541:12"/>
had but one neck, that hee might cut it off at one ſtroke;
ſo theſe having got the opportunity, impriſoned the whole
Univerſity, <hi>March</hi> 23. 1643. which day the whole Senate,
(the Repreſentative Body of it) being ſolemnly aſſembled
in the <hi>Regent Houſe,</hi> were there violently invironed with
great Binds of Armed Souldiers, who wanted nothing but
the Word to diſpatch us, becauſe wee would not vote in a
matter as they would have us, though that matter did not
any whit concerne them or their Cauſe, more then the
conferring of a Degree upon ſuch a man as the whole
Univerſity in their conſciences judged unworthy of it: And
one Maſter <hi>Danes,</hi> (Generall of that famous Expedition,
but formerly a member of that Houſe which he then ſo abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
adding Perjury to his former ſinnes, came in a terrible
manner, (contrary to his Oath formerly taken to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Univerſity) and flatly denied the Vice-chancellour
leave to diſſolve the Congregation, unleſſe hee would firſt
promiſe that the matter ſhould be voted, as they required:
Whereupon ſundry Members of that Senate, being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make uſe of that Statute-liberty and Freedome,
which was eſſentiall to that Aſſemblie, were forrhwith ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on, and impriſoned by the Committee, in no better
Lodgings then the common Court of Guard. Which ſtrange
and violent perverting of our Univerſities proceedings, wee
wondred at the leſſe, for that this Captaine had not done
more to us, then Captaine <hi>Ven</hi> with his Raggamuffins
had done formerly to the <hi>ſacred Senate of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that all Academicall Exerciſes might expire, and ſo
the face of an Univerſity be quite takenaway, a grave Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
(the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> Publique Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher)
going to Preach <hi>Ad Clerum,</hi>

               </note> (according
to his office) <hi>pridie Termini,</hi> was furiouſly
purſued over the market place by a confuſed number of
Souldiers, who in a barbarous uncivill manner cryed out,
<hi>A Pope, A Pope,</hi> and vowed high revenge if he offered
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100541:12"/>
to goe into the Pulpit; whereupon the Church was ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
filled with great multitudes, and when ſome who
accompanyed the Preacher, told them, <hi>It was an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
Exerciſe, and to be by Statute performed in Latine,</hi> they
replyed, <hi>They knew no reaſon why all Sermons ſhould not be
performed in Engliſh, that all might be edified,</hi> threatning
withall to teare the Hoods and Habits which Graduates then
wore, according to the Univerſity Statute. Yet all this may
perhaps be extenuated as a ſudden uproare of undiſciplined
Souldiers, but (which is the aggravation of all, and makes
us beleeve that theſe petty Reformers were but the ſenſleſſe
inſtruments of higher Agents) when all this was related to
their then Generall of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> no courſe
was taken at all to prevent theſe growing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes,<note place="margin">Lord Gray of Warke.</note>
but the Divine appointed by Statute to

and glad he could eſcape ſo: And this is the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
which Learning is like to find from theſe grand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to advance it.</p>
            <p>And that Religion might fare no better then Learning
in the Univerſity Church, (for perhaps it may be Idolatry
now to call it Saint <hi>Maries)</hi> in the preſence of the then
Generall our <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> was torne
before our faces,<note place="margin">See the Preface.</note> notwithſtanding our Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Houſe of Peeres for the free uſe
of it, ſome (now great one) encouraging them

               </note> and openly rebuking the Univerſity Clerk
who complained of it before his Souldiers. Thus
thoſe Reverend Fathers, the Compilers of it,
who ſealed the truth thereof with their deareſt bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
content to burne at a ſtake for the light of the Goſpel,
are now this ſecond time martyred and torne in pieces
in their Liturgie, yet all this under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>It will not be ſtrange now to hear how our perſons have
been abuſed, ſeeing Religion and Learning have ſuffered
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100541:13"/>
ſo deeply amongſt us: how divers of us have been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
without ſo much as pretending any cauſe, but ſnatcht
up in the ſtreets, and throwne into priſon at the pleaſure
of a ſmall ſneaking Captaine, where wee have
laine three or foure moneths together,<note place="margin">Jordan.</note> not ſo
much as accuſed, much leſſe heard, but quite
and cleane forgotten, as if there had been no ſuch thing in
nature. How ſome of us (and many others with us) have been
thruſt out of bed in the night, that our Chambers might
forthwith be converted into Priſon Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings:<note place="margin">So at Saint Johns Coll.</note>
How our young Scholars with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
have been commanded to accuſe and
cut out the names of their owne Tutors, and
ſome of them throwne into priſon for not being old enough
to take their Covenant<note n="*" place="margin">So was <hi>Joh. Bullock</hi> of S. Johns.</note>: But (to paſſe
higher) how often have our Colledges been
beſet, and broken open, and Guards thruſt
into them ſomtimes at midnight, while wee
were aſleep in our beds? How often our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries
and Treaſuries ranſackt and rifled, not ſparing ſo
much as our auncient<note n="*" place="margin">So at Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge, whence they took in ancient Coines to the value of 22. l. according to weight.</note> Coynes?
which thoſe that know any

               </gap>ance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
which our Founders and Benefactors allotted for
our ſuſtenance, been taken from off our Tables by the
wanton Soldier? How often have our Rents been extorted
from our Tenants, or if received, remanded of our Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars
and Stewards, and by force taken from them? and all
this under the old odious title of <hi>Plundering,</hi> which word
though they cannot endure to heare of, ſince that new
terme of <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> was invented; yet the thing is the
ſame, and more practiſed then ever, they having for above
two yeares together ſet themſelves upon little elſe then to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100541:13"/>
ſeize and take away our goods and furniture belonging to
our Chambers, prizing and ſelling away our Books at a
tenth part of their value, which are our onely tooles and
inſtruments whereby the trade and profeſſion of Learning
ſhould be holden up. And to this end they have conſtituted
a decay'd Hatter,<note place="margin">Fortune.</note> Plunder-Maſter Generall,
who (together with a Conventieling Barber
and a Confiding Tayler) hath full Commiſſion,<note place="margin">Parrell.</note>
for our propriety ſake,<note place="margin">Curd.</note> to Lord over us, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
of out goods as they pleaſe: So deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a thing to them is an Univerſity, or any that belong
unto it.</p>
            <p>But their malice is unſatiable, and cannot be contained
within the Line of their Fortifications, and therefore to
propagate their owne wickedneſſe, and make us odious and
abominable to the whole Country, as wee were already
(though moſt undeſervedly) to ſome of themſelves, they
have invented a pretty device to reſerve out of their plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all ſorts of pictures, were they but paper prints of the
twelve Apoſtles, and every market-day to burne them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
in the market-place, proclaiming them the <hi>Popiſh
Idols</hi> of the Univerſity, untill wee became ſo hated by the
weaker ſort of the deceived people, that a Scholar could
have ſmall ſecurity from being ſtoned or affronted as he
walkt the ſtreets.</p>
            <p>But why doe wee inſiſt ſo long upon particular mens
plundering, when whole Colledges (wherein not onely the
preſent, but alſo the future propagation of Religion and
Learning is concerned) have drunke ſo deeply the dregs
of their malice? For beſides the cutting down of our
Walks and Orchards, (contrary to their own <hi>Generaliſſimo's
Orders of Warre)</hi> they have cut downe the Woods
and Groves belonging to our Colledges,<note place="margin">So at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Coll.</note> and
ſold them before our eyes to a great value, when
by an <hi>Ordinance</hi> they were declared not Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable:
And (which was likewiſe contrary to an Order)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100541:14"/>
they have ſeized and taken away the Materials of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
buildings, to the worth of three or foure hundred
pounds in Timber, which our pious and charitable Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
had out of their devotion conferred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the re-edifying of an ancient Colledge
which Time had impaired:<note place="margin">Clare Hali.</note> And, to ſhew
what violent paſſions they are tranſported withall, they have
pulled down, demoliſhed and defaced five
or ſix faire Bridges of Stone and Timber
belonging to ſeverall Colledges,<note place="margin">S. Johns, Trin. Kings, Garret Hoſtle, and z. at Queenes.</note> and have
ſpoyled a goodly Walk with a new Gate
pertaining to one of our<note n="*" place="margin">Kings Coll.</note> Colledges, upon
pretence of keeping our Cavaliers, and yet
for forty ſhillings they would faine have
been hired to ſpare it, and caſt up a Work beyond. And let
the world judge whether this was not done to get the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of a Contribution from a Colledge to their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
and conſequently to this Warre againſt the
King.</p>
            <p>But (as if Bridges and materials for Buildings were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
they have yet proceeded further, even to the very
Structure it ſelfe of one of the faireſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
in our Univerſity,<note place="margin">S. Johns Coll.</note> which they plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the true owners of, for above ſixteen
moneths together, as an eſpeciall argument of their love to
Learning, and have converted all the old Court thereof into
a Priſon for His Majeſties Loyall Subjects, (which before
the other was built, has contained above three hundred
Students at a time) not ſuffering any whom it concerned
to remove any bedding or other goods, whereof the Gaoler
could make any uſe or benefit, but renting them all
out together with the Chambers at above five hundred
pounds <hi>per An.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as if ſpoyling of one Colledge were not enough,
their malice has ſince extended it ſelfe to all the reſt, in
Quartering multitudes of Common Souldiers in thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100541:14"/>
and ancient Structures, which our devour and Royall
Founders deſigned for Sanctuaries of Learning and Piety,
but were made by them meere Spittles and Bawdy-houſes
for ſick and debauched Souldiers, being filled with Queans,
Drabs, Fiddlers, and Revels night and day. Which black
deeds of darkneſſe being divers times complained of by us to
their Officers, and the particular men thewed them, who
had thus lewdly abuſed our Colledges, none
of theſe new Reformers were ever puniſht,<note place="margin">Pembr. Hall.</note> nor
the holy Siſters removed, nor ſo much as cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before any that then bore rule among us. By which
meanes, (ſee what Religion they fight for, and what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reformation we may expect) they have diſhonoured
God, countenanced lewdneſſe, ſcandalized modeſt and civill
men, and driven from us, or poyſoned among us, thoſe young
Students which were leſt.</p>
            <p>To this we may adde, how they have torne and defaced
thoſe Reverend buildings, pull'd down and burned the
Wainſcot of our Chambers, our Bed-ſteads, Chaires, Stools,
Tables, and Shelves for our Books, ſo as they may now
have ſome plea for multiplying of Gaoles, if the Liberty of
the Subject ſhall ſo require. And when their ragged Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which had lyen lowzing before <hi>Crowland</hi> nigh a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
were commanded to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> forthwith the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
are appointed for their Kennels, and fourſcore
were turned looſe into one of the leaſt Halls
in the Univerſity,<note place="margin">Pembr. Hall.</note> and charged by their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
to ſhift for themſelves; who without
any more ado, broke open the Fellowes and Scholars Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and took their Beds from under them. But when the
Kings Priſoners taken at <hi>Hilſden-houſe</hi> were brought famiſhed
and naked in triumph by <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> ſome of our
Scholars were knockt down in the ſtreets, only for offering
them a cup of ſmall beere to ſuſtain nature, and the drinke
throwne in the keanell, rather then the famiſhed and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
throats of the wicked, as they eſteem'd them, ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100541:15"/>
uſurp one drop of the creature. And it is much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they would have ſtarved them in priſon
there,<note place="margin">Miſtris <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> maid.</note> if a valiant Chamber-maid had not
relieved them by force, trampling under
her feet in the kennell their great perſecuter,
a Lubberly Scotch Major.<note place="margin">Homes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhould wee mention moreover, how we have been
over-whelmed with inſupportable Taxes extorted from us
by plundering, ſeſſed not by any of our owne Body, but
(which is directly contrary to our eſtabliſhed priviledges)
by the Arbitration of a few confiding Aldermen, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Enemies, who, inſtead of that gratitude which very
nature requires at their hands, now repay us with unſatiable
malice and Envy; which property of theirs have ſince
commended and qualified them to be appointed Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
and Judges to ſtrip us of our Eſtates and Livelyhoods.
And when neither our Conſciences nor Eſtates could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any further to defray their impoſts for our very Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
(which their Soldiers then poſſeſſed and burnt) beſides
all exciſes, weekly paiments, Taxes, fift and twentieth
part, upon all our Revenews, and other ſuch new termes of
property and libertie, all the favour we can expect from
them, is, quietly to be thruſt into priſon without further
abuſings.</p>
            <p>And although all theſe are but ſad Theames to be thus
farre inlarged and dilated upon, yet they thinke they
can ſtop the noiſe of all theſe juſt complaints with their
uſuall grinning objection, <hi>that ſundry of our Students
are in the Kings Army:</hi> making that to be their crime, to
which if their owne innate Loyaltie did not draw them, yet
their haughty and heatheniſh uſage would of neceſſity drive
them: For who had not rather fall upon the bed of honour,
and aſſert with his deareſt blood, his Religion, Loyaltie, and
Liberty, then live a ſlave under them, to ſet his ſurviving
foot-ſteps upon the graves and aſhes of expired
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100541:15"/>
Loyaltie, Nobility, Gentry, Clergie, and Civility it
ſelfe?</p>
            <p>And now to tell how they have prophaned and abuſed
our ſeverall Chappels; though our pens flowed as faſt
with vineger and gall, as our eyes doe with teares, yet were
it impoſſible ſufficiently to be expreſſed: when as multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of enraged Souldiers (let looſe to <hi>reforme)</hi> have to me
downe all carved worke, not reſpecting the very Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the dead: And have ruined a beautifull carved
ſtructure in the <hi>Univerſitie Church</hi> (though indeed that was
not done without direction from a great one,
as appeared after upon complaint,<note place="margin">M. Cromwell.</note> made to
him) which ſtood us in a great ſumme of
money, and had not one jot of Imagery or ſtatue worke
about it. And when that Reverend man the
then Vice-Chancelour told them mildly,<note place="margin">D. Ward.</note>
               <hi>That they might be better imployed,</hi> they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him ſuch Language, as we are aſham'd here to expreſs.</p>
            <p>Nor was it any whit ſtrange to find whole Bands of
Soldiers training and excerciſing in the Royall Chappell
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth:<note place="margin">Kings Coll.</note> Nay even the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
themſelves (being commanded to ſhew their
new Major Generall<note n="*" place="margin">Crawford.</note> how well they underſtood
their trade) choſe that place to trayne in,
(whether in policy to conceale their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
or out of feare to betray their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or on purpoſe to ſhew their Soldiers how little Gods
houſe was to be regarded, let the world conjecture.) And
one who calls himſelfe <hi>John Dowſing,</hi> and by vertue of a
pretended Commiſſion goes about the Country like a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,
breaking gloſſe windowes, having battered and beaten
downe all our painted glaſſe, not only in our Chappels,
but (contrary to Order) in our publique Schools,
Colledge Halls,<note place="margin">See the Pref.</note> Libraries, and Chambers, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking
perhaps the Liberall Artes for Saints (w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

(againſt an Order) defaced and digged up the floors of our
Chappels, many of which had lien ſo for two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares together, not regarding the duſt of our founders
and predeceſſors, who likely were buried there; compelled
us by armed Souldiers to pay forty ſhillings a Colledge

Earle of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> Lord <hi>Say,</hi> Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Sir <hi>William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
and Maſter <hi>Pym.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet all theſe actions of theirs were but preparatory
Pils to diſpoſe our whole Body for its finall purge of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
when ever they ſhould pleaſe to think it ſick of us:
And that is this laſt act, which is none of the leaſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this our ſad complaint. For although wee were
ſeldome in any freedome for any time neere theſe three
yeares from ſome <hi>Proteſtation, Oath, Aſſociation, Vow and
Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> menaced upon us, yet this laſt onely brought
with it the fatall doome of our finall extirpation: though
wee muſt have leave to wonder that all <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100541:16"/>
ſhould be denied us by them, who lately pleaded nothing
elſe againſt the eſtabliſhed Eccleſiaſticall lawes, and now
pretend partly to fight for the ſame: But indeed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
was not the true cauſe but the pretence onely for
our <hi>Ejection,</hi> (for that is the <hi>word of Art,</hi> for this newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Myſtery) as appeares by ſeverall writs iſſued out
under hand and ſeale without mention of <hi>refuſing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
The thing was abſolutely determined by a perent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory
decree, to plant a <hi>new Univerſity</hi> for propagating at
leaſt, if not inventing a <hi>new Religion:</hi> And to that end the
Old one muſt be removed, at leaſt ſo much of it, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as might hinder this great deſigne; onely ſome meanes
and plauſible pretences were yet wanting.</p>
            <p>The firſt that was attempted was to ſummon all thoſe
that were abſent to return within ten dayes. But then they
were ſo far to ſeek for reaſon of Ejection, as that after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
halfe ten dayes more ſtudy all they could inſert in their
writ was, <hi>For oppoſing the Proceedings of
Parliament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Preface.</note> 
               <hi>and other Scandalous Actions in
the Univerſity:</hi> Their tongues thereby te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
their mindes, though perhaps out of incogitancy,
which are ſo furiouſly ſet upon their great worke of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
as to puniſh the <hi>oppoſing of Scandalous Actions,</hi> with
the loſſe of all a mans livelyhood. Whether they were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the phraſe or not, we know not; but they had very
good reaſon to be aſhamed of the Act, being ſo different
from all ſhew of Juſtice, as to enjoyne impoſſibilities in
commanding men to returne within twelve dayes, after iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
the ſummons, which at that time were above two
hundred miles diſtant, and had two Armies to paſſe
through all the waies: or enjoyning them to be reſident
at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whom themſelves at the ſame time kept
faſt priſoners at <hi>London:</hi> And yet for non appearance,
for no man knowes any other cauſe, theſe muſt be eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>But though this be not ſo plauſible, yet they have a ſure
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100541:17"/>
reſerve, their <hi>Solemne League and Covenant,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from their deare <hi>Brethren of Scotland,</hi> they thinke
no penalty too great for refuſall of it: And this, becauſe
it carries in its frontiſpice a pretence of <hi>Reformation,</hi> comes
not alone, but (though without any viſible Order) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a new Legiſlative fangle called <hi>An Oath of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi>
but indeed was an Oath of Treachery, a wild un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
deviſe to call whom they would before them, and
make them accuſe their neareſt and deareſt Friends, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
Tutors, and Maſters, and betray the Members and
Acts of their ſeverall Societies, manifeſtly contrary to our
<hi>Peaceable Statutes</hi> formerly ſworne unto by us, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
againſt all faction and ſedition, which theſe men only
hunt after, <hi>[Viz. Non revelabis aliquod ſecretum Collegii;
Non malum aut damnum inferes Collegio aut cuilibet Sociorum:]</hi>
And apparently reviving the Oath <hi>Ex Offiſhio,</hi> (as their
Commiſſioners ſpell it) aboliſhed this preſent Parliament,
to accuſe our ſelves: For what is it elſe to accuſe our
owne <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Corporations,</hi> whereof our ſelves are
parts and members?</p>
            <p>And though wee would not any whit derogate from the
Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> as it is uſed this day in moſt Chriſtian
Kingdomes and Common-wealths, nay even in <hi>Scotland</hi>
and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and may be of excellent uſe, if not ſtretched
beyond the due limits of Law: yet this <hi>Oath of diſcovery,</hi>
all, we thinke, except one or two, refuſed, perceiving that
thereby the deſigne of a ſecond <hi>Century</hi> was to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for they finding no accuſation or crime objected againſt
any of us, wherewith to colour their ugly purpoſes, which
they had already plotted in private againſt us, and yet
their Covenant muſt be for Reformation, they reſolved to
ſhrive us with an <hi>Auricular Confeſſion</hi> ſanctified to the
<hi>Cauſe,</hi> that ſo we might help them out with their malice,
which was otherwiſe like to be borne blind, though hitherto
it hath been Eagle-eyed over our moſt veniall ſlips; And
forthwith upon refuſall of this Oath was their Solemne
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100541:17"/>
               <hi>league and Covenant</hi> urged upon us.</p>
            <p>We cannot but ſignifie by the way, that ſeeing it muſt
be tendered to the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> as their printed inſtructions
told us, we hoped it ſhould have beene to the whole body
Statuteablie aſſembled, either to admit of, or otherwiſe
humblie to ſhew reaſons of deniall, but they were wiſe
enough to foreſee what entertainment ſuch ſtuffe was like
to find from all the learned Men of ſo famous an Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and were not willing it ſhould be blaſted with their
Univerſall refuſall. And therefore contrary to our hopes,
a ſelected number of particular men are cull'd out, partly as
the lot fell, for it much reſembled a lottery, but cheifly of
ſuch whom they moſt redoubted, &amp; of whom by ſome pettie
information, they had received a black Character of <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie</hi>
termed <hi>Malignancy,</hi> and to theſe, yet ſeverally, was
tendered <hi>the Oath of diſcovery,</hi> and after that the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though indeed we ſhould, by Gods help, as often have
refuſed it, as it ſhould have bin offered, yet after one ſingle
deniall, without a ſecond tender, Contrary to the Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Article of the <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> a warrant was ſtraightway
iſſued forth under the Earl of Mancheſters hand and ſeal
for our <hi>Ejection and Baniſhment from the univerſitie of
Cambridge for refuſing to take the Solemn League and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and other Miſdemenors in the ſaid Univerſitie,</hi>
which were ſurely no other then the deniall of the <hi>Oath
of diſcovery,</hi> for not one of us who were there preſent, had
any one accuſation brought, much leſſe proved againſt him,
when we appeared upon their Summons. And without
any delay our names are cut out of the Colledge Tables,
and we <hi>ſtrictly commanded in three dayes ſpace to quit the
univerſitie and Towne under paine of Impriſonment and
Plunder,</hi> if any thing was left.</p>
            <p>And it is here not to be paſſed by, that whereas by the
laws of the Land we were ever reputed to have as good an
intereſt in our ſeveral fellowſhips during life, as any of our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100541:18"/>
fellow Subjects in his ſee Simple, provided we carried our
ſelves according to thoſe Statutes by which our ſeverall
Colledges were reſpectively to be governed, yet now we
are utterly deprived of them by the meer Arbitrary power
of one of our fellow Subjects without tranſgreſſing of any
one Statute, or being called to anſwer for any pretended
offence whatſoever. Nay, ſo little was Propriety valued,
that a paire of<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> Aſh, and <hi>M.</hi> Good.</note> Camp-Chaplains, or one of
them, might expunge, eject, and baniſh
whom they pleaſed, eſpecially ſuch as would
not ſacrifice their Loyalitie and Conſciences
to the nerves and cement of this <hi>Rebellion,</hi> called the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
For inſtance, when a Warrant for Ejection of certain
Fellows of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge was iſſued out under hand
and ſeale, and their names expreſly mentioned in it, yet
M. <hi>Aſh</hi> knowes very well who it was that expunged M.
<hi>Henmans</hi> name, and put in M. <hi>Botelers,</hi> without ſo much at
writing the Warrant over againe.</p>
            <p>And now (ſeeing what courſes were taken) it will not
ſeeme ſtrange to the Reader, to heare that no leſſe then
29. Fellows, (together with the Maſter) have been thruſt
out of the ſaid Colledge, the emoluments of whoſe places
have beene ever ſince ſwallowed up by not halfe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and not content with that neither. And in
another they have made a through Reformation,<note place="margin">Queenes Colledge.</note>
               <hi>Root and Branch,</hi> leaving neither Fellow nor
Scholar. In others indeed they have left per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
one or two, (or more as they ſee good) like <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
to hew wood and draw water,</hi> till ſuch time as they
have diſcovered unto them all the myſteries concerning
their Colledge Revenues, and by that time they will finde
enow godly men of their owne Tribe, learned enough to
pocket the profits of two Fellowſhips apiece, which is the
end of all this bleſſed Reformation. Thus is their old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Regulation</hi> vaniſhed, in place whereof their true
intention of a totall <hi>Extirpation</hi> of the whole ancient Body
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100541:18"/>
of the Univerſity doth now ſo plainly appeare, that they
which runne may read it; which though a great many would
not beleeve, till by woefull experience they found it, yet
was it conſpicuous enough from the very beginning to any
that was but tollerably provident in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>For it was hardly poſſible that <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſhould be free
from theſe two crying ſinnes of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
which the devill hath long endeavoured to make this whole
Kingdome guilty of; and to that end (miſ-calling them by
the names of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty)</hi> had masked under the
counterfeit vizard of a <hi>Covenant for Reformation:</hi> By
which means though the ſimplicity of the vulgar was much
abuſed, to the extreame hazard of this once flouriſhing
Church and State; yet ſeeing it could not be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the ſtrict ſearch, which in ſuch an Univerſitie of all
ſorts of learned and conſcientious men it was not like to
eſcape; it could not be otherwiſe expected, but that thoſe
who were his inſtruments herein, would lay a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and (how moderate ſoever their pretences were)
reforme <hi>Root and Branch,</hi> as they called it, that ſeeing they
could not make the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> to rebell by
taking their Covenant, they might at leaſt make a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Univerſity at <hi>Cambridge</hi> which ſhould take it.</p>
            <p>And to this end thoſe new intruders which falſly call
themſelves Maſters and Fellowes of our ſeverall Colledges,
inſtead of thoſe ſolemne Oaths which our pious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Founders and <hi>Legiſlators</hi> enjoyned to be taken, (and
without taking of which, no man can pretend any right to
any of their foundations) onely take their <hi>Covenant</hi> againe,
and make a Proteſtation to reforme all our wholſome Laws
and Statutes according to that <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Covenant with hell,</hi> begot betweene <hi>Munſter</hi> and
<hi>Mecha,</hi> by the help of a Jeſuite, the moſt impious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
confederacie that their grand maſter the devill
could contrive: the cheife end whereof is to dethrone the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100541:19"/>
               <hi>Lords anoynted,</hi> and throw down the Church and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
government thereof, and to force not only their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects,
to contradict their Oathes of Allegiance and
Supremacie, but even their moſt gracious Soveraigne to
perjurie, in violating that this ſacred Oath which hee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
made at his Coronation. And to compleat that
their moſt horrid and heinous ſin, to joyne in Armes with
a <hi>forraigne Nation,</hi> to lay deſolate their owne native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to ſtain this Earth with the Blood of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Men
and fellow-Subiects, and to expoſe the treaſures
of <hi>England,</hi> the Cream of theſe fruitfull vallies, to the
Empty and hungry maw of a Rebellious Scot: and then
vow never to have peace, but what ſhall be written in the
bloud of their Enemies (His maieſty and his Loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects)
and laſtly, moſt cruelly and wickedly to exhort and
ſolicite all Proteſtants in the Chriſtian world to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the like courſe with them by riſing in Rebellious
Armes; thereby expoſing the throats and lives of all our
Brethren the Proteſtants in France and elſewhere to the
Juſt iealouſy of their ſeverall princes. And yet (forſooth)
this <hi>Covenant</hi> is made the foundation of the great worke
of their glorious <hi>Reformation,</hi> and under pretence of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this we muſt be baniſht, and thruſt out of all we
have.</p>
            <p>It will not be more then what upon tryall will be found
true, if we here mention a myſterie which many (we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
will not a little wonder at, <hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>Covenant,</hi>
for which all this perſecution hath been, conſiſted of 6.
Articles, and thoſe Articles of 666. words. This is not the
firſt time that pereſecution hath riſen in England upon 6.
Articles, (witneſſe thoſe in the raigne of
King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8.<note n="*" place="margin">See M. Fox, Act. and Mon.</note>) But as for the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the beaſt,</hi> to anſwer directly to the
words of thoſe ſix Articles,<note place="margin">Vol. 2. p. 443.</note> it is a thing,<note place="margin">Edit. London. 1631.</note>
which (conſidering Gods bleſſed provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in every particular thing) hath
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100541:19"/>
made many of us and others ſeriouſly and often to reflect
upon it; though we were never ſo ſuperſtitiouſly <hi>Caballi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi>
as to aſcribe much to numbers. This diſcovery (we
confeſſe) was not made by any of us, but by a very judicious
and worthy Divine, formerly of our Univerſity,
and then a Priſoner (for his Conſcience) within
the precincts of it,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Geaſt.</hi>
               </note> and not yet reſtored to his
liberty, but removed to London. And therefore we ſhall
forbeare to inſiſt any farther, either upon it, or the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it.</p>
            <p>For our owne particulars we ſhall only adde thus much,
that ſeeing ſome of our owne Reaſons with which we had
armed our ſelves againſt that <hi>Myſterie of Iniquity</hi> have
ſince that time been publiſhed to the world (in ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
of phraſe as well became Chriſtian ſufferers, though
in ſuch diſtraction as may ſufficiently teſtifie who were the
Authors and what their Condition) we appeale to any who
with Judgment and moderation hath or ſhal read the ſame;
whether we have cauſleſly and fooliſhly triffed away thoſe
faire advantages wherewith God by the meanes of our
renowned Benefactors had endowed us, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Glory, and further propagation of learning
and true Religion; or whether we had not rather ſufter'd
an unjuſt deprivall of all our livelyhoods under the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
hands of cruell Tyrants, who neither feare God not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the juſt ſctuples of tender Conſciences.</p>
            <p>For when a Member or our Vniverſitie was
brought upon this occaſion before the E.<note place="margin">M. Maldero.</note> of
Mancheſter, and being not ſatisfied in conſcience, deſired his
LOP that his Chaplaine (then preſent) might reſolve him
in ſome Scruples about it; to this motion (being then
thought not unreaſonable ot his LOP, and much preſſed by
ſome that were there preſent) his Reverend Chaplain learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
replyed before the whole Company, that <hi>he came not
thither to reſolve Mens Conſciences, but to preach to his
LOP.</hi> Whereupon the Gentleman was not long after ſent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100541:20"/>
up priſoner to <hi>London</hi> by the ſaid Earle for tendring the
Reaſons of his refuſing the Covenant, though invited and
required thereunto by his Lordſhip: And there without
farther hearing committed to priſon, where he continued a
long time at exceſſive charges, which is all the ſatisfaction
he could finde (or any other can expect) from them, for the
ſcruples of a tender conſcience.</p>
            <p>Thus are we impriſoned or baniſhed for our conſciences,
being not ſo much as accuſed of any thing elſe, only ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of Loyaltie to our King, and Fidelity to our Mother
the Church of England; and not onely ſo, but quite ſtript
of all our livelyhood, and expoſed to beggery, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left us to ſuſtaine the neceſſities of nature, and many
of us no friends to goe to, but deſtitute and forlorne, not
knowing whither to bend one ſtep when we ſet footing out
of Cambridge, having one onely companion, which will
make us rejoyce in our utmoſt afflictions, <hi>viz. A cleare
Conſcience in a righteous cauſe:</hi> Humbly ſubmitting our
ſelves to the chaſtiſement of the Almighty, who after he
hath tryed us, will at laſt caſt his rods into the fire.</p>
            <p>As for us, God forbid that we ſhould take up any rayling
or curſing, who are commanded onely to <hi>bleſſe:</hi> we are ſo
far from that, that we have rather choſen to let the names
of our greateſt perſecutors rot in our ruines, then ſo much
as mention them with our pen, ſave onely where neceſſity
compelled us unto it.</p>
            <p>But though we ſpare their names, we hope we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence to any deſcribe their qualities: And therefore
if Poſterity ſhall ask, Who thruſt out one of the <hi>eyes of this
Kingdome?</hi> Who made Eloquence dumbe, Phyloſophie
ſottiſh, widdowed the Arts, and drove the Muſes from their
ancient habitation? Who pluckt the Reverend and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
<hi>Profeſſors</hi> out of their Chaires, and ſilenced them
in priſon or their graves? Who turned Religion into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and changed the Apoſtolicall Chaire into a Deske
for Blaſphemy, and tore the garland from off the head of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100541:20"/>
Learning, to place it on the dull browes of diſloyall Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
If they ſhall aske, who made thoſe Ancient and
beautifull Chappells, the ſweet remembrancers and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our fore-father <hi>Charitie,</hi> and kind fomenters of
their childrens <hi>devotion,</hi> to become ruinous heaps of duſt
and ſtones? or who unhived thoſe numerous ſwarms of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Bees,</hi> which uſed to drop honey-dews over all this
Kingdome, to place in their roomes ſwarmes of ſenſleſſe
<hi>Drones?</hi> Tis quickly anſwered, Thoſe they were, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to ſhare three Crownes, and put them in their
owne pockets, have transformed this free Kingdome into a
large Gaole, to <hi>keep the Liberty of the Subject:</hi> They who
maintaine 100000. robbers and murtherers by ſea and land,
to protect our lives, and the propriety of our goods: That
have gone a <hi>King-catching</hi> theſe ſix yeeres, <hi>hunting</hi>
their moſt gracious Soveraigne <hi>like a Partridge on the
mountaines</hi> in his owne <hi>defence;</hi> They who have poſſeſt
themſelves of His Majeſties Townes, Navie, and Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines,
and robbed him of all his revenues, to make him a
<hi>glorious King:</hi> Who have multiplyed Oathes, Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
vows, Leagues and Covenants for the <hi>eaſe of tender
conſciences:</hi> Filling all Pulpits with jugglets for the <hi>Cauſe,</hi>
canting Sedition, Atheiſme, and Rebellion, to root out Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Babylon, and ſettle the Kingdome of Chriſt:
who from a trembling guilt of a legalltry all have engaged
three flouriſhing Kingdomes, and left them weltring in
their owne bloud, They (laſtly) which when they had
glutted themſelves with ſpoyle and rapine, hiſſed for a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
viper</hi> to come and care up the bowels of their deare

know what a world of wickedneſſe they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>And now ſeeing they are not content to deprive us of
our eſtates, but (which is much more grievous unto us) have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100541:21"/>
alſo robbed us of our good names, branding all of us in our
ſeverall writs of Ejectment with a black Character of
<hi>miſdemeaners</hi> in generall (and yet not any one particular
was alledged againſt any one of us, which were then there,
much leſſe offered to be proved by any one ſingle witneſſe,
although eſpeciall care was taken by an Ordinance for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing

we challenge and conjure them as they will one day an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for this ſlander and oppreſſion, that they declare and
prove what thoſe <hi>Miſdemeaners</hi> are; which if they doe,
the ſhame and guilt will be ours: if not (as we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they cannot) we muſt appeale herein from theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Judges to the impartiall Tribunall of the righteous
Judge of Heaven and Earth, who knowes our integritie,
and to whom we ſubmit our ſelves and cauſe, Humblie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
him not to lay this Sinne to their charge. For
though for our many ſinnes againſt him we may juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
at his hands, heavier Judgments then theſe: yet our
Innocence will plead <hi>Not Guiltie,</hi> to the face of any man
who ſhall obiect againſt us any Civill <hi>miſdemeanors,</hi>
whereby we can more iuſtly be deprived of our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

            </p>
            <p>And as it hath pleaſed our gracious Maſter (whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

to the reſt of our Brethren: So we hope he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
unto us his grace of <hi>humiliation under his mightie

be pleaſed to ſtrengthen our infirmities to beare: And that
