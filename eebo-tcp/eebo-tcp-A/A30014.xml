         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>PEnnſylvania</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſy</hi> in <hi>America</hi> lieth in about
forty &amp; forty two Degrees of North Latitude, and is
ſevered the one from the other by the River of <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi>
on the Weſt, and ſeperated from <hi>New-York</hi> Collony by
<hi>Sandy-hoock-Bay,</hi> and part of <hi>Hudſons</hi> River on the Eaſt.
The dayes in the Winter are about two hours longer, and
in the Summer two hours ſhorter than in <hi>England,</hi> the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſomewhat hotter, which cauſeth the Fruits and Corn
ſomewhat to ripen faſter than in <hi>England,</hi> and the Harveſt
for <hi>Wheat, Rye</hi> and <hi>Barley,</hi> being about the latter end of <hi>June.</hi>
In the Winter ſeaſon it is cold and freezing Weather, and
ſometimes Snow, but commonly very clear and Sun-ſhine,
which ſoon diſſolves it.</p>
            <p>The Country is well Watered, the River of <hi>Delaware</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
navigable for Ships of great burthen to <hi>Burlington,</hi> which
from the <hi>Capes,</hi> or entrance, is accounted an hundred and
forty Miles; and for Sloops to the Falls, which is about ten
Miles farther.</p>
            <p>The Bay of <hi>Sandy-hoock</hi> on <hi>East-Jerſy</hi> is a ſafe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Harbour for any Fleet of Ships, which can lie there in
all Weathers, and go in and out to Sea in Winter, as well as
Summer, and Ships of great Burthen can lie cloſe to the
Town of <hi>New-Perth,</hi> which renders it a good Scituation for
Navigation, from whence in ſix Hours time at moſt, Ships
can go out into the Sea; and cloſe by the Town of <hi>Perth</hi>
runs up <hi>Rariton</hi> River. From the Falls of <hi>Delaware</hi> River
the <hi>Indians</hi> go in Cannows up the ſaid River, to an <hi>Indian</hi>
Town called <hi>Miniſincks,</hi> which is accounted from the Falls
about eighty Miles; but this they perform by great Labour
in ſetting up againſt the Stream; but they can come down
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38228:4"/>
with eaſe and ſpeed; the River from the Falls runs from the
North and North-Weſt about twenty Miles, as I my ſelf
obſerved in my Travel ſo far by the River, but by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
Information, it cometh about more Eaſterly farther up.
I have been informed, that about <hi>Miniſincks,</hi> by the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
both in <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> is great quantities
of exceeding rich open Land, which is occaſioned by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of the Leaves and Soil in great Rains from the
Mountains, which Land is exceeding good, for the raiſing
of <hi>Hem?</hi> and <hi>Flax, Wheat,</hi> or any other ſorts of Corn, Fruits,
Roots <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where in time may be conveniently ſettled a
Manufacture for the making of <hi>Linnen-cloth, Cordage, Twine,
Sacking, Fiſhing-Nets,</hi> and all other Commodities commonly
made of Hemp or Flax: And after great Rains, we may
bring down great quantities of Goods in flat-bottom-Boats,
built for that purpoſe, which will then come down, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Land-floods with ſpeed.</p>
            <p>And into this River, betwixt the Capes and the Falls, run
many navigable Rivers and Cricks, ſome of them fifteen
or twenty Miles, and others leſs, which Rivers and Cricks
are made by the plenty of Springs and Brooks, that run out
of the Country, many of which Brooks are ſo conſiderable,
as to be fit to drive Mills. And above the falls, in travelling
of twenty Miles by the Rivers ſide, I went over twenty run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of Water, five or ſix of them being fit to build Mills
on.</p>
            <p>The Country for the moſt part is pretty leavel, until we
come about ten Miles above the Falls, where it is Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
for many Miles, but interlaced with fertile Valleys.
The Bay and River of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and the Rivers and Cricks
that runs into it, are plentifully ſtored with various ſorts of
good <hi>Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Water-Fowl.</hi> as <hi>Swans, Geeſe, Ducks, Wigeons,</hi>
&amp;c. And a conſiderable <hi>Whale</hi>-Fiſhery may be carried on in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38228:4"/>
the Bay of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and on the Sea-Coaſts of <hi>New Jerſey,</hi>
there being <hi>Whale</hi> -Fiſheries already begun, plenty of <hi>Whales</hi>
being by experience found there, and the Winter-time being
the time for the catching them, they will not thereby be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of raiſing there Summer-Crops; and the Oyl and Bone
being good Commodities to be ſent for <hi>England,</hi> there alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Bay of <hi>Delaware</hi> and <hi>Sandy-hoock, Drums, Sheeps-heads
Baſs,</hi> and other ſorts of large Fiſh, which may be fit to ſalt
up in Casks to keep for uſe, and Tranſportation alſo. There
are great plenty of <hi>Oyſters,</hi> which may be pickled and put up
in ſmall Casks for uſe. Likewiſe, in <hi>Delaware</hi> River are
great plenty of <hi>Sturgion,</hi> which doubtleſs might be a good
Trade, if mannaged by ſuch Perſons as are skilful in the
boyling and pickling of them, ſo as to preſerve them good to
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and other adjacent Iſlands. There are alſo in the
Spring great quantities of a ſort of Fiſh like <hi>Herrings:</hi>
with plenty of the Fiſh called <hi>Shads,</hi> but not like the
<hi>Shads</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but of another kind, being a much better
ſort of Fiſh; the Inhabitants uſually catch quantities, which
they ſalt up, and pack them in Barrels for Winter's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The Lands from the Capes, to about ſix Miles above <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Caſtle</hi>
(which is by eſtimation ninety Miles) is for the moſt
part very rich, there being very many navigable Cricks on bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th
ſides of the River, and on the River and Cricks are great
quantities of rich fat Marſh Land, which cauſeth thoſe parts,
to ſome freſh People, to be ſomewhat unhealthful in the latter
part of the Summer, at which time ſome of them have
<hi>Agues:</hi> Alſo in and near theſe Marſhes, are ſmall Flies, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Musketoes,</hi> which are troubleſome to ſuch People as are
not uſed to them; but were thoſe Marſhes banked, and
drained, and then plowed and ſowed, ſome Years with
Corn, and then with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hay-ſeed, I do ſuppoſe it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38228:5"/>
would be healthful, and very little troubled with <hi>Musketoes;</hi>
and if Cattel did commonly feed on this Ground, and tread
it as in <hi>England,</hi> I ſuppoſe it would not be inferior to the
rich Meadows on the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> and were quantities
of this Land laid dry, and brought into Tillage, I ſuppoſe
it would bear great Crops of <hi>Wheat, Peaſe</hi> and <hi>Barley, Hemp</hi>
and <hi>Flax,</hi> and it would be very fit for <hi>Hop-Gardens,</hi> and for
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Graſs, which might ſerve for rich Paſtures or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
Alſo theſe Marſhes are fit for <hi>Rape,</hi> and were <hi>Rape</hi>-Mills
built, and the deſign mannaged, ſo as it would be if it
were in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> a great Trade might be carried
on, and many hundred Tuns of <hi>Rape</hi>-Oyl might be made
Yearly, and ſent to <hi>England,</hi> to the Planters inrichment; and
not only ſo, but would be for Merchants advantage, they
thereby having Goods to freight their Ships, which would
tend to the benefit of the Inhabitants in general.</p>
            <p>And if thoſe Trades and Deſigns are carried on to effects, as
are mentioned in this Treatiſe, there would naturally follow
Trade and Imployment for <hi>Ship-wrights, Boat-wrights, Coopers,
Carpenters, Smiths, Ropers, Mariners, Weavers, Butchers,
Bakers, Brewers;</hi> and many other ſorts of Trades would have
full Impoyment.</p>
            <p>From ſix Miles above <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> to the Falls of <hi>Delaware</hi>
(which is about ſixty Miles) and ſo to the Head of the ſaid
River, the <hi>Water</hi> is clear, freſh, and fit for Brewing, or any
other uſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Air</hi> clear and good, it being ſuppoſed to be as health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as any part of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Land</hi> is in Veins, ſome good, and ſome bad, but the
greateſt part will bear good Corn, as <hi>Wheat, Rye, Barley,
Oats, Indian Corn, Buck-Wheat, Peaſe</hi> and <hi>Indian Beans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fruits that grow natural in the Countries are</hi> Strawberries,

            <p>There ought to be <hi>publick Store-Houſes</hi> provided for all

taking a Note under the Hand and Seal, from the Store-houſe
Regiſter, of the quantity, quality and value of the Hemp Flax,

a Merchant, that am furniſhed with divers ſorts of goods, I
ſell them to a Planter, and receive their Notes which they
had from the Store-houſe <hi>Regiſtry,</hi> in pay for my goods, to

the Maſter of the Spinning-School buys of the Farmer in

Cloth to the value of ſixty pound, at receiving thereof he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
up the Notes to the Regiſter of the publick Store,
which are cancelled, and then filed up as Waſte paper. The
Roper, when he pleaſeth, receives on demand, in Hemp to
the value of forty pounds out of the publick Store, by which
he is made capable of imploying his Servants in making of
Cordage; but he that hath no occaſion to take out this Hemp
or Flax, or Linnen Cloth, may paſs theſe Notes from one man
to another, as often they pleaſe, which is all one as ready
Money at all times.</p>
            <p>Were the Flax and Hemp Manufactuaries carried on to that
height as it might be, it would greatly advance theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
for did we make our own Sail-cloth and Cordage,
we could make Ships, Sloops and Boats at much eaſier Rates
than they can build for in <hi>England,</hi> the Timber coſting us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

both Ships and Houſes might be built at eaſie Rates.</p>
            <p>Many Ship Loads of Hemp is brought yearly from the Eaſt

after-noon let a Meeting be kept by the School-maſters and
their Scholars, where after good inſtruction and admonition
is given by the Maſters, to the Scholars, and thanks returned

and let reproof, admonition and correction be given to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors,
according to the quantity and quality of their faults.</p>
            <p>5. Let the like Meetings be kept by the School-Miſtriſſes,
and the Girls apart from the Boys. By ſtrictly obſerving this
good Order, our Children will be hindred of running into
that Exceſs of Riot and Wickedneſs that youth is incident to,
and they will be a comfort to their tender Parents.</p>
            <p>6. Let one thouſand Acres of Land be given and laid out
in a good place, to every publick School that ſhall be ſet up,
and the Rent or incom of it to go towards the defraying of

the Children of Rich People, let them be maintained free of
charge to their Parents, out of the Profits of the ſchool, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

and the Remainder of the Profits, if any be, to be diſpoſed of
in the building of School-houſes, and Improvements on the
thouſand Acres of Land, which belongs to the School.</p>

bring their tender fingers by degrees to ſpin very fine; their
Wheels go all by the Foot, made to go with much eaſe,
whereby the action or motion is very eaſie and delightful:
The way, method, rule and order how they are govern'd is,
1 <hi>ſt.</hi> There is a large Room, and in the middle thereof a little
Box like a Pulpit: 2 <hi>dly,</hi> There are benches built round about
the Room, as they are in Play-houſes, up on the benches ſit
about two hundred Children ſpinning, and in the box
in the middle of the room, ſits the grand Miſtreſs with a
long white Wand in her hand; if ſhe obſerve any of them
idle, ſhe reaches them a tap, but if that will not do, ſhe rings
a bell, which by a little ord is fixed to the box, and out
comes a VVomau, ſhe then points to the Ofendor, and ſhe
is taken away into another Room and chaſtized; and all
this is done without one word ſpeaking: In a little Room
by the School there is a VVoman that is preparing, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Flax on the Diſtaffs, and upon the ringing of a Bell, and
pointing the Rod at the Maid that hath ſpun off her Flax,
ſhe hath another Diſtaff given her, and her Spool of Thred
taken from her, and put into a box unto others of the ſame
ſize, to make Cloth, all being of equal Threds. 1 <hi>ſt.</hi> They
raiſe their Children, as they ſpin finer, to the higher Benches:
2. They ſort and ſize all the Threds, ſo that they can apply
them to make equal Cloths; and after a young Maid hath been
three years in the <hi>Spinning-School,</hi> that is taken in at ſix, and
then continues until nine years, ſhe will get eight pence the
day, and in theſe parts I ſpeak of, a man that has moſt
Children, lives beſt</q>

            <p>Now were <hi>Spining-Schools</hi> ſettled in the principal Cities and

Planter at full double the price as it coſt from the maker in
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> from whence it brought to <hi>England,</hi> by
which it doth appear, that if we do get ſuch Prices for the
Cloth that we make, then we ſhall have double for our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to what they have; therefore it may be well that a
Law were made for the encouragement of the <hi>Linnen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture</hi>
by the Governours and General Aſſemblies, that all
Perſons inhabiting in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> or <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> that keep
a Plow, do ſow one Acre of <hi>Flax,</hi> and two Acres of <hi>Hemp,</hi>
which would be a means of ſupplying us with <hi>Flax</hi> and
<hi>Hemp,</hi> to carry on the Manufacturies of <hi>Linnen-Cloth</hi> and
<hi>Cordage;</hi> and alſo would be very profitable to the Planter,
by imploying his Family in the Winter ſeaſon, when they
would have otherwiſe but little elſe to do, <hi>viz.</hi> the Men and
Boys in Breaking and Dreſſing of it, and making it fit for
uſe, and the Women and Girls in Spining it, and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they may carry on their Husbandry as largely, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this was done; the Husbandry-Affairs being chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betwixt the Spring and Fall.</p>
            <p>Now to that end that a <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Monies</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> may be
in <hi>Pennſilvania</hi> and <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> a Law may be made, that all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38228:11"/>
Monies ſent on Intereſt be at 8 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> by the year, and
that all Bills and Bonds be entred on the publick Regiſtry, and
by Act of Aſſembly be made transferable by Aſſignments, ſo as
the Property may go along with the Aſſignment; thereby a
Bond or Bill will go in the nature of <hi>Bills of Exchange;</hi> and
ſo <hi>A.</hi> owing 200 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> he aſſigns him the Bond of <hi>C.</hi> who
owed him 200 <hi>l.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> owing <hi>D.</hi> 200 <hi>l.</hi> aſſigns him the
Bond of <hi>E.</hi> who owed him 200 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo one Bond or Bill
would go through twenty hands, and thereby be as ready
Monies, and do much to the Benefit of Trade. Alſo, that all
Lands and Houſes be put under a publick Regiſtry, and entred
in the Book, with an account of the value of them, and how
occupied and tenanted, a particular thereof being given under
the Hand and Seal of the Office to the Owners. We having
thus fitted our ſelves with a publick Regiſtry of all our Lands
and Houſes, whereby it is made ready Money at all times,
without the charge of Law, or the neceſſity of a Lawyer; and
a Law being made for the payment of ſuch large Intereſt for
Monies lent, and the ſecurity being ſo undeniably good, a
Pank will in time ariſe, and ſuch a Bank as will be for the
benefit and advantage of <hi>Pennſilvania</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> and
Trade univerſal.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe my ſelf, and ſome others have in Houſes and
Lands in <hi>Pennſilvania</hi> or <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> worth 3000 <hi>l.</hi> and are
minded to mannage and carry on the Linnen Manufacture,
but cannot do it, without borrowing on Intereſt 2000 <hi>l.</hi>
therefore we come to the Bank in <hi>Pennſilvania</hi> or <hi>New Jerſey,</hi>
and there tender a particular of our Lands and Houſes, and
how occupied or tennanted, being worth 3000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania</hi>
or <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> and deſire them to lend us 2000 <hi>l.</hi>
and we will Mortgage our Land &amp; Houſes for it; the anſwer
will be, <hi>We will ſend to the Regiſter's Office your particular, and
at the return of the Meſſenger you ſhall have your anſwer:</hi> The

Regiſters ſend anſwer, it is our Lands and Houſes, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,
and tenanted, and valued according to the particular,
there needs no more words but to tell us the Money, with
which we carry on the Trade briskly, to the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and advantage of ſome hundreds of People that we ſet to
work, and to the ſupplying of the Inhabitants with Cloth
made of Flax, grown, dreſt, ſpun and wove in our own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
which Trade we could not mannage and carry on
without this credit, but having this credit, we go on with our
Trade comfortably, and the Lender will have his ends anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and his Moneys well ſecured. And its certain, ſuch an
Anchorage, Fund, and Foundation, will then bring out the
Monyes unimployed from all Perſons in theſe Provinces, even
People of all degrees will put in their Monyes, which will be
put out again into Trade to Merchants, and ſuch as ſtand in
need of ready Monyes; and thereby Trade is made eaſie, and
much convenienced.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe ten Families purchaſe in <hi>Pennſilvania</hi> or <hi>New-Jerſey</hi>
five thouſand Acres of Land, and they lay out a ſmall Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in the middle of it, for the conveniency of neighbourhood,
to each Family one hundred Acres for Houſes, Gardens, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,

that by that time they have built their dwelling Houſes, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
Barnes, and other Out-houſes, and have made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures
about their home-lots, that their Monyes is all expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and without a further ſupply to buy Oxen and Horſes to
plow their Land, and Cows to find their Families in Milk,
Butter and Cheeſe, and Sows to breed a ſtock on, they will
live but meanly for ſome time, therefore to amend their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they come to the Bank, and there tender a particular
of their Lands, valued to be worth 1500 <hi>l.</hi> on which they
deſire to take up 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to purchaſe a Stock of Oxen, Horſes,
Cows, Sows, Sheep and Servants, by which they will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled

to carry on their Husbandry to great advantage, and the
benefit of the Province in general; and it may be that in two
or three-years time, they may be able to pay in this Money,
with Intereſt, to the owner; and in two or three years more
may be able to bring into the Bank, to be lent out to others,
one thouſand pounds of their own Eſtates.</p>
            <p>As to the benefit of <hi>publick Granaries</hi> on <hi>Delaware River,</hi>
to keep the Corn for all Merchants, Bakers and Farmers that
pleaſe to ſend it thither, that ſo the deſtruction and damages
occaſioned by Rats and Mice, may be prevented. In this Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
Corn at all times may be taken in, from all Perſons that
pleaſe to ſend it, and the Corn ſo ſent may be preſerved ſweet,
ſafe, and in good Order, at a ſmall charge for a whole year,
and the owner at liberty to take it out at his own will and
pleaſure, or to ſell, transfer or aſſign any part of the ſaid Corn
to any Perſon or Perſons for the payment of his Debts, or to
furniſh himſelf with Clothing, or other Neceſſaries from the
Merchant; and the Granary-keepers to give good ſecurity
that all things ſhould be faithfully done &amp; diſcharged. Now
the Corn being brought into the publick Granary, and there
regiſtred in the Regiſter-Book, to be kept for that purpoſe;
and the Perſon that hath put in the ſaid Corn, taking a Note
under hand and ſeal, from the Granary-Regiſter, of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Corn brought into the Granary, with the time it was
delivered, and the matter and kind of the Corn, then theſe
Advantages will enſue:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Preſervation from the Rats and Mice, Straw to ſupply
his Cattel, the Chaff for his Horſes, and the light Corn to feed
his Pigs and Poultry; his Husbandry mannaged with rule and
order to his advantage; no forc'd haſte, but thraſhing and
carrying the Corn to the Granary in times wherein his ſervants
have leiſure; ſo in ſeeding time &amp; harveſt all People are freed
from that. Beſides, there being at all times ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38228:12"/>
of Corn in the Granaries to load Ships, Merchants from
<hi>Barbadoes</hi> and other places, will come to buy Corn; of one
Farmer he may buy one hundred Buſhels, of another fifty,
and ſo he may buy the Corn that belongs to ſixty or eighty
Farmers, and receive their Notes which they had from the
Granary-Office, which Corn he letteth lie in the Granary until
he have occaſion to uſe it, then he orders his Baker to go with
thoſe notes to the Granary-Office, and receive ſuch quantities
as he hath a mind ſhall be made into Flower and Bisket, which
the Baker does accordingly, and gets it packt up in Casks, and
ſent to <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> the remainder, if he pleaſe, he may full to
ſome other Merchant that lives at <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> or ſome other
place, and when ſold, may deliver the ſaid Merchant the
Notes on the Granary-Office, at ſight whereof they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Corn, if they pleaſe, or they may paſs thoſe Notes
from one to another, as often as they pleaſe, which is all one
as Money, the Corn being lodged ſafe, and kept in the publick
Granary, will be the occaſion of imploying much of the
Caſh of <hi>Pennſilvania</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey;</hi> moſt People near theſe
publick Bank Granaries, will be dealing to have ſome Corn in
Bank-Credit; for that cannot miſs of finding an encreaſe and
benefit to them in the riſe of Corn.</p>
            <p>The beſt places at preſent for the building of <hi>Granaries,</hi> are,
I ſuppoſe, <hi>Burlington</hi> in <hi>Weſt-Jerſey, Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>New-Caſtle</hi>
in <hi>Pennſilvania,</hi> and <hi>New Perth</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> which
places are excellently ſituated, there being many Navigable
Rivers, whereby Trade is very communicable, and the
Corn may be brought in Boats and Sloops from moſt places
now inhabited, by water to theſe publick Granaries, for ſmall
charge, and from the Granaries may be carried to Water-Mills
to grind, which are ſome of them ſo conveniently ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
that Boats may come to the Mill-Tayl, which is alſo a
great conveniency to thoſe that trade much in Corn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:38228:13"/>
Now I will demonſtrate, and ſhew you the length,
breadth and heighth the <hi>Granaries</hi> ought to be of, to hold
this Corn; as alſo the Charge of building one of them, and
the way how it ſhould be built for the beſt advantage, with
the way of ordering and managing the Corn that it may
keep good, ſweet and clean, eight or ten Years. The <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi>
muſt be three hundred Foot long, eighten Foot wide
betwixt inſide and inſide, ſeven Stories high, each Story
ſeven Foot high, all to be built of good well burnt Brick, and
laid in Lime and Sand very well; the ends of the <hi>Granaries</hi>
muſt be ſet <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> ſo the ſides will be <hi>Eaſt</hi> and
<hi>Weſt;</hi> and in the ſides of the <hi>Granaries,</hi> there muſt be large
Windows to open and ſhut cloſe, that when the Wind blows
at <hi>Weſt,</hi> the Windows may be laid open, and then the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
man will be turning and winding the Corn, and all
Filth and Droſs will be blown out at the Window. When
the Weather is fair, then throw open the VVindows, to let
in the Air to the Corn; and in the middle, there muſt be
Stoves to be kept with Fire in them in all moiſt or wet times,
or at going away of great <hi>Froſts</hi> and <hi>Snows,</hi> to prevent moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
either in the Brick-walls, Timber, Boards or Corn.
There muſt be in each ſide of the <hi>Granaries,</hi> three or four long
Troughs or Spouts fixt in the uppermoſt Loft, which muſt
run about twenty Foot out of the <hi>Granary;</hi> and in fine
VVeather, the <hi>Granary</hi> men muſt be throwing the Corn out
of the uppermoſt Loft, and ſo it will fall into another Spout
made ten Foot wide at the top, and through that Spout the
Corn deſcends into the lowermoſt Loft, and then wound up
on the inſide of the <hi>Granary,</hi> by a Crane fixt for that purpoſe,
and the Corn receiving the benefit of the Air, falling down
thirty Foot before it comes into the ſecond Spout, cleanſeth
it from its filth and Chaff; theſe Spouts are to be taken off
and on, as occaſion requires, and to be fixt to another of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38228:13"/>
Lofts, that when Veſſels come to load Corn, they may
through theſe Spouts convey the Corn into the Boats or
Sloops, without any thing of Labour, by carrying it on the
Backs of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The charge of one</hi> Granary <hi>three Hundred Foot long,
eighteen Foot wide, ſeven Stories high, ſeven Foot betwixt
each Story, being built with Brick in</hi> England, <hi>as by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of</hi> Andrew Yarenton, <hi>take as followeth;</hi> Six hundred
thouſand of Bricks builds a <hi>Granary,</hi> two Bricks and a half thick
the two firſt Stories, two Bricks thick the three next Stories, Brick
and a half thick the two uppermoſt Stories; and the Brick will be
made and delivered on the Place for eight Shillings the Thouſand,
the laying of Brick three Shillings the Thouſand, Lime and Sand
two Shillings the Thouſand; ſo Brick-laying, Lime and Sand will
be thirteen Shillings the Thouſand, one hundred and fifty Tuns of
Oak for Summers-Joiſts and Roof, 170 l. Boards for the ſix
Stories, ſixty thouſand Foot, at 13 s. 4 d. The one hundred Foot
and ten thouſand Foot for Window-Doors and Spouts at the ſame
rate, 48 l. Laths and Tiles 100 <hi>l.</hi> Carpenters work 70 l. Iron,
Nails, and odd things 60 <hi>l.</hi> So the charge of a Granary will be
800 <hi>l.</hi> There will be kept in this <hi>Granary</hi> fourteen thouſand
Quarters of Corn, which is two thouſand Quarters in every Loft,
which will be a thouſand Buſhels in every Bay; ſix labouring men,
with one Clerk, will be ſufficient to manage this <hi>Granary,</hi> to turn
and wind the Corn, and keep the Books of Accounts; fifteen
pounds a piece allowed to the ſix men, and thirty pound a year to the
Clark or Regiſter, will be Wages ſufficient; ſo the Servants Wages
will be 120 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> allow ten in the hundred for Monies laid
out for building the <hi>Granaries,</hi> which is 80 <hi>l.</hi> ſo the charge will be
yearly 200 <hi>l.</hi> Now if the Country-man pay ſix pence a Quarter
yearly for keeping his Corn ſafe and ſweet in the Granary, fourteen
thouſand Quarters will come to 350 <hi>l.</hi> for Granary-Rent yearly.</p>

above one third higher, <hi>viz.</hi> a Cow and Calf valued

and other things advance much after the ſame proportion.</p>
            <p>My five thouſand Acres of Land coſt me 100 <hi>l.</hi> I had of
the ten Families for the one thouſand Acres diſpoſed of to
them 50 <hi>l.</hi> my Town or City Lots will yield me currant 50 <hi>l.</hi>
by which it appears I am nothing out on the four thouſand
Acres that is left.</p>
            <p>I get my five thouſand Acres ſurveyed and laid out to me,
out of which I lay out for the ten Families one thouſand Acres,
which may be ſo divided, as that each family may live near
one to the other; I intend with them to let the Money lie in
their hands ſix years, for which they to pay me each family,
8 <hi>l</hi> a year, in conſideration of the one hundred pound a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
laid out for them, and at the expiration of the ſix years,
they to pay me my 1000 <hi>l.</hi> viz. each family 100 <hi>l.</hi> as by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
my Money being paid me, I am unwilling to let it lie
dead, therefore I lay out in the middle of my Land one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Acres, which I divide into ten lots, in form and manner
as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before then I intend, with fifty Servants to ſerve me four
years a piece, I place them on the Land, <hi>viz.</hi> five on each lot.
Their Paſſage, and in goods to purchaſe Cattel and Proviſions,
&amp;c. is to each five ſervants 100 <hi>l.</hi> as before is explained: Now
I order a Houſe to be built, and Orchards, Gardens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures
to be made, and Husbandry affairs to be carried on on
each lot; ſo that at the four years end as the ſervants time is
expired, I ſhall have ten Farms, each containing four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Acres; for the one thouſand Acres being laid out in the
middle of my Land, the remaining three thouſand Acres
joyns to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38228:15"/>
My ſervants time being expired, I am willing to ſee what
charge I am out upon theſe ten Farms and Stock, in order to
know what I have gain'd in the ten years paſt, over and above
8 <hi>l. per Cent. Intereſt,</hi> that is allowed me for the uſe of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
I am out by the firſt charge 1000 <hi>l.</hi> &amp; the Intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
for four years, at 8 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> is for the four years 320 l. ſo that
the whole charge on the ten Farms, Principal &amp; Intereſt, comes
to 1300 l. Now if I value my ten Farms but at 400 l. each,
which is 20 <hi>s. per Acre,</hi> one with another; then the whole
will be 4000 l. beſides the firſt Stock of Cattel and Hogs, &amp;c
to each Plantation, with its Increaſe for four years, which Stock
coſt at firſt to each Farm 30 <hi>l.</hi> in goods at firſt coſt, but is
worth 40 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling, at which rate the Stock on the ten
Farms coſt 400 <hi>l.</hi> and if we account the four years Increaſe
to be no more than the firſt Stock, yet that is 400 <hi>l.</hi> by which
it appears that the ten Farms, and the ſtock on them is worth
4800 <hi>l.</hi> out of which deduct the Money laid out, which with
Intereſt is 1320 <hi>l.</hi> So the the Neat profit, beſides 8 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi>
allowed for Intereſt, is for this ten years improvement, 3480 <hi>l.</hi>
and twenty Families ſet at liberty from that extream Slavery
that attended them, by reaſon of great Poverty that they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in <hi>England,</hi> and muſt have ſo continued, had not they
been thus redeemed by coming into <hi>America.</hi> It may be
thought that this is too great an undertaking for one man,
which if it be, then I propoſe that ten joyn together in this
community, and each man ſend over five Servants, of which
let one of them be an honeſt man that underſtands Country
buſineſs, as an Overſeer, which if we allow him over and
above his Paſſage and Diet 20 <hi>l.</hi> a year for his four years ſervice,
this amounts to 80 <hi>l.</hi> which is for the ten farms 800 <hi>l.</hi> which
being deducted out of the 3480 <hi>l.</hi> there only remains 2680 <hi>l.</hi>
clear profit to the ten men, which is for each man 268 <hi>l.</hi> for
his ten years improvement of his 100 <hi>l.</hi> and his 100 <hi>l.</hi> back
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38228:16"/>
again with Intereſt for all the time at 8 <hi>l per Cent. per annum,</hi>
the whole producing 448 <hi>l.</hi> for his 100 <hi>l.</hi> firſt laid out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some may object, and ſay,</hi> They cannot believe the Land of
each farm, with its Improvements, will ſell at 20 s. an Acre, that
is, at twelve years purchaſe 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per Acre per annum.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
three hundred Acres of it is as it was, <hi>viz.</hi> Rough Woods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Anſwer;</hi> That although it be ſo, yet theſe Woods are
made valuable by the twenty Families that are ſeated near
them, the firſt ten families having been ſettled ten years, the
laſt four years; for ſome are willing to have their Children live
near them; and and they having but one hundred Acres in
all, it will not be will to divide that, therefore they will
give a good price for one hundred Acres, to ſettle a Child upon,
to live by them, as experience ſheweth; for in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi>
which is not far from us, Land rough in the Woods, not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than ours, will ſell at 40 <hi>s.</hi> an Acre, which is 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d per Acre
per annum.</hi> Therefore, Reader, I hope now thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that there is a probability that what I here inform thee
of, will prove true, caſualties of Fire, &amp;c. excepted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> are but few in Number, and have been very
ſerviceable to us by ſelling us Veniſon, <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, Peaſe

other Skins and Furs; the Men hunt, Fiſh and Fowl, and the
Women plant the Corn, and carry Burthens; they are many
of them of a good Underſtanding, conſidering their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and in their publick Meetings of Buſineſs, they have
excellent Order, one ſpeaking after another, and while one
is ſpeaking all the reſt keep ſilent, and do not ſo much as
whiſper one to the other: We had ſeveral Meetings with
them, one was in order to put down the ſale of <hi>Rum, Brandy,</hi>
and other ſtrong Liquors to them, they being a People that
have not Government of themſelves, ſo as to drink it in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

at which time there were eight Kings, (&amp; many other

            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Indian <hi>Kings ſate on a Form, and we ſate on another
over againſt them; they had prepared four Belts of</hi> Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum,
<hi>(ſo their current Money is called, being Black and
White</hi> Beads <hi>made of a Fiſh Shell) to give us as Seals of
the Covenant they made with us; one of the Kings by the
conſent and appointment of the reſt ſtood up and made
this following Speech;</hi> The ſtrong Liquors was firſt ſold us by
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and they were blind, they had no Eyes, they did not
ſee that it was for our hurt; and the next People that came
amongſt us, were the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> who continued the ſale of thoſe
ſtrong Liquors to us: they were alſo Blind, they had no Eyes, they
did not ſee it to be hurtful to us to drink it, although we know it to
be hurtful to us; but if People will ſell it us, we are ſo in love
with it, that we cannot forbear it; when we drink it, it makes us
mad; we do not know what we do, we then abuſe one another; we
throw each other into the Fire, ſeven Score of our People have
been killed, by reaſon of the drinking of it, ſince the time it was
firſt ſold us: Thoſe People that ſell it, they are blind, they have no
Eyes, but now there is a People come to live amongſt us, that have
Eyes, they ſee it to be for our Hurt, and we know it to be for our
Hurt: They are willing to deny themſelves of the Profit of it for
our good; theſe People have Eyes; we are glad ſuch a People are
come amongſt us. We muſt put it down by mutual conſent; the
Cask muſt be ſealed up, it muſt be made faſt, it muſt not leak by
Day nor by Night, in the Light, nor in the Dark,
and we give you theſe four Belts of <hi>Wampam,</hi> which we would
have you lay up ſafe, and keep by you to be Witneſs of this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that we make with you, and we would have you tell your
Children, that theſe four Belts of <hi>Wampam</hi> are given you to be

               <p>IT was my deſire, that my Brother's Son, <hi>Jahkurſoe</hi> ſhould
be ſent for to come to me to hear my laſt Words, whom
I have appointed King after me. My Brother's Son, this
day I deliver my Heart into thy Boſom, and would have
thee love that which is Good, and to keep good Company,
and to refuſe that which is Evil; and to avoid bad Company.
Now inaſmuch as I have delivered my Heart into thy Boſom
I alſo deliver my Boſom to keep my Heart therein; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alwayes be ſure to walk in a good Path, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of it. And if any <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould ſpeak any evil of
<hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> do not joyn with it, but to look to that
which is Good, and to joyn with the ſame alwayes. Look
at the Sun from the Riſing of it to the Setting of the ſame.
In Speeches that ſhall be made between the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
if any thing be ſpoke that is evil, do not joyn with that,
but joyn with that which is good; and when Speeches are
made, do not thou ſpeak firſt, but let all ſpeak before thee,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38228:17"/>
and take good notice what each man ſpeaks, and when thou
haſt heard all, joyn to that which is good. Brother's Son,
I would have thee to cleanſe thy Ears, and take all Darkneſs
and Foulneſs out, that thou mayſt take notice of that which
is Good and Evil, and then to joyn with that which is
Good, and refuſe the Evil; and alſo to cleanſe thy Eyes,
that thou mayeſt ſee both Good and Evil; and if thou ſee
and Evil, do not joyn with it, but joyn to that which is
Good. Brother's Son, Thou haſt heard all that is paſt;
now I would have thee to ſtand up in time of <hi>Speeches,</hi> and
to ſtand in my <hi>Steps,</hi> and follow my <hi>Speeches</hi> as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, then what thou doſt deſire in Reaſon will be
granted thee. Why ſhouldſt thou not follow my Example,
inaſmuch as I have had a mind to do that which is Good, and
therefore do thou alſo the ſame? Whereas <hi>Sehoppy</hi> and <hi>Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi>
were appointed Kings by me in my ſtead, and I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by my Doctor, that <hi>Sehoppy</hi> ſecretly adviſed him
not to cure me, and they both being with me at <hi>John Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſhead's</hi>

I had a mind to make a Speech to them, and to my Breathren

God giveth Man an underſtanding of what is Good, and what is
Bad, and after this Life rewardeth the Good with Bleſſings, and
the Bad according to their Doings; <hi>to which he anſwered and
ſaid,</hi> It is very true, it is ſo, there are two Wayes, a broad Way,
and a ſtrait Way; there be two Paths, a broad Path and a ſtrait

               <head>Something in Relation to a Conference had with the Indians at

               <p>THe <hi>Indians</hi> told us, they were adviſed to make War on

They were told, that we ſold them the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> with the

That we came amongſt them by their own conſent, and had

Some are apt to ask, How we can propoſe ſafely to live
amongſt ſuch a Heathen Poople as the Indians, whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practices leads them to War and Bloodſhed and our
Principles and Practices leading us to love Enemies, and if
reviled, not to revile again; and if ſmitten on the one cheek
to turn the other, and we being a peaceable People, whoſe
Principles and Practices are againſt Wars and Fightings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer:</hi> That we ſettled by the Indians conſent and
good liking, and bought the Land of them, that we <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

which they conveyed to us by Deed under their Hands and
Seals, and alſo ſubmitted to ſeveral Articles of agreement
with us, viz. <hi>Not to do us any Injury;</hi> but if it ſhould
ſo happen, that any of their People at any time ſhould injure
or do harm to any of us, then they to make us ſatisfaction
for the Injury done; therefore if they break theſe Covenants

other Offendors, <hi>viz.</hi> to be kept in ſubjection to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
Power, in whoſe hand the Sword of Juſtice is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be uſed by him, for the puniſhment of Evil-doers,
and praiſe of them that do well; therefore I do believe it to
be both lawful and expedient to bring Offendors to Juſtice by
the power of the Magiſtrates Sword, which is not to be uſed
in vain, but may be uſed againſt ſuch as raiſe Rebellions and
Inſurrections againſt the Government of the Country, be they
<hi>Indians</hi> or others, otherwiſe it is in vain for us to pretend to
Magiſtracy or Government, it being that which we own to
be lawful both in Principle and Practice.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there be no Bears, Wolves, and other Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous

               <p>

ſome hundreds of Miles, and by miſſing of my way have lain
in the Woods all night, and yet I never ſaw any of thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
nor have I heard that ever man, woman or child were

hurt by them, they being afraid of Mankind; alſo, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
is given to both <hi>Indians</hi> and others to kill Wolves,
they being paid for every Wolfs head that they bring to the
Magiſtrate, the value of ten Shillings; and the Bears the
<hi>Indians</hi> kill for the profit of their Skins, and ſake of their Fleſh,
which they eat, and eſteem better than Deers fleſh.</p>

diſcovered; for they commonly lie in the Paths for the benefit
of the Sun, &amp; if any Perſon draws nigh them, they ſhake their
Tail, on which the Rattles grow, which make a noiſe like a

Oh the <hi>Breathing</hi> and ſervent <hi>Prayers,</hi> and earneſt <hi>Deſires</hi>
that vvere in your Hearts to the Lord, <hi>That you might not go
except it was his good Pleaſure to remove you, for a purpoſe of his

of you received ſatisfaction, that it was your places to leave
your Native Country, Trades, and near and dear Relations
and Friends to tranſplant your ſelves into a Wilderneſs,
where you expected to meet with many Tryals and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of a differing kind, than what you had met withal in
your Native Country; but this you contentedly gave up to,
but not without earneſt deſire, and ſervent Prayers to the
Lord for his Wiſdom to govern you, and his Fatherly Care
to preſerve you, and his comfortable preſence to be with you,
to ſtrengthen and enable you chearfuly to undergo thoſe new
and unaccuſtomed Tryals and Exerciſes, that you were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
would attend you in this weighty undertaking, the Lord
heard your Prayers, and anſwered your Deſires, inaſmuch as
that his Fatherly Care was over you, and his living Preſence

did accompany you over the great Deep; ſo that you ſaw
his wonderful Deliverence, and in a ſence thereof, you prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Name for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Lord having thus far anſwered our Souls deſire, as
to bring us to our deſired Port in ſafety, and to remain with
as, to be a Counſellor of good things unto us, let us now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

may be convinced thereby, and may glorifie our heavenly

               <p>The Eyes of many are on us, ſome for Good, and ſome

               <p>
                  <hi>Dear Friends;</hi> be tender and helpful one towards another,

out the precious Life, and make us barren and unfruitful to
