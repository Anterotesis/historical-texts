            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHen I had read the REPORT, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Author's Pains, and the Search he had
made, and thereby brought to light, the ſtate of
our Coin for many Ages; I could not but approve his Induſtry
and Care in this ſo great a Concern, as our Nation hath of late
labour'd under.</p>
            <p>And therefore gave my ſelf diligently to conſider, what
weight might be in thoſe that oppoſe his Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49237:2"/>
And to examine the force of their Arguments, it may not
be improper to reduce them to a few Heads, wherein I hope
to Contract the Subſtance of their ſeveral ſtrongeſt Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
at leaſt ſo far as may be worth notice.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall begin with theirs, who ſay,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Alteration of our Coin to be leſs in Weight than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
will be of no Advantage to us.</item>
               <item>2. Our Money will then purchaſe no more of Inland or Forreign
Commodities than before; becauſe Wares will riſe proportionable to
the advance in Money, ſo that Silver by the Ounce will buy no more
Goods than it did before.</item>
               <item>3. The Exchange they ſay, will always follow our ſtate of the Coin,
be it Better or Worſe.</item>
               <item>4. 'Twill have no influence to make Coin'd or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncoin'd Silver
more plenty among us.</item>
               <item>5. The Ballance of Trade ſometimes requires, that Bullion either
Coin'd or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncoin'd, muſt be ſent out of the Nation; and when it
comes abroad, they'll put no more Value on it than before.</item>
               <item>6. All Bargainers will be Cheated, in receiving leſs than their
Agreements, as Landlords leſs Rents, Merchants leſs Silver in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the King leſs Taxes.</item>
               <item>7. That Forreigner's that have Lent to the Crown, will have leſs
by receiving Smaller Money, and thereby be diſcourag'd from Lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again.</item>
               <item>8. That all theſe together will Ruin us.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And in order to plenary Satisfaction to all Unbyaſſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
I ſhall endeavour to Anſwer them one by one.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>'Tis Alledged,</hi> The Alteration of our Coin to be leſs in Weight
than heretofore, will be of no Advantage to us.</p>
            <p>I humbly propoſe it will; for as we have cauſe to believe,
former Ages ſaw good Reaſons from time to time to lighten
our Coin, from 20 <hi>s. 3 d.</hi> for the Pound Troy-weight, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49237:2"/>
3 <hi>l. 2 s.</hi> ſo I hope to demonſtrate our Governours now have
cauſe, if they New-Coin the Money to lighten it yet once
more, from 3 <hi>l. 2 s.</hi> the Pound Troy-weight, to about 3 <hi>l.
18 s.</hi> or 4 <hi>l.</hi> eſpecially if it ſhall be conſider'd, that if it be now
Coin'd at the ſaid Rate of 4 <hi>l.</hi> to a Pound Troy-weight, it is
but to continue it about its preſent ſtate; whereas it muſt be
granted, that to New-Coin it at the old weight, is to make an
Alteration, and that at a time very unfit, when the Nation is
in an Expenſive War, and when Forreigners have great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
here, which they want to carry Home.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>But ſay they,</hi> If our Money be New-Coin'd lighter, 'twill
purchaſe no more Inland or Forreign Commodities than before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Wares do and will riſe proportionable to the Advance in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
ſo that Silver by the Ounce will buy no more than it did before.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, that Poſition is not always true, nor is it the only
Reaſon of our preſent Advance on Goods, but 'tis complicated
with other Cauſes, as the Loſſes of great quantities of Goods
by the War, eſpecially homewards, whereby thoſe Goods that
are left Sell quick, and would have Sold quick, had the ſtate
of our Money remain'd as formerly; for may it not be well-acknowledged
what great Rates (even as great as now)
Goods Sold at in a former War, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>Anno</hi> 1667?</p>
            <p>And yet the Money was then almoſt twice as heavy as now.
And tho' we ſhould make it heavy again, yet it may moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
be judged Forreign Goods will Sell quick and high,
while Trade is liable to the Obſtructions and Hazards of War:
But ſhould the making our Coin heavier, thereby make our
own Commodities Cheaper, I hope there's none but will
grant, that were then <hi>England</hi>'s great Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Again,</hi> They ſay the Exchange will always follow our ſtate of
the Coin, be it Better or Worſe.</p>
            <p>But that I deny, for this Age hath furniſht us with Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the contrary; and that when our Coin was weighty,
the Exchange ſometimes varied heretofore greatly, upon great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49237:3"/>
Emergencies of State and Trade, as well as now, and yet it
was then eſteem'd, no Cauſe of altering our Money; nor was
the Exchange ſo much alter'd this time Twelve-month, tho'
our Money was then near as Bad as now, and worſe than it
would be, were it New-Coin'd at a quarter or third part leſs in
weight, than the old Standard.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they argue to our Loſs, who ſay, The Exchange
will riſe in proportion to our New-Coining the Money, if we
make it of the old weight. And to ſhew they propoſe our
Loſs, let's draw their Argument into a Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe by their Rule our Pound Sterling ſhould again be
made near Four Ounces, then the Exchange will riſe to <hi>35s.</hi>
Flemiſh <hi>per</hi> Pound Sterling.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay, How can they tell that? Yet for the preſent
let's grant it, and then we ſhall ſee that One Ounce weight of
our Silver purchaſeth 8 <hi>s. 9 d.</hi> Flemiſh, and Four Ounces at
8 <hi>s. 9 d.</hi> Flemiſh <hi>per</hi> Pound Sterling is 35 <hi>s.</hi> Flemiſh.</p>
            <p>Which I hope is thus demonſtrable to be vaſtly our Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
for our preſent ſtate of the Coin and Exchange is 30 <hi>per
Cent.</hi> better; becauſe now our Pound Sterling while it weighs
but about Two Ounces and a half, is worth about 28 <hi>s. 4 d.</hi>
Flemiſh, whereby we have 11 <hi>s. 4 d. per</hi> Ounce weight of
Silver; ſo that the Change they would have us make (by
their own Rule) is viſibly 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Loſs to <hi>England;</hi> as
you may ſee by Subſtracting the Purchaſe of One Ounce of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in Flemiſh Money at their Rate, which is 8 <hi>s. 9 d.</hi> from
the preſent Courſe, which is 11 <hi>s. 4 d.</hi> the difference where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is 2 <hi>s. 7 d.</hi> and that is about 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if the Subject hath occaſion then to remit 1000 <hi>l.</hi> of
New-Money of Four Ounces to the Pound, at 35 <hi>s.</hi> Flemiſh,
he will loſe 300 <hi>l.</hi> by it, of what he would do, to remit
1000 <hi>l.</hi> of our preſent Money at our preſent Exchange of 28 <hi>s.
4 d.</hi> And if the King were to remit Three Millions in Pound
Sterling of Four Ounces at 35 <hi>s.</hi> Flemiſh <hi>per</hi> Pound, he would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49237:3"/>
loſe near a Million by it, of what he would do at the preſent
Exchange, by the aforeſaid Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>Their Fourth Miſtake is, <hi>'Twill have no influence to make
Coin'd or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncoin'd Silver more plenty amongſt us;</hi> and they give
ſome Reaſons for it, as they think, but they go but a little
way: They ſay indeed, If the Silver be Coin'd a quarter or
third part leſs, Commodities will riſe proportionable, ſo that
I ſhall then Buy no more Commodities with a Hundred
Ounces of Silver than I did before. But did I yield them that to
be true; yet here they go from their own Arguments, which
was, that it would not make either Coin'd or Uncoin'd Silver
more plentiful, which I call their Miſtake; for let them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in that Country where a Commodity will yield moſt, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
'twill go, and that made Forreigners get our Crown-pieces;
and if our Coin be New made about a quarter or third
part lighter, and our old Crowns made to go at 6 <hi>s. 3 d.</hi> or 6 <hi>s.
8 d.</hi> 'twill make our old Crown-pieces return hither again,
if any of them are abroad unmelted: It being certain, as I ſaid,
that in what Country any thing is moſt Valued thither 'twill
go. And ſo much Silver come to our Mint.</p>
            <p>And as the new Coining our Crown-pieces one quarter or
one third part lighter, may bring back ſome old Ones; ſo
'twill certainly bring us in great quantity of Bullion to be
Coin'd; for if it be worth, as they ſay, but 5 s. 2 d. <hi>per</hi> Ounce
abroad, yet if an Ounce Coin'd here, be worth 6 s. 3 d. or
6 s. 8 d. 'twill invite all the Bullion in <hi>Europe</hi> hither to be
Coin'd, or to be ſold as Bullion: For it's granted, Bullion
alſo will hold up the Price, if the new Crown-pieces be Coin'd
one quarter or one third part lighter.</p>
            <p>5. They think, <hi>the Ballance of Trade ſometimes requires that
Bullion either Coin'd or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncoin'd muſt be ſent out of the Nation,
and when it comes abroad, ſay they, Forreigners will put no
more value on it than before.</hi> I Anſwer, That's a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
at this time, and if ever true, 'tis only when we are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49237:4"/>
of Egregious Falſe Policy, in valuing our Coin lower than
other Nations: Which the better to prove, let's obſerve a
little of what this Ballance of Trade is; and it is, when there
is Imported into <hi>England</hi> in Goods twelve hundred thouſand
pound in a Year, and Exported but eleven hundred thouſand
pound, there the Ballance of Trade is one hundred thouſand
pound which <hi>England</hi> is Debtor. Which, ſay they, muſt be paid
in Money. I ſay no Neceſſity for that, for ſuppoſe one of thoſe
Forreigners, that ſent in part of the Goods which belongs to
this Ballance of Trade, he never thinks of that, but bethinks
him how moſt to his Profit to draw home his Eſtate; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Exchange, or by Manufactures, or Bullion Coin'd or
Uncoin'd: And if he chuſes Bullion, 'tis becauſe that is more
valued in his own Countrey than here, and perhaps will yield
him more Profit then he can get by Commodities, ſo that 'tis
our Silver and Gold being too often under-valued here makes
them be taken away, and our Commodities left, and not any
otherwiſe does our over-Ballance of Trade moſtly come, for
can any Merchant tell the Time when he might not have laid
out his Money plentifully enough in Cloath, Serges, Lead,
Tyn, Leather, <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without ever carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away our Coin, and that upon a ſuppos'd Neceſſity?</p>
            <p>Again, whenever we value our Gold and Silver leſs than
Forreigners, it tends to lower our Commodities, and our
Rents, and our Lands; as when Guineas went here at 22s.
and abroad at 23s. then were they often carryed out, and the
Commodities left, and the Commodities thereby falling, muſt
need fall the Land they riſe out of. And the Tenant and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupier
of Land, not being able to ſell his Produce, can't pay his
Rent; therefore Landlords look you to it, if you make the
Money fit for Forreigners to carry away, you lower your Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
Manufactures, and your Lands produce firſt, and then
your Lands alſo.</p>
            <p>Another Erroneous part of their pretence is, that let us over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49237:4"/>
our Coin never ſo much, Forreigners will not follow us
therein.</p>
            <p>But the contrary is evident, and I appeal to any Man of
Knowledge herein; Whether Guineas han't of late been ſold
for more Gilders in <hi>Holland</hi> ſince <hi>May-day,</hi> than this Time
twelve-Month, ſo that at laſt 'twas hardly worth their while
to bring them hither?</p>
            <p>And before I go from this Propoſition about the over-Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Trade, I would offer one Conſideration more,
<hi>viz.</hi> Whenever our Money is more profitable to Export than
Commodities, it makes <hi>England</hi> Debtor upon the Ballance of
Trade; and that too in a very diſadvantageous Caſe, for we
thereby exchange an unperiſhable Commodity, as our Coin is
allowed to be, for periſhable Commodities; I mean for Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Drinking and Apparel, and this has been to often our
Caſe, while we had broad Money, or Guineas left, that they
could get by fetching away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next Propoſition to be anſwer'd is, if the Money be
made leſs than formerly,</hi> all Bargainers will be cheated in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leſs than their Agreements, as Landlords, leſs Rents, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
leſs Silver, and the King leſs Taxes.</p>
            <p>But pray conſider, did the Landlord Lett his Land to be paid
in Money as big again, as that which is Current? Or did the
Merchant ſell his Goods to be paid in a new Coin? Or the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee
to be paid in bigger Money then he Lent? No ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
therefore if the Money be new Coin'd larger, than it has
been this Year or two; 'twill be as great a loſs in reality upon
he that pays great Money, as 'tis in pretence on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>But ſay they, Forreigners that have Lent to the Crown, will
have loſs by receiving it back in ſmaller Money, and thereby be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from lending again.</p>
            <p>And now methinks, I could be glad the whole Cauſe were
to be tried on this one Iſſue: For, did Forreigners lend to the
Crown Money of four Ounces to a Pound Sterling? Or did
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49237:5"/>
they lend ſuch as was Current; and ſuch as they Lent, ſuch
let them have again; if they Lent hundred Pound Bags of 16.
or 18 <hi>l.</hi> weight, let them have ſuch again. But what Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is it to Coin them new Money of 32 <hi>l.</hi> in a hundred Pound,
to pay them who Lent but 16 <hi>l.</hi> or 18 <hi>l.</hi> in a hundred Pound;
pray conſider well of it.</p>
            <p>For hereby you'll prevent Forreigners from lending any
more; becauſe when you have paid them in ſuch weighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
away goes their Eſtates that are here with this new heavy
Money, and ſo they leave none here to lend.</p>
            <p>Whereas keep but Forreigners Stocks here, which are come
over in Guineas, and you may have Money enough. Lent, and
that at Intereſt low enough: For they can't carry back their
Eſtates as yet, and great Eſtates without doubt they have
here, by the pouring in Guineas, and lowering the Exchange;
which brings me to their eighth Argument</p>
            <p>8. Wherein they ſay, the Conſequence is, <hi>That all theſe
things will ruin us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They mean, unleſs the Money be made heavy by a ſpeedy
Alteration of the Coin to the old weight.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to which, I offer this Poſition, and hope the
following Lines will prove it.</p>
            <p>That if an Alteration be now made of the Coin, to about an
Ounce of Silver in a Crown-piece, 'twill be ruinous to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that in a very vaſt degree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis evident, the War and our Neighbours have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away, our <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Goods, and our home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made
Commodities alſo: And if the Silver be made heavy as
formerly, there's enow will carry that away too.</p>
            <p>Nor will they then leave us the Gold; for if we new-Coin
our Silver Money heavy, that will lower the Guineas; and
that will infallibly carry them away too; nay, perhaps to the
profit of thoſe very Men that got 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> by bringing them
in; and may get near half as much, by carrying them away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49237:5"/>
Nor will it be leſs fatal to us in the Exchange, for if they of
the other ſide are in the right, they expect our Pound Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(when we ſhall make it weigh near four Ounces) to
procure us but 35s. Flemiſh, which is about 8 s. 9 d. an
Ounce.</p>
            <p>Whereas at preſent, we have 11 s. 4 d. Flemiſh, for an
Ounce of Silver, as is before demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>So that to alter our Money at this Time, is to make the
Exporters thereof a profit, which they greatly deſire; and
they will greatly admire our Prudence, ſo to fit our Crowns
to their Politick-Heads, and our Coin to their Covetous Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all the fatality attends us, from their carrying
back their Eſtates in Coin, who brought it in Guineas; but
it will alſo ſtop their laying out their Stocks, (they have here)
in Engliſh Produce and Manufactures, which they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to buy, and will go on to do, if we don't inconſiderately
furniſh them another way to carry off their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>For it muſt be granted, that, though ſome of the Guineas
that came, were ſent for by our own People: Yet vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of them, were ſent hither by Forreigners; and of ſuch
Forreigners Eſtates prodigious ſumms, may well be ſuppoſed
to lye here ſtill, and groan to get home; and therefore they
uſe their skill, to have the ſame Guineas, or other Coin adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their devices.</p>
            <p>Nor is it Forreigners only; but alſo ſome of our own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
would by it make themſelves an advantage; and they are
of two ſorts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as are for any gain they can come at, and will
venture Exporting Money when ſo very profitable, though it
be ſo poſitively againſt Law; which fairer Traders ſcorn to
do: And to give thoſe Secret deſigners, an opportunity to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
Honeſter Men, is no true Policy; if it were not attended
with theſe general damages to the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49237:6"/>
The other ſort of our own People, that fall in with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of Forreigners; may be thoſe, who have undertaken
to remit Money for the Government, and they will needs get
by their Trade, and 'tis very good Reaſon they ſhould; yet
can't they propoſe another way, than that, which will rob us
of our Treaſure.</p>
            <p>For that's the plain Conſequence of making our Money ſo
heavy.</p>
            <p>Ever ſince <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. the weight has robb'd us of it, by
Exporting, or Melting, or both.</p>
            <p>And is not 35 Years Experience ſufficient to ſhew us, we
muſt take a contrary Method, if ever we will preſerve it here?</p>
            <p>For thoſe deſigning Men, whoſe Intereſt it is to Melt or
Tranſport it, will hardly forbear, though it were ever ſo Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
becauſe they can tranſact it with Privacy.</p>
            <p>Therefore, conſider the Propoſals in Eſquire <hi>Lowns</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:
Where he doth not only propoſe as our Advantage,
that our Coin be made lighter. But ſhews, that in former
Times our Anceſtors did often find occaſion ſo to do, and
pray what diſhonour did ever attend their making it leſſer;
when they kept up to the Fineneſs?</p>
            <p>It may be granted, when the Money has been made Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
they have ſoon found Reaſon to alter it.</p>
            <p>But did they ever ſee cauſe to reform, after they had light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
it? And what ever Reaſons they had, we ſeem to have
much more.</p>
            <p>For I appeal to all judicious Men, whether ever Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had ſuch vaſt Eſtates here as now, and when they pleaſe
to have them home, have they any more then theſe four Ways,
<hi>viz.</hi> in Silver, in Gold, in Exchange, or in Goods?</p>
            <p>1. They can't carry away our Silver at the preſent value of
it here, not Uncoin'd Silver, becauſe 'tis worth here 6 s. 5 d.
and abroad about 5 s. 2 d. nor can they carry it off in our
Coin as it now is, (or if new Coin'd at one quarter or one
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49237:6"/>
third part advance) becauſe it goes for much more here, then
it would there.</p>
            <p>But ſhould our Silver be reduc'd, that one Pound Sterling
ſhould have in it near four Ounces of Silver, away they'd car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that.</p>
            <p>Or ſhould we thereby lower Uncoin'd Silver to 5 s. 2 d.
upon a ſmall turn of the Exchange, away goes that too.</p>
            <p>And the Conſequence is the ſame upon Guineas; and pray
conſider, that unleſs they will take them of us at that Rate,
we have took them from them, they ought not to carry them
away; but rather leave them where they are.</p>
            <p>3. Nor can they carry it all away by Exchange; for if ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many of them ſhould go about that, t'would lower the
Exchange to their loſs; perhaps more than they got by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Guineas.</p>
            <p>But as the Caſe now is, 'tis their Intereſt, as well as our
own, to keep up the Exchange.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if we gratifie them in falling our Guineas, and
greatening our Silver, 'twill alſo raiſe the Exchange: So that
then they have three ways to chuſe, and may leave our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
to fall.</p>
            <p>But ſhould we ſo ſee their devices (and the ruine impends
us thereby) as to avoid fitting their Intereſt, in either of the
ſaid three ways; then they have but one left, and that's the
Fourth.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Viz.</hi> To carry off our Commodities, and they are Men
but of ſhort ſight, that ſee not how greatly that will ſtill raiſe
our Commodities: Although perhaps they are as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
already, as the Guineas are.</p>
            <p>Yet for the Forreigners to carry back their Eſtates in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities;
the Engliſh growth and Manufacture, and that of
our Plantations, muſt yet ſtill advance; to the great enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Induſtrious Nation.</p>
            <p>And were it not falſe Policy with a witneſs, to loſe this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49237:7"/>
opportunity of ſelling our Goods 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> above whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they would give for them, when they could get by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away our Coin: Eſpecially, when we have given them ſo
dear for their Money.</p>
            <p>Rather let it ſtay and circulate three Times, through the
Manufactures of <hi>England,</hi> while our Goods are at theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
Prizes; then in the thrice circulating, we ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
get the advance, the Guineas has got, but alſo the whole
Guinea.</p>
            <p>But they ſay, if our Commodities are ſo dear, they won't
turn to account abroad: That I deny too, unleſs there was
another <hi>Virginia</hi> to afford them Tobacco, or another <hi>Barbadoes</hi>
to yield them Sugar, or another <hi>England</hi> to yield them broad
Cloaths, Serges, Kerſies, Bays, and Stockins, Lead, Tin,
and Leather; for ſeeing this is the Store-houſe, from whence
they muſt have theſe uſeful Commodities for Trade; when
they have them abroad, they'll go near to ask as much profit
upon them, as they did before, when bought here at 40 <hi>per
Cent.</hi> leſs.</p>
            <p>And though it be objected, That they who bought early,
whether Forreigners or Engliſh, will under-ſell the Dear Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at Markets abroad; yet that will ſoon be over, and then
all may run equal.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if we continue our Coin, about the weight the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Money now is, Silver will hold about 6 <hi>s. 5 d.</hi> or 6 <hi>d.</hi>
and that may Incourage Forreigners to ſend theirs hither, and
that will raiſe the price with them, as it has done with us;
and ſo it hath done already with Guineas, for they could not
lately be bought, to bring hither with much Advantage; but
'twill be with large Advantage they'll carry them out, and
our New Money too, if we make it large.</p>
            <p>And though they boaſt they have gull'd our People, to get
the Guineas taken at theſe high Rates, yet it's much to be
hoped, our Government will not be over-reacht by them, ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49237:7"/>
as to make it their Advantage to carry it away, with as much
Profit as they brought it in.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhall ſeem meet to the Wiſdom of the Parliament,
to New-Coin it again, pleaſe to conſider, nothing is ſo like to
keep it here, as to make 100 <hi>l.</hi> of Sterling, to weigh about
ſo many Pound of Silver, as it now does; and then it will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
anſwer all Bargains now on foot; and the King will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
pay thoſe that have Lent Money, according to the
goodneſs or weight of the Money they Lent; and thereby the
Eſtates of Forreigners will ſtill be continued here, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
Lent to the Crown, if need ſhould require, at Four or
Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſhould the Coin now be made large, and thereby,
as is before-demonſtrated, it be all, or moſt of it carried away,
what ſhall we have to Lend the Government, or Pay our
Merchants and Landlords? Will they be willing to take Hens,
and Peaſe, and Barley, for Rent, as is common in <hi>Scotland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Reducing our Coin to half the quantity which it
now is, will render the Nation ſo bare of Money: Firſt, By
its quantity, being leſs. Secondly, By their carrying much of
it away; that each Trader will have little enough left to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Neceſſary Payments of Trade, and Expences, and
Taxes, and the fewer to ſpare to Lend to the King.</p>
            <p>But ſome may Object, This great uneaſineſs in the People,
under the preſent Circumſtances of the Badneſs of Money, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitates
ſomewhat to be done.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, there is the Diſeaſe; but it don't need ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
a Remedy.</p>
            <p>For if the Government ſhould ſee good to make the Guineas
every where paſſable at <hi>30s.</hi> and they thereby become Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
at the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe, Exciſe-Office,</hi> and in
payment for other Taxes; then will the People alſo take them
freely, and we ſhould have Money Circulate amain; then
would Taxes come in eaſily, Rents be well paid, and great
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49237:8"/>
quantities of Money ready to purchaſe Lands of any Seller, and
quantities ready for the Crown; and all the uſes of Money
well-ſupplied, without the Charge of Altering the Money at
all, at this Juncture, when it can ſo ill be done; or when ſuch
Difficulties attend the finding any other Fund at this time to
anſwer the Loſs: And this is the Fund I propoſe, both to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our want of Acceptable Caſh to pay every Body, and to
carry on the Affairs of the Nation, by making the Guineas
paſſable at 30 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the Counterfeit Money, a little time will furniſh
moſt People with Judgment enough to avoid that; and then
where's our need of an Alteration, till the Nation is again in
Peace and Proſperity; and by that time you may ſo find the
ſweet of keeping the Money here, as willingly to Coin it in
ſuch Bulk as may continue it with us hereafter.</p>
            <p>It will alſo be made yet more eaſie, if the next Fifty or
a Hundred Thouſand Pounds of Gold that ſhall be Coin'd, be
done in half Guineas, to go at <hi>15s.</hi> Thirds of Guineas, to go
at <hi>10s.</hi> Sixths of Guineas, to go at <hi>5s.</hi> then ſurely we ſhall
not need to go upon this Chargeable and Ruinous Affair now
at this time, when the Nation hath ſo many ways for all the
Money they can ſpare, both at Home for our Navy, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
for our Army.</p>
            <p>Ay, ſay they, for our Army, how will you pay and ſupply
them?</p>
            <p>And truly if this were rightly anſwer'd, I hope their Cauſe
were at an end.</p>
            <p>Therefore let's divide their Objection into two parts, and
anſwer them aſunder; <hi>and Firſt for the Pay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that, let us give the King ſo much the more; we were
better do that, than Ruin us all; as would be the going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of all our Coin. And if we give the King, in the <hi>Quota</hi>
Allotted to pay the Army one fourth part more, that will be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49237:8"/>
a much leſs Inconvenience; and keeping the reſt here, our
Commodities will Sell well and quick, and the Nation grow
Rich under all; eſpecially, if Providence Bleſs the Care of our
Superiors, in protecting our Trade with Succeſs.</p>
            <p>As for the other part of their Objection, <hi>The Supply of the
Army with Neceſſaries;</hi> let them eat our own Bread, and wear
our Apparel: I mean, let them be Cloath'd from <hi>England</hi> as
before; let their Beef be ſent them from <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and their Bread ready Bak'd, and Cheeſe, and Peaſe, and
Fiſh, as are provided for the Navy, and moſt part will Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
among our ſelves.</p>
            <p>And thus having Anſwer'd all their Valuable Objections
I have met withal; I ſhall cloſe this Diſcourſe with a Brief
Summary of the whole Matter.</p>
            <p>'Tis our Intereſt to be Keepers of our own Coin our ſelves.</p>
            <p>If Forreigners have Eſtates here, let them take them home
in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodities at theſe Advanced Prizes they now
bear, and that's the way to equal the Ballance of Trade; for
the more Commodities goes out, the leſs the Nation is Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
on the Ballance of Trade.</p>
            <p>Or if they won't do ſo, let them leave them here to Lend
the Government.</p>
            <p>But don't let us make it their Intereſt, to Rob us of our
Treaſure, inſtead of Buying our Commodities.</p>
            <p>May the Almighty Bleſs the Debates of our Grandees, and give
a Happy Iſſue to their Conſultations, is the Hearty Deſire of
<hi>England</hi>'s Well-wiſher.</p>
