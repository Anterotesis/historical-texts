            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

their gifts, neglecting God, becauſe he is good:
but faithfull Chriſtians, doe by the true feare
and worſhip of God, ſecure themſelues from

<pb facs="tcp:7342:5"/>
much more a noble King, the <hi>Defender of the

iealouſie, and feare for your Maieſties ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Nor is it a Panicke, or cauſeleſſe feare. If
I did but dreame of any danger towards Your

here is neither <hi>Dreame,</hi> nor <hi>Diuination,</hi> but
plaine demonſtration of imminent, if not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Your Naieſtie with a moſt prudent, and
vigilant feare; ſuch as the learned Biſhop in
his <hi>Tortura,</hi> wiſhed to abound in your royall
Father of famous memory, and wee no leſſe in
Your Maieſtie. The cauſe (I ſay) of all is, the
<hi>Popes Bull</hi> or <hi>Breeue,</hi> even now perſwading and
ſtraightly charging his <hi>Catholique Sonnes</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(as hee calls them) vpon no termes to
take the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to Your Maieſtie, as
being not their <hi>King,</hi> but their <hi>enemie.</hi> Such
<hi>Breeues</hi> never come, but they betoken ſome
notable miſchiefe not farre off. Like the <hi>Coote,</hi>
which flying to the ſhore crying, prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates

which being ſeene in the City, portends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

<pb facs="tcp:7342:5"/>
ſpecially where they exerciſe theyr maliguant

as being <hi>Signes</hi> only, but no <hi>cauſes</hi>
of future euents: yet the <hi>Popes Bull,</hi> being not
only a <hi>Signe,</hi> but a <hi>cawſe</hi> conducing to, and
producing miſchiefe, and that even <hi>exprofeſſo;</hi>
ought not ſlightly to be regarded. <hi>Omne malum
à Breuibus, Breuia a Pontifice</hi> ſayde the foreſayd
Biſhop vpon the ſame occaſion. A <hi>Breeue</hi> was
ſent from the <hi>Pope,</hi> to prepare the way for the

more cunningly couched, and fuller of ſubtill

<pb facs="tcp:7342:7"/>
We know, as God hath dignified You with a
Diademe: ſo he hath qualified Your Maieſty
with moſt excellent Princely indowments. For
inſtance, vouſchſafe leaue to Your poore old
ſervant, to remember a moſt Princely ſpeach
vſed often by Your Highneſſe, <hi>HONESTY
IS THE BEST POLICY.</hi> A Motto
for a King, and worthy to be ingraven in the
laſting Monuments of Your Kingly Actes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with Your owne royall hands. I may not
preſume, leaſt I ſhould offer both violence
and wrong, with my vnskilfull penſil to limme
out more largely this moſt beautifull, and well
proportioned Image of a Princes vertuous
mynd. But I dare ſay (which I referre to the
beſt judgement of Your Majeſtie, ableſt to
judge of Your owne noble ſayings) it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<hi>Aphoriſme,</hi> or <hi>Abſtract</hi> of that divine
Rule preſcribed to Kings by the Lord and
Iudge of Kings: <hi>It ſhall be, when the King ſitteth
vpon the throne of his Kingdome, that he ſhall write
him h copy of this Law in a Booke, out of that which
is before the Prieſts and Leuites: and it ſhall bee
with him, and he ſhall read therein all the dayes of
his life, that hee may learne to ſerue the Lord his
God, to keepe all the words of this Law, and theſe
<pb facs="tcp:7342:8"/>
Statutes to doe them; that his heart be not lift vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
his brethren, and that hee turne not aſide, from
the Commandement, to the right hand, or to the left:
to the end that he may prolong his dayes in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
hee and his children in the midſt of Iſraell.</hi>
Now what is the ſumme of all this, but, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
is the beſt Pollicy?</hi> From this Root, to
wit, <hi>Honeſty,</hi> the heathen deriued all the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of vertue. As, thoſe foure Cardinall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<hi>Prudence, Juſtice, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
the ſubiect of thoſe three bookes of <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Tully</hi> draweth from the force and nature
of <hi>Honeſtie,</hi> as himſelfe expreſſeth. And thoſe

There is ſome waighty cauſe in hand

brought vs in a plentifull harveſt, in ſtead of a

prayer <hi>preuaileth much</hi> with God,<note place="margin">Iames 5.</note> not onely as
being commanded by him, and hauing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
annexed: but for the neceſſity of it to bee

Power. What <hi>Engliſh</hi> eares can with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
heare ſuch an inſolencie? When King <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuerus</hi>
did but vnderſtand of the deſperate eſtate of
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> wherein that <hi>wicked Haman</hi> (as
<hi>Heſter</hi> told the King) had brought them: the good
King by and by ſent forth his <hi>Edicts</hi> by Poſt into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Prouince, to incourage and arme the poore
people of God, to ſtand vpon their guard, and ſo
they preuented and ouercame the perill. Now who
ſtand more deeply charged with the care, of the
Kings Crowne, then your Grace? So that I
neede not (I trow) in ſuch a caſe, vſe ſpurres to
your agility and readines, for the putting of all dull
courſes in speedy execution, for not onely the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
but the condigne puniſhment of ſuch
kinde of <hi>Malefactors.</hi> Why, what <hi>Malefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors?</hi>
ſuch, as <hi>Ieſuits</hi> are: not onely of factious,
treacherous, traiterous spirits, as they are men,
<pb facs="tcp:7342:13"/>
poſſeſsed with the ſpirit of Ieſuitiſme: but euen by
vertue and force of their Order and Profesſion,
<hi>Traitors ex profeſſo.</hi> They muſt be ſo, they are
bound to bee ſo, elſe they are no Ieſuits, elſe must
they renounce their <hi>Holy Order of the ſociety of
Ieſu.</hi> And is it posſible that ſuch ſhould rouſt in
<hi>England?</hi> Nay reuell and riot? Nay, not onely
bee profeſt traitors themſelues; but drawing Parties
to their ſide continually, euen to the diuiding of the
limmes, the armes, and ſhoulders, legges and feete
from the Head of this goodly Politicke body? It is
the faſhion indeed, in other neighbour Popiſh
States publickely to allow and auow ſuch kinde
of <hi>Creatures</hi> in the State. But none haue more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to vphold them then, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> their good
Master. For certainly in time, if they be ſuffered to
goe on, they will bring all Chriſtendome vnder the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> yoake, God forbid. Yet if they ſhould ſo do, I
make a queſtion, whether the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would ſuffer
ſuch pragmatical ſpirits any longer in Chriſtendome,
leſt, as the reſtles ſea, hauing wrought as far as it can
one way, it worke as far as faſt the contrary
way. It is likly then; that he would ſend them into the
<hi>Turks</hi> Dominions; into <hi>Perſia,</hi> &amp; all thoſe Eaſterne
Empires to make compleat the Monarchy of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
that ioyning the two <hi>Indies</hi> together, and circling in
<pb facs="tcp:7342:14"/>
whole globe of the earth, his Motto may then be, <hi>Ne
plus vltra.</hi> But why doe I roue ſo farre, when our
home is in ſuch danger? What is to bee done? ſhall
I <hi>ſhoot a fooles bolt.</hi> Shall I bee bold with your
Grace? Why not? I haue heard men ſay, you are of
a noble diſpoſition, which will eaſily pardon a fooles
bluntneſſe. In briefe then: Your Grace knowes,
the King wants money extreamely. You know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that <hi>Treaſon</hi> is vnſufferable; to wink at it,
to conceale it, brings a man within <hi>Miſpriſion of
treaſon.</hi> You may be pleaſed all to know, that all
Ieſuites, as by their profeſsion, ſo in their practiſe,
are <hi>high Traitors</hi> to Kings and States. You know
againe, that all <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Iuſtices of peace</hi> in
this land, are ſworne to the King, to ſee the lawes
duly executed, but eſpecially vpon fellons and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
You know, that all ſuch, as ſhall bee found
guilty of ſuch <hi>Periury,</hi> or <hi>Miſpriſion of treaſon.</hi>
are puniſhable, not onely in their perſons, but in
their purſes and eſtates. Can the King then lacke
money, ſo long as there are (as they ſay) ſo many
<hi>Ieſuits</hi> in the land, which paſſe euery where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed?
O that your Grace would finde out the
<hi>Delinquents</hi> in this kinde? Nay let your Grace be
aſsured, if you will but take a round courſe with the
Ieſuites, in rooting them out, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits,
<pb facs="tcp:7342:14"/>
as it would bring ſafety &amp; ſecurity to the
Kings Perſon and State, ſo being the faithfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of that truſt repoſed in you, what a comfort
will it be to your conſcience, what a bleſsing from
God might you expect, yea, what loue alſo from all the
Kings louing ſubiects? Then would all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
ſucceed happily: whereas on the contrary, ſo
long as Ieſuits with their factions and treaſons are
ſuffered in this land, what can wee expect, but that
euery thing we take in hand, ſhould proue very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosperous
&amp; croſſe? For God is highly displeaſed
with vs, for ſuffering ſuch miſcreants to practiſe
their impieties on this his Church, to the great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his Name, and Religion. And how ſhall we
be worthy to inioy ſuch a King, ſuch a Country, ſuch
a Church, ſo many bleſsings of God, if we be ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
of them? All the world admires the wonderfull
truſt, that the King hath repoſed in you: I pray God
your Grace may anſwer it, in your faithfull, prudent,
and vigilant care. I remember a ſpeech, which his
Highneſſe, when he was Prince, vttered among vs,
that were his ſeruants: that when he had once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any buſineſse of truſt, though of the higheſt
nature, to a ſeruant, he would neuer conceiue the leaſt
ſuspicion of his fidelity: adding, hee had rather run
the hazard of his loyalty, then imbitter his generous
<pb facs="tcp:7342:15"/>
truſt with mixture of feare. A ſtrong obligation
ſure to a ſeruant ſo intruſted. But ſome of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
trembling replyed: what if he proue treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous?
hath hee not the more free and ſecure opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to worke his wicked ends? But (quoth his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
my care ſhall be ſuch in the Choyce, as my truſt
ſhall bee built vpon a ſure ground. Pray God it bee,
ſo, ſaid his ſeruants. Now this wee ſee verefied on
the Kings part towards your Grace. What a liberall
truſt hath he repoſed in you? ſuch, as not all the
gold of <hi>Iudai</hi> ſhould euer ouer ballance. But we all
beſeech the Lord, that his Maieſty may not bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And haue we not cawſe? Doth not the ſafty
of the Kings Perſon &amp; Crowne, of this Church &amp;
State, of three goodly Kingdoms, yea of the Goſpell of
Chriſt, and of true religion at home and abroad, euen
ouer Chriſtendome, &amp; throughout the world, depend
in a maner vpon this truſt, committed to your Grace?
King <hi>Achiſh</hi> would haue made <hi>Dauid keper</hi> of
his <hi>Head for euer.</hi> But his Nobles thought it not
ſafe leaſt all their own <hi>heads</hi> ſhould haue payd for
it. But the truſt committed to your Grace, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Kings head</hi> but of all our <hi>heads,</hi> &amp; of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
millions more, that neuer, ſaw your face. Haue you
not neede then not only of <hi>Davids</hi> true <hi>heart</hi> toward
his King but of <hi>Argus</hi> his 100 <hi>eyes,</hi> in watching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:7342:15"/>
               <hi>Io,</hi> committed to his truſt? Yet <hi>Argus</hi> for all his
<hi>eyes,</hi> was ſo inchaunted with <hi>Mercuries</hi> pipe, whom
<hi>Iupiter</hi> had ſent to ſteale her away: that falling all
a ſleep, <hi>Io</hi> was taken away, and <hi>Argus</hi> had all his
<hi>eyes</hi> puld out, and put into the peacocks traine. But
where are any ſuch <hi>Mercuries</hi> to inchaunt your
<hi>Grace?</hi> Where? Alas, where are they not, ſpecially
where reatnes dwelleth, at ourt? <hi>Haue we any
need of madd men,</hi> ſaid the King of <hi>Gath?</hi> And
may not the <hi>Court</hi> ſay, <hi>haue we any need of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers?</hi>
Theſe be the inchanting <hi>Mercuries.</hi> And of
all other, none more to be feared, then the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi>
whom the <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſends into <hi>England,</hi> to
inchaunt and impoſe vpon our moſt prudent, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
<hi>Arguſes,</hi> as the learned Biſhop hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
in his <hi>Tortura Torti. Ieſuites,</hi> a generation,
who as they are the moſt exquiſite Artiſts in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of flattery, ſo none hath more cauſe to beware &amp;
abhor them, then your Grace. But you know no <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites.</hi>
The greater is your danger, and ours. For they
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in ſheeps clothing, in diſguiſed habits, ſo bold, as
they can no more bluſh then their viſards, lowly low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
charming thechiefeſt with a counterfet adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; admiration of their I wot not what excellency.
And were it not miraculous, if the Court it ſelfe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
your <hi>Graces</hi> houſe, ſhould be free even from
<pb facs="tcp:7342:16"/>
many of ſuch flyes, which fliblowe the pureſt fleſh
with their flatteries? The croaking <hi>Froggs</hi> of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
crawled up into the very Kings chambers: and
are not theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to Froggs,
which <hi>goe vnto the Kings of the earth,</hi> and by
their crouching and croaking, and their Sardonian
ſmiles, would allure them to warre againſt Chriſt
and his goſpell? It is good therefore your Grace
ſhould make a ſpeedy &amp; diligent ſearch in the Court,
in your owne howſe, and in all the skirts of it round
about, and ſo alſo throught the whole land, what
Ieſuites are lurking any where, and to giue them the
reward of Traitors. Shall wee dally with ſuch
ſhall wee thinke to winne them with complements?
Wee know the fable of the ſnake foſtered in the mans
boſome: it is but the Morall of a Ieſuite, intertained
with a Court-like Curteſy. Jeſuites are nettles, if gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly
handled, they ſting: but if hard graſped, they
hurt not. Contrary to the Baſil (the Embleme of the
<hi>Throne eſtabliſhed by mercy)</hi> which being gently
ſtroked on the hand, yeelds a pleaſant ſmell, but cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hard vpon it, vnſauory. Your Grace takeing this
courſe, <hi>Parcere ſubjectis, et debellare ſuperbos,</hi>
therein you truly diſcharge the truſt committed vnto
you. Whereas if the execution of good lawes ſhould
bee ſuſpended, if treaſon &amp; traitors ſuffered, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7342:16"/>
Yf in this perillous ſeaſon, our potent &amp; profeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſhould thus be armed againſt vs, what can wee
expect, but confuſion of all? And how ſhall your
Grace, in the ruine of this goodly ſtate, eſcape ſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free?
ſhall your houſe ſtand notwithſtanding? Nay,
aſſure your ſelfe, if at this time you doe not beſtirre
your ſelfe, to reforme things amiſſe, but that they bee
ſuffered to runne on headlong to deſtruction, I may
apply that ſpeech of <hi>Mordecai</hi> to <hi>Heſter,</hi> vpon the
like occaſion: <hi>Thinke not with thy ſelfe, that
thou ſhalt eſcape in the Kings howſe: for yf
thou altogether holdeſt thy peace at this time,
then ſhall inlargement and deliuerance ariſe to
Gods people from another place: but thou
and thy fathers howſe ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> Nor
let this my boldneſſe ſeeme ſtrange to your Grace,
though perhaps you bee not much acquainted with
ſuch, as will ſpeake the downe right truth. Of all
<hi>Iobs</hi> friends, hee found but one <hi>Elihu,</hi> who ſayd,
<hi>Let me not, I pray you, accept any mans perſon:
neyther let me giue flattering titles vnto men:
For I know not to giue flattering titles; in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
my Maker would ſoone take me away.</hi> If
<hi>Iob</hi> in his Miſery found but one ſuch: no maruaile
if your Grace find ſcarce one. As for mee, I am an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-man,
a free borne ſubiect, a true louer of my
<pb facs="tcp:7342:17"/>
King &amp; Countrey; yea I am alſo an vnworthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of Chriſt, a poore <hi>watch-man</hi> of Iſraell: and
when I ſee my ſoueraine King, my Mother Country,
the Glory of God, the Goſpell of Chriſt, the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> yea the Church of Chriſt ouer the world,
in danger to bee deſtroyed, and all brought vnder the
tyranny of Antichriſt, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> yoake: ſhall
I bee ſilent? ſhall I not ſpeake? ſhall I not <hi>lift vp
my voice like a trumpet?</hi> ſhall I not thus <hi>free</hi>
my <hi>ſoule,</hi> whatſoever ſhall become of my body? Yea,
<hi>for Sions ſake I will not hold my tongue, and
for Ieruſalems ſake I cannot reſt, vntill the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
thereof goe forth as brightneſſe, and
the ſalvation thereof as a Burning Lampe.</hi> I
feare neither priſon, nor death it ſelfe, that I may
diſcharge a good conſcience both towards my God, &amp;
my King, &amp; Countrey. Nor feare I to be cenſured
as a Polypragmaticke. What haue Miniſters to doe
to meddle in State-myſteries? Sir, let mee ſpeake
boldly, it were happy, if, as in the apoſtatized King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of Chriſtendome, the Prieſts of <hi>Baals</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
I mene, Ieſuites, &amp; Prieſts (which muſt needs
bring ruine to them) are followed: So in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Iuda,</hi> onely the truth-telling <hi>Micaia</hi>'s were
heard. Good King <hi>Dauid</hi> could ſay, <hi>I am wiſer
then my teachers, then the aged, then mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
<pb facs="tcp:7342:17"/>
for thy teſtimonies are my delight,
and my Counſellors?</hi> Hee that will bee a wiſe
ſtates-man, &amp; politician indeed, let him take Gods
word for his <hi>card</hi> &amp; <hi>compaſſe.</hi> For euen <hi>the
fooliſhneſſe of God</hi> (as ſayth the Apoſtle, as the
world accounteth fooliſhneſſe) <hi>is wiſer then men.</hi>
But you want not thoſe, that are able to performe the
office of good Chapleins. Yet if any, inſtead thereof,
ſhall not onely bee ſilent, &amp; negligent, but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, bee too officious to ſow pillowes vnder your
Elbowes, to applaud and approue you in all your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yea to perſwade and counſell you, wherein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
theyr conſcience tells them, it ought not to bee ſo:
woe be vnto them. Only wee hope better things. But
if any ſhall goe about to find a knot in a Bullruſh, by
picking ſome quarrell with this booke, where hee hath
noiuſt cawſe (bee his pretence neuer ſo faire guilded
ouer, or ſeeme his reaſons neuer ſo farre fetcht, yea
from his abſtruſe ſpeculations in ſtate-pollicy) &amp;
ſhall by hooke or crooke labour the ſuppreſsing of it,
or hinder your Grace from reading of it, though ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to imploy your ſaddeſt thoughts in, it ſo neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerning the ſafety of your gratious Maſter our
dread Soueraine, &amp; of our ſweet Countrey, &amp; euen

Traitour, &amp; if hee be not a Ieſuite, yet certainly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed

the benefit of heauen, and the patrimony of
piety. For the Church, ſeeing the Peace of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
hath often found by proofe, that the power of
Mortals is the ſtipend of impiety. Wherefore we preferre the
chaines of Martyrs, before the ſpoyles of the triumphant, and the
King eternall promiſeth heauenly Principalities, not to them,
that trample the Lawes vnder their proud foote, but to thoſe,
that ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake. This truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
out of the treaſures of antiquity, into the earth, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
conſidering, did not onely not caſt away his hope, but was
ſuperabundantly ioyfull in all the tribulation of the faithfull;
for they which are accounted worthy to ſuffer reproches for the
name of Ieſu, thoſe ſeeme to poſſeſſe the Bill of Exchange of
Gods loue, and abound with that price, wherewith they purchaſe
the Diademe of Eternity. Indeed we had rather (being mindfull
of humane frailty) that glory and riches were in the tabernacles
of the righteous: but when we contemplate your miſeries, Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Sonnes, wee put ſo much confidence in your vertue, and
Chriſts defence, that we dare congratulate vnto you plenty of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.
The Church well hoped indeed, that the minde of the
moſt potent King, who of a Catholique wife wiſhed to beget
heires, that might rule his Countrey Kingdomes, being mollified
<pb facs="tcp:7342:25"/>
by the fighes of his Wiues <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> piety, would permit the dowry of
royall wedlocke to bee the liberty of faith: but now the vowes
and counſels of your enemies are feared; and whereas the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
religion is crowned with a royall Diadome in that moſt
excellent Queene: yet there are not wanting thoſe, which dare
threaten impriſonments and puniſhments to our ſonnes. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
there are among you thoſe, who deſire to carry about in
your owne body the mortification of Ieſu Chriſt, and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the blandiſhments of pleaſure, and titles of ambition, in
compariſon of the butcherie of hangmen, and ignominy of bonds:
yet if any be there, who are poſſeſſed with a deſire of the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the preſent Church, we deſire they ſhould take notice, that
the Pontifician charity is wonderouſly ſollicitous of their ſafety,
No one duty is of vs omitted, which may conuert the menacing
cloud of the growing tempeſt, into a wiſhed calme of conſolation:
yet if Hell inlarge her mouth, and mortall cruelty thirſt after the
blood of Martyrs, yee ought to bee armed with the inuincible
buckler of a good reſolution, and meditate of Heauen in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
of a Crowne in the Racke, of immortality in death. Among
the Britiſh Rockes of their ſhipwracke religion, Chriſts Croſſe
hath beene a Planke, and hath brought you into the hauen of your
deſire. This Croſſe you muſt imbrace, by the vertue whereof
the bitterneſſe of puniſhments is ſweetned. Conſider beloued
Sonnes in what ſtation ye ſtand, and to whoſe eyes you are made
a ſpectacle; the Angelicall Legions do flutter about you, which
receiue in their golden violls the deſires of the faithfull, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them at the ſanctnarie of the mercy of the Omnipotent; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
gates being ſet open, Chriſt not only a beholder, but a Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſheweth you the ſacred triumphs of your Citizens, whom
purpled in their owne blood, England hath brought into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
aſſemblies. The anxious prayers of the mournefull Church
deſire of God for you the ſpirit of charity and fortitude. The
Counſels of the Apoſtolique Senate, and the prayers of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
take care of your ſafety in ſo large a theater of heauen and
earth; what rigour of your conſtancy, what ſublimity of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
minde becomes it you to haue in you? The Counſels
of your Predeceſſers haue beene in the like ieopardy, the lights of
<pb facs="tcp:7342:25"/>
the holy Ghoſt, and the Armor of light be your wiſe Oracles,
and your actions the examples of fortitude. And if violence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
ſo farre, as it compell you to that permitions and vnlawfull
oath of Alleagiance of England; remember, that your prayer
is heard of the whole aſſembly of the Angels beholding you, and
let your tongue cleane to your gummes, before you cauſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of bleſſed Peter to bee diminiſhed with that forme of
Oath. For that is not all, that fidelity be kept vnto the King:
but that the ſacred ſcepter of the Catholique Church be wrung
from the Vicars of God Almighty; that which our Predeceſſor
Paul 5. of bleſſed memory, in ſo graue a deliberation decreed,
that ought ye altogether to obſerue, as the Decree of truth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
ſonnes, this Tribute, due to the Prince of the Apoſtles, no
threates of men, or flatteries, ought at any time to extort from
you; they that perſwade you otherwiſe, thoſe propheſie vnto you a
lying viſion, and a fraudulent Diuination. For ſooner ought
the ſword of the mighty to take away from a Chriſtian man his
life, tken his faith. Yea if an Angell from heauen teach you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
then the Apoſtolique truth, let him be accurſed. We
in the meane time will intreate the Father of lights, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not the heart of the Engliſh King to bee blinded, who ſhall
certainly learne, how great credit is to be giuen to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ſubiects, in thoſe things, which you may promiſe; who leaſt
they ſhould make themſelues liable to periury, they had rather
breath out their ſpirit, then their voice. But that your vertue
may be found more precious then gold, which is tried in the fire:
teach that kingdome, that there is not ſuch force in the cruelty
of enemies, that it is able to extinguiſh the eternall fire of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in your hearts. Pray for them that perſecute you; humilitie,
patience, concord, faſting, praier, are your weapons, which in the
cruell conflict ye ought to draw forth, that the Palmes of ecleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
triumphs may flouriſh in your hands. For ſeeing Bleſſed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was forbidden to ſmite with the ſword, the cruell aſſailants of
Chriſt: we exhort you, hauing the prejent good of the Church
before our eies, that in the meane time you thinke the thoughts
of peace, and that yee praie for eternall life euen for the King,

            <q>Pope Vrban 8.</q>
            <p>POpe is a title ſignifying father, and being appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Pontiſe or Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who alone is ſo
intituled, it notes the great Antichriſt. The Pope, as much
to ſay,<note place="margin">Math. 3. v. 9.</note> as the Antichriſt. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Call no man father vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

as the Pope challengeth to himſelfe, namely, <hi>Papa,</hi>
that father, who as ſupreme ouer all other fathers, will,
and muſt be honoured, and obeyed. Yea he will be ſuch
a <hi>Papa,</hi> or Father, as vnto whoſe becke, is ſubordinated
and limited that obedience, which all do owe to our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

Pope alloweth: for euen the ſacred Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
the onely rule of our obedience to our heauenly
Father, are ſo locked vp in the Cabinet of the Popes breſt,
that they may yeeld vs no other ſenſe, but what his key
openeth, as is intimated in the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. affixed to
the <hi>Trent</hi> Councill, <hi>ſuper formâ Iuramenti profeſſionis fidei,
ad perpetuam rei memoriam.</hi> So that not our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Counter-mand commeth with a <hi>Non obſtante.</hi> This is that
Pope forbidden by Chriſt, thus to be called our Father

Hereof we cannot haue a more pregnant proofe, then this

            <p>This <hi>Pope,</hi> is <hi>Vrban</hi> the 8. a new name cuſtomarily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
with the Popedome. And lightly they borrow ſuch

               <hi>Vrban</hi> the 6. for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable

troubler. And ſuch a <hi>Turban</hi> I feare we ſhall finde of this
<hi>Vrban</hi> the 8. as we may eaſily diſcerne by the clouen foote
of this Bull. The Popes Bull is a prodigious or diſaſtrous
blazing ſtarre; it neuer appeareth, but it portendeth and
bodeth ſome approching fatality, to Princes and States.
Onely the Comet is but a ſigne, no cauſe of future euents:
but the Popes Bull is not onely a ſigne, but a cauſe procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and producing ſad Accidents to enſue: To goe no
further then home for inſtances. To prepare away for the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inuaſion in 88. as an harbinger to prouide them
lodging vpon their arriuall on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, Pope
<hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5 or if you will <hi>ſice ſinque,</hi> (as hauing already
caſt the Dice for <hi>England)</hi> ſends out his Balis declatatory,
wherein he excommunicateth the good Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
of euer gratefull memory, and abſolueth her ſubiects of
their allegiance, lauiſhing alſo, out of the bottomleſſe bag
of his Church treaſure, plenarie Indulgence to all foraine
States and Princes, that would joyne their helping hand
againſt <hi>England.</hi> Enough to ſet the whole Pontifician
world about our eares, but that our heauenly Father ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7342:29"/>
himſelfe more potent in bleſſing vs, then the <hi>Balaam</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> in curſing vs. Alſo about the time of the Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
plot, the Pope ſent out his Bulls, <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. by
name, as here <hi>Vrban</hi> the 8. they agree both in name and
number, God grant they agree not in the nature of their
miſchiefesment vs;<note place="margin">See <hi>Tortura Torti.</hi> pag. 281<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> or God grant them al the like euents,
that formerly. <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. (I ſay) his Bull or Breeue,
being in ſafe keeping with Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> and by him
ſhewed to <hi>Catesby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſpectis illis ſemel, fundauit ſe ſtatim Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbeus, atque ſuper illis om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes intentiones ſuas exedifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit ibid.</note> by whom this buſineſſe began to bee
brewed; while as yet the powder was but a ſoaking in the
ſalt-peter tubs, he was ſo animated with the ſight thereof,
that he built and founded all his (otherwiſe perplexed and
tottering) inuentions vpon thoſe Breeues, wherein <hi>Garnet</hi>
alſo was not wanting to obfirme him more and more:
whereupon the learned Biſhop inferreth; <hi>Ita omne malam
à Breuibus, Breeuia à Pontifice,</hi> ſo that all miſchiefe is from
Breeues, and Breeues from the Pope.</p>
            <p>Theſe two inſtances may induce vs to take better heed
to this new Bull now in hand, and to conſider, whether
this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanicall</hi> Breeue, may not bode at leaſt the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
miſchiefes to this land, that thoſe did: And ſo much
the rather, if we weigh all the concurring circumſtances
of the time. The Pope knowes beſt, how to make his own
benefit of others homebred hurts; his forces are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnited, and ſtrengthened, by others diuiſions, and he
well hopes to licke himſelfe whole againe, by others pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying
ſores. And ſo much the more may the force of this
Bull bee feared, as not hauing ſo long hornes, as ſtrong
ſinewes cloſſely compacted, like thoſe skales of <hi>Leuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi>
Or rather (leſt the impreſſion of feare might bee a
preuention of their purpoſe) it comes in, like the aſpe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in a baſket of figgs, lurking vnder the
greene leaues, the biting whereof is not ſo ſenſible, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
mortall. The judicious Reader may therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
notable artifice, in tempering ſtrong poyſon as it
were in a paire of <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> perfumed gloues.
And were there nothing elſe, but that it comes from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7342:29"/>
               <hi>Rome:</hi> can any good thing come from <hi>Rome?</hi> from the
Pope? <hi>Omne malum à Brenibus, Breuia à Pontifice.</hi> As
when <hi>Iulian</hi> the Cardinall was much recommended to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi>
King of <hi>Romanes:</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Tamen Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
eſt, yet he is a Roman.</hi> And a peſtilent one too, witneſſe
that woefull ouerthrow at <hi>Varna,</hi> by <hi>Amurath,</hi> whereof
<hi>Iulian</hi> was the chiefe cauſe, hauing perſwaded <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi>
vnjuſtly to breake the truce with the <hi>Turke.</hi> To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a peace now offered (as they ſay) betweene the
aduerſe parties, but onely this, that ſuch a Treaty will very
well ſuite, and ſerue this Breeue with occaſion, as a milde
open ſeaſon helpeth phyſicke, to worke the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
But we haue not forgotten their Treaty vpon 88.
Nor are we ſo fooliſh, or weary of our liues (I truſt) as
with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> wittingly and willingly, to ſuffer our ſelues
to be ſtung with the Popes Aſpe, in greene leaues, whoſe
womaniſh ſpirit, would otherwiſe haue fainted to ſee her
owne death. Yea rather we know the nature of ſuch Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liskes
which a man eſpying firſt, before ſhe him, the Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liske
dyeth, the man is preſerued. Thus ſuch prodigious
Comets, may ſpend their malignant matter, and bee fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
of their force, and influence, where wiſe men make
right vſe of them. <hi>Sapiens dominabitur aſtris:</hi> for as the
learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerueth well; Comets cannot cauſe, but
may occaſion onely State-ruines, and changes; as when
they inflame the ayre,<note place="margin">Anima ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam corto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, vt corpus aeris.</note> the ayre mens bodies, the bodies

impreſſion in the moſt delicate and tender bodies of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
working vpon their ſpirits, cauſeth oftentimes ſuch
combuſtions, as haſten ſome fatall periods; while in the

ſuch importent operations; ſuch, and no other is the
malignant influence of Papall Breeues, which cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
generous Princes with an imbellious feare of ſuch
<hi>bruta fulmina,</hi> which cannot ſcare nor ſcratch any, but
Brutes. The ſword of good Lawes drawne forth, well bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and brandiſhed, to the cutting off but the maine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7342:30"/>
pipes, by which theſe poyſoned waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
diſſention betweene the head and the members,
Prince and ſubiects, are deriued from the Papall ſpring to
his Cotholique ſons, will through Gods grace giue a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
defeate to whatſoeuer Papall deſigne this Breeue
cloſſely intendeth. As followeth.</p>
            <q>To his beloued Sonnes the Catholiques
of England.</q>
            <p>HAuing ſpoken of the father <hi>Papa,</hi> now to his ſons:
a father and ſonne are of neereſt relation, and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
a ſtrong combiner of affections, and ingager of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
offices. Sonnes are either by naturall generation, or by
legall adoption, or by common appellation, or by ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
generation; ſuch here, in a ſpirituall meaning. As for
the Popes naturall ſonnes, thoſe he calles his Nephewes,
<hi>Euphoniae gratiâ</hi> as it were a degree once remoued. His
ſpirituall ſons we ſhall better diſcerne of their kinde, not
onely by their father, but by their mother, of whom they
are begotten; namely the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which if it bee
that great Whore, deſcribed in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> (as what
more euident? <hi>he that runnes may reade)</hi> hence it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
how legitimate they be. So that in a ſpirituall and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
ſence, he may as well call theſe alſo his Nephewes,
as his ſons. But in naming them ſons, it impoſeth on them
that filiall, or rather baby blinde obedience, which none
but ſuch a father as the Pope, can or will exact of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
This father if they obey not, aboue, contrary to God,
they are none of the Popes true bred ſons. But to ſweeten
their rigid obedience, he ſtyleth them his beloued ſonnes;
Yet rather louing, then beloued: for in naturall affection,
loue rather deſcends then aſcend: in this, contrary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vnnaturall: I dare ſweare ſuch babes more dote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their father in their blind affection, then he vpon them;
all the world ſeeth what be the grounds and ends of the
Popes loue to his ſonnes. But to paſſe by that, he calles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7342:30"/>
them the <hi>Catholiques</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> all the reſt then are <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 303. <hi>Vincentius Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinenſis.</hi>
               </note>
But Catholiques they are not ſimply, but in the
compound, Romane-Catholiques; a right <hi>Babyloniſh</hi>
word: And ſuch are no true Catholiques, as the learned
Biſhop hath proued in his <hi>Tortura:</hi> for he is a true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
that holds the Catholique faith, profeſſed in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
according to the Scriptures: not hee that holds faith
none otherwiſe, but with limitation to the priuate ſenſe,
and meaning of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſuch is a <hi>Romane-Catholique,</hi>
no true <hi>Catholike.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
            <q>Beloued Sonnes, greeting, and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
benediction.</q>
            <p>A Forme of ſalutation, farre vnlike that of the Apoſtles,
farre from <hi>Apoſtolique.</hi> The Apoſtles, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> in all their Epiſtles write to Gods elect, to his Saints,
by calling, recommending vnto them grace, and peace in
Ieſus Chriſt; that is a right <hi>Apoſtolique</hi> ſalutation. But in
the Popes ſalutation, nothing ſounding to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
but the bare word <hi>Apoſtolique,</hi> which putteth the
greater difference; for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> came in Chriſts
name, the Pope in his owne name; they ſalute the Saints
with the the Grace, and Peace of Chriſt, he with his owne
<hi>Apoſtolique benediction.</hi> An other note of Antichriſt, that
commeth in his owne name:<note place="margin">Iohn 8. v. 43.</note> As Chriſt ſaid to the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Iewes, If another come in his owne name, him will ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</hi>
Now he comes in his owne name, that comes in his
owne vſurped authority, as here the Pope doth, with his
<hi>Apoſtolique benediction:</hi> Yea although the Pope pretend,
and claime neuer ſo much to be Chriſt Vicar, and ſo may
ſeeme to come, not in his owne, but Chriſts; name: yet
vſurping that power, which Chriſt neuer vſed, as contrary
to the diſpenſation of his miniſtery; (The Popes power
being to erect, and ſupport an earthly Monarchy, whereof
he may ſay,<note place="margin">Dan. 4. v. 30.</note> as that proud King: <hi>Is not this great Babylon,
which I haue built for the honour of the Kingdome, by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7342:31"/>
might of my power, and for the honour of my Maieſtie?)</hi> he
therefore commeth in his owne name. So here: His bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is of himſelfe, who in this Breeue cals himſelfe,
that Apoſtolique one; ſuch is his Apoſtolique benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to wit, Antichriſts benediction. Thus in ſtead of Chriſts
grace, he hath Apoſtolique greeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſtead of Chriſts
peace, Apoſtolique benediction: and to whom? not to
the elect Saints in Chriſt Ieſus, but to the Popes ſonnes;
not to the faithfull in Chriſt, but to the Popes Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
in <hi>England;</hi> ſuch as his father-hood goes about to
ſtrip of all the cognizances of Chriſts faithfull ones; who
as they are truely faithfull towards God, ſo they expreſſe
the ſame towards man; and as to Chriſt in the firſt place;
ſo in the next to the Lords annoynted, their Leige Lord
immediately vnder Chriſt. It followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Terrene felicity is not alwaies the benefit of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and the patrimony of piety; for the Church ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the peace of ſinners, hath often found by proofe,
that the power of mortals is the ſtipend of impiety:
Wherefore we preferre the chaines of Martyrs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſpoyles of the triumphant; and the King eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
promiſeth heauenly principalities, not to them
that trample the lawes vnder their prood foote, but to
thoſe that ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Anſwer.</p>
            <p>NOt to inſiſt vpon euery particular, but noting by
the way throughout, the Popes egregious hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
and prophaneſſe, in peruerting and abuſing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the ſacred name of God: wee will touch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon the principals. Onely by the way, how doth the
Pope come to put a difference betweene <hi>terrene felicity,</hi>
and the <hi>benefit of heauen?</hi> ſeeing that all the benefit hee
either hath, or can hope for of heauen, is his <hi>terrene feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:7342:31"/>
This is the Popes heauen vpon earth; this is his <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
patrimonie,</hi> which in his owne papall ſenſe, is farre
from the <hi>patrimonie of piety.</hi> Or what hath the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> to doe with peace? <hi>what peace,</hi> ſhee <hi>ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h the
peace of ſinners:</hi> A phraſe borrowed from <hi>Ezechiel 13.
16.</hi> And it agrees well with the Pope; For as thoſe falſe
Prophets ſaw viſions of peace, where there was none: ſo
the Pope. Is he about to ſtirre vp rebillion, and ſpeakes
he of peace? Or what peace can all popiſh doctrine, put
together, giue vnto a poore ſinner? None at all. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they puffe a man vp with pride, or poſſeſſe his heart
and conſcience with fearfull perplexities. <hi>Peace</hi> it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
none, neither in life nor death. But paſſe we by that
too. The Pope here making mention of <hi>Martyrs chaines,</hi>
cannot but put vs in minde of Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> &amp; that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
crew, <hi>Romes Martyrs:</hi> and ſo may giue vs, (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

bcames of your <hi>contemplation</hi> vpon the miſeries of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<hi>Sonnes</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> But herein yee ſhow the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells
of a father: But you are ſenſible thereof onely in
your <hi>contemplation.</hi> If you <hi>contemplate</hi> this out of ſome
propheticall viſion, foreſeeing the calamities, which your
ſonnes impieties through your fatherly inſtigation, may
further pull vpon them, if they ſhall attempt ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſervice for your father-hood, wherein they ſhall faile
of their purpoſe: herein wee deſire, and hartily pray, you
may bee as true a Prophet, as <hi>Balaam</hi> was, who though
you would neuer ſo faine, to obtaine an <hi>houſefull of gold,
and ſiluer,</hi> which you haue formerly had out of <hi>England,</hi>
yet the <hi>curſe</hi> in the end ſhall fall vpon your own <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites.</hi>
But if you <hi>contemplate</hi> and ſuch great preſent cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
vpon your <hi>ſonnes</hi> among vs, wee are giuen hereby
to perceiue, that your holineſſe may erre; vnleſſe you
will excuſe it, that you ſpeake it by the figure <hi>Iroma:</hi> you
are able to <hi>contemplate</hi> more herein, then all wee can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
with open eyes. Yea on the contrary (whereof
your holineſſe cannot bee ignorant) your ſonnes are ſo
kindly intreated among vs, as, though wee might thinke
thereby to winne them the more to loue vs, and our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
yet foraſmuch as they are your holineſſe owne ſones
(wee meane the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and <hi>Preiſts</hi> eſpecially) the truth
is, we haue the more cauſe to feare them. We know of old
what recompence to expect of the <hi>ſnake,</hi> if wee foſter him
in our boſomes. Thus doe your ſonnes recollect their
ſtrength among vs, and ſuch <hi>vertue,</hi> wherein to repoſe
your <hi>confidence.</hi> Herevpon it is (in plaine truth) that your
holineſſe dare <hi>congratulate</hi> to your <hi>ſonnes</hi> ſuch <hi>plenty of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs:</hi>
you may bee confident of it, ſo long as your <hi>frogs</hi>
are ſuffered to friske and range vp, and downe among vs
at pleaſure, without controwle, in defiance of Lawes and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7342:36"/>
Proclamations, to ſeduce the Kings Liege people, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their number daily, to ſtrengthen their partie, to
weaken vs by ſowing their ſeeds of faction, that no leſſe
then a rich <hi>plenty of triumphs</hi> muſt needes inſue. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee comfort our ſelues, that your Papall <hi>confidence</hi> in
your ſonnes <hi>vertue,</hi> is preferred before Chriſts <hi>defence</hi> you
ſet that in the firſt place; and ſurely if you had not more
confidence in your ſonnes <hi>vertue,</hi> then in <hi>Chriſts defence,</hi>
it were very ſmall: for wee know, that in <hi>Chriſts defence</hi>
you haue no <hi>confidence</hi> at all: your owne apoſtatized heart
can tell you ſo much. Except yee truſt at all in <hi>Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi>
becauſe our ſinnes haue ſo much prouoked God
againſt vs, and none more, then that your ſonnes haue
beene too indulgently intreated among vs, not onely to
the damage, and murther of many ſoules, if the Lord bee
not the more mercifull to giue them repentance, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the truth; but to the endangering of this noble
State, if the ſame our God no leſſe mightily, then mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
preuent it not. You know too well the Kings
of <hi>Iſraeil</hi> are mercifull Kings: but wee know againe, that
many times pitie, (though it is pitie) yet being ſhewed
to <hi>Amileck</hi> and <hi>Aramites,</hi> may redound to the Authors
hurt; witneſſe theſe * <hi>Kings of Iſraell</hi> On the other ſide,
wee know what <hi>Elias</hi> did, and afterward what <hi>Jehu</hi> did to
the <hi>Prophets of Baal,</hi> and what a bleſſing came vpon them
from the Lord, <hi>Iehues</hi> Sonnes ſate vpon the throne to the
fourth generation, and had done longer, if hee had not
cleaued to the ſinnes of <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> And <hi>Jezabell,</hi> for all her
vengeable malice, and impotent fury, yet could not wreck
it vpon <hi>Elias,</hi> though one ſingle poore Prophet, no more
then the Pope with all his pontificall, and imperiall power
could preuent poore <hi>Luther</hi> of dying peaceablely in his
bed; ſo miraculouſly mightie is the Lord in preſeruing
his pooreſt ſeruants, that are zealous for his cauſe. Yf
we ſhew the like zeale now in this frozen age; wee may
with comfort hope for the like bleſſing, and protection.
Then put you neuer ſo much <hi>confidence</hi> in your ſonnes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7342:36"/>
               <hi>vertue,</hi> our confidence ſhall bee in the <hi>defence</hi> of Chriſt,
whoſe cauſe wee defend: and ſo wee doubt not, but
(through Gods neuer failing goodneſſe to his people)
all you <hi>confidence,</hi> and daring promiſes of <hi>plentifull try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs</hi>
will vaniſh into the ayre, whereof they were ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
It followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>The Church well hoped indeed, that the minde of the
moſt potent King, who of a Catholique wife wiſhed to
beget heires, that might rule his Countrey kingdomes;
being mollified by the ſighes of his wiues <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>  pietie, would
permit the dowry of royall wedlocke to bee the libertie of
faith; but now the vowes, and counſels of your enemies
are feared, and whereas the oxthodox Religion is crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a royall diadem in that moſt Excellent Queene;
yet there are not wanting thoſe, which dare threaten im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
and puniſhments to our ſonnes.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Anſwer.</p>
            <p>YOu meane the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> &amp; what may it not <hi>hope?</hi>
yet againſt your <hi>hope,</hi> the prayers of Chriſts Church
are neuer wanting, for the fruſtrating of your faireſt
hopes. Our Church in particular publiquely prayeth.
<hi>That it may pleaſe God to bring into the way of truth, all ſuch
as haue erred, and are deceiued.</hi> And in another prayer, for
the whole eſtate of Chriſts Church, in the end of our
<hi>Communion booke: Wee beſeech thee ô Lord to reduce all ſuch,
as bee yet ignorant, from the miſerable captiuitie of blindneſſe,
and errours, to the pure vnderſtanding, and knowledge of thy
truth: that wee all with one conſent, and vnity of mind, may
worſhip thee our onely God, and Sauiour.</hi> And for our King,
bleſſed bee God, his <hi>heart</hi> is eſtabliſhed vpon firmer
grounds, then to be remoued from that true faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee was bred, and brought vp, ſo eaſily as you <hi>hoped:</hi>
yea that <hi>pietie,</hi> which with your ſolemne Croſſe you haue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7342:37"/>
ſo crowned, our hope is, that his Maieſty may in time
by Gods grace ſo purifie, and perſit, as that <hi>royall Queene</hi>
ſhall account it the moſt rich dowry of her wedlocke, to be
made partaker of the liberty of that faith, which her Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
husband profeſſeth,<note place="margin">See for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>numents in <hi>Rich. 2.</hi>
               </note> that ſo they may long enioy a
ſweet ſociall conjunction, as in their affections, ſo in their
Religion. If that noble Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> Siſter ſometime to
<hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Behemia,</hi> being married heere to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
the 2. King of <hi>England,</hi> and that in a deplored time,
when the Kinges of <hi>England</hi> were ouer-awed by the Popes
vſurped power, being tyrannized ouer alſo with that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<hi>Egyptian</hi> ſeruitude; if ſhee (I ſay) by the meanes
of this marriage, comming, and liuing in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo happy, as to be made acquainted with the <hi>Goſpell
of Chriſt,</hi> which ſhee had, written in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue,
namely, the foure <hi>Euangeliſts,</hi> with the Doctours vpon
them, in the reading thereof ſhee was dayly exerciſed;
and ſo by this meanes alſo many <hi>Bohemians</hi> comming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into <hi>England,</hi> comming to the ſight and knowledge
of <hi>Wickliffes</hi> workes, conveyed the ſame into <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
whereby a good foundation was laid of planting, and ſo
eſtabliſhing the true religion there: what hopes then
may wee perceiue of this our noble <hi>Queene,</hi> who beeing
married to ſuch a royall husband, who is not onely in
title, but in realty, <hi>Defender of the faith,</hi> yea a Prince, who
is excellently able to worke vpon ſuch a noble diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by infuſing into her the ſeedes of the true Chriſtian
faith? that ſo not onely her ſelfe may become a ſound
<hi>Proteſtant,</hi> but by the bleſſing of God, this religion may
from ſo noble a roote, multiply and branch it ſelfe into
thoſe her fathers Countries alſo; ſo that when they ſhall
taſte of the cluſters of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> growing by the meanes
of this bleſſed vine, hir fathers houſe may then bleſſe the
time, that euer ſhe was tranſplauted into ſo happy aſoyle.
The Lord bring theſe faire bloſſomes of our hope to a
timely maturity: as your Pontifician hope is heerein alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(bleſſed be God) blaſted in the bud.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:7342:37"/>
And the ſame God,<note place="margin">See for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents in K. <hi>Edw. 4. p.</hi> 366.</note> that preuented that intended maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre
of Religion in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by the death of the King
<hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> at whoſe intended marriage with <hi>Magdalene</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> Kings Daughter of <hi>Prague,</hi> where, and when
the confluence of ſo many Pontifician States ſhould haue
beene, the maſſacre ſhould the more eaſily haue beene
effected: that God hath, and will (wee truſt) euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
this his true religion profeſſed in <hi>England,</hi> and that
by preſeruing the life of our gracious Soueraigne long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
vs to his glory, and his Churches good, maugre all
Pontifician <hi>hopes</hi> of the contrary.</p>
            <p>But it ſhould ſeeme the Popes hopes are turned into
feares: <hi>but now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the vowes and councells of your
enemies are feared.</hi> Whom doth he meane here by <hi>enemies?</hi>
Surely, by coherence with the premiſſes, he muſt needes
meane the moſt <hi>Potent King,</hi> of whom he ſpake in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part of the ſentence. And certainely in nothing ſhall
our noble King ſhow himſelfe more <hi>Posent,</hi> then by roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of his Dominions all <hi>Popiſh Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Ieſuites,</hi>
and by eſtabliſhing in vnity of doctrine, that Religion,
which for theſe many yeares hath beene ſo happily mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein. Herein, herein ſtands the potency and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie
of our <hi>Moſt Potent King:</hi> The eſtabliſhing of true
religion, is the eſtabliſhing of the <hi>Kinges Throne.</hi> It were
happy if other Kinges in Chriſtendome had their eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to ſee their miſerable thraldome vnder the Popes
yoake, and vpon what a tottering foundation their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domesſtand:
where Papall authoritie, and Ieſuiticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
take place.</p>
            <p>But here we may not paſſe ouer, that he faith, <hi>Your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</hi>
Who? or whoſe <hi>enemies?</hi> what? the King an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy?
to whom? to the Popes Sonnes here in England:
what? to the Prieſts, and Ieſuites in <hi>England?</hi> There
were ſome reaſon why the King ſhould ſhowe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
an enemy to theſe: for who are more mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the King and his Crowne: then they? But it is
playne by the ſequell, that hee meaneth chiefely heere
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7342:38"/>
ſuch Catholique ſonnes of his, as are, or at leaſt ought
to bee true ſubiects to the King. Loe here then Pontifician
malice. The Pope doth here moſt ſubtilly inſinuate, that
the <hi>King</hi> is an enemy to all thoſe his ſubiects, who are
<hi>Roman Catholikes.</hi> Enough with ſuch a brand, to kindle
the flames of hatred, and rebellion in ſuch ſubiects againſt
their <hi>King,</hi> while the Pope thus blowes the bellowes.
But wherein is the <hi>King</hi> an <hi>enemy?</hi> to their perſons? no:
but to their religion, which is enmity againſt <hi>God,</hi> and
the <hi>King.</hi> But the Pope feareth the Kings <hi>Councells.</hi> Now
the good Lord ſo direct the <hi>King,</hi> and bleſſe him in all
his <hi>Councells,</hi> that they may more, and more be matter as of
feare to the Pope, ſo of ioy, and comfort to himſelf, and
all his People.</p>
            <p>But hee feares alſo his enemies <hi>vowes.</hi> What <hi>vowes?</hi>
For tolleration (forſooth) of the Popes <hi>Orthodox religion,</hi>
Yf <hi>Orthodox,</hi> then ought it not onely to bee tollerated,
but publikely imbraced, profeſſed, avowed. But if it bee
(as it is) the Antichriſtian, <hi>Babylonian,</hi> Apoſtaticall, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
<hi>religion of Rome,</hi> that <hi>Where of Babylon:</hi> then no
<hi>vowes,</hi> ought either to bee made, or much leſſe kept, for
the tollerating of ſuch a <hi>religion.</hi> It is againſt our <hi>vowe</hi> in
baptiſme, wherein we diſavow <hi>the Deuill and all his works.</hi>
and therefore all <hi>doctrines of Devills.</hi> A precontract with
our ſpouſe Chriſt, diſanulleth all after contracts with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
with a harlot: Yea <hi>vowes</hi> made againſt God and
his word, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> voyd, and become a meere nullity.
And if the Pope at his pleaſure can diſſolue all lawfull
vowes, which being duely made obliege men inviolably
to keepe them: hath not God himſelfe power to diſanull
all impious <hi>vowes,</hi> which are made to maintaine the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of Antichriſt? Therefore, the Pope muſt giue vs
leaue herein not to giue credit to his Holineſſe complaint;
which, howſoeuer, wee knowe to bee moſt vniuſt. And
whereas the Pope calls his Religion <hi>orthodox:</hi> let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of this <hi>Bull</hi> witneſſe. Wee need goe no further for
proofe. <hi>Ipſe dixit.</hi> Yet you complaine, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7342:38"/>
your <hi>orthodox Religion</hi> (a forcible argument, if it
were rightly applyed) your ſonnes are <hi>threatned.</hi> You are
ſore hurt: you know full well that <hi>threatned folkes liue long.</hi>
But here wee cannot but put your father-hood in minde of
your forgetfulneſſe. A little before, you <hi>contemplate</hi> your
ſonnes miſeries; and now is all come but to a bare <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</hi>
wee looked for a ſtorme, and behold but a cloud;
for fire, and loe, but a little ſmoake: onely wee may hence
obſerue, what punctuall intelligence your vigilant ſonnes
giue your father-hood out of <hi>England.</hi> There ſtirres not
a Mouſe, but you heare of it: vnleſſe you haue it by ſome
ſpeciall reuelation, reflected in the glaſſe of your <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,</hi>
as your Saints know all is done here below, by the
perſpectiue <hi>Glaſſe of beatificall viſion.</hi> Or elſe happely you
haue it by the ſpirit of Prophecie, as conjecturing what
afterclaps, or prognoſticating what ſtormes this Meteor
of your Papall Breeue might ingender in this our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
Clymate againſt your Sonnes, when once they
ſhould bee ſo poſſeſſed with the malignant influence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as refuſing to take the oath of Allegiance, they ſhould
not onely incurre a <hi>threatning,</hi> but of <hi>congruitie,</hi> yea <hi>condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
merit</hi> both <hi>impriſonment</hi> and <hi>puniſhments.</hi> But our
<hi>hope</hi> is, that <hi>Non obſtante</hi> your peremptory <hi>Bull,</hi> they will
ſhew themſelues ſuch true hearted Engliſh-men, that they
will not deſerue in that caſe, ſo much as a <hi>threatning.</hi> But
you adde.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Wee belieue there are among you thoſe, who deſire to
carry about in your owne body the mortification of Ieſu
Chriſt, and would contemne the blandiſhments of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and titles of ambition, in compariſon of the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie
of hang-men, and ignominie of bonds. Yet if any
bee there, who are poſſeſſed with a deſire of the proſperitie
of the preſent Church, wee deſire they would take notice,
that the Pontifician charitie is wondrouſly ſollicitous of
their ſafetie.</hi>

            <p>PAuſe a while. Here is ſome deepe matter ſure: here
is ſome <hi>deepeneſſe of Sathan,</hi> for ſome Lyncean eyes to
diſcouer. No doubt his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> is great with child, ready
to be deliuered of ſome Monſtrous birth; onely hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
ſome maſculine Mid-wife to helpe at a pinch. To
which purpoſe, behold here a moſt pernicious clauſe,

attempting, of ſome facinorous, and audacious fact, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the <hi>butcherie</hi> of the <hi>Hangman,</hi> or the <hi>ignominy of bonds.</hi>
As the Poet ſpake, but in a farre better ſenſe, then the
Pope: <hi>Aude aliquid breuibus Gyaris, &amp; carcere dignum;</hi>
he ment it by daring to write of the touchy vices of the
lawleſſe times, wherein hee liued. Would to God Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
attempts were no worſe then ſo. But whatſoeuer
ſhame or ſorrow their attempts ſhall make them worthy to
ſuffer; they are to haue a ſpeciall reſpect vnto the reward,
to wit, the <hi>Pontifician charitie,</hi> which will make a full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for all; his father-hood being ſo <hi>wonderouſly ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of their ſafetie.</hi> What is the matter? ſome difficult en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
full of danger (it ſeemeth) to the Actour. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
whereof the <hi>Pope,</hi> is no leſſe <hi>ſollicitious</hi> (I wis) then
a naturall father, whoſe ſonne being about to encounter
ſome hideous monſter, or to attempt ſome <hi>Herculian la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
is very ſollicitous, and anxious of the euent, ſo full
of danger to his beloued ſonne: Onely here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
a naturall father in that caſe would vſe all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to diſſwade his ſonne, yea vpon his bleſſing to enioyne
him not to hazzard his life in ſuch a deſperate aduenture:
but the Pope on the contrary, animateth, and inciteth his
ſonnes, by all perſwaſiue arguments, not onely of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
inſinuation, but of profeſſed approbation, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
ſome deſperate enterpriſe. And enterpriſes of
that nature (bee they at all aduenture what they will bee)
we may boldly abide by it, that howſoeuer they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the life of the attempter, certainly they doe actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7342:39"/>
deſtroy the ſoule of the atchieuer. But the Pope is
ſo <hi>wondrouſly ſollicitous</hi> of their <hi>ſafety,</hi> that perhaps in
caſe of extremity, if they ſhould chance to dye in hotte
blood <hi>vnconfeſſed,</hi> hee will, as Pope <hi>Clement</hi> in his Bull
at his Iubilee, command the Angells to take their ſoules
out of their bodies <hi>abſolued,</hi> and carry them ſtraight
into the glory of <hi>Paradice,</hi> and not ſo much as one
touch at <hi>Purgatorie</hi> by the way. Onely here is one <hi>item</hi>
more (by the way) what they doe, it muſt be as that of
<hi>Iudas, ſpeedily</hi> done, intimated here by <hi>deſire of the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

then the Pope will want matter to animate ſome deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſonne or ſonnes hereunto, beſides earneſt deſire that
they ſhould <hi>take speciall notice of the pontifician charity, ſo
wondrouſly ſollicitous of their ſafety:</hi> he prefixeth a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

to aduance forward their miſcheifeous plot in hand. For

vnto vs by one,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Sheldon in <hi>his</hi> ſuruey of the miracles of Antichriſt.</note> who once had beene too well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with ſuch proceedings, when he was a Popiſh
Prieſt, till it pleaſed God by the light of his truth to bring
him home vnto vs, and make him a worthy member of our
<hi>Church,</hi> and a pregnant inſtrument to detect <hi>Antichriſt,</hi>
with his deluſions.</p>
            <p>But whereas your father-hood tells your ſonnes of the
<hi>Legions of Angells fluttering about</hi> them, if you ſpeake of
the good <hi>Angells:</hi> herein we poore of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
comfort our ſelues againſt theſe your vaine boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and lying confidence. For wee are ſure thoſe <hi>legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are <hi>miniſtring ſpirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> 
               <hi>ſent forth to miniſter for them, which

Gods ſeruants to <hi>keepe</hi> them <hi>in all their wayes:</hi> they
<hi>pitch their tents round about them that feare God, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

one of Gods Prophets, againſt a whole band of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Therefore in theſe heauenly <hi>Legions,</hi> your Sonnes
can haue no confidence at all for protection. For how can
your ſonnes be the heires of ſaluation, to whom you
vtterly deny the meanes of ſaluation, as is ſauing faith
in Chriſt? what charge can they haue to protect your
<hi>ſonnes,</hi> whom you cauſe to goe out of their waies, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling

your ſonnes may juſtly feare, that thoſe <hi>Angells</hi> ſhall ſtand
with their ſwords drawne to ſtoppe your courſe, and to
cut you off, as that <hi>Angell</hi> did to <hi>Balaam,</hi> becauſe your

is ſufficient to ſmite, and ſlay a million of you <hi>in one

and will moſt certainly bee a ſeuere rewarder of all Popiſh

            <p>For the <hi>purpled Martyrs,</hi> whom <hi>England</hi> hath ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>heauenly aſſemblies:</hi> true it is, being vnderſtood of
the true <hi>Martyrs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom in the dayes of <hi>Queene</hi>
MARY, the Antichriſtian crueltie of <hi>Rome,</hi> rather then
<hi>England,</hi> ſent <hi>be purpled</hi> in their owne innocent blood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe <hi>heauenly aſſemblies,</hi> of their fellow <hi>Martyrs</hi> and
<hi>Saints.</hi> But thoſe you here call <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
haue ſuffered juſt puniſhments, for their fowle
crimes, and abominable treaſons, thoſe without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
dying embrued in their owne blood, were no doubt
ſent thither, where not all your purgatory flames, though
neuer ſo hotte, can purge away the leaſt ſlaine of ſuch
helliſh guilt. So that betweene theſe <hi>Romiſh Martyrs,</hi>
and thoſe our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there is ſo great a gulph ſet, that
there is an impoſſibilitie of the leaſt communion of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But wee deny not, wee enuy not (but pitie rather)
that all ſuch your <hi>Romiſh Martyrs</hi> goe all to one place,
who as they are confederates in the ſame crimes, ſo it is
juſt, that they ſhould bee aſſociates in the ſame place, and

            <q>
               <hi>The anxious prayers of the mournefull Church deſire
of God for you the ſpirit of Charity, and Fortitude.
The counſels of the Apoſtolique ſenate, and the prayers
of Chriſtendome, take care of your ſafety, in ſo large a
theater of heaven and earth; what rigour of year con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
what ſublimitie of a tryumphant mind becomes it
you to haue in you? The counſels of your predeceſſors
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7342:45"/>
haue beene in the like ieopardy, the lights of the holy
Ghoſt, and the armour of light bee your wiſe oracles, and
your actions the examples of fortitude.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Anſwer.</p>
            <p>IN the former clauſe the Pope animates his ſonnes, as
being a <hi>ſpectacle</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Angels:</hi> here he ſets
them in the <hi>large theater of Heauen and Earth.</hi> No doubt
they are to play ſome notable prize: Or rather hee brings
them forth into the open field, where the maine battle
is to be fought. Hee is now growne to that <hi>confidence</hi> in
his Pontifician forces, as hee ſcorneth any more to goe to
worke by digging and delving, and cloſe vndermining;
hee will try it out by dint of ſword. To this end hee calls
mightily vpon his ſonnes for <hi>fortitude,</hi> for <hi>rigid conſtancy,</hi>
for <hi>ſublimitie of a triumphant mind,</hi> for ſuch bright <hi>armour,</hi>
for ſuch braue <hi>actions,</hi> as may be the <hi>examples of fortitude.</hi>
This whole clauſe breathes nothing, but <hi>Arme, Arme.</hi>
Now is <hi>Antichriſt</hi> come to his full height; hee will now
aduenture his Kingdome in one maine battle: now is
the time in all appearance, for the fulfilling of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
<hi>Reu.</hi> 17. it would be ſet downe in Capitall letters.
THE TEN HORNES, TEN KINGS, HAVE

AND THE LAMB SHALL OVERCOME THEM:
FOR HE IS LORD OF LORDS, AND KING

for they are the ſpirits of Diuells, working miracles,
which go forth to the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world
to gather them to the battail of that great day of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
Loe here this fulfilled before our eyes this day: when
were there more ſwarmes of Ieſuites (thoſe <hi>vncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
thoſe <hi>frogs,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſpirits of Diuells,</hi> that ſeduce with lyes

in <hi>England,</hi> where this battaile is mainely intended to

and incite them, and how vigilant and diligent are
theſe <hi>froggs,</hi> to arme ſtates, and kingdomes here, and elſe
where, yea, like thoſe <hi>froggs of Egipt,</hi> crawling into Kings
Chambers, by their Croking and crowching, <hi>to gather
them to this great battaile of the great day of God Almighty.</hi>
Now, euen now (I ſay) is this a doing; and for their

the <hi>anxious prayers of the mournefull Church.</hi> But bleſſed
be God our comfort is, they be but the <hi>anxious prayers</hi> of

Antichriſtian, Apoſtatized <hi>Church,</hi> that <hi>whore of Babilon,</hi>
that enemy of Chriſt, and his word; That <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe
prayers; are abomination to the Lord; for as much as
they not onely proceede of infidelitie, and want of true
faith in God, which they haue altogether abandoned,
and accurſſed, as in their councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> but becauſe
alſo they are powred out for obtaining of their moſt
wicked ends, and purpoſes, as the diſhonour of God,
treaſons, and rebellions, murthers, and maſſacres, and all

If God, as euer hitherto, <hi>bee on our ſide,</hi> how ſhall
you <hi>bee againſt vs:</hi> Doe you not remember how many
times, how mightily, how miraculouſly our God hath
defended vs, and defeated you? how he fruſtrated your
proud confidence in that your <hi>invinſible Nauy</hi> in 88. as he
did the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea?</hi> doe yee not remember,
how in your <hi>Gunpowder plott,</hi> wherein you <hi>digged as deepe

But yee preſume we are become changelings, to make

our God, as yee haue done: Yet we muſt needes confeſſe
to our owne ſhame, that we haue not walked worthy of,

enjoyed for theſe many yeeres, euen to the aſtoniſhment,

the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> (a day worthy to be put in the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi>
of our perpetuall thankeſgiuing) vpon that very
day (I ſay) God began euen miraculouſly to ſtoppe that
ſad and vnſeaſonable influence of heauen, wherewith
our fields, now waxing white to the harueſt, were ſo
pittifully drenched, that almoſt all hope of harveſt, was
drowned in our feare of a deluge in ſtead thereof: yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

continued ſo extraordinarily, and conſtantly faire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one dayes intermiſſion, vntill by Gods fauour, they
brought vs in not onely an harveſt in ſeaſon, but in an

ſett our ſelues to ſeeke his <hi>face</hi> and <hi>fauour</hi> in the pardon

your <hi>Dagon</hi> cheeke by joule by <hi>Gods Arke,</hi> and to aduance
the Throne of your <hi>Antichriſt</hi> euen in the face of Chriſts
Tribunall: and all this (remember, and marke it well)
vpon your very fifth of <hi>Nouember.</hi> Remember I ſay, and
forget it not, that it may teach you to tremble before that
God of Ours: and euer may we alſo remember it, for
thankefullneſſe to our God, for vindicating his owne cauſe,
and glory againſt ſuch proud, and inſolent affronts. Well,
conſult (I ſay) lay your heads, ioyne you forces together,
arme your ſelues with as much might, as yee haue malice

Church be wrung from the Vicars of God Almightie; that
which our predeceſſor <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth of bleſſed memorie
in ſo graue a deliberation decreed, that ought yee altogether

tribute due to the Prince of the Apoſtles, no threats of
men, or flatteries, ought at any time to extort from you;
they that perſwade you otherwiſe, thoſe prophecie to you
a lying viſion, and a fraudulent divination. For ſooner

<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent to ſupply his ſtead, at his aſcenſion. This Spirit
gouernes and directs his Church into all truth. This is that
<hi>other Comforter, the ſpirit of truth</hi> By this <hi>ſpirit Chriſt</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with his <hi>Church to the end of the world.</hi> But for any one

of <hi>God almightie,</hi> ſimply conſidered as <hi>God,</hi> and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and iudge of all here on earth, wee acknowledge not

as ſo many Vicegerents of <hi>God almightie,</hi> to gouerne and
moderate their peculiar Dominions, in, for, and according
to <hi>God,</hi> and his word; theſe be Gods Lieutenants here on
earth, and therefore called <hi>Gods.</hi> Now giue me leaue to tell
you, that the iuriſdiction of <hi>God almighty</hi> here on earth is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from that of Chriſt. Gods iuriſdiction is alſo in things
temporall: Chriſts iuriſdiction as Mediator is in things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.
Theſe two iuriſdictions are not compatible, not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident,
or concurrent in their totall extent in any one
man. Onely the outward politie of the Church, both as
touching perſons, and cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, are ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God almighties Lieutenants here on earth, as all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Magiſtrates: ſo that in this regard, thoſe that are
Chriſts Vicegerents in common, as all faithfull <hi>Miniſters</hi> of
the <hi>Gospell,</hi> who are <hi>Chriſts Legats,</hi> or <hi>Ambaſſadors (2. Cor.
5. 28.)</hi> are for their perſons, and outward eſtate ſubiect to
God almighties Lieutenants, ſet ouer them.</p>
            <p>So that if you will confine your ſelfe to the title of <hi>Chriſts
Vicar:</hi> firſt, as no man is capable of that title, as you chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
it: ſo neither can you by vertue thereof ſhew you
haue any ſuch power deriued vpon you from <hi>Christ;</hi> for
<hi>Chriſt</hi> left, or bequeathed no other kinde of power to his

               <hi>Goſpell</hi> exerciſed in his <hi>Miniſters</hi> here on earth. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in that diſpenſation of his, exerciſed no ſuch power or iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction

he ſubmitted himſelfe to pay tribute to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> yea,
to be iudged at <hi>Caeſars</hi> barre, from which the <hi>Pope</hi> hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
himſelfe, and Clergie, by his papall <hi>decrees.</hi> And was
it, becauſe Chriſt wanted power to vindicate and defend

of his mouth his apprehenders fell backward to the ground.
Hee had twelue legions of Angels in readineſſe to defend

               <hi>Object.</hi> But had not Chriſt, as being God, ſoueraigne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
ouer Kings and Princes, to diſpoſe of their kingdomes,
and the like, if it had pleaſed him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Mediatour</hi> (the office whereof he came
to execute) is to be conſidered, not ſimply as <hi>God,</hi> but as hee
was <hi>God-man.</hi> In that regard the power of his diſpenſation,
was limited by his Father, that ſent, and appointed him. So
that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I came to doe, not mine owne will, but the will of
him that ſent me.</hi> Not that Chriſts will was contrary to his
fathers, but ſubordinate onely, as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> to doe that
which the father appointed him, and no more. Chriſt would
not, muſt not goe beyond his Commiſſion, receiued of the
father. Now the <hi>Father</hi> gaue him no ſuch commiſſion of a
temporall iuriſdiction, no not ſo much as in ſmall cauſes.
When thoſe two brethren came to him, intreating him to
<hi>diuide</hi> their <hi>inheritance</hi> betweene them: hee refuſed, ſaying,
<hi>Who made me a Iudge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 12. v. 14.</note> 
               <hi>or a diuider ouer you?</hi> Hee had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
in ſuch things from the <hi>Father.</hi> And if not in ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
matters, as that was, how much leſſe ouer Emperours and
Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But although Chriſts power was limited, during
his abode on earth in the ſtate of his humiliation: yet after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
his reſurrection, hee receiued an abſolute, and vnlimited po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:
as he ſaith, <hi>All power is giuen mee in heauen and earth:</hi>
from this <hi>power</hi> doth the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Chriſts <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar</hi> challenge a

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in that viſion ſaw the <hi>great

with great admiration.</hi> But when wee ſee this blaſphemous
<hi>Beaſt</hi> not in a viſion, but with open eyes, how can we chooſe
but greatly wonder? for this very ſpeech of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>
aſſumes as ſpoken of himſelfe, and that in as full, yea, more
ample ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> applied it to himſelfe. For although
by this ſpeech Chriſt declared himſelfe to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and
ſo to his <hi>Church,</hi> to be the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God <hi>conſecrated</hi> for euer
<hi>Lord ouer all,</hi> to the great comfort of his drooping <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
now at his departure: yet herein doth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhow
any alteration in the diſpenſation of his Miniſtery, deputed
to his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Hee doth not hereby inueſt his Miniſters
with a larger power and commiſſion, then himſelfe execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his owne perſon, while hee was with them; for what
followeth? <hi>All power is giuen me in heauen, and earth: go ye
therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> Hee ſaith
not, <hi>Goe yee therefore, and exerciſe this power of mine ouer the
Kings of the earth, and if they will not obey your Miniſterie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, or abſolue their people from their allegiance, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you of their Kingdomes to whom you will.</hi> Much leſſe ſaid
he any ſuch thing to <hi>Peter</hi> alone: <hi>Goe Thou therefore, and
haue thou all power in heauen and earth, for thee, and for thy
ſucceſſour in the See of Rome.</hi> No ſuch thing. <hi>All the power
that Chriſt</hi> delegates to his Diſciples, and that in common
men, is for their Miniſteriall function, to preach the <hi>Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and adminiſter the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Herein <hi>Peter</hi> had but his
ſhare with the reſt of his fellowes. They were ioyned in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
Commiſſion, none aboue another; much leſſe aboue
others in any Temporall Iuriſdiction. To this their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to animate and arme them, againſt all difficulties,
and diſcouragements, either in regard of their owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and naturall diſabilities, or of the worlds malice and
might in oppoſing them: hee tels them, <hi>All power is giuen
me in heauen, and earth: Goe yee therefore, &amp;c. Feare nothing,
for I, who haue all power giuen me in heauen and earth, am with
you, and will be with you to the end of the world.</hi> And it is worth

the noting, that this laſt charge, which Chriſt (now leauing
the world, and ſo his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> as concerning his bodily
preſence) gaue vnto them, hee gaue it in common to them
all, without putting difference: which plainly ſheweth, that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> left no <hi>Supremacie</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> ouer the reſt of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
as the <hi>Pope</hi> vſurpeth, which otherwiſe no doubt hee
would haue expreſſed, if it had bene ſuch an <hi>Article of faith,</hi>
whereupon depended the <hi>neceſſitie of ſaluation,</hi> as <hi>Pontificians</hi>
teach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet for all this, the</hi> Pope <hi>will needes (as</hi> Chriſts <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar)
<hi>challenge theſe words to himſelfe, and be an equall ſharet

Chriſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> hath placed the myſterie of the Apoſtolike fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

from him, as from a certaine head, he might diffuſe his gifts, as it

he himſelfe was, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Tues Petrus, &amp; ſuper hanc Petram
&amp;c. <hi>In a word, the</hi> Popes triple crowne, <hi>is to ſignifie his triple
Dominion and iuriſdiction in heauen, earth, and purgatorie,

dominion. Thus all <hi>power</hi> is giuen him in heauen and earth.
Thus hee runnes away with Chriſts power, but leaues the
charge of Chriſt to his Diſciples, to preach the word, and
adminiſter the Sacraments.</hi>

fame foot to take away his crowne that had put it on. Thus
we ſee <hi>Antichriſt exalting himſelfe aboue all that is called God,</hi>
and that in the higheſt degree. So that it may be admired,
that any man hauing but his eyes open to compare the <hi>Pope</hi>
with his owne picture,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 2.</note> can doubt, that he is that <hi>Antichriſt;</hi>
vnleſſe ſuch men be giuen vp <hi>to a ſtrong deluſion, becauſe they
receiued not the loue of the truth.</hi> But it is lamentable to ſee
learned men ſo blind-folded, as not to ſee this <hi>Myſterie of
iniquitie.</hi> But more pernicious, that not ſeeing it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
they would perſwade the world alſo, that the Pope
is not <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Is it time now to make Apologies for the
<hi>Pope</hi> not to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> when he ſo egregiouſly plaies the
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> euen vnder our noſes? when hee goes about to
ſeduce, and withdraw the hearts of ſubiects from the <hi>King,</hi>
from our gracious Soueraigne? It was <hi>Tortus</hi> his ſpeech,
noted by the learned Biſhop, in his <hi>Tortura,</hi> to be Romes
Doctrine,<note place="margin">Tortura Torti pag. 328.</note> that <hi>at the hiſſing of a ſlye, which is in Babylon,</hi>
namely at <hi>Rome, the ſubiects would reuolt from the obedience of
their Prince, and ſo by the window treaſon immediately entreth.
The Pope is the flye of Babylon, who can make of the Prince, no
Prince, of the ſubiect, no ſubiect, and the no ſubiect, againſt the
no Prince; what may he not attempt? But this is, in caſe the
Prince bee an Hereticke, or Schiſmaticke. And what is it for
the Prince to be an Herticke: forſooth, if hee doe not yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the Popes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſſall; which</hi> (ſaith the Biſhop) <hi>is elſe to deny
one of the prime Articles of the Chriſtian faith. It was the caſe of

            <p>To proceede: the Pope mentioneth a graue Decree of
his Predeceſſor <hi>Paul</hi> 5. no doubt he meaneth that Bull ſent
hither into <hi>England,</hi> inhibiting his ſonnes the oath of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.
The <hi>Pope</hi> calleth it a <hi>Decree of truth,</hi> which muſt be

<hi>threats,</hi> nor <hi>flatteries extort it from them:</hi> rather part with
<hi>life,</hi> then <hi>faith:</hi> yea this they muſt bee ſo vndoubtedly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of, that <hi>If an Angell from heauen teach otherwiſe, then
this Apoſtolike truth, let him be accurſed.</hi> Here at laſt breakes
forth the thunderbolt it ſelfe, which were enough to blaſt
the very <hi>Angels of heauen;</hi> if, for ſubiects to denie due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their lawfull Princes, were an <hi>Apoſtolike truth.</hi> But
can a Chriſtian eare heare ſuch blaſphemie without horror,
with any patience? This an <hi>Apoſtolike doctrine,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtolike
truth: Papall</hi> it is, <hi>Diabolicall</hi> it is, raked out of the pit of hell.
<hi>Apoſtolike</hi> it is not, neither from <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Peter:</hi> from
<hi>Paul</hi> 5. but not from <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle. Paul</hi> teacheth the
contrary, <hi>Rom. 13. Peter</hi> the contrary, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. how durſt
you, you bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> preach ſuch a doctrine, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Apostolike truth of Rome?</hi> either you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
your doctrine, or loe a ſmoaking <hi>Anathema</hi> is breathed
out againſt you.</p>
            <p>But leſt thoſe holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> leſt <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, leſt <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

of God ſhould come within the danger of the <hi>Popes</hi> curſe,
and all for the miſtaking of one word <hi>Apoſtolike,</hi> for <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke.</hi>
We are rather to thinke, that as <hi>Manicheus</hi> writing
himſelfe <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> hence hee would conclude his damnable
doctrines to be <hi>Apostolike:</hi> ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> calling himſelfe that
<hi>Apostolike</hi> one, therefore all his lying <hi>Oracles</hi> muſt be taken
for <hi>Apostolike truths.</hi> And ſee here alſo how impiouſly the
<hi>Pope</hi> goes on to peruert, and prophane the ſacred <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
If an Angell from heauen teach you otherwiſe, let him be
anathema.</hi> This was the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpeech to the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
rightly applyed. The <hi>Pope</hi> vſurpes the ſame words, but to
his moſt wicked purpoſe. Herein alſo hee ſhewes himſelfe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7342:55"/>
that great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who was of old noted to be an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
falſifier, and peruerter of the Scriptures. Take one
example:<note place="margin">Origen. in Mat. 24. Tract. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omnis ſermo qui profitetur, &amp;c. Euery
ſpeech that profeſſeth the expoſitions of the Scriptures, and the
faith of them, and hath not the truth, is iuſtly to be vnderſtood
to be Antichriſt, comming in Christs name, and ſaying, I am
Chriſt, lying, and not able to ſhew the forme of truth in himſelfe.</hi>
How truly this is verified of the <hi>Pope,</hi> among infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſtances of his audacious peruerting of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
this one here, taken from the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> may ſufficiently
euince.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Oath</hi> is preiudiciall to the <hi>Catholike faith:</hi> to
what <hi>Catholike faith?</hi> you muſt vnderſtand there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>Catholike faith:</hi> the one, that of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> of the
<hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and
Prophets, of the whole <hi>Church</hi> of God in all ages, in all
places of the world, which is therefore called the <hi>Catholike</hi>
faith, becauſe it is vniuerſall, and this is the onely true and
proper Catholike faith. There is another <hi>faith,</hi> that hath the
name of <hi>Catholike,</hi> but with an addition, either expreſſed or
implied, to wit, the <hi>Romane Catholike</hi> faith; and becauſe
<hi>Romane Catholike,</hi> therefore indeede not <hi>Catholike,</hi> no true,
but a baſtard Catholike faith. The obiect of this <hi>Romane
Catholike faith,</hi> is together with the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
(for the <hi>myſterie</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> contained therein to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
true beleeuers ſaluation, they exclude from being ſo
much, as a <hi>partiall obiect</hi> of this their faith, but in generall
onely, as an Hiſtory) the <hi>Apocryphall Bookes.</hi> Which Saint
<hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, are for <hi>inſtruction of manners, not for instruction
of faith,</hi> all their <hi>Traditions</hi> which they call <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> all
their <hi>Decretales</hi> and <hi>Extrauagants,</hi> and aboue all, that which
is the ſumme of all the reſt, the <hi>Oracle of the Popes owne breaſt</hi>
inerrable; and ſo whatſoeuer his Holineſſe either hath
taught, or ſhall hereafter teach, as he ſeeth to be moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
for the preſent ſtate of the Church: all theſe are
the <hi>adequate obiect</hi> of this <hi>Roman-Catholike faith.</hi> Among
which Doctrines <hi>Apoſtolike</hi> this is one, to denie <hi>fidelitie</hi> to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7342:56"/>
               <hi>Kings and Princes,</hi> when the <hi>Pope</hi> commandeth. This is an
<hi>Article of the Romane Catholike faith,</hi> not to be violated vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
paine of damnation. So that to take the oath of <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
and keepe it, as it cannot ſtand with the ſafetie of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

blinded, who ſhall certainly learne, how great credit is
to be giuen to Catholike ſubiects in thoſe things, which
you may promiſe; who leſt they ſhould make themſelues
lyable to periurie, they had rather breath out their ſpirit,
then their voice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer.</p>
            <p>How? after all theſe blaſphemies againſt <hi>God,</hi> and his
word, dare the <hi>Pope</hi> intreat the <hi>Father of lights?</hi> vpon what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7342:56"/>
confidence? vpon what hope to be heard? Will the <hi>Father
of lights</hi> heare the prayer of the <hi>man of Sinne, of the Sonne of
Perdition,</hi> of the <hi>great Antichriſt, the Beaſt full of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</hi>
yea rather, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbad the diuell to confeſſe him,
to vſurpe his name, to preach of <hi>Ieſus:</hi> ſo we intreat the
Pope, not to intreat for our <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Lords Annointed:</hi> hee
needeth none of ſuch prayers. Hee hath daily thouſands of
good Chriſtians, of his louing, and faithfull ſubiects, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the <hi>Father of lights</hi> for him, for his life, Crowne, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
happineſſe; which prayers no doubt will preuaile
with God to defeat all <hi>Romes</hi> prayers and plots, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
againſt our noble King, Church, and State. We know
the Popes prayers to be meerely phariſaicall, in ſtead of <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
to <hi>prey</hi> vpon vs, vnder the colour of many <hi>Pater noſters,</hi>
to <hi>deuoure</hi> our <hi>habitations.</hi> Againſt the Popes prayers here,
our moſt humble, and harty prayers, and ſhall be to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of lights</hi> in the name of his <hi>Sonne Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that hee
will not ſuffer the <hi>heart</hi> of our dread Soueraigne to be <hi>blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
with Popiſh bandiſhments, and faire promſes, that ſo he
may not too dearely buy the certaine knowledge; <hi>how great
credit is to be giuen to Romane-Catholikes, in thoſe things which
they may promiſe.</hi> For note how his holineſſe in the very next
words bewrayeth how little confidence is to bee giuen to
ſuch promiſes, as his Catholike Sonnes may make; for ſaith
he, <hi>least they ſhould make themſeles liable to periurie.</hi> But it is
ſomething, that the Pope had rather his <hi>Catholike Sonnes</hi>
ſhould by making faire promiſes, hazzard their fidelitie
therein, then by taking the <hi>Oath,</hi> incurre the danger of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie.</hi>
Although a good Chriſtian makes conſcience as much
of his ſolemne <hi>promiſe,</hi> as of an <hi>oath.</hi> But it ſeemeth, if his
<hi>Catholike Sonnes</hi> ſhould take the <hi>oath,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> puts them in
minde, they ſhould thereby expoſe themſelues to <hi>periurie;</hi>
ſo that if they doe but promiſe <hi>fidelitie,</hi> he teacheth them the
very ready way to perfidiouſneſſe, and breach of promiſe:
for if an <hi>oath</hi> cannot preſerue them from <hi>periurie,</hi> how ſhall
a promiſe from breach thereof? ſeeing both periurie and
perfidiouſneſſe grow from the ſame root of Ieſuiticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7342:57"/>
               <hi>Nulla fides ſeruanda cum hereticis: no faith to be kept
with heretickes.</hi> Herein therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that ſeeing he tels vs plainly, he will keepe <hi>no faith with
heretickes,</hi> neither will he make any faith with them. Onely
herein he is moſt vniuſt, that not onely thoſe, who are the
onely true, and orthodox <hi>Catholikes,</hi> he cals <hi>heretickes,</hi> and
thoſe that are his ſonnes, and conſequently the limmes of
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> Apoſtates from the faith of Chriſt, he calleth <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes:</hi>
but more eſpecially that hee goeth about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
ſubiects, not to enter into couenant of <hi>fidelitie</hi> by <hi>oath</hi>
to their rightfull, and onely Soueraigne King ouer them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, next vnder <hi>God;</hi> which couenant they ought not
onely to make, being demanded, but betweene God and
their owne heart religiouſly to vow, and before all the world
faithfully auow. He that ſhall perſwade men from this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
bond of dutie, is a traitour, and vſurper ouer God and
man, euen the great <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Howſoeuer, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no one <hi>Catholike Sonne in England,</hi> ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
if he haue but a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> heart in him vn-Ieſuited,
that he will refuſe, but rather moſt willingly take the oath,
and be ready, whenſoeuer there ſhall be occaſion, to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his perſon, and all his power, againſt any <hi>Romiſh Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Inuaſion.</hi> They cannot be ſo farre blinded, and beſotted
with Popiſh ſpels, and Ieſuiticall charmes, but that they
will euer put an infinite difference betweene their <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
and a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King. But if any be otherwiſe minded, hauing
exchanged his <hi>Engliſh</hi> for a <hi>Spaniſh heart,</hi> if he may not truſt
himſelfe to take the <hi>oath,</hi> for feare of <hi>periurie:</hi> neither (I
truſt) will his bare promiſe be taken, leſt whenſoeuer the
<hi>great flye</hi> ſhould <hi>hiſſe</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he ſhould forget his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
&amp; turn <hi>hornet</hi> or <hi>waſpe,</hi> to ſet againſt the <hi>Maſter Bee</hi> of
this <hi>hony-flowing</hi> hiue of <hi>England.</hi> But I truſt (for all the <hi>Popes</hi>
charge here to the contrary) that no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſt, will ſo far
preferre his breath, before his life, that rather then ſpend the
one in taking the <hi>oath,</hi> he will expire the other. It followeth.</p>
            <q>But that your vertue may be found more precious then
gold, which is tried in the fire: teach that Kingdome, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7342:57"/>
there is no ſuch force in the crueltie of enemies, that it is
able to extinguiſh the eternall fire of charitie in your
hearts. Pray for them, that perſecute you, humilitie pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
concord, faſting, prayer, are your weapons, which in
the cruell conflict, ye ought to draw forth, that the palmes
of coeleſtiall triumph may flouriſh in your hands: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bleſſed <hi>Peter</hi> was forbidden to ſmite with the ſword
the cruell aſſailants of Chriſt: wee exhort you, hauing the
preſent good of the Church before our eyes, that in the
meane time you thinke the thoughts of peace, and that
yee pray for eternall life euen for the King, while he takes
away your mortall life. So muſt the ſouldiers of Chriſt
make warre, vnder the banner of the Croſſe; the mouth
of them that ſpeake wicked things, ſhall be confounded,
ſeeing ye know not, to hate thoſe who torment you. But
the Lord, who is able to turne your ſorrow into ioy, ſhall
be at your right hand, that yee be not moued, and may not

               <q>That
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7342:58"/>
is an old peece of craft, often detected, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſuſpected: that at no time more the Popes doe
write to ſuch a purpoſe, then when moſt of all they intend
miſchiefe. Here they would ſweetly impoſe vpon our
ſharpeſt wits, that they may ſay to themſelues, Peace and
all ſafe, that ſo ſudden deſtruction may take them tardy,
while they ſuſpect no ſuch thing. There was no cauſe why
yee ſhould mention that admonition, which to vs is the
meſſenger of a ſtorme, certainely then alwaies imminent.
But there was alſo another reaſon of this admonition: for
this buſineſſe of the powder-plot was ſo pleaſing, ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
hopefull, that they would not haue it interrupted
with any tumult, but ſhould command all others to bee
quiet, that this one buſineſſe might take place, wherein all
their hope was lapped vp.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus by the iudgement of our graue and experienced
<hi>Fathers,</hi> wee may learne what interpretation to make, what
to expect, when <hi>Romes holy Fathers</hi> in their <hi>Buls</hi> exhort
their <hi>Sonnes to be quiet, and to containe themſelues from tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,</hi>
as here the <hi>Pope</hi> doth. If thus they did vpon the <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-plot,</hi>
all huſht, till the ſudden blaſt: doth not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſun-gleame foretoken ſome ſuch hideous
ſtorme, ready to fall vpon vs? Is not this a ſprinkling of water
vpon lime? or with oyle to ſuppreſſe the flame? The <hi>token</hi>
which <hi>Iudas</hi> gaue to the apprehenders of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
<hi>kiſſe,</hi> and <hi>Romes</hi> ſignall to her treacherous attempts,
is <hi>Peace, peace.</hi> But as the <hi>French</hi> ſay in their Prouerbe, <hi>When
the Spaniard comes to parle of peace, then double-bolt the
doores:</hi> ſo I hope, <hi>England</hi> will be ſo wiſe, as when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
the <hi>Popes</hi> morning ſun-ſhine of peace from vnder a
cloud, they will <hi>prouide for a rainie day.</hi> But to the words, in
more particular.</p>
            <p>In the forefront of this clauſe, here is twice mention of
fire. And how great matter a little fire kindleth? This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
word in the Lord <hi>Mounteagles</hi> letter, of fire, was that,
which through Gods prouidence kindled in King <hi>Iames</hi> his
conceit a ſuſpition of ſuch a like plot, as indeede it proued.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7342:58"/>
Vpon whoſe iudgements wee may the more boldly ſuſpect
by the Popes twice mention of fire, that without doubt ſome
fiery triall is now in hand, euen fire and ſword. Here againe
the <hi>Pope</hi> puts his <hi>Sonnes</hi> in minde of their <hi>vertue,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe;
as alſo of their <hi>enemies,</hi> the King and State: enough
to blow the coales of their hatred, and ſo to exerciſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<hi>fire</hi> of their vnquenchable <hi>charitie.</hi> A <hi>fiery charitie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
of the nature of <hi>wilde-fire,</hi> or as the ſtone <hi>Asbestos,</hi>
which once inflamed, cannot be quenched againe. But can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>Pontifician charitie be loſt?</hi> be <hi>quenched?</hi> This is againſt
your <hi>Trent-doctrine,</hi> which teacheth, <hi>that charitie, with other
graces may be loſt.</hi> But happily you meane, this your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
<hi>fire</hi> of <hi>charitie</hi> towards vs your enemies, is not
a <hi>gift of grace,</hi> but a <hi>Papall gloſſe,</hi> or ſuch a <hi>charitie</hi> as is of the
eternall fire of hell, ſuch (if ſo good) as poore <hi>Diues</hi> his <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi>
to his brethren in <hi>hell-flames;</hi> ſuch, or the like <hi>charitie</hi>
is this here. Whatſoeuer it is wee doe not greatly affect or
deſire this your <hi>charitie,</hi> but wee pray God, that wee neuer
come to feele the <hi>fierie vnquenchableneſſe</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>For your weapons of <hi>humilitie, faſting, prayer,</hi> and the
like, would to <hi>God</hi> we had no more cauſe to feare your <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
and <hi>piſtals, treaſons,</hi> and <hi>treacheries, falſehoods</hi> and <hi>flatTHe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
more then theſe. But if the <hi>armour</hi> of your white ſonnes
<hi>patience</hi> were a little better ſcoured, and exerciſed among
vs, we ſhould as little feare theſe your pernicious weapons,
as thoſe your ſuperſtitious deuotions. But ſurely you muſt
haue other gates <hi>weapons,</hi> then all theſe, to make good that
<hi>cruell conflict</hi> you ſpeak of, to win you thoſe <hi>celeſtiall palmes
of triumph.</hi> And your <hi>faſting, prayers,</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but bode ſome notable enterpriſe now a preparing.
What ſolemne <hi>Proceſſions</hi> had you <hi>vpon</hi> 88? So that theſe
your admonitions giue vs to prepare for ſome <hi>cruell conflict</hi>
indeede. Elſe, what meaneth your exciting your ſonnes to
<hi>patience?</hi> as if they were in the <hi>fierie triall;</hi> as if they were
to vndergoe a <hi>cruell conflict?</hi> you know it is ridiculous to
meane it of the preſent ſtate of things. But if your <hi>ſonnes</hi> be
in any hazard of a <hi>cruell conflict;</hi> we cannot conceiue how it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7342:59"/>
ſhould be, vnleſſe vpon the diſcouery of your <hi>Armadoes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
towards vs, they ſhould in the meane time (to
make all faſt in vnitie at home) be vrged to take the <hi>oath</hi> of
<hi>fidelitie</hi> to our <hi>King,</hi> which refuſed, might bring condigne
puniſhments vpon them. Although I am perſwaded, no
<hi>Engliſh Papiſt</hi> is ſuch an vnnaturall miſcreant, yea ſo fooliſh
and brutiſh, as he would betray his own deere natiue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
to a ſorraine <hi>Tyrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You exhort your ſonnes to pray for the <hi>Kings eternall life.</hi>
Why? alas! Is his <hi>temporall</hi> in ſuch danger? <hi>God forbid.</hi>
But wee pray alſo for his temporall life, that after a long,
happy, religious gouernment, and raigne here, hee may
at length come to enioy that <hi>eternall Crowne of glorie.</hi> But all
your <hi>prayers,</hi> all your <hi>patience,</hi> and peaceableneſſe, you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
your <hi>Sonnes</hi> to, is with ſpeciall reference to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
good of the Church;</hi> vntill the opportunitie and ſeaſon
ſerue to ſhew your ſelues in open colours. For the Kings
<hi>taking away your Sonnes mortall life,</hi> it is ridiculous. But if
your ſonnes muſt pray for the <hi>Kings eternall life,</hi> onely <hi>while
he takes from them their mortall:</hi> we may make a queſtion,
whether euer they will pray for him; at leaſtwiſe, if they
reepe them quiet, and liue like peaceable ſubiects, as you
ſeeme to perſwade them. For the reſt of your words, as, of
<hi>Chriſts Souldiers,</hi> and ſo to the end of the clauſe, we paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them; as being weary of your <hi>blasphemies,</hi> and falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.
What part haue you, or yours in <hi>Chriſts Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
vnleſſe your <hi>ſonnes</hi> vtterly renounce communion with

               <note place="margin">See Platina in Coeleſtine 5. &amp; Bonif. 8.</note> and flye to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>word:</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

               <hi>ſmiting</hi>

that adhere to ſuch an head. And if the <hi>inheritance</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

haue you therein? for wherein doe ye imitate <hi>Chriſt?</hi>

yea, wherein doe yee not both teach and practiſe quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vnto him? But your ſhameleſſe blaſphemies, and bold
miſapplying of the Scriptures are ſo familiar with you, as we
will giue ouer admiting of them. Onely we cannot chooſe
whether we will or no, but admire one thing, that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<hi>bleſſed Peter</hi> for an example of not ſmiting with the

herein eſpecially to ſhew themſelues <hi>Peters Succeſſours,</hi> in
ſmitting with the ſword? ſauing onely, that <hi>Peter</hi> drew his
ſword againſt that rabble rout in defence of his Maſter: you
draw your ſword againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe in his Members,
in <hi>Gods <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icegerents</hi> here on earth, the Lords <hi>Annointed.</hi> All
of you challenge the power of <hi>Peters</hi> ſword: and ſome of
you haue in your owne perſons drawne in out in open field;
as Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. when marching againſt the Emperour, his
Liege Lord, he in a rage threw Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes into <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
as too impotent to vindicate his quarrell, and pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
drew forth <hi>Pauls</hi> ſword, ſaying, <hi>If Peters Keyes could

            <p>But the thing I admire in your example of bleſſed <hi>Peter,</hi>
is this: that here you vſe it to your ſonnes, as a motiue to

typed in his two-topped Miter, in the front whereof,
was anciently written, <hi>Myſterium,</hi> that a man might point

For Antichriſt ſhall be the ſupreame, and laſt Head of

Rome, farre, and neere? Doth not he challenge ſupremacie

The Emperor that now is, hath not he his election, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation

Hands off. That is for his holineſſe alone. So that, if, as ſome

of our deepeſt conſiderations, for the diſcuſſing of ſuch a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>To begin then at the head-ſpring of this our diſcourſe,
it is no newes vnto you, that the Pope of late hath ſent his
<hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Brieue</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> recommended to all his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
ſonnes of <hi>England,</hi> wherein he chargeth you by no
meanes to take the <hi>Oath of Allegeance</hi> or <hi>fidelity</hi> to your
<hi>King,</hi> but rather that you ſhould account him for your
<hi>Enemy;</hi> the ſumme is that you ſhould bee armed with the
ſpirit of rebellion againſt your King and Country, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

               </gap> vnfolding of the <hi>Brieue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How? to charge <hi>ſubiects</hi> to diſauow their fidelity to their
Prince? by what authority? who hath ſuch power ouer men,
to diſpenſe, to diſſolue, to abſolue from the bonds of duty
and obedience, which <hi>naturall ſubiects</hi> owe to their King?
By what lawe or example? God in his word hath taught the
contrary. But Chriſt Vicar hath this power: but Chriſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
the contrary. But the Apoſtolicke ſucceſſour of <hi>Peter</hi>
may doe it: but <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> both, preached, practiſed the
contrary: ſo all the Patriarckes and Prophets: Yet Chriſts
Vicar, <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, are titles not lightly to be regarded;
to which is added alſo, <hi>Head of the Church, Oracle of the
world, to whom is committed all power in heauen and earth, who
cannot erre, to whom all muſt be ſubiect vnder paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and much more then I can tell: Huge titles, enough
to intoxicate and infatuate ſilly and ſimple ſoules, yea and
to dazzle the eyes euen of the acuteſt wits with their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
luſter, where they are attended or entertained but with
credulity.</p>
            <p>But if there be any truth at all in theſe things, concerning
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7342:68"/>
the Pope, whence (in the name of God) hath he theſe titles?
From what ground of truth? He dare plead, from <hi>Scripture.</hi>
From <hi>Scripture?</hi> Hold you there, we deſire no better eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or vmpire in this cauſe: you will graunt then, that
the Scripture is of authority in it ſelfe to challenge our faith
to reſt vpon it, as a moſt ſure rule. Yes, but with condition
(as you are taught) if it haue authority from the <hi>Church:</hi>
From what Church? What Church? Of <hi>Rome:</hi> From whoſe
mouth? who muſt pronounce the verdict? The Pope for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth:
if ſo then the Popes power is not built primarily vpon
the Scriptures but vpon himſelfe, and ſo he is Iudge in his
owne cauſe. The Pope belike lendeth authority to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and they againe repay him with his owne minted

ſhall the rule of Faith bee eeked out to the intire perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to pleaſe the Pope, in caſe his Holineſſe would come
within the compaſſe of any rule? Yes: there is (forſooth)
<hi>the liuely Oracle or voyce of the Church,</hi> which being of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
latitude, doth conſummate the rule of Faith; and the
Popes breſt is the fountaine, whence theſe waters of <hi>Romes</hi>
ſanctuary flow. But the truth is (if there were any truth in it)
this <hi>rule</hi> is ſuch, as will not indure copartnerſhip with
<hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Traditions,</hi> for all they be <hi>Apoſtolicke,</hi> but is
the ſole and ſupreme <hi>Rule</hi> whereby thoſe muſt be ſquared
&amp; whereto they muſt be conformed. Nor is this <hi>Rule</hi> of the

&amp; ſometimes another, according as the changeable &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

which perhaps many of you the Popes <hi>Catholicke ſonnes</hi> will

and let <hi>right reaſon</hi> be the <hi>Moderatour.</hi> Tell me (as

you may anſwere with <hi>Agrippa, Almoſt thou perſwadeſt mee

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7342:69"/>
farre from the Kingdome of God.</hi> But to reſt vpon the voyce of
the Pope, and not vpon the expreſſe words of Scripture,
what is it, but to ſuffer him to <hi>plucke out both your eyes,</hi> that
ſo he may the more eaſily lead you blindfold into hell? Or
what were this, but to make the Pope your <hi>God,</hi> aboue
God and Chriſt, and ſo to adore him, who thus <hi>aduanceth
himſelfe aboue all that is called God?</hi> Fye for ſhame, as God
hath giuen you reaſon, vnderſtanding and iudgement, ſo in
the name of God vſe it to his glory, that gaue it, and ſuffer
no man to cheate you of it, leaſt you proue more ſottiſh then
thoſe heathen, who <hi>worſhipped the creature in ſtead of the

            </p>
            <p>But you are perſwaded of the Popes <hi>inerrability,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Chriſts Vicar, Peters ſucceſſor,</hi> as hauing continued in
the See of <hi>Rome</hi> euer ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, ſo as not any
<hi>Biſhops See</hi> in the world hath done the like. What then? all
Biſhops and Miniſters of the Word may be ſaid to be Chriſts
Vicars, and Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, while they execute
their Miniſtry, as Chriſt and the Apoſtles did. But neuer
any man was Chriſts ſole <hi>Vicar</hi> ouer his Church. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
is peculiar to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that <hi>Other Comforter,</hi>
who onely cannot erre, <hi>leading</hi> Gods people <hi>into all truth.</hi>
As for <hi>Peters Vicarſhip,</hi> he had it but in common with his
fellowe-<hi>Diſciples,</hi> Wee paſſe by thoſe places of Scripture,
which Pontificians haue miſerably peruerted to this purpoſe.
Doe but looke in my anſwer to this Bull or Brieue. And for
lineall vniterrupted ſucceſſion of the <hi>Bp.</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> from the
Apoſtles times: what is this to the purpoſe, to proue the
Popes <hi>Vicarſhip</hi> or his <hi>Succeſſors-ſhip?</hi> Certainely it makes
wondrous much to fulfill all thoſe Prophecies in Scripture,
concerning Antichrſt, whoſe Seat is <hi>Rome.</hi> For may not the
ſame Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſpecially if we meaſure it by the place
where it is fixed) in ſo long a tract of time, come exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to differ from that it was once, in the more pure and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitue
age of it? Doth not experience teach you, that the
ſoundeſt, and ſolideſt Oake in time growes rotten, hollow,
a neſt for Owles, and ſuch like night-birds, vnuſefull for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7342:69"/>
building, and at laſt, good for nothing but the fire? And yet
the while, it is called by the name of ſuch an Oake ſtill. The
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> at firſt was ſound and Apoſtolicall, while
it kept the <hi>Apoſtolicke Faith:</hi> but might not time make it rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and yet be called Apoſtolicke ſtill? <hi>Bethel</hi> (as much
as the houſe of God) ſo called at firſt by <hi>Iacob</hi> who erected
there an Altar for Gods pure worſhip, yet retained that name
ſtill in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time, euen when it was wholly polluted
with the Idolatry of one of his golden Calues erected there.
Ancient goodly Chanels haue beene in time ſo choaked vp
with mud and grauell, that the maine ſtreame hath beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
and driuen another way, and yet haue retained the
name of the old chanell ſtill. Yea that goodly Cittie <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
in Chriſts time, when it crucified Chriſt was called the
<hi>Holy Cittie;</hi> and for all that God hath made that now a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
heap, and the Country about it a deſolation, neuer to
be repaired: yet your Pontificians eſpecially call it the <hi>Holy
Land</hi> ſtill; which notwithſtanding is neuer a whit the holyer,
though by the Popes ſubtile inſtigation, ſo many thouſands
of ſoules haue periſhed about the pretended quarrell, out of
a blind zeale of recoucring it againe; which whither regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or no, the Pope was ſure not to looſe by the bargain;
for if he had regained it, it might haue brought the greater
income to his coffers by the trade of ſuperſtitious Pilgrims
at leaſt; althoug hee hath ſome footing there with the
Turke: but he was ſure during the quarrell, to inlarge his
Papall Dominions at home in Chriſtendome, which he did:
but this by the way. You ſee then, that continuance of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in name and title, may notwithſtanding ſtand with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the propertie and true nature of the thing. Did not the
Prophet ſay of <hi>Ieruſalem, How is the faithfull Cittie become
an harlot? It was full of iudgement, righteouſneſſe lodged in it;
but now murtherers, &amp;c.</hi> And may it not proue ſo with <hi>Rome,</hi>
for all you ſtill call it <hi>the Apoſtolicall See?</hi> And what will
you ſay then? What if <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> in <hi>title</hi> bee turned into
<hi>Apoſtaticall,</hi> in <hi>truth?</hi> What if <hi>Tues Petrus, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>tibi da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo
claues, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Orani pro te Petre, &amp;c.</hi> and, <hi>Omnis mihi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7342:70"/>
data &amp;c. &amp; Ecce duo gladij hîc: ſatest:</hi> all proue, by
the Popes peruertings, to make vp the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity;</hi>
and by faſtening all to Rome, proue her the Miſtres, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of whooredomes.</hi> For let me tell you, you cannot finde
me out the exact and true naturall <hi>Myſtery of iniquity</hi> indeed,
but vnder the vaile of ſuch titles, borrowed from Scripture.
None can be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> but he muſt call himſelfe the <hi>Vicar
of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Succeſſor of Peter,</hi> the onely one vpon earth,
that <hi>cannot erre,</hi> and the like; tranſlating the whole power of
Chriſt vnto himſelfe. To bring in the <hi>Turke</hi> for a Corriuall
with the <hi>Pope</hi> for the title of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is to dreame waking,
and to bewray extreme ignorance in thoſe two great <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
the one of <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> the other <hi>of iniquity.</hi> For all the <hi>Turks</hi>
Alcoran cannot make one compound of the <hi>Myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
whereby <hi>to deceiue with ſtrong illuſion, if it were poſſible,
the very elect,</hi> For take but a breefe ſuruey of <hi>the Myſtery
of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Myſtery</hi> began to take roote in the Apoſtles time, as
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.</note> but was letted to grow, by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
Empire (as the learndeſt Fathers haue interpreted,
and experience hath made it euident) and by manifold <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions</hi>
for the ſpace of aboue 300. yeares. Then <hi>Constantine</hi>
the great, like <hi>Noahs Doue</hi> after the <hi>Deluge</hi> bringing an <hi>Oliue
branch</hi> of peace; and after a ſad winter a mild ſpring, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
to the Church, ſetting a Coronet vpon the head of <hi>Sylue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
the 1. <hi>Bp. of Rome,</hi> then the imperiall City, at what
time there was a voice heard from Heauen, <hi>Hodie venenum
effuſum est in eccleſiam, This day is poyſon powred into the
Church:</hi> from this time forward began the Root of this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie</hi>
to ſprowt and ſpring, bud forth and bloſſome aboue
ground, howſoeuer nipt by ſundry froſts, as an ouerforward
ſhoot in the ſpring. For Rome, by vertue of being the prime
Imperiall City, and the Bp. of Rome, by vertue of his new
Crowne, began from henceforward to ſtickle for the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
ouer all other Churches. Yet, at the firſt, his beſt Plea
was, a counterfet and foiſted Decree of the Nicen-Councel,
by which hee would claime the Preſidency of the African
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7342:70"/>
Councell, whereof Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> was. But the whole
Councell cryed it downe, hauing openly conuinced the Bp.
of Rome of forgery. For as yet, the Bp. of Rome had not
learned, how he might deriue this ſtreame of <hi>Supermacy</hi> to
Rome from the fountaine of Scriptures. But ſtill the <hi>Myſtery</hi>
faſtened the roote euery day more &amp; more, and got ground,
vntill <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. about the yeare 606. by earneſt ſuit and
importunity, as their owne Platina recordeth, obtained of the
Parricide, <hi>Phocas,</hi> that the City of Rome ſhould be the head,
and Mother city ouer all other. But what was this to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Supremacy?</hi> yes: for vpon the Headſhip of Rome, the
Pope now founds his owne Headſhip ouer the Church, &amp; all
Church men; that he might proue himſelfe to be <hi>that man of
ſinne,</hi> that <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> who <hi>exalts himſelfe</hi> (marke it well)
<hi>aboue all that is called God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſitting in, vpon, or ouer the Temple
of God.</hi> For <hi>Phocas</hi> his meaning was not; when hee granted
the preheminence to Rome before other cities, whoſe emulous
corriuall <hi>Constantinople</hi> her younger ſiſter had bene, <hi>Phocas</hi>
now ſtinting the ſtrife; that therefore the <hi>Bp. of Rome</hi> ſhould
haue that abſolute ſouerainty ouer all, as euen <hi>Boniface</hi> then
began to arregate to himſelfe, who of Bp. of Rome (a title
which he had had with other <hi>Patriarches</hi> in common, only
hauing precedency of place, in regard of the prime Imperiall
city) now is turned Pope of Rome, challenging the ſoueraine

               <hi>Volumus &amp;

of Biſhops into his owne hand; whereupon his Papall
word was, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olumus &amp; Iubemus.</hi> So that thus this <hi>Boniface</hi>
became the firſt ſtemme or eminent branch growing from the
root of the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity.</hi> Here began Antichriſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
himſelfe, whoſe immediate <hi>forerunner</hi> (as <hi>Gregory</hi> Bp.
of Rome but a little before called him) was <hi>Iohn of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
who taking vpon him that <hi>blaſphemous name of vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall</hi>

A moſt true Prophecy; Now <hi>Boniface, Gregories</hi> next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7342:71"/>
but one, is the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> whoſe <hi>forerunner</hi> was <hi>Iohn.</hi>
All you that are verſed in the ſtorles of the Church, know all
this to be true. This branch henceforward ſpreads further and
further, and mounts higher and higher, till <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> 7. who added another maine branch to the former,
to wit, <hi>domination ouer Kings and Princes,</hi> which the Pope
had ſtriuen for before (the <hi>Miſtery of iniquity</hi> ſtill working,
but <hi>Rome was not built in one day)</hi> but could not obtaine

to <hi>thunder</hi> out his excommunications againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
This <hi>Hildebrand</hi> ſate about 1000. yeares from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

began to peruert the Scripture to his wicked purpoſes, as the

of the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity</hi> did thriue and proſper notoriouſly,
hauing the two numerous <hi>Orders</hi> of Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> and
Saint <hi>Francis</hi> to water it, inſtituted by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. at the

like to fall, but that in came <hi>Dominick, and ſupported it with

him his ſute, which he was then in hot purſuit off, for the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the firſt that decreed the <hi>Breaden God</hi> in his Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be belieued, and adored of all, about the yeare 1215.

the Emperours footing in <hi>Italy</hi> in <hi>Auguſtulus:</hi> the quarrell
about <hi>Images,</hi> deuiſed at firſt by <hi>Gregory</hi> onely for <hi>Lay-mens
bookes,</hi> yet wherein now all Romaine-Catholicks, Lay, and
learned, are proved ſuch profound Proficients, as by their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and over-ſtudious diligent pooring therein, they haue
learned ſuch Divinity in them, as to adore them for theyr
Gods: the riſing vp of <hi>Maomet</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> the <hi>tranſlation</hi>
of the <hi>Empire</hi> into the <hi>Weſt:</hi> the long pretended-<hi>holy warres</hi>
for recovery (forſooth) of the <hi>holy Land,</hi> the Pope ſetting
Chriſtian Princes to goe fight for the <hi>Shadow,</hi> the while hee
got the <hi>Subſtance:</hi> the rabble of <hi>Friers</hi> of all ſorts: the <hi>Schoole
Rabbies:</hi> and profound <hi>ignorance</hi> all along, all religion being
confined to an <hi>vnknowne tongue,</hi> that men might know it
(that knew nothing) to be the <hi>language</hi> and religion of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
by the confuſed ſound, and little ſenſe hee could find in
it. And yet all this while was not <hi>Antichriſt</hi> come to his full
pitch, ſtature and ſtrength, vntill the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> in
which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> ſheweth her ſelfe to bee quite apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatized
and fallen away from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ceaſſing to bee any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a true Church, as having ſolemnly renounced and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
the <hi>ſauing faith of Chriſt,</hi> without which is no ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no communion with him. During which <hi>Council,</hi> alſo
was firſt founded that diabolicall <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> the
moſt actiue inſtruments of <hi>Antichriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and in a manner the
only and laſt ſupporters of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> tottering Tower.
But this by the way. In the <hi>Councill of Trent</hi> (I ſay) is the
whole <hi>Myſtery of iniquity</hi> fully accompliſhed, and the Pope
now declared <hi>that Man of ſinne, that Antichriſt,</hi> prophecyed
of in the Scriptures. I can but name theſe things vnto you
at this preſent: nor doe I ſay more, then I am able more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
to demonſtrate, if occaſion ſerued. For compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Pope exactly to the deſcription of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in the
Scripture, wee finde him in all points anſwerable, and that
in a full meaſure, ſo that it is not poſſible for a man to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
wherein <hi>Antichriſt</hi> can goe higher, then the Pope hath
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7342:72"/>
done. A ſcantling where of wee may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take in this Papall
Breeue or Bull, wherein throughout, hee ſhowes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<hi>that Antichriſt.</hi> And if the Pope bee <hi>that Antichriſt,</hi> as
moſt demonſtratiuely hee is, which I dare vndertake to
maintaine againſt all the <hi>Ieſuites in England:</hi> then conſider,
ô yee <hi>Romaine-Catholickes,</hi> in what a fearefull condition you
all ſtand, that adhere to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as your <hi>Head.</hi> Certainely
ſuch are no other, then the limmes of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the children of that <hi>Father,</hi> who is the <hi>ſonne
of perdition,</hi> who with all his, <hi>goe into perdition. This is a hard
ſaying,</hi> you will ſay, but it is too true. Nor do I alone ſay,
that in the Church of Rome is no ſaluation to bee found;<note place="margin">Concil. Trent. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 6. Can. 12.</note>
Aske the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> (which is the onely <hi>rule of Romiſh
faith)</hi> that will tell you. To giue you one inſtance for many;
one of her Canons is: <hi>Si quis dixerit, fidem iuſtificantem ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil
aliud eſſe, quàm fiduciam diuinae miſericordiae, peccata remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentis
propter Chriſtum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ibid. Can. 28.</note> 
               <hi>vel eam fiduciam ſolam eſſe, qua iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur:
anathema ſit. That is: If any ſhall ſay, that iuſtifying faith
is nothing elſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but a confidence in Gods mercy, remitting ſinnes
for Chriſts ſake; or, that confidence to bee onely that, whereby
wee are iuſtified: let him bee accurſed.</hi> What is then <hi>Romes
iuſtifying faith?</hi> Heare another <hi>Canon:</hi> which telleth you,
that the <hi>faith of Rome may ſubſiſt, being ſeperate from grace,
and yet bee a true faith, though it bee a dead faith.</hi> And this
is no other <hi>faith,</hi> but that which is in the very <hi>Deuills,</hi>
as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſayth. For, as they confeſſe, they may
with this their faith goe into hell, and there bee puniſhed
with the Devils. As for the <hi>iustifying</hi> and <hi>ſaving faith,</hi> they
not onely accurſe it, but him alſo, that ſhall ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Can. 14.</note> 
               <hi>that none
is truly iuſtifyed, but hee that beleeueth that he is iuſtifyed.</hi> Thus
they haue quite excluded and exiled out of their Church,
with <hi>Anathema,</hi> the ſaving &amp; <hi>inſtifying faith,</hi> without which
there is no ſalvation, no communion with Chriſt. Whence
I conclude with this Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church which denieth, yea accurſeth the ſauing faith
of Ieſus Chriſt, vnto inſtification, allowing onely ſuch a
faith, which can neuer ſaue a man, but is a graceles faith,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7342:72"/>
ſeperable from grace, and which a man may carry
with him into hell; that is an Apoſtatized Church,
vtterly fallen away from Chriſt, wherein no ſaluation is to
bee found, or hoped for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Church of Rome denyeth, yea accurſeth the ſauing
faith of Ieſus Chriſt, vnto iuſtification, allowing only ſuch
a faith, as can neuer ſaue a man, but is a graceleſſe faith,
ſeperate from grace, and which a man may carry with him
into hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Church of Rome is an apoſtatized Church, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
fallen away from Chriſt, wherein no ſaluation is to be
found, or hoped for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both the propoſitions are proved out of the Councell of
<hi>Trents</hi> owne Canons already cited.</p>
            <p>If any anſwer, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denyeth not the
true faith; foraſmuch as the faith, which ſhee alloweth, ſhe
ſayth is <hi>true,</hi> though <hi>dead;</hi> I rejoyne, and ſay, that this is a
Paralogiſme. <hi>Romes dead faith</hi> is indeed for the kind of it, a
<hi>true</hi> dead faith, or a <hi>true</hi> faith of devils, as one may be ſaid to
be a true lyar. But I proue, that this <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is meerely
different in kind from the true <hi>ſauing faith</hi> of Chriſt, thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That faith, which Chriſt commendeth for the onely true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
faith, doth ſo iuſtifie a man, that he ſhal neuer come
into condemnation, but paſſe from death vnto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the only faith which the Church of Rome alloweth, doth
not ſo ſaue or iustifie a man, but that he way with it go into
condemnation, and not paſſe from death vnto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the ſaith of the Church of Rome, is not that faith,
which Chriſt commendeth for the only true ſauing faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And conſequently, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denying the true
ſauing faith of Chriſt, whereby to be juſtified, is vtterly voyd
of all hope of ſaluation, and ſo hath quite abandoned Ieſus
Chriſt. Now for the Propoſition, it is proved by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24. The Minor is confeſſed by the Councell
of <hi>Trent</hi> itſelfe, as hath beene proved.</p>
            <p>Take one argument more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church which cleaueth to Antichriſt as her Head 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7342:73"/>
whome ſhee receiueth all her ſpirituall life, hath no ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be found or hoped for in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Church of Rome cleaueth to Antichriſt, as her Head
from whom ſhee draweth all her ſpirituall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Church of Rome hath no ſaluation to be found,
or hoped for in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propoſition is granted of all. For Antichriſt and all
his members are damned, and goe into perditition, as  the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſheweth, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. Reuel.</hi> 14. 8, 9, 10, 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

this in the <hi>Anſwere</hi> to the <hi>Breeue.</hi> Againe, doth not the Pope

this fall, twice repeated? Some fearefull and ſtrange fall

            <p>So that we need not further quarrell <hi>Rome</hi> about other
points, as the rubbidge of her infinite idolatries, and doctrins
of Devils, whereof that Tower of <hi>Babylon</hi> is built vp; when
as the very foundation of it is rotten, and the whole body
