            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHen I reflect upon the many <hi>Great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> you have done to this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> and the vaſt obligations they both owe to your <hi>Grace</hi> for their Peace and Proſperity; it raiſes in me not only an admiration of your <hi>Perſon,</hi> but a grateful ſence of them, and fills my heart with wiſhes for your Health and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>It is upon this conſideration, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſume to dedicate to <hi>Your Grace</hi> this enſuing diſcourſe, which, I hope, out of the known candor and goodneſs of your Nature, you will be pleas'd not only to pardon but accept of, as a ſmall tribute of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:150081:3"/>
and to give it your <hi>Noble Patronage and Protection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a Sermon, which, tho mean enough in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, yet ſincerely exhorts my <hi>Fellow Subjects</hi> to pray for the welfare of <hi>His Sacred Majeſty,</hi> and to ſerve him with their Lives and Fortunes. Now, at whoſe Feet can I better lay it than at <hi>Yours,</hi> who have hazarded all that is near and dear to you in this world for his <hi>Preſent Majeſty's</hi> Intereſt, for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Monarchical Government,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion; for which Your <hi>Illuſtrious Name ought to be had in everlaſting Remembrance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, ſome <hi>Pamphlets</hi> have, of late, appear'd abroad with a full deſign to blacken <hi>Your Grace,</hi> and injure your Reputation. Such things, as theſe, have been in all ages and will be ſtill incident to <hi>Great Men:</hi> for ſuch as move in High Spheres and with a vigorous luſtre, muſt needs <hi>(as the Sun)</hi> raiſe many envious Exhalations: But God be thanked <hi>Your Graces</hi> merit and integrity are ſo well known, your <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Name</hi> and reputation ſhine ſo bright in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Horizon,</hi> as makes it beyond the power and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a <hi>Pamphleteer</hi> to eclipſe or blemiſh them.</p>
                  <p>Alas! we live in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful Age: The <hi>King himſelf,</hi> tho the <hi>Author</hi> of the greateſt happineſs to this <hi>Nation,</hi> yet hath his Enemies. How many have we amongſt us, whoſe Madneſs and Stupidity make them

deſire to exchange a <hi>golden Sceptre</hi> for an iron Rod of <hi>French</hi> Cruelty and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Revenge; Who repine and murmur, complain and conſpire againſt the beſt of <hi>Princes?</hi> Some long for <hi>troubl'd waters</hi> to fiſh for an Eſtate in, impatiently wait for the moving of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to repair their broken, or heal their lame fortunes; ſo great is the Vice and Immorality of ſome, that they hate ſuch a <hi>Governor</hi> as enlightens <hi>the ſublime Orb</hi> he moves in, with the bright luſtre of an exact and an exemplary Converſation, and ſtudies nothing more than a general Reformation of Life and Manners, and ſo endeavours, as much as in him lies, to make <hi>His People</hi> happy, by <hi>having the Lord for their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All I have to add, is my hearty prayers that nothing may undermine our State, or ſhake King <hi>William</hi>'s Throne, that nothing may diſturb our Happineſs and Tranquillity, that God may preſerve <hi>Your Grace</hi> and <hi>Noble Family,</hi> and give a Bleſſing to all your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Endeavors for the Peace and Proſperity both of this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi> I humbly beg leave, <hi>My Lord,</hi> to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

            <p>THis Pſalm was compos'd by the Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet King <hi>David,</hi> after his tranſlation of the <hi>Ark</hi> of the Lord to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the place which God had appointed for his ſolemn worſhip and adoration, and whither all the <hi>Jews,</hi> whereſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting, were oblig'd by the teſtimony or law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to go up thrice every year, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the mercies of God towards them, and to offer up unto him the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. <hi>Thither the Tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord according to the teſtimony or commandment, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord,</hi> v. 4. <hi>there alſo are ſet thrones of judgment, even the throne of the houſe of David,</hi> v. 5. that is, there is the ſupreme judicature of the Nation, there is the adminiſtration of juſtice and judgment, the great Court for the deciſion of the higheſt matters, for the conduct and management of the moſt important affairs. Thus at the time of this Pſalms compoſure, there was a re-eſtabliſhment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150081:5"/>
of Piety and Religion, Juſtice and Judgment, Liberty and Property; the Sun had once again dazled the rays of proſperity upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and State; and for this, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Pſalm, we find <hi>Holy David</hi> in a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport of joy and exultation: <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, let us go into the houſe of the Lord. Our feet ſhall ſtand in thy gates, O Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 1, 2. and here in the Text he paſſionately excites and calls upon his ſubjects, upon all good men, to expreſs an ardent love, a ſincere affection for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to pray to God for its happineſs, for a continuance of the great bleſſings, of the many precious advantages which it then enjoy'd: and as an argument to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and perſwade them ſo to do, he aſſures them that it tended to their own inexpreſſible inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and advantage, to their temporal and eternal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, <hi>that in the peace thereof they ſhould have peace:</hi> that upon the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> depended the peace and proſperity of the whole Kingdom. <hi>O pray for the peace of Jeruſalem: they ſhall proſper that love thee</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, what thus concern'd the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> doth no leſs concern us <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> We of this Church and Nation have as ſtrong reaſons, as nervous arguments, as powerful motives to pray now for the peace of our <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Praiſed be the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150081:5"/>
Lord, great and ineſtimable are the bleſſings which we enjoy: We have the true Religion eſtabliſhed amongſt us, a pure, an eaſie and ſubſtantial Religion, which infinitely tranſcends that of the <hi>Jews:</hi> We have the bliſsful prerogative of peaceable publick Aſſemblies, we are not debarr'd from coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Courts of the Lord. We have liberty and eaſe, juſtice and judgment, plenty and abundance, peace and tranquillity in a great meaſure here at home, and the Almighty hath lately made us victorious and triumphant abroad, thro the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable conduct and heroic valour of our <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Prince, whoſe hands God hath taught to war, and his fingers to fight.</hi> Now all this great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies at ſtake, now ſeems to be the <hi>Criſis</hi> of our affairs both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, the peace and proſperity both of this Church and State ſeeins to depend upon the peace and unity, upon the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and concord of that <hi>Auguſt Aſſembly</hi> which is nigh at hand; for which reaſon I thought it not improper to call upon you to pray for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem. A word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, how good is it?</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon. Prov.</hi> 15.23. All our happineſs, I ſay, ſeems to depend upon the unity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of that <hi>Auguſt Aſſembly</hi> which is nigh at hand.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Multitude of Counſellors, in them is our ſafety,</hi> if they prove worthy <hi>Patriots,</hi> if they employ and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150081:6"/>
unite their counſels together for the publick good, <hi>if they be ſuch as fear God, men of truth and hating covetouſneſs,</hi> if their hearts be truly <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with love and affection for their Country's intereſt, for the preſent Government, and for the Proteſtant Religion, for the honor and glory of the Nation, for the grandeur and reputation of our <hi>Prince,</hi> then may we promiſe to our ſelves <hi>Halcyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> days, then ſhall we have a charming Proſpect and a comfortable aſſurance of a more compleat and eſtabliſhed felicity. When ſuch wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men govern affairs, what can be the effect but all temporal bliſs and proſperity? if ſuch Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots are plac'd at the Helm, the Ship muſt ſail in an Ocean of peace and tranquillity. Oh! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us make it our important buſineſs, at this time eſpecially, to pour forth our prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the God of Heaven, with ardor and zeal, with fervency and devotion, for a bleſſing upon all their conſultations: that their hearts and minds may be as uniform as the graceful build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that <hi>Metropolis,</hi> whither they are going, where is the ſeat of Judgment, where is our <hi>Prince</hi>'s Throne O my Brethren, let me beſeech you in the affectionate words, in the paſſionate language of the Royal Prophet, King <hi>David,</hi> to pray for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem.

            <p>In the lively oracles of God, Peace is a word of a large extent and ſignification; it comprehends all kind of happineſs and proſperity: Sometimes it imports a freedom from inward ſorrow and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a ſatisfaction or contentment of mind; a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which ſuch are poſſeſt of, as come into the houſe of the Lord, and worſhip him there <hi>in the beauty of Holineſs,</hi> as <hi>keep his Sabbaths and reverence</hi> his Sanctuary, as <hi>ſerve the Lord with faſting and prayers night and day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing but a good and religious life can ſecure to a man that thing which ought to be valued by him above all the things in this world, namely, the inward peace and tranquillity of his mind: <hi>ſuch only can have this great peace as love the law of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as ſincerely endeavour to live up to the precepts and obligations of the Goſpel. A vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man hath peace and an Heaven in his boſom; the greateſt tranſports of joy poſſeſs and ſurround his breaſt, <hi>ſuch a man is ſatisfy'd from himſelf,</hi> Prov.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150081:7"/>
14.14. hath quietneſs of conſcience; this is the thing which gives him abundant ſatisfaction: for there is ſuch a natural principle as conſcience which God hath implanted in every man, this is the <hi>Angel-Guardian</hi> which God and Nature hath plac'd within every ones own breaſt, this is the ſcale which impartially weighs all our actions, all our works, whether they be good or whether they be evil: when we do the good, it creates in us delight and pleaſure, complacency and ſatisfaction, it entertains us with this ſweet and grateful Eccho, <hi>well done good and faithful ſervants, you ſhall enter into the joy of your Lord:</hi> When we do the evil, it laſhes us, fills us full of regret and trouble, ſhame and diſgrace. It is this natural principle which is the great repoſitory and Magazine of all thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which can afford any ſolid refreſhment to the ſoul: When there is a calmneſs and ſerenity in the conſcience, then a man properly enjoys all things, and what is more, himſelf; and nothing can make a mans conſcience to applaud and comfort him, but a life conform to the Divine Laws, <hi>a conſcience void of offence both towards God and towards men.</hi> There is no pleaſure comparable to that which ſprings from a good conſcience; all other pleaſure is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient and momentary, vaniſhes and is gone immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after its fruition or enjoyment, and generally
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150081:7"/>
leaves a ſting behind it; but the pleaſures and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions which flow from purity and holineſs; theſe fan the mind, entertain the conſcience with ſweet and comfortable, with durable and laſting reflections.</p>
            <p>But the caſe is far otherwiſe with a wicked man; ſuch a one is a great ſtranger to inward peace and tranquillity of mind; becauſe of his evil deeds, his conſcience flaſhes in his face, caſts abroad its thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſtrikes him the greateſt terror and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment. A life of ungodlineſs is always tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and the expectation of a future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is always terrible; his conſcience tells him that in the world to come, he ſhall have ſuch a puniſhment aſſign'd him as is proportionable to his vicious life and immoral converſation. The Holy Scriptures compare a wicked man to a troubled Sea, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.20. <hi>a wicked man is like a troubled Sea!</hi> how? he is always working, reſtleſs and uneaſie; and when he comes within ſight of the port of eternity, what ſtorms and tempeſts are then rais'd in his Soul? he is ſeiz'd with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt anguiſh and horror, with ſadneſs and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit. No, if we will believe the Lord our God, <hi>there can be no peace to the wicked,</hi> v. 21. No, this is only the good Man's portion, it is he alone who hath peace and tranquillity of mind,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150081:8"/>
it is he alone who hath a comfortable expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the life to come, his conſcience only, as a glaſs, repreſents to his ſight the Beatific Viſion, the ineffable pleaſures and the endleſs joys of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, By Peace may be underſtood a deliverance from War, from ſtrife and contention both in Church and State; and this is the proper import and ſignification of peace in the words of my Text. <hi>O pray for the peace of Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, it is this Peace which is the greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral happneſs: this is the peace which makes a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on glorious and flouriſhing: this bleſſeth the people with affluence of proſperity; this gives them richly all things to enjoy; without this, riches and honors, the greateſt plenty and abundance is but a dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and an uncertain felicity. And this ſort of peace we of this Church and Nation are <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> bleſſed with, beyond many other Nations in the world. The greateſt part of <hi>Europe</hi> lies now a bleeding, involv'd in blood and confuſion: how doth fire and ſword, diſtreſs and perſecution rage in ſeveral places beyond the Sea? how many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are there by War laid waſte and demoliſhed? how many noble ſtructures are turn'd into ruinous heaps? how many thouſands abroad are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſorrow, detain'd from the comforts of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150081:8"/>
Gods ſolemn worſhip, <hi>fed with the bread of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and have nothing but plenteouſneſs of tears to drink?</hi> When, in a great meaſure, the beauty of our Church and State is as yet unſullied; when we ſit under our own Vines; when we have the true Religion, and can come into the Courts of the Lord; when we can appear before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our God without diſturbance or moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is true indeed, we are engag'd in a charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and expenſive, in a very bloody war; but ſtill we are happy in reſpect of other Nations, becauſe it is a War nor at home but abroad: A War that is abſolutely neceſſary, we can have no proſpect of happineſs without it; and if we will but ſo exerciſe our ſelves as to engage the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> to be our God, we may ſee it ſhortly produce an honorable and laſting Peace, durable tranquility. <hi>O pray for the peace of Jeruſalem.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Peace, in the Holy Scriptures, not only imports a good conſcience, ſatisfaction or content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind, not only a deliverance from war, from ſtrife and contention both in Church and State, but alſo it ſignifies all kind of temporal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and proſperity: and according to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive ſignification we enjoy Peace in a great degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:150081:9"/>We are bleſt with the beſt of <hi>Princes</hi> and the beſt of governments, with a moſt incomparable conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: we live in the moſt temperate part of the <hi>temperate Zone:</hi> our habitation is encompaſſed with the Sea, as a Wall of defence to us on every ſide.
<q>Et penitus toto diviſos orbe Britannos.</q>
And we enjoy a Government as temperate as the Climate itſelf; the beams of Soveraignty are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo perpendicular over our heads as that they can ſcorch us, nor yet ſo oblique, but that they are able to warm and cheriſh us; there is nothing but what enjoys the auſpicious influence, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table heat thereof. A government which made our fore-fathers happy at home and famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. If you conſult ſuch as are men of wiſdom and experience, as have ſeen many things by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling foreign Countries; read but the accurate remarks and curious obſervations of ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perſons, and they will tell you that no Polity is more amiable and lovely, more graceful and glorious than our own. If any Nation under Heaven can, we may juſtly ſay <hi>that the lot is faln unto us in a fair ground:</hi> let us therefore humbly beg of God a continuation of theſe his Bleſſings. <hi>O pray for the peace of Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:150081:9"/>And this leads me to the ſecond obſervable, namely, what method we muſt of neceſſity take, what means we muſt make uſe of to enjoy the bleſſings of peace.</p>
            <p>And here, the Text chalks us out a method, preſcribes us ſuch means, as, if rightly made uſe of, will effectually procure us the bleſſings of peace; and that is Prayer. We muſt pray for it. <hi>O pray for the peace of Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time would fail me to tell of the virtue and efficacy, the force and energy, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtrength and power of <hi>prayer.</hi> Such cannot be ignorant of this as believe the Holy Scriptures, as are converſant in the lively oracles of God. What ſtrange and prodigious things are recorded there, unto which prayer hath given an accompliſhment and perfection? how many Victories hath it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd? how hath it ſtay'd the courſe of the Sun and Moon? how hath it made thoſe glorious Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries to ſtand <hi>ſtill in the midſt of Heaven for the ſpace of a whole day?</hi> how hath it brought down rain from Heaven to refreſh and enrich the parched ground? this important truth is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by ſeveral Examples in the Sacred Records. We find there, that <hi>the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much;</hi> that God is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleas'd to be prevail'd upon, and overcome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150081:10"/>
by prayer; that this is the way to ſtorm the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Eternity; that by this artillery, if well planted the kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent, the obſtinate ſuppliants, take it by force. If therefore ſuch be the virtue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the force and energy, the wonderful ſtrength and power of prayer, <hi>O pray for the peace of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 2dly, Prayer, as well as peace, is a word of comprehenſive ſignification. Prayer, which is the neceſſary means for the obtaining the bleſſings of peace, implies a putting our truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Lord our God. If we muſt pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for peace, it ſuppoſeth that we muſt place all our hopes in him; for in vain ſhould we pray unto him, if we did not make him the object of our hope, if we did not put our truſt in him. No, when we pray, we muſt ſay, with the Royal Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, <hi>Let thy merciful kindneſs, O Lord, be upon us, like as we do put our truſt in thee,</hi> Pſalm. 33.21. Or in the words of our excellent and incomparable Liturgy, <hi>O Lord, let thy mercy be ſhewed upon us, as we do put our truſt in thee.</hi> O therefore not only pray unto, but put your truſt in the Lord for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! in whom ſhall we truſt, in whom ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our hopes for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> but in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150081:10"/>
Lord our God? Shall we truſt in our <hi>Naval Force?</hi> Vain are all theſe helps without God our defence. Our Ships may be conſum'd by fire: ſuch a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing and terrible tempeſt may ariſe, as may drive the Walls of our Nation upon rocks, or elſe they may be daſh'd in pieces with the violence of the waves. <hi>They that go down to the ſea in ſhips and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy their buſineſs in great waters,</hi> do ſee <hi>the works of the Lord,</hi> and behold <hi>his wonders in the deep;</hi> ſuch men frequently ſee the ſad and diſmal effects of a rough wind and a tempeſtuous ſea; <hi>for at his word the ſtormy wind ariſeth which lifteth up the waves thereof, they are carry'd up to the heaven and down again to the deep, their ſoul melteth away becauſe of the trouble; they reel to and fro and ſtagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits end,</hi> but when they cry or pray unto the Lord, when they truſt in him, <hi>he delivereth them out of their diſtreſs.</hi> O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray unto, and truſt in God, for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem, whom the winds and the ſeas obey.</hi> Shall we truſt in <hi>prudent Politicians?</hi> Alas! God by a ſecret and irreſiſtable power can ſtop or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the deepeſt projects can ſplit the cloſeſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and ſmite the moſt refined policy with fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a curſe: God can infatuate the wiſdom of the wiſe, and turn all their counſels into folly, as he did the counſels of <hi>Achitophel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:150081:11"/>Shall we truſt in the ſtrength of tough, well-diſciplin'd and veteran Troops? God can ſtrike a terror into their hearts, He can make them hear a a noiſe of Chariots, a noiſe of Horſes, even the noiſe of a great Hoſt; He can fill their hearts with ſuch a fear as ſhall put them all into diſorder and confuſion, as ſhall enforce them to decamp and fly: Thus He did with the Hoſt of the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.6.</p>
            <p>Shall we truſt in the power and friendſhip of our <hi>Allies?</hi> Shall we depend upon the ſtrength of Leagues and Confederacies? God can diſſolve and break ſuch chains in ſunder: <hi>God can ſet Ephraim againſt Manaſſes, and Manaſſes againſt Ephraim, and both againſt Judah.</hi> No; let us pray unto, and truſt in the Lord our God for the peace of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Tho here, miſtake me not, I do not declaim againſt a <hi>Naval force,</hi> againſt prudent <hi>Politicians,</hi> againſt a well-appointed <hi>Army,</hi> or againſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Leagues and Confederacies:</hi> No, theſe are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as well as Prayer, as well as a truſting in God; tho not in the ſame height or degree: it muſt be our prime and ſupreme care, our principal ſtudy, we muſt in the firſt place have our recourſe to God by prayer and ſupplication; for all is in vain, if God goeth not forth with our <hi>Fleets</hi> and <hi>Armies;</hi> without Gods favour and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150081:11"/>
we muſt not expect the bleſſings of peace. Thus, I ſay, a <hi>Naval force,</hi> a <hi>well appointed Army. Leagues and Confederacies,</hi> are neceſſary as well as Prayer, tho not in the ſame degree; for, ſuch is the diſpenſation of Divine Providence in this ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary world, that it requireth humane means, our own labor and indefatigable induſtry in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it; we muſt not expect Miracles at this time a day. You know the Fable in <hi>Anianus;</hi> A <hi>Country man,</hi> that had laid his Waggon faſt in a Slough, did nothing but call upon <hi>Hercules</hi> to help him out of the mire; no, ſet your ſhoulder to the Wheel, and then is your time to pray; and this is emblematical of our duty and obligation: We muſt not lie with our fingers in our mouths, no, we muſt exerciſe all our powers and abilities, we muſt not expect the gracious aſſiſtance of Divine Providence, except we ſet our own ſhoulders to the work: So that it is neceſſary to fight, to have good forces both by Sea and Land, as well as to pray for peace, for our temporal bliſs and felicity. And here how happy are we, who have a <hi>Courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince</hi> to head his Armies, to fight our Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels; a <hi>Prince</hi> of a ſound and ſteady underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of a great ſpirit and heart, who runs upon the very mouth of the Cannon, for the peace of <hi>Europe.</hi> That unfortunate Gentleman (Mr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150081:12"/>
was ſlain by a Cannon-ball, when ſtanding very near his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in the Trenches, in the late famous Siege of <hi>Namur:</hi> Thus has He expos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in places of greateſt danger, and is ſtill ready to charge through ſtorms and tempeſts of flame, for our happineſs and proſperity. It is He whom God hath made the happy inſtrument of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: it is He who gives the miſerably har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed and diſturbed part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> a glorious proſpect of its former peace and tranquillity. Let us pour forth our ſupplications, let us heartily pray to God for him, that he would be pleas'd to protect his <hi>Royal Perſon,</hi> and crown all his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But this is not the whole of our Duty. Let us ſerve him with our lives and fortunes, let us cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and willingly contribute to the ſupport of his <hi>government</hi> proportionably to our reſpective abilities. <hi>Money</hi> is the nerve, the ſtrong ſinew of War; without this what peace can we expect? without this, as well as prayer, how can He <hi>break the power of the ungodly and malicious?</hi> how can He humble <hi>the troubler of Iſrael?</hi> A Denial of this takes off the Chariot wheels, and makes things drive on not <hi>vigorouſly</hi> but heavily, and then what can <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>But 2dly and laſtly, Let us glorifie God by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of life and holineſs of converſation. This we muſt of abſolute neceſſity do, or elſe the <hi>Almighty</hi> will not hear our prayers for the peace of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> It is infallibly true which we read in ſeveral places in Holy Writ; thus <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. <hi>He that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150081:15"/>
turneth away his ear from hearing the law,</hi> he that hearkens not to the Lord his God and obeys not his laws, <hi>the prayer of that man is an abomination.</hi> Thus Pſalm 66.18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</hi> but Pſalm 34.15. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers.</hi> Thus in the ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s goſpel verſe 31. we read, that <hi>God heareth not ſinners.</hi> Yes, God hears and ſees what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is tranſacted upon the ſtage of this World. God is a witneſs and ſpectator of all mens actions; not ſo <hi>much as a thought can eſcape him, neither can any word be hidden from him: to him all hearts are open, all deſigns are known, and from him no ſecrets are hid;</hi> every mans heart is as pellucid, as clear to him as Cryſtal, he knows what is done in the inner rooms of the heart. <hi>The eye, indeed, of the Adulterer, the Thief, the Murderer, waiteth for the twilight, for the evening, for the black and dark night, ſaying, no eye ſhall ſee me; and diſguiſeth his face.</hi> Alas! he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours under the groſſeſt miſtake and deluſion: <hi>the night, with God, is as clear as the day, the darkneſs and light to him are both alike.</hi> Oh, that ſuch men would but conſider that God is the Author of their frame and conſtitution! It is he who hath enriched us with the noble powers and excellent faculties of hearing and ſeeing. It is by him that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150081:15"/>
we are <hi>thus fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi> Now what man of ſenſe or underſtanding can imagine him to want any power or excellence which He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath imparted to his creatures? If the effect be ſo glorious, what is the cauſe? ſurely he hears, he ſees, in a ſuperior degree, in a more eminent manner than we can poſſibly comprehend, <hi>his eyes muſt be ten thouſand times brighter than the ſun. He that formed the eye, ſhall not he ſee? He that plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ear, ſhall not he hear?</hi> Pſalm. 94.9. <hi>God heareth not ſinners.</hi> Theſe words were ſpoken by the man who was blind from his birth, and whoſe eyes our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> had opened; ſuch an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing miracle as confounded the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as made them fly to opprobrious language and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications</hi> ſuch a credential, ſuch an infallible teſtimony as illuſtrated his <hi>Divinity,</hi> as ſufficiently evinc'd and prov'd his divine original and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>God heareth not ſinners!</hi> That is, God patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizeth no ſin, God worketh no miracle to authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticate or juſtifie the miſſion of a ſinner: Wicked men are always hateful to God, he rejecteth and refuſeth the prayers and requeſts of ſinners, that is, ſuch as live in a ſtate of impenitency, ſuch as run on in ſinful and debauched courſes with the greateſt boldneſs and preſumption, ſuch as affront him by avowed wickedneſs and impiety. Nothing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150081:16"/>
will endear the God of heaven to us but purity and holineſs: the God, with <hi>whom we have to do, is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;</hi> this will certainly make a ſeparation betwixt him and us, this will enforce him to withdraw from us the light of his countenance. If we continue in our ſins, then when we <hi>cry, He will not hear; when we call, He will not anſwer.</hi> O then let us lead holy and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary lives, let us live with eſpecial regularity and ſtrictneſs of converſation; let us glorifie our <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father</hi> by works of meekneſs and humility, charity and patience, ſobriety and temperance: thus if <hi>we perfect holineſs in the ſight of God,</hi> we ſhall then have evident demonſtrations of his power and audience; he will graciouſly hear us when we pray for the happineſs and proſperity both of Church and State for <hi>the peace of Jeruſalem?</hi> God will then direct the conſultations of the <hi>High and Honourable Court of Parliament</hi> now at hand <hi>to the advancement of his Glory, to the good of this Church, to the ſafety, honour and welfare of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and his Kingdoms.</hi> We ſhall than have a comfortable hope <hi>that all things will be ſettled by their endeavours upon the beſt and ſureſt foundations, that peace and happineſs, truth and juſtice, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion, and true Chriſtian piety will be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd among us for all generations.</hi>
