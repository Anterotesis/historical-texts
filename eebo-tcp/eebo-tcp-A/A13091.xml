            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore seeing wickednesse doth so abound, the Lord (least his children frosen in the dregs of their sinne should perish with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) raiseth vp in his mercie good men (as we see he hath done our good brother the author hereof) to plucke off the visors of sinne from their faces, and to lay them open to the view of the whole world, to the end that euerie one seeing the dung of his wicked waies, and the filthie dregs of sinne throwne in their faces, may blush at the same, be ashamed, repent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and turne to the Lord Iesus, and so eternally be saued To this end and purpose hath the author here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (for whose singular towardnes in his primar yeres the Lord Iesus be praised) taken in hand the compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this little treatise, conteining a summarie of certeine corruptions and abuses, as well in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraltie, as in the clergie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing made the first part of the Anatomie of abuses (Right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and my verie good Lord) and dedicated the same to your good Lordship, I thought I should then haue taken mine <hi>Vltimum vale,</hi> for euer-needing to write anie more of this argument againe. But seeing the diuell our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aduersarie in the fulnesse of his malice hath since spued out his poison<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and powred out his filthie dregs of infinit corruptions, blemishes, and abuses (al which

to comprehend in number were <hi>Infinitum finito com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendere</hi>) amongst vs of late daies more than euer were heard of before. I was compelled for the health of their soules, and benefit of my countrey, to take in hand afresh this new tractation, intituled <hi>The display of Corruptions,</hi> wherein are laid open diuers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie abuses, corruptions, and blemishes crept as well into one sort of men as into another. And hauing fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the same, and committed it to the presse, I stood in suspense, douting to whom I might dedicate the same, as well for the argument, and matter which it hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth (being a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>otch, which some frosen in the dregges of their sinne cannot in any wise abide to be touched) as also for the inhability and indignitie of the author But at the last considering with my selfe the proximitie, the semblance, and neerenesse of the arguments, as well of my first booke of the Anatomie of abuses as also of this the <hi>Display of Corruptions,</hi> I could doe no lesse than to dedicate the same to your excellent Lordship, to the end, that your Honour (whom the Lord hath made the mirrour of true nobilitie) might see, as it were in a glasse) a briefe summarie of the corruptions and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that reigne in these daies. And not onely for this cause was I incited to commit the defense of this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle treatise to your Honourable Lordship, but also and in especiall, in demonstration of my thankfull hart, and vnfained goodwill towardes your Honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that it pleased the same (farre beyond either my desart or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation) not onely to accept, and take in good part my former simple booke of the Anatomie of Abuses, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so most honourably to shield the same vnder the wings and guardance of your Lordships protection. In recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense whereof, if mine habilitie were answerable to my
<pb facs="tcp:12936:5"/>
faithfull hart, and goodwill borne to your Honor, then should this present gift be as great, as now by reason of the contrarie it is small and contemptible. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I may be adiudged of som to be ouer presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in dedicating this booke vnto your Honour, yet if they will consider, that such treatises as this (and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in these corrupt daies, wherein no man can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to heare of his faults) are not to be dedicated to euery one without exception, but to such whom GOD hath blessed (as his glorious name be praised therefore he hath done your Honour) with all graces and gifts. either spirituall, or corporall whatsoeuer. And therfore haue I had a special regard, that as this my booke doth discouer and lay open to the view of the world, manie and sundrie corruptions, abuses, and blemishes in euery degree, so I might dedicate the same to one free from all the same blemishes and corruptions, least otherwise it might happily be a pricke to his eies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an offense to his mind. For this (right Honourable and my very good Lord) I hold for a <hi>Maxime,</hi> that he who is licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously and dissolutely inclined, can hardly in any sauce brooke or disgest good bookes, which reprooue such things as he so greedily thirsteth after. This maketh many a one of a giltie conscience (when he cannot abide to heare his faults ript vp, bicause he is faultie) to cast away good bookes, and to contemne both them and the authors, who with great studie labour and paines haue finished the same for the glorie of GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and benefit of their country. But had euery one tasted of the fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceptation of their patrones, to whose tuition they commend their labours, as wel as I haue of your good Lordships not onely acceptation, but also most bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remuneration, they should not neede to feare any
<pb facs="tcp:12936:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
refusall of their faithfull good wils in exhibiting good works vnto their protection and defense. Which thing though I can neuer sufficiently in effect regraciate, yet in affect I will not faile (Christ willing) to the end of my life faithfully to supply. And truly not without great cause am I bound so to doe, and not onely I, but euen all that in any respect haue to deale with your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Lordship. For what is the common bruit noised of your Honour? Truly this. That your Lordship for gentlenesse and affabilitie (whereof I haue tasted to my singular comfort) is surpassing any, in good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, mercie, and compassion inferiour to none, in noble prowesse, valiancie, &amp; magnanimitie comparable with the best. In wisedome and vnderstanding singular, in zeale to the truth and christian religion famous, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of equitie and iustice renowmed. Finally, in all kind of vertue equall with any, so as I will not feare to call your good Lordship a perfect patterne of true nobilitie in all respects. Thus hauing rather as the peinter doth, to draw the lineaments of your Lordships vertues with my rude pensill, than to display the liuely proport on of the whole bodie thereof, which is vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will surcease the same For if I should take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to discipher foorth the whole bodie of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships deserued commendations, I should rather not knowe where to end, than where to begin. But least I might seeme to aggrauate your sacred eares, occupied with grauer and sager matters than these, I will draw to an end, most humbly beseeching your good Lordship to receiue this little treatise into your Honors patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with like plausible alacritte as your Honor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my former dedication. And not only to receiue the same into your Lordships protection, but also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

               </gap>, It is easier to carp, &amp; to find fault with, than to imitate, or amend. And thus crauing pardon at your good Lordships hand, for this my bold attempt, I most humbly take my leaue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting your Honor with my good Ladie your wife, and all the rest of your honorable progenie, and aliance to the tuition and protection of the blessed God, who keepe and preserue the same, in his faith, feare, and loue all the daies of your life, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of much honour, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall beatitude in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens by Iesus Christ.</p>

Thus I commit thee to God (most Christian reader) and to the power of his might, who blesse thee with all graces spirituall and corporall in this life, that long maist thou read, and much maist thou profit, and in the end grant thee eternall life in the heauens, thy inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance purchased with the bodie of Christ Iesus, to whom be praise, glorie, honour, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for euer.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>Surely they are as all other countries and nations be for the most part, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to sinne, and wickednes, drinking vp iniquitie as it were water, but yet I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that albeit all flesh hath corrupted his way before the face of GOD, yet is there not any nation or countrey vnder the sunne that for pride, whoredome, droonkennes, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie and all kinde of oppression, iniurie, and mischiefe, may compare with this one country
<pb facs="tcp:12936:11"/>
of <hi>Dnalgne,</hi> God be mercifull vnto it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten his kingdome that all wickednes may be done away.</p>

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Then as in all other countries, where euer I haue trauelled, so in this also, is verified the old adage, namely, that the first age of the world was called <hi>Aurea aetas,</hi> the golden age, for that men liued godlie, &amp; in the feare of God, the second age was called <hi>Argentea aetas,</hi> the siluer age, for that men began somewhat to decline, and fall from their former holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and integritie of life, to sinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes: the thirde and last age, which is this that we are fallen into, is and may iustlie be called <hi>Ferrea</hi> or <hi>Plumbea aetas,</hi> the yron or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den age, in as much as now men are fallen from all godlinesse whatsoeuer, and are as it were wedded to iniquitie, committing sinne without any remorse, and running into all kinde of abhomination and impietie, without restraint. All which things dulie in the good hart of a faithful christian considered, &amp; weied, may easilie persuade a wise man to think their destruction to be at hand, except they repent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>You saie verie well. Therfore I would wish them to take héed to themselues, and to leaue their wickednes before the Lords wrath be gon out against them, for let them be
<pb facs="tcp:12936:11"/>
sure, that when the measure of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is full, then will the Lord cut them off from the face of the earth if they repent not, and truely turne to the Lord. The wise man saith, that a little before destruction come, the hart of man shall swell into pride, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Our sauiour Christ saith, when men flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselues, and saie peace, peace, al things are well, we néede not to feare any thing, then euen then shall sudden destruction fall vpon them, as sorrow commeth vpon a woman tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling with childe, and they shall not escape, bicause they would not knowe the Lord, nor the day of his visitation. Which thing we sée to be true through al the histories of the sacred Bible, for when the Sodomits, and Gomorre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had filled vp the measures of their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and faciate themselues in sinne, then came there fire and brimstone raining from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon them, and their citie, and consumed them all, from the vpper face of the earth. When all the worlde in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> was giuen ouer to sinne, and wickednes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie came the floud of Gods vengeance, and destroied them all, eight persons to wit, <hi>Noah,</hi> his wife, his thrée sonnes, and their wiues, who serued the Lord in true simplicity of hart, onelie excepted. The Hierosolimitanes
<pb facs="tcp:12936:12"/>
when their sinne was ripe, were they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and put to the edge of the sworde? When <hi>Pharao</hi> the king of Egypt his sinne was ripe, did not the Lord harden his hart to pursue the Israelits, and so drowned him, and all his retinue in the read sea? <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Nabuchadnezer</hi> swelling in sinne, and rising vp against the maiestie of God in the malice of their harts, was not the one stroken dead in a moment, and eaten vp with worms, the other deposed from his kingdome, and constrained to eate grasse with the beasts of the earth, with the like examples, which for the auoiding of prolixitie, I omit. By all which it appeareth, that when destruction is néerest, then are the people the securest, and the most indurate and frosen in the dregs of their sinne, and being so, the sequele is either confusion in this life, or perdition in the world to come, or both. And therefore I beséech the Lord that both this country, and all others may repent, &amp; amende euerie one their wicked waies, to the glorie of God and their owne saluation.</p>

of all things there is such plentie (God haue the praise thereof) as they may séeme to haue néede of no other nation, but al others of them. In so much as if they were wise people (as they be wise inough, if they would vse their wisedome well) to kéepe their owne substance within themselues, and not to transport it ouer to other countries (as many couetous wretches for their owne priuate gaine doe) they might liue richly and in abundance of all things, whilest other countries should lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and want.

               <p>It is an old saieng and true: <hi>Ex incertis, &amp; ambiguis rebus optimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tenere sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis est:</hi> Of things vncerteine a christian man ought to iudge, and hope the best. They hope wel that all are their friends and welwillers: but it is thought (and I feare me too true) that they are so far from being their friends (<hi>Nisi verbo tenus,</hi> From mouth outward onely) that they haue vowed and sworne their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they could as easily atchiue it, as they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly intend it. Which thing to be true, some of their late practises haue (yet to their owne confusion, Gods name be praised) proued true. For how manie times hath that man of sinne, that sonne of the diuell, that <hi>Italian</hi> Antichrist of <hi>Rome</hi> interdicted, excommunicated, suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and accursed with booke, bell, and candle, both the Prince, the Nobilitie, the Commons, and whole Realme? How often hath he sent foorth his roring buls against hir Maiestie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating (as I haue said) hir Grace, and discharging hir Highnesse liege people, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall subiects from their alleageance to hir Grace? How often hath he with his adherents conspired and intended the death and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of hir Maiestie, and Nobilitie by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration,
<pb facs="tcp:12936:14"/>
necromancy, exorcismes, art magike, witchcraft, and all kind of diuelrie besides, wherein the most part of them are skilfuller, than in diuinitie? And when these deuises would not take place, nor effect as they wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then attempted they by other waies and meanes to ouerthrowe the estate, the Prince, nobles, people, and country: sometime by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret irruption, sometime by open inuasion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and rebellion, sometime by open treason, sometime by secret conspiracie, and sometimes by one meanes, sometimes by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And now of late attempted they the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe and subuersion of hir Maiestie, people, country, and all, by sending into the realme a sort of cutthrotes, false traitors, and bloud thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie Papists, who vnder the pretence of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men (in whom for the most part there is as much religion as is in a dog) should not onely lurke in corners like howlets that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the light, créepe into noble mens bosoms, thereby to withdrawe hir Maiesties subiects from their allegeance, but also mooue them to rebellion, and to take sword in hand against Prince, country, yea and against God himselfe (if it were possible) and to dispense with them that shall thus mischieuouslye behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And forsooth these goodlie fellowes, the
<pb facs="tcp:12936:14"/>
diuels agents, that must worke these feates, are called (in the diuels name) by the name of Iesuites, seminarie préests, and catholikes, vsurping to themselues a name neuer heard of till of late daies, being indéed a name verie blasphemously deriued from the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and improperly alluded and attributed to themselues. But what will it preuaile them to be like vnto Iesus in name onely, or how can they, nay how dare they arrogate that name vnto themselues, wheras their doctrine, religion, and whole profession, togither with their corrupt liues and conuersations are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrarie to the doctrine, religion, life, and profession of Christ Iesus? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world more contradictorie one to another, than all their procéedings in generall are to Christ Iesus, and his lawes, and yet will they vnder the pretence of a bare and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked name, promise to themselues such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, such integritie, and perfection, as GOD cannot require more, yea such as doth merite <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi> Eternall felicitie in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.

In so much as I doubt not to call hir sacred breast the promptuarie, the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or storehouse of all true virtue and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For if you speake of wisdome, knowledge and vnderstanding, hir Grace is singular, yea, able at the first blush, to discearne truth from falsehood, and falsehood from truth in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how ambiguous or obscure soeuer: so as it may iustly be called into question whether

                  <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe had greater light of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome instilled into his sacred breast, then hir maiestie hath into hir highnes roiall minde.

If you speake of sobrietie, modestie, mansuetude, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse, it is woonderfull in hir Highnesse, yea, so affable, so lowly and humble is hir Grace, as she will not disdaine to talke famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arlie to the meanest, or poorest of hir Graces subiects vpon speciall occasions. If you speake of mercie, and compassion to euery one that hath offended, I stande in suspence whether hir like were euer borne. If you speake of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of zeale and feruencie to the truth, or if you speake of the vpright execution or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of iustice, all the world can beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that herein (as in all godlinesse else) hir Highnes is inferior to none that liueth at this day.

Besides this deferring and delaieng of poore mens causes, I will not say how iudgement is peruerted in the end. I réed them take héed to it that be the authors thereof. Therefore the reformed churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the seas are woorthie of commendations, for there the Iudges sit in the open gates, stréets, and high waies, that euery man that will may speake vnto them, and complaine if he haue occasion. And so farre from delaieng, or putting of poore mens causes be they, as they will not suffer any matter how weighty soeuer to hang in sute aboue one day, or two, or at the most thrée daies, which happeneth verie seldome. But if the lawes within euery particular countie or shire were duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred without parcialitie, and truly executed with all expedition, as they ought, and not so lingred as they be, then néeded not the poore people to run 100.200, yea 300. or 400. miles (as commonly they doe) to séeke iustice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they might haue it néerer home: through the want whereof, besides that their sutes are like to hang in ballance peraduenture seuen yéeres,

they hauing spent al in the end fall to extreme beggerie, which inconuenience might easilie be remoued, if all matters, and causes whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer were heard at home in their owne shire, or countie with expedition. And to say the truth, what fooles are they (yea woorthie to be inaugured fooles with the laurell crowne of triple follie) that whilst they might haue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice at home in their owne country, and all matters of controuersie decided amongst their neighbors and friends at home, will yet go to lawe two or thrée hundred miles distant from them, and spend all that they haue to inrich a sort of gréedie lawiers, when at the last a sort of ignorant men of their neighbors must make an end of it whether they will or not. This me thinke, if euerie good man would perpend in himselfe, he would neither go to lawe himself, nor yet giue occasion to others to doe the like.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>The apostle in that place repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth them not for going to lawe for reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable causes, but for that they being christians went to lawe vnder heathen iudges, which tended to the great discredite, and infamie of the Gospell. But certeine it is though some Anabaptists <hi>Quibus veritas odio est,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine other heritikes haue taught the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, yet it is certeine, that one christian man may go to law with another for causes reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. For it being true as it cannot be denied, that there is a certeine singularitie, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and proprietie in euery thing, and the lawe being not onely the meane to conserue the same propriety, but also to restore it againe
<pb facs="tcp:12936:19"/>
being violate is therefore lawfull, and may lawfully be attempted out, yet with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiso, that it is better, if the matter may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be apeased at home, not to attempt lawe, than to attempt it. But if any schismatikes (as alas the worlde is too full of them) should alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither deny the vse of the lawe, as not christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, besides that the manifest word of God in euery place would easilie conuince them, the examples, and practises of all ages, times, countries and nations, from the first beginning of the world, togither with the example of our sauiour Christ himselfe, who submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the lawes then established, would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ouerthrow their vaine imaginations. The lawe in it selfe, is the square, the leuell, and rule of equitie, and iustice, and therefore who absolutely contendeth the same not to be chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, may well be accused of extréeme folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if the lawes be wicked and antichristian, then ought not good christians to sue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather to sustaine all kind of wrong what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Then it séemeth by your reason, that if the lawe be so necessarie, as without the which Christian kingdomes could not stand, then are lawiers necessarie also for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>

               <p>They are most necessarie. And in my iudgement a man can serue God, in no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling better, than in it, if he be a man of a good conscience, but in <hi>Dnalgne</hi> the lawiers haue such chauerell consciences, that they can serue the deuill better in no kind of calling than in that: for they handle poore mens matters cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they execute iustice parcially, &amp; they receiue bribes gréedily, so that iustice is peruerted, the poore beggered, and many a good man iniuried therby. They respect the persons, and not the causes, mony, not the poore, rewards, and not conscience. So that law is turned almost top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie turnie, and therefore happie is he, that hath least to doe with them.</p>

               <p>It gréeueth me to relate thereof vnto you, the abuses therein are so inormous. For if a felone, homicide, a murtherer, or else what gréeuous offender soeuer, that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued a thousand deaths, if it were possible, happen to be taken and apprehended, he is straightway committed to prison, and clapt vp in as many cold yrons as he can beare, yea, throwne into dungeons, and darke places vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ground, without either bed, clothes, or any thing else to helpe himselfe withall, saue a little straw or litter bad inough for a dog to lie in. And in this miserie shall he lie amongst frogs, toades, and other filthie vermine, till lice eate the flesh of his bones. In the meane space hauing nothing to eate, but either bread and water, or else some other modicum scarce able to suffice nature, and many times it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that for want of the same pittance they are macerate and shronke so low, as they either looke like ghosts, or else are famished out of hand. And this extreeme misery they lie in sometime (perhaps) a quarter of a yéere, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times halfe a yéere, a tweluemonth, yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two or three yéeres, and perchance
<pb facs="tcp:12936:21"/>
all their life though they haue deserued death, by their flagitious facts committed. Who séeth not that it were much better for them to die at once, than to suffer this extréeme miserie? Yea the sufferance of this extremitie is better vnto them, than the tast of present death it selfe. And therefore in the cities reformed beyond seas, there is notable order for this: for as soone any fellon or malefactor whatsoeuer, that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued death is taken, he is brought before the magistrate, witnesse comes in, and giues eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against him, and being found gilty, and conuict by iustice, is presently without any further imprisonment, repriuation or delay, condemned, and being condemned, is led pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the place of execution, and so commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the sword.</p>

Therefore those that ought to die by the lawe of God, are not to be saued by the lawe of man.

<pb facs="tcp:12936:22"/>
may easily be dispensed withall. Indéede the wisedome of God ordeined, that if any man chanced to kill an other against his will, he should flie to certeine cities of refuge, and so be saued, but if it were prooued that he killed him wittingly, willingly, &amp; prepensedly, then he should without al exception be put to death. And herein is great abuse, that two hauing committed one and the same fault the one shal be pardoned, and the other executed. If it be so that both haue committed offence worthy of death, let both die for it, if not, why should either die, Experience prooueth this true, for if a Gentleman commit a gréeuous offence, and a poore man commit the like, the poore shal be sure of his <hi>Sursum collum</hi>? But the other shall be pardoned. So <hi>Diogenes</hi> séeing a sort of poore men going to hanging fell into a great laughter.

               <p>Some are of opinion that the prince by his power imperiall and proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue may pardon and remit the penaltie of any law, either diuine, or humane, but I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that if Gods law condemne him, no prince ought to saue him, but to execute iudgement, and iustice without respect of persons to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently. But in causes wherin Gods lawe doth not condemne him, the prince may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the offender, if there appéere likelyhoode of amendment in him. And yet let the prince be sure of this, to answere at the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the tribunall seate of GOD, for all the offences that the partie pardoned shall commit any time of his life after. For if the prince had cutte him off when the
<pb facs="tcp:12936:23"/>
lawe had passed on him, that euill had not béen committed. To this purpose I remember I haue heard a certeine pretie apotheg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a iester to a king. The king had pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one of his subiectes that had committed murther, who being pardoned committed the like offence againe, and by meanes was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the second time also, and yet filling vp the measure of his iniquitie, killed the third, and being brought before the king, the king being very sorie, asked why he had killed thrée men, to whom his iester standing by replied, saieng: No (O king) he killed but the first, and thou hast killed the other two: for if thou hadst hanged him vp at the first, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two had not béene killed, therefore thou hast killed them, and shalt answere for their bloud. Which thing being heard, the king han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him vp straightway as he very well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: yet notwithstanding I grant that a prince by his power regall, and prerogatiue imperial may pardon offenders, but not such as Gods lawes and good conscience doe condemne, as I said before. The power of a prince is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>In Rebus licitis in Deo,</hi> but not <hi>In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus illicitis contra Deum:</hi> In things lawfull in God, not in things unlawfull contrarie to God. No power or principalitie vpon the earth
<pb facs="tcp:12936:23"/>
whatsoeuer may dispense with the lawe of God, but what it setteth downe must stand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable. Therefore if it be asked me wherein a prince may pardon any malefactor, I answer for the breach or violation of any humane lawe, ordinance, constitution, statute, or sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not against Gods word and lawe in any condition.</p>

               <p>If any haue cause to complaine (as alas too many haue) it is for want of due execution of the lawes, not for lacke of good lawes.

The lawiers I would wish to take lesse fées of their clients. For is not this a plaine theft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to take ten, twentie, or fortie shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of one poore man at one time, and so much of a great sort at once, and yet to speake neuer a word for the most part of it? And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that they can be present but at one barre at once, yet will they take diuers fées of sundry clients to speake for them at three or foure places in one day.

For is not
<pb facs="tcp:12936:24"/>
this too vnreasonable to take a crowne, or ten shillings for writing six or seuen lines, or little more. And then the kéeper of the seale, for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle waxe, he must haue as much as the other. And thus they sucke out (as it were) euen the very marrowe out of poore mens bones. The shirifs, bailifs, and other officers also, I would wish, for fées, for bribes, for friendship and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, not to returne a <hi>Tarde venit,</hi> or a <hi>Non est inuentus,</hi> when they either haue sent the partie word to auoid couertly, or else looking through their fingers sée him, &amp; wil not sée him, forcing herby the poore plaintife to lose not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his great &amp; importable charges in the lawe, but also peraduenture his whole right of that which he sueth for. Thus let euery officer by what kind of name or title soeuer he be called, or in what kind of calling soeuer he be placed, doe all things with single eie, and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that God may be glorified, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace maintained, iustice supported, and their owne consciences discharged against the great daye of the Lorde, when all flesh shall be conuented before the tribunall seate of GOD all naked as euer they were borne, to render accounts of all their doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whether they bee good or badde, and to receiue a rewarde according to their déeds.

For proofe whereof we read that our sauiour Christ was, not onely obedient to the maigistrates, and superior powers in all things, but also taught his apostles, disciples, and in them all people and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, the very same doctrine.

And this is that, that the apostles ment when they saide: It is better to obey God than man.

               <p>The youth truely is well brought vp, both in good letters, nurture, and maners for the most part. For the better performance whereof, they haue excellent good schooles, both in cities, townes, and countries, wherin abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of children are learnedly brought vp, But yet notwithstanding some parents are much to be blamed in the education of their children, for the most kéepe their sonnes to schoole, but for a time, till they can write and read, and well if all that too, and very seldome or neuer doe they kéepe them so long at their bookes, as vntill they atteine to any perfect knowledge indéed. So that by this means lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth and is like greatly to decay. And if one aske them, why they kéepe not their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to schoole till they prooue learned, they will answer, Bicause I sée learning and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men are little estéemed, and me thinke the best of them can hardly liue by the same. And therefore I will set him to an occupation, which will be alwaies sure. As herein they say
<pb facs="tcp:12936:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
true, so I cannot but lament the small prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now adaies that learning getteth in the world amongst men, &amp; the smal account that is made of the same. This is the cause why lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth, and will in time greatly decay. For who is he that hauing spent all his substance vpon learning, yea his bodie, strength, and all, and yet can hardly liue thereby, and maintaine himselfe withall, that will couet after lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which is both so chargeable, and painfull to be come by?</p>

               <p>There are such places indéed. But alas they are abused &amp; peruerted to other ends than was intended by them at the first. For whereas those places had great liuings, rents, reuenues, &amp; possessions giuen to them, it was to this onely end and purpose, that those poore children whose parents were not able other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to maintaine them at learning, should be brought vp vpon the charges of the house, and not those whose parents are able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them of themselues. But now we sée the contrarie is true, and whereas they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to maintaine none but the poore only, now
<pb facs="tcp:12936:28"/>
they maintaine none but the rich onely. For except one be able to giue the regent or prouost of the house, a péece of mony, ten pound, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pound, fortie pound, yea, a hundred pound, a yoke of fatte oxen, or a couple of fine gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, or the like though he be neuer so toward a youth, nor haue neuer so much néed of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, yet he comes not there I warant him. If he canot preuaile this way. Let him get him letters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatory from some of reputation, and perchance he may spéed, in hope of benefite to insue.

First I would wish that euery one that is a schoolmaster, how lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or vnlearned soeuer, should be examined, as wel for his religion, and his sufficiencie in knowledge, as also for his integritie of life, &amp; being found sound in them all, to be alowed &amp; admitted to teach. For if euerie one that wold should take vpon him to teach without further triall, then might there great inconuenience follow. For papists and other schismatikes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postataes, or else whatsoeuer, might thrust in themselues, &amp; so corrupt the youth. Ignorant &amp; vnlearned would take vpon them high lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; so delude their schoolers. And if his life should not be answerable to his profession, then should he peruert his auditorie also, Therefore in my iudgement is there great choise to be made of schoolmaisters. Thus they being tried, let them be admitted <hi>gratis,</hi> by authoritie. But now there is great abuses herein, for being found sufficient in all respects, yet must he be constrained to take a license, whether he will or not, and must pay x.xvi. or xx. shillings for it &amp; yet will this serue him no longer, than he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in that dioces, &amp; comming into another he must pay as much there for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like license also, whereas peraduenture he shall scarcely get so
<pb facs="tcp:12936:29"/>
much cléere in thrée or foure yéeres, in that dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they haue such fat pasture. But if they would néedes haue them to haue licenses, (which I grant to be very good.) I would wish they might haue them <hi>gratis,</hi> without mony, for if it be lawfull for them to teach for mony, it is also lawfull without. And if they be not woorthie, it is pittie that mony should make them woorthie, and againe, if they be woorthie, it is pittie that without mony they cannot be so accepted.</p>

And then will they keepe these marchandize till they waxe verie scarse, (and no maruaile for they buy vp all things) and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly déere.

               <p>They will go into the countries, and buy vp all the wooll, corne, leather, butter, cheese, bacon, or else what marchandize soeuer they knowe will be vendible, and these they transport ouer seas, whereby they gaine infinit summes of mony.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>There are good lawes, and great restraints to the contrary, in so much as they be apparent traitors to God, their prince and country, that carrie any of the foresaid things ouer without speciall licence thereto. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, either by hooke, or crooke, by night or day, by direct, or indirect meanes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowne or vnknowne, they wil conueigh them ouer, though their owne country want the same. But to auoide all dangers, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase a licence, &amp; a dispensation for mony, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prince in hand that they do it for some good cause, when indéed the cause is their owne
<pb facs="tcp:12936:30"/>
priuate gaine. And for the spéedier obtaining of their desires, they demand licence for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ouer but of so much and so much, when in truth they conuey ouer vnder the colour of this their licence ten times, twenty times, yea, a hundred times, fiue hundred times, yea, a thousande times as much more. And thus they delude their prince, impouerish their country, and inrich themselues, féeding, clothing and inriching our enimies with our owne treasure. Hereby it commeth to passe that all things are déerer, and scarser, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they would be, if restraynt were had, and I warrant them many a blacke curse haue they of the poore commons for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. But first I would haue our owne people serued that they wante not in any case. For it is very vnméete to féede forren nations, and our owne country fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish at home.

But the Wise man telleth them, that false ballances, counterfet weightes, and vntrue measures are abhomination to the Lord. And the Apostle telleth them, that God is the iust reuenger of all those that deceiue their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in bargaining. And yet shall you haue them in the sale of their wares to sweare, to teare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and protest, that before God, before Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, as God shall saue my soule, as God shall iudge me, as the Lord liueth, as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me, as God helpe me, by God and by the world, by my faith and troth, by Iesus Christ, and infinite the like othes, that such a thing cost them so much, &amp; so much, and it is woorth

this much, and that much, when in truth they sweare as false, as the liuing Lord is true, as their owne consciences can beare them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and I feare me will condemne them at the day of the Lord, if they repent not. For if a thing cost them ten shillings, they will not blush to aske twentie shillings for it. If it cost them twentie shillings, they will not shame to aske forty shillings for it, and so of al others, doubling, tripling, and quadrupling the price thereof without either feare of God, or regard of good conscience.</p>

               <p>Of Drapers I haue little to say, sauing that I thinke them cater cosins, or cosin germans to merchants. For after they haue bought their cloth, they cause it to be tentered, racked, and so drawne out, as it shall be both broader, and longer than it was when they bought it almost by halfe in halfe, or at lest by a good large sise. Now the cloth being thus stretched forth in euery vaine, how is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either to endure, or hold out, but when a shower of raine taketh it, then it falleth and shrinketh in, that it is shame to sée it. Then haue they their shops and places where they
<pb facs="tcp:12936:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sell their cloth commonly very darke and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, of purpose to deceiue the buiers. But <hi>Caueat emptor</hi> (as the old saieng is) Let the buiers take héed. For <hi>Technas machinant, &amp; retia tendunt pedibus,</hi> as the saieng is: They meane deceit, and lay snares to intrap the féet of the simple. And yet notwithstanding they will be sure to make price of their racked cloth double, and triple more than it cost them. And will not sticke to sweare, and take on (as the other their confraters before) that it cost them so much, and that they doe you no wrong. God giue them grace to haue an eie to their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and to content themselues with reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable gaines.</p>

               <p>No doubt of that. For some put in naughty wool, and cause it to be spun &amp; drawne into a very small thred, and then compounding with the Fuller to thicke it very much, and with the Clothier also to sheare it very lowe, and with some liquide matter, to lay downe the wooll so close, as you can hardly sée any wale, and then selleth it as though it were a very fine cloth indeed.

               <p>Indéede there are excellent wines as any be in the world, yet not made within the Realme, but comming from beyond seas: which when the vintners haue once got into their clouches, and placed in their sellers, I warrant you they make of one hogshead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most two, or at lest, one and a halfe, by mixing &amp; blenting one with another, &amp; infusing other liquor into them.

wine, neither pleasant to the mouth, nor whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the bodie. And notwithstanding that they gaine (welneare) one hogshead in another, yet shall their measures, their gallons, pints, and quarts be so spare, and their prices so hie, that it is woonderfull to sée. And if a poore sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man go to drinke a pint of wine for the strengthening of his bodie, and for necessities sake onely, he shall be sure to haue that wine brought him, that is too bad, though his monie (I am sure) is as good as the rich mans. But if a man of countenance come to drinke for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure &amp; nicenesse, he shall haue of the best wine in the seller, though his mony be no beter than the poore mans.

               <p>Nothing but this: that they are not behind in their abuses, fallacies, and deceits. For whereas they pay a certeine price for a fat béefe, they are so impudent that they thinke their market is naught, except they may gaine halfe in halfe, or the best quarter at the least. And to the end their meate may be more sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the eie, the fairer, and the fatter, they will kill their beasts, and suffer the bloud to remaine within them still, for this cause that
<pb facs="tcp:12936:34"/>
it may incorporate it selfe in the flesh, and so thereby the flesh may not onely be the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier (for in some places they buy all by waight) but also may séeme both fresher, fairer, newer, tenderer, and yonger. And which is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they vse to blowe, and puffe it vp with winde, to the end it may séeme bigger, fatter, and fairer to the eie.

And though it be neuer so old meate, tough, and stale, yet will they sweare, protest, and take on woonderfully, that it is very new, fresh, and tender. So that no more in them than in others, there is little conscience at all. There be some of them also now and then that will not sticke to sell meate which hath died (perchance) in a ditch, if it be worth the eating (which is most lamentable) and yet wil beare the world in hand that it is excellent meate, that it died kindly, and so soorth.

               <p>Oh no. Nothing lesse. But rather the contrarie is most true. For when a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or other hath a farme, or a lease to let: first he causeth a surueior to make strict inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie what may be made of it, and how much it is woorth by yéere, which being found out, and signified to the owner, he racketh it, straineth it, and as it were so setteth it on the tenter hookes, stretching euery vaine, and ioint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as no poore man can liue of it. And yet if he might haue it fréely for this racked rent too, it were somewhat well. But (out alas, and fie for shame) that cannot be. For though he pay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so great an annuall rent, yet must be pay at his entrance a fine, or (as they call it) an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come often pound, twenty pound, forty pound, threescore pound, an hundred pound, whereas in truth the purchase thereof is hardly woorth somuch. So that hereby the poore man if hee haue scraped any little thing togither, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to disburse it at the first dash before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the doores of his poore farme, wherin, what through the excessiue fine, and the unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rent, he is scarse able to buy his dog a lofe, liuing like a begger, or little better all his life after. The time hath béene, and not long since, when men feared God, &amp; loued their brethren, that one might haue had a house, with pasture
<pb facs="tcp:12936:37"/>
lieng to it, yea good farmes, leases, and liuings for little or nothing. Or (as some hold) for a Gods penie as they called it. But howsoeuer it be, certeine it is, that that farme or lease, which one might haue had then for ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, is now woorth ten pound. For twentie shillings, now is woorth twentie or threescore pound. For fortie shillings, is now woorth fortie pound, or an hundred pound and more.</p>

               <p>They must first consider that the earth is the Lorde (as the Psalmograph saith: <hi>Domini est terra, &amp; plenitudo eius,</hi> The earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse thereof) and all that dwelleth therein. And therefore being the Lords in propertie, it is theirs but in vse onely. And yet not so. But that they

ought to lay it foorth to the support of the poore, that all may liue iointly togither, &amp; maintaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of the common wealth to Gods glorie.

But if they posses the wrongfully, then ought they to surrender their tytle, and giue it to the right heire: but take them with that fault &amp; cut of their necks.

<pb facs="tcp:12936:39"/>
all this. There are some landlords, (nay lewdlords) that hauing racked their rents to the vttermost, exacted fines, &amp; made all that euer they can of their farmes, will yet proceede further, and as men neuer content with inough, will haue their poore tenants to pay a yeere or two yeeres rent before hande, promising them (before they haue it) that they shall pay no more rent yeerelie, till the same be runne vp. But when they haue it, they pay their yeerely rent notwithstanding, and neuer receiue any restitution for the other. And at euerie change forsooth they must take newe leases, and pay new fines, being borne in hand that their leases before are insufficient, and of no effect. And sometimes foure or fiue yeres yea, ten, twentie, fortie, or fiftie yeeres before their former lease be expired, shall they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to renue their leases, and disburse great somes, or else haue their houses taken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their heads. Besides, as though these pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and pillages were not ill inough, if their leases be not warely and circumspectly made (all quirks, and quiddities of the lawe obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) they will finde such meanes (or else it shal go verie hard) that the poore man shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait his lease, before his lease be expired: which thing if it happen, out goes the poore man,

<pb facs="tcp:12936:41"/>
aske them how much cloth, veluet, or silke wil make a cote, a dublet, a cloke, a gowne, hosen, or the like, they must néeds haue so much, as they may gaine the best quarter thereof to themselues. So play they with the lace also: for if tenne yards would serue, they must haue twentie, if twentie would serue, they must haue fortie, if fortie woulde serue, they must haue sixtie, if sixtie would serue, they must an hundred, and so forward. Besides that, it must be so drawne out, stretched, and pulled in in the sowing, as they get the best quarter of it that way too. Then must there as much go for the making, as halfe the garment is woorth. Besides this, they are in league, and in sée with the Drapers and Clothsellers, that if a man come to them to desire them to helpe them to buy a péece of cloth, and to bring them where good is, they will straightway conduct them to their feer, and whatsoeuer price hee setteth of the cloth, they persuade the buier it is good, and that it is woorth the money, whereas indéed it is nothing so, nor so. And thus they betwixt them diuide the spoile, and he (the tailor) receiues his wages for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruice done. If a man buy a garment of them made, hee shall haue it very faire to the eie (therfore it is true: <hi>Omne quod gliscit non
<pb facs="tcp:12936:42"/>
est aurum,</hi> Euerie faire thing is not the best) but either it shalbe liued with filthie baggage, and rotten geare, or else stretched &amp; drawne out vpon the tenter, so as if they once come to wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they shrinke almost halfe in halfe, so as it is a shame to sée them.

For that which they buy for ten shillings, they will hardly sell for twentie shillings, that which they buy for twentie shillings they will not willingly sell for fortie shillings. And thus by this meanes, they make shooes vnreasonable deere.</p>

               <p>There is fault inough in them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. For wheras the others inhause the price of their hides excessively, these felowes, racke it very vnconcionably. And yet if the shooes were good, though déere, it were somwhat tollerable, but when they shall be both naught, and yet déere too, it is too bad, and abhominable. Now if you aske the shoomakers in whom the fault doth consist, they will answere you strait in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anner. But this is certeine, that as there is a horrible fault in the tanner, so there is more, or as much in the shoomaker. For first of all the shoomaker liquoreth his leather, with waterish liquor, kitthen stuffe, and all kinde of baggage mingled togither. And as though that were not ill inough, they saie they vse to put salt in the liquor, wherewithall they grease the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of purpose, to the ende that the leather shal neuer hold out water. And truelie it is verie likelie, they doe so, or some such like thing, for surelie almost none of their leather will holde out water, nor scarselie durt neither. Besides this it is a worlde to see how lowsely they shall be sowed, with hotte alles, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing threedes, euerie stitche an inch or two from another, so as with in two or three daies you shall haue them seamerent and all too betorne. And yet as though this were not
<pb facs="tcp:12936:44"/>
ill inoughe they adde more. Sometimes they will sell you calues leather for cow leather, horse hides for oxe hides, and truelie I thinke rotten shéepe skins for good substantial &amp; dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able stuffe. And yet shall a man pay for these as well as for better stuffe. And to the ende they may séeme gaudie to the eie, they must be stiched finelie, pincked, cutte, karued, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nickt, and I cannot tell what. And good reason, for else would they neuer be sold. The inwarde soole of the shooe commonlie shall be no better then a cattes skinne, the heeles of the shooes shall be little better. And if the sooles be naught (as they be indeede, yet must they be vnderlaied with other peeces of leather, to make them seeme thicke, and excellent stuffe, whereas indeede they are nothing lesse. And to make the sooles stiffe, and harde, they must be parched before the fire, and then are they most excellent sooles, And such as will neuer be worne, no I thinke not in halfe a coopple of daies, which is a woonderfull thing. Oh, farewell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer worlde, for I haue hearde my Father saie, and I thinke it most certeinely true, that a paire of shooes in those daies woulde haue kept a man as drie as a feather, though he had gone in water all the daye thorowe,

Yea, all the weeke thorow, to the very last day, and would haue serued a man almost a whole yeere togither, with a little repairing.

For when as a théefe, or a fellon stealeth any thing, hee bringeth it to his receiuer, who though he knowe it to be stolen, yet with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie admitteth it into his custodie, and retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it, hereby making himselfe accessorie, and guiltie of the felonie committed. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding when execution is to be done for the same, the principall is (peraduenture) han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp, the other that is the accessorie is not once spoken of, nor none can saie blacke is his eie. But howsoeuer it be, I cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise persuaded, but that the receiuers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessories are a great deale more woorthie of death (by the penall lawes) than he who stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the thing it selfe whatsoeuer it be. Bicause if they had not any to receiue their stolen goods they would not steale at all. And therefore are the receiuers (in my simple opinion) rather the authors, and the principals (especially if
<pb facs="tcp:12936:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they know before they receiue it, that it is sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len) then they that commit the fact, and being the authors of the euill comitted, they are to be punished rather than the perpetrators of the fact it selfe. But for want of due punishment to be executed as well vppon the one as vppon the other, we sée gréeuous crimes, and flagici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous facts without all remorse, or feare of God, daily committed. Good lawes there are, both for the repressing of these, and al other enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatsoeuer, but the want of the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, is the cause why all wickednes and mischiefe dooth reigne and rage euerie where as it doth, God amend it if it be his good pleasure. And thus much briefly of the noble science of brokerie.</p>

But yet can I not denie but that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, &amp; others kéepe sumptuous houses, lusty ports, and great hospitalitie, but so as the pore hath the lest part therof, or rather iust nothing at all.

               <p>Yea, there are two sorts. One sort is of stout, strong, lustie, couragious, and valiant beggers, which are able to worke, and will not. These at no hand are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued (for <hi>qui non operatur non manducet,</hi>

The other sort of beggers are they, that be old, aged, impotent, decrepite, or lame, sicke, sore, or diseased, these I would wish should be looked vnto: and these are they that euerie Christian man is bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to reléeue.</p>

For notwithstanding that they be neuer so impotent, blind, lame, sick, old, or aged, yet are they forced to walke the countries from place to place to séeke their releefe at euery mans doore, except they wil sterue or famish at home, such vnmercifulnes is in <hi>Dnalgne.</hi> Yea, in such troups doe they flocke, and in such swarmes, doe they flow, that you can lightlie go no way, but you shall see numbers of them at euerie doore, in euerie lane, and in euerie poore caue, and as though this were not extremity inough

they driue them from citie to citie, from parish to parish, from towne to towne, from hundred to hundred, from shire to shire, and from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to country like flocks of shéepe.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>No truely haue they not. For some haue such fatte farmes, and tenements, as either will bring forth no corne at all (in a manner) or if it doe verie little, and that not without great cost bestowed vpon it. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some haue houses with no lands belonging to
<pb facs="tcp:12936:51"/>
them at all, and yet notwithstanding shall pay a good round some for the same also. And no marueile, for landlords, and gentlemen take all the lands, and lyuelode wherevpon there poore tenants shoulde liue into their owne hands, and suffer not the poore husbandmen to haue so much ground as will finde them corne for the maintenance of their poore families, nor which is more, scarcely to keepe one cow, horse or sheepe vpon, for their continuall reléefe. Or if they haue any they shall pay tenne times so much as it is worth, to their vtter vndooing for euer. But if landlords would consider that the earth is the Lords, and all that is therein, and that it is theirs, but onely in title, interest, and propertie (hauing the souereigntie, or chieftie thereof) and the poores in vse and possession, and if they would remember that the poore ought to liue vpon the earth as well as they, than would they not vse such tirannie, such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, such pooling, and pilling and the like as they doe without all compassion.</p>

               <p>There is great store of corne, and all kind of graine, no nation vnder the sunne like vnto it, but as I told you before, thorowe the insatiable gréedines of a few couetous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants, who for their owne priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, transport ouer seas whole mountaines of corne, it is made sometimes very scarse. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise there would be gret store at al times. And wheras you say it is good cheape, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, as euerie daies successe prooueth true.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you. It commeth to passe three manner of waies. First, for that landlords racke there rents so extreemely, and aduance their fines so vnreasonably, that the poore man is forced to sell euerie thing déere, otherwise he should not be able to pay his land lord his due, whereas if he had his fearme good cheape, he might afforde to sell good cheap. The second cause is (as I haue said) for that the same is carried and conueighed ouer Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. The third cause is, thorow a sorte of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or forestallers, who intercept euerie thing before it come at the market, or else being come to the market, and hauing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb facs="tcp:12936:52"/>
at will, buy vp either all, or the most part, and carieng it into their celles, and garners at home, keepe it till time of the yeere that corne is scarse, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deere. And when there is want of it, then they sell it deere, and when there is plentye, then they make it deerer by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it vppe in whole heapes as they doe. Thus you sée by this meanes, these hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe ingratours, and forestallers make corne and all thinges else deere, all times of the yeere, Nowe iudge you what a horrible abuse is this for one man to buy vppe all things, and that not for anie neede or want in himselfe, but to sell it againe, deerer then they bought it, thereby to inriche him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the impouerishing of many a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>There be great penalties, and forfaitures ordained, as well for the repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe of this, as of any other outragious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, but they playe with this as with all other good lawes, they inuente quirckes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and quiddities, shiftes, and put offes ynough
<pb facs="tcp:12936:53"/>
to blinde the eies of the magistrates, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer themselues (trimly trimly) from the danger and penaltie of the lawe. For they will say that they buy but for the necessarie proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their owne families, and not to sell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And then when they doe sell it againe, they will beare you in hande it was of their owne tillage. Or if this way will not serue the turne, then procure they another man to buy it with their owne mony vnder his owne name, and so to sell it againe when hee seeth tyme, but who hath the commoditie, iudge you. But if all these waies faile, then buie they it couertly, and sell it againe as couertly, and thus they buy and sell their owne soules for corruptible monie, which in the last day shall beare witnesse against them, and consume them: yea as Saint Iames saith: The monie which they haue vniustlie got with the polling and pilling of the poore, shall rise vp in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against them, and the rust thereof shall eate and deuoure their flesh as it were a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. But let these iollie felowes (as subtil and as politike as they would séeme to be) take héed vnto themselues and beware: for though they can blinde mens eies, and deceiue their iudgements, yet let them be sure, that they can not deceiue the iudgement of the Lord, but he
<pb facs="tcp:12936:53"/>
that made the eies shall surely sée, and he who knoweth the secrets of all harts, shall one day declare the same to their perpetuall confusion except they repent.</p>

And it is well too, if the other though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so wise, circumspect, or prouident, be not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deceiued (or to speake in plainer termes cosoned at their hands) such subtiltie, such po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and such craftie conueiance they practise vnder the garment of simplicitie.

And therefore they are not only to be beloued of vs, but also to be preferred and to be made much of amongst vs, without whose industrie and labour no man could liue long vpon the face of the earth.

               <p>Abuses quoth you? They dare not commit anie I trowe. But séeing you would so faine knowe, I will giue you an inkling of them. First they buy that butter, chéese, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which is naught, bicause they may haue it for a little monie, and then sell it for verie good, this manie a poore prentise and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can tell to be true. Or if they buy that which is good, then they either sell it wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full déere, or else kéepe it till it be past the best, and yet vtter it for as much and more than it cost them. Besides this that they kéepe their butter &amp; chéese till it be mustie and mould, yea till it smell that no man can eate it, they haue also their false waights &amp; counterfet measures to deceiue the poore people withall. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that they buy sometimes 2. or 3. fagots for a penie, yet wil they not sel one be it neuer so litle, vnder a penie, gaining aboue the one halfe in the other. And as for the stuffe whereof they make their candles, I am asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to speake of it. For whereas they should make them of good liquor and swéet, they make them of all kind of kitchen stuffe, &amp; other stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baggage, so that they shal waste &amp; consume

away like vnto waxe against the fire, and yet shall neuer burne cléere, nor giue good light, but run ouer, and about the candlesticke too shamefully.

And therefore in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their ouerflowing knowledge (oh inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious heads, &amp; worthie to be dignified with the diademe of follie and vain curiositie) they haue inuented such strange fashions and monstrous maners of cuttings, trimmings, shauings, and washings, that you would wonder to sée. They haue one maner of cut called the French cut, another the Spanish cut, one the Dutch cut, another the Italian, one the newe cut, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the old, one of the brauado fashion, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the meane fashion. One a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cut, another the common cut, one
<pb facs="tcp:12936:57"/>
cut of the court, another of the country, wish infinite the like vanities, which I ouerpasse? They haue also other kinds of cuts innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore when you come to be trimed they will aske you whether you will be cut to looke terrible to your enimie, or amiable to your fréend, grime &amp; sterne in countenance, or pleasant &amp; demure (for they haue diuers kinds of cuts, for all these purposes or else they lie.) Then when they haue done al their feats, it is a world to consider, how their mowcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when they come to washing, oh how gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly they behaue themselues therein. For then shall your mouth be bossed with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or fome that riseth of the balles (for they haue their swéete balles wherewith all they vse to washe) your eyes closed must be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith also.

And if it be said that any man may cut off the haire one of another, I answer, they may so, but yet not in such comelie, and decent maner as these barbers exercised therein can doe, and besides they knowe that a decorum in euerie thing is to be obserued. And therfore I cannot but maruell at the beastlinesse of some ruffians (for they are no sober christians) that will haue their haire to growe ouer their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces like monsters, and sauage people, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like mad men than otherwise, hanging downe ouer their shoulders, as womens haire doth: which indéed is an ornament to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen them as a signe of subiection, but in man, it is a shame and reproch as the Apostle prooueth.

<pb facs="tcp:12936:60"/>
maketh it of no estimation in the world, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly discrediteth it amonst men. For when as any sick, infirmed, or diseased, either miscarieth vnder the hands of his phisition, or surgean, or else when the medicine, or salue worketh not his effect then fall they to accuse the science it selfe, and to reproch it altogither, whereas in truth the whole blame consisteth in the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the practicioner himselfe. Great pitie it is therefore, that there is such libertie in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting euery one that lust to prophane and to abuse these venerable sciences of phisicke and surgerie as they doe. For euery man though he know not the first principles, grounds or rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his science, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lineaments, dimensions, or compositions of mans body, the poores, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, temperament, or constitution, no nor yet so much as the naturall complexion, qualitie, or disposition of the same, will yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing take vpon him the habite, the title, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name, and profession of a phisition, or surgean.

               <p>Phisicke is good, and yet would I not haue euerie ignorant doult that knoweth not the vse, nor benefit thereof to practise the same.

Than woulde I wyshe that the others who shoulde exercise the vse of Phisicke and Surgerie shoulde first bee Graduates in
<pb facs="tcp:12936:61"/>
either of the vniuersities, and being graduates yet not to be admitted therefore, but first to be tried and examined as well for their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, discresion, and sufficiencie in their art, profession and calling, as also for their godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, christian zeale, pure religion, compassion, and loue to their brethren, and being found suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the foresaid respects, to be admitted and licensed, vnder hand and seale authentike by those that be of authoritie. And if he abuse himselfe or his facultie, then out with him, let him be <hi>Officiperda,</hi> Iacke out of office, make him a <hi>Quondam,</hi> and let him go to plow and cart, rather than to robbe the poore (as manie of them doe) yea to murther and kil them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reprehension. And as I would wish none but godlie, learned, and such as feare God to be admitted to the exercise and practise hereof, so I would wish, that either they might be allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed anual stipends, for their better succouring of the poore diseased, or else might be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take lesse of their poore patients than they doe. For now they ruffle it out in silckes, and veluets, with their men attending vpon them, whereas many a poore man (GOD wot) smarteth for it. Yea, so vnreasonable, and so vnconcionable are they, as some of them wil not set one foot out of his owne doores, without
<pb facs="tcp:12936:61"/>
twentie shillings, fortie shillings, thrée pound, twentie nobles, ten pound, twentie pound, and some more some lesse. And hauing this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fée, If they minister any thing to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie diseased, than besides, must they haue twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shillings, for that that stands them not in twentie pins, fortie shillings, twentie nobles, for that that cost them not twentie pence, &amp; so foreward. This is a great wickednes, God be mercifull vnto vs, and such as the Lord will one day reuenge, if they preuent not his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by spéedy repentance. Besids these abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, there are othersome, that if they owe euill will to any, man or woman being sicke, or if they hope for any preferment by their deaths, wil not make any conscience of it, to giue them such medicines, such potions, and drinkes, as will soone make a hand of them, and this shall be done inuisible in a clowde. Under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of phisicke forsooth, and if he die, why it was not the medicine that killed him (no it were <hi>Blasphemia in sanctos ruminare,</hi> blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to thinke it of these holie fathers) but it was death that cruell tyger that spareth none.

astrologie, and the like curious arts to iudge of things to come, and thinke they can tell all things by the same (but <hi>Dum parturiunt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes nascetur ridiculus mus,</hi> whilst the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains doe trauell a séely mouse will be brought forth) Christ our sauiour saith, <hi>Non est vestrum nosse tempora, &amp; momenta temporum, quae ipse pater in sua ipsius constituit potestate,</hi> It is not for you to knowe the times and seasons, which the Lord God hath reserued to himselfe.

               <p>It standeth vpon nothing else, but méere coniectures, supposals, likelihods, ghes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, probabilities, obseruations of times and seasons, coniunctions of signes, starres, and planets, with their aspects and occurrents, and the like, &amp; not vpon anie certeine ground, knowledge, or truth, either of the word of God. or of natural reason. But to argue the vntruth and the vncerteintie of this foolish curious sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we néed not to go farre for examples and arguments. For the contrariety that euer hath béene in all ages amongst the verie doctors and maisters themselues, but most specially of late doth approoue the same to be most fantasticall, curious, vaine, vncerten, and méere prophane. For there being a maruellous strange coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (as they said) of two superiour planets. So manie as writ of the same, neither iumped togither in one truth, nor yet agréed togither either of the day, houre, or moneth, when it should be: but in al things shewed themselues like themselues, that is plaine contradictorie one to another. Insomuch as they writ in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their errors, and confutation of the contrarie, one against another shamefully to behold. By which more than presumptuous audacitie, and rash boldnesse of these, they brought the world into a woonderfull perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:12936:64"/>
and cease, expecting either a woonderfull alteration of states and kingdomes (as these foolish starre tooters promised) or else a finall consummation, and ouerthrowe of all things. Or if not so, yet the strangest things should happen, that euer were heard or séene since the beginning of the world. Whereas God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at the verie houre, and moment when (as some of them set downe) these woonders and portents should haue happened, there was no alteration nor change of any thing séene or heard of, the element being as faire, as bright, as calme, and as pleasant, and euerie thing as silent, and in as perfect order and forme, as euer they were since the beginning of the world. By all which appéereth the vanitie, and vncerteintie of their curious science. I woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where these fellowes sate, whether vppon the earth, or in the firmament of heauen when they sawe these coniunctions. Or with what eies they could sée that, that no man else could see. But peraduenture they haue <hi>Argus</hi> eies, and can see all things, euen those things that be not. I maruell whether they haue dwelt in the region of the aire, and who told them the names, the scituation, the houses, aspects, and locall places of the signes and planets, of the sunne, moone, and starres, with the number
<pb facs="tcp:12936:64"/>
thereof also, which indeed are innumerable. I woonder what spirite tolde them which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets were higher than other, and which lower than other, which be good, and which be euill, which be moist, and which bee drie, which bee colde, and which be hote, which be gentle and affable, and which bee cruell and terrible, which giue good fortune, and which giue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, which be good to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take iourneies in hand, or to attempt any great thing, and which bee naught, which bee good for a man to take a wise in, that she may be amiable, and gentle, and which be contrarie, which be dangerous to take diseases in, or to fall sicke, and which bee not, with infinite the like fooleries, which I ouerpasse. Now from whence they haue learned these things I cannot tell, but certeine I am, that out of the booke of GOD, they neuer fetched them, the same being in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie point contrarie vnto them, and reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, yea condemning to hell their vaine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious searching of Gods secrets, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of things by such fallible and vncerteine accidents.</p>

               <p>It is the onely waie. For who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the creatures as the sun, the moone, the starres, the signes &amp; planets, doe giue both good things and euil, blessing and cursing, good successe, and euill successe, yea, life and death, at their pleasure (as these brainesick fooles hold they doe) and that they rule, gouerne, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose al things whatsoeuer, yea both the bodies &amp; soules of man (for so some shame not to say) who hearing this I say, would not fall from God, and worship the creatures, that giue such blessings vnto man? What can be a néerer way to withdrawe the people not onelie from God, but also to hale them to idolatrie, and wholy to depend vpon creatures as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then do to their eternall damnation for euer. But say they, though we giue authoritie, great power, great rule and gouernement to the treatures, yet we giue vnto God the chéefest stroke and the chéefest rule in all things, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures being but the instrumentall, or secundarie causes, or (that I may speake plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie) as it were his deputies, substitutes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes whereby he ruleth and worketh all things. Is this any thing else, than to saie with certeine heretikes, that though God made all things, yet he ruleth them not, nor hath no care ouer them, but hath committed the rule
<pb facs="tcp:12936:65"/>
and gouernement of them to his creatures. Then which what blasphemie can be greater? is not this a flatte deniall of the prouidence of God, which scripture so much setteth forth, and commendeth vnto vs? Shall we thinke that God made all things, and now as one wearie of his worke, committeth the gouernmente of them to other creatures? Saith not our Sauior Christ <hi>Pater et ego operamur,</hi> my father work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and I worke? Meaning thereby that as he wrought in creating of all things, so he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth still in ruling them by his power, gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by his wisdome, and preseruing them by hys prouidence, and will do to the end of the world. But when they haue proued that he hath committed the rule and gouernement of his creatures, to his creatures, then I will saye as they say. In the meane time I say &amp; holde that it derogateth greatly from the glorie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God, to saye or affirme that creatures haue the gouernement of all things committed vnto them. For if there should be many kings, princes and rulers in any one realme or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, must not the dominion and rule of the chief prince or regent be lesser, than if he ruled, and gouerned alone? Woe were vs, if wee were at the rule and gouernement of creatures, but blessed be our God, who as he knoweth our
<pb facs="tcp:12936:66"/>
frailtie (hauing therefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities) so he ruleth and gouerneth all things, whether in heauen, earth, hell, or else whersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer according to the good pleasure of his will. In the 1. and 2. chapters of Genesis, besides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit the like places of holie scriptures, we read that the sun, the moone, the stars, with all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures else were created &amp; made for the vse and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of man, being made subiect to him, &amp; he constitute lord ouer them. &amp; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are they becom now his lords, and he their subiect, vassall, and bondslaue? This is preposterous geare, when Gods ordinance is turned topsie turuie, vpside downe. It is time these phantasticall fellowes were looked to in time, that wil go about to disthronize the migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie God Iehoua of his regall throne of maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and glorie, making an <hi>Officiperda</hi> of him, a iacke out of office, &amp; to pul him (as it were) <hi>E caelis,</hi> Out of the heauens, downe to the earth, giuing him no power nor authoritie at all.</p>

               <p>Yes they haue their power, their operation, force, strength and effect in those things whereto GOD hath created them, as namely in the growing, increasing, cherishing, fostering, renewing, comforting &amp; reuiuing of
<pb facs="tcp:12936:66"/>
all natural things, And also they haue their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence &amp; operation in mans bodie, for letting of bloud, receiuing of purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; the like. But to say that they work these effects of their own proper force &amp; strength, or that they rule or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the spirits &amp; soules of man, is vtterly false &amp; at no hand true. And yet notwithstanding is far infatuat are these busie heded astronomers, &amp; curious serching astrologers, that they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute euery part of mans body to one particular signe &amp; planet, affirming that part of the bodie to be ruled by that signe, or planet. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Aries they haue assigned the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the head &amp; face. To Tau. the necke and throte. To Gem. the shoulders, the armes &amp; the hands? To Leo the hart and back. To Can. the brest, stomake, &amp; lungs. To Lib. the raines and loines. To Uir. the guts &amp; bellie. To Scor. the prime parts &amp; bladder. To Sag. the thighes. To Cape. the knées. To Aqu. the legs. To Pisc. the féet. And thus haue they &amp; doe beare the world in hand that the whole bodie of man both <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne</hi> &amp; <hi>externe,</hi> within &amp; without, is ruled and gouerned by the xij. signes, by starres, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets &amp; not by God only. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of which fained vntruth, they pretend the xij. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths in the yere to be ruled &amp; gouerned by the xi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:12936:67"/>
also. Besides this they haue their particular houres, times, and seasons, wherein they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke their effects, and haue greatest strength. So that by their reasons, no moneth in the yere, nor day in the weeke, nor no houre in the day nor night, but it is ruled and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the influence and constellation of the starres and planets, and nothing is effected or brought to passe, but what they will, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>

               <p>They are no liuing or reasonable creatures, it is without all controuersie, but meerely insensible, and without life. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without life and reason, how is it possible that they should bring life or death (as these fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes hold) sicknesse or health, prosperitie or aduersitie, heate or cold, faire weather or foule, beautie or deformitie, long life or short, or any thing else? And if they be not able to giue these things, how much lesse able are they then to gouerne, rule, and dispose all thinge in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, earth, the aire, or else whersoeuer, so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe monarchies, kingdoms, nations, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and people, and finally to work althings after their owne desire and will? Will they
<pb facs="tcp:12936:67"/>
haue dumbe and vnreasonable creatures to rule the reasonable? If that were true, why should God be praised either for his mercie, or feared for his iustice and iudgement, and not rather the planets, signes, and starres; which worke all in all in all creatures? If blessing come by the influence of starres and planets, then let men praise them and not God for the same. And if curses proceed from the starres, let them be feared for them. Briefly if life and death, and all things else come by the force of the elementall creatures, and celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then let them be honoured with diuine worship. If these effects issued from creatures. then why should the homicide, the murtherer, adulterer, or wicked person be punished, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he might say, it was not I, it was <hi>Planeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum iniuria,</hi> The force of the planets that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me to sinne? Or why should the godlie man be praised for dooing well, whereas he is inforced thereto, by the starres and planets? In <hi>Summa,</hi> why should not planets and scarces be adored and worshipped as gods, if they coulde worke these effects? They that attribute thus much to the starres, not onelie rob the maiestie of God of his honour, but also strenhthen the hands of the heathen, pagans, infidels, and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous people, to perseuere in their cursed ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latie
<pb facs="tcp:12936:68"/>
still. Nay do they not rather shake hands with them, that as they worship the sonne, the moone, the starres, fire, water, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for their God, so doe these worship the same, though not for their chiefe Gods, yet for their second gods, whereby they commit most filthie idolatrie and are giltie of most hainous transgression. Indeede I confesse they haue effects and operations, but yet are they not the efficent causes of any thing either good or bad. Otherwise than thus, that it pleaseth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God to worke by them, as by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments whatsoeuer is his good wyll and pleasure, and not after any other sort.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12936:68"/>
gaisers, who teach that man is drawne to good or euill by the constellations, and influence of stars, whether all the people that were euer borne since the beginning of the world, or shal be borne to the ende of the same, were al borne vnder one planet or star? For they had all one fortune, all sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; all were in the iustice of God condemned to euerlasting fire. I would know also whether all the Sodomits and Gomorreans being consumed with fire, &amp; brimstone from heauen were borne all vnder one starre or planet? For they had all one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie, and all one end. Whether all the whole world in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> was borne vnder one, and the same star, or planet, for they had all one destenie, being ouerwhelmed with an vniuersall deluge. Whether the whole host of <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> were borne all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one star, or planet, who had al one iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t one destinie, and one kind of death. Whether all the host of <hi>Pharao</hi> were borne vnder one, and the same starre, and planet, who all sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one kinde of death, and had all one desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Whether <hi>Esau,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were not borne both in a moment, and both at one birth, and yet had they contrarie natures, qualities, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and ends. Finally I would learne of them, whither none that euer liued since the
<pb facs="tcp:12936:69"/>
first beginninning of the worlde, nor any that shall be borne to the end of the same, hath not, or may not be borne in the same houre, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same planet, &amp; constellation, that Christ Iesus was borne in. If they say there haue not beene any borne in the same houre that Christ Iesus was borne in, common reason, and daily experience would disprooue them, for there is not one minute of an houre wherein there are not infinite children borne into the world. And if they say that there are that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e beene borne in the same houre, and vnder the same starre, and planet, than must it needes follow (if man should necessarily be ruled, gouerned, disposed &amp; affected, according to the naturall dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inclination of the planets &amp; stars) that he that hath bin is or shall be, borne in the same howre, and vnder the same planet or star that Christ Iesus was borne vnder, should bee as good &amp; as perfect in euery respect, as Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus himselfe, and so should we haue had manie christs before this time. But God blesse all his children from once thinking of any such impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and blasphemie. By all which reasons and arguments it apeareth manifestly that man is nothing lesse, than ruled, gouerned, or destined, after the inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or influence of stars or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, but onely by the liuing God, who doeth
<pb facs="tcp:12936:69"/>
whatsoeuer pleaseth him in heauen &amp; in earth. This being so, twise vnhappy be those parents that thinke any moneth, day or houre infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for their children to be borne in, or that some be more fortunate and happie than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. And thrise cursed be those wicked deuils, that taught them those lessons. What? Doe they thinke that the Lorde is a sleepe those houres, or being wake hath no power to rule? Hath he not made all things pure and good? Then cannot the good creatures of God make vs euil, or incline vs to sinne. But it is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the deuill, the corruption of our nature, and the wickednes of our owne harts, that dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vs to euill, and so to shamefull destinies, and infamous ends, and not the starres, or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. Whereof if we were truely perswaded, we wold leaue of when we come to any sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full end, to saie? Oh, I was borne to it, it was my destonie, and I cannot tell what: whereas in truth we were borne to no such ends. But rather to glorifie our heauenly father by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of life &amp; godlines of conuersation, whilst we liue vpon the face of the earth. Certein it is that God by his prouidence, &amp; prescience, doth foresee that such a man through his wickednes shall come to such an ende, yet did not the Lord foreordeine, or foreappoint him to the same,
<pb facs="tcp:12936:70"/>
but rather dehorteth him from comitting that wickednes, which may purchase such an end. Wherefore to conclude.

               <p>I will tell you how they pretende to doe it. There are (as they saye) certeine signes in the element (but yet I maruell what Apollo tolde them so, when they were there, and sawe them, or how they knew the shape,

and prooortion of them) as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Uirgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, and Pisces, with their planets, and aspects, as Sol, Luna, Mars Mercurie, Iupiter, Uenus, and Saturne. Now say they, he that is borne vnder Aries, (which is a signe in the <hi>Nusquam region,</hi> Like to a ramme, or sheepe vpon earth) shall be a riche man and too too wealthie. And whie so? Marke their droonken reason. Forsooth because the rame is a fruitfull beast vpon earth, and yeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his master two or three fleeces a yeere. Againe he that is borne vnder Taurus (which is a signe (say these liers) in the element like vnto a bull, vpon earth) now si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he that is born vnder him, shall be pore, &amp; a bondslaue all his daies. And why so? Mary say they bicause the bull on earth is a beast vsed to the yoke, and to much slauerie &amp; drudgery. He that is borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Leo, (which is a signe quoth these iuglers like to a lion) shal be strong, couragious &amp; fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, of al men, &amp; shalbe lord &amp; ruler ouer many. And why so? Bicause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lion is a strong &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beast, &amp; is lord &amp; king ouer all other beasts. He that is borne vnder Scorpio, shalbe a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, a robber, a theefe, and a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Why so? Forsooth bicause the Scorpion, is a serpent full of poyson, &amp; malice vpon earth.

He that is borne vnder Gemini shall be rich, and haue manie children, bicause Gemini is a signe of two twinnes. He that is borne vnder Uirgo shall be beloued of women, shall be ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, faire, gentle, and I cannot tell what, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause maids are so affected. He that is borne vnder Cancer, shall be crabbed and angrie, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the crab fish is so inclined. Hee that is borne vnder Libra, shall be fortunate in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, in waights and measures, bicause Libra is a signe of a paire of ballance. He that is borne vnder Sagittarius, shal be a good shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bicause Sagittarius is a signe like to a shooter. He that is borne vnder Capricornus shall be a slouenly, ill fauoured, and vncleane fellowe, bicause the gote is a beast filthie stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and vncleane. He that is borne vnder A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarius and Pisces shall be fortunate by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bicause watermen haunt the waters, and fishes swim in the same. These be cupstantiall reasons, and well seasoned arguments, and as strong to prooue their purpose, as a castell of paper to resist the enimie. Thus you may sée they haue no other reasons, than to heape one lie vpon another. As first that these signes and planets in the heauens are like to earthly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, then that their natures, and qualities are knowne by the natures and qualities of

These are profound fellowes indéed, and by all likelihood, haue dwelt long in the clouds that are so perfect in euery thing there. and can iudge of future accidents with such singular dexteritie.

               <p>It is the office and dutie of a prince not only to see elected, sent forth, &amp; called, good, able, &amp; sufficient pastours, for the instruction of the church, but also to see that good orders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions &amp; rites be established, and duely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the worde be preached, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments truely ministred, excommunication, discipline and ecclesiasticall censures orderly

executed to the honor of God, and benefit of his church. But if it be said that these thinges are to bee executed of the ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons onely. I answere true it is, but if the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall magistrate be negligent, secure, slouthfull, and carelesse about the execution hereof (as who seeth not some be) than ought the prince to shew his authoritie in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inioining them to doe their office. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this it is the office of the prince to see all kind of sinne, as well in the church men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as in all others of the church seuerely punished. And though I grant the prince to haue the soueraigntie and primacie ouer the church of GOD, within his dominions, yet my meaning is not, that it is lawfull for the prince to preach the word, to minister the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, or to execute the sentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and other ecclesiasticall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and censures of the church, but (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to see them done of them, to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteineth.

meddle wyth the clergie, and therefore made they vassals of most christian Princes. Yea that pernicious antichrist of Rome, in those daies of ignorance hath not béene ashamed to make Kings, Queenes, Emperours, Dukes, Lords, and all other how honorable or noble soeuer, his lackeis, his pages, his horsekee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and compelled them to hold his stirups, to leade his horse, and to prostrate themselues before him, whilest he trod vpon their neckes.

               <p>Be any readers onlie, and not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that is a great abuse. For I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he that cannot preach, ought not to supplie a place in the church of God to read on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, how say you?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is no good reason to say bicause all ought to be preachers, that therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are not necessarie. But indeed I am of this iudgement with you, that whoso can but read onelie, and neither is able to interpret, preach, expound, nor explane the scriptures, nor yet to refell and conuince the aduersarie, nor to deliuer the true sense and meaning of the scriptures, ought not to occupie a place in the church of God, as the pastor thereof. For God commandeth that the pastors be learned, saieng: <hi>Labia sacerdotum custodiant vorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
<pb facs="tcp:12936:78"/>
&amp; ediscant populi verbum dei ex ore eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> Let the lips of the priests preserue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and let the people learne the truth out of their mouthes. And therefore those that haue not this dexteritie in handling the worde of God, they are not sent of God, neither are they Christs vicegerents or pastors to instruct his flocke. To such the Lord saith: They rule, but not by me, they run, but I sent them not, they crie thus saith the Lord, whereas hee neuer spake it. These are those woll shepheards, and dumbe dogs, of whom speaketh the prophet, that are not able to barke against sinne. And therefore I beseech the Lord to remooue them, and place able and sufficient pastors ouer his church, that GOD may be glorified, and the church edified in the truth.</p>

               <p>Uerie true. And therefore are not they more scrupulous than they ought, more curious than néedes, and more precise than wise, that bicause they cannot haue preaching in euerie church, doe therefore contemne ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as not necessarie? This is as though a man should despise meane fare, bicause he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come by better, whereas I thinke it is

It were good (as saith the apostle) that all could prophesie, that is, that all could preach, and expound the truth, but bicause that al haue not the gift, is therfore reading naught? And therefore a sort of noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians lately sprong vp, haue greatly faulted herein, in that they hold that no reading mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters only ought to be permitted in the church of God, as though (as I say) because a man can not haue daintie fare, therefore it is good to haue none at all. But to be plaine, as I will not defende a dumbe reading ministerie only, so I will not condemne it for necessities sake, when otherwise euery place cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently furnished at the first with good and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men as it ought.</p>

               <p>Yea, doubtlesse.

word of God should flourish, ignorance (man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the head of satan) be abandoned, the church edified, and manie a one incouraged to go to their bookes, whereas now they practise no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, and all by reason that by their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they haue no promotion nor preferment at all.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>They preach for the most part in their owne charges, and cures whereouer the holie Ghost hath made them ouerseers, and for which they shall render a dreadfull account at the day of iudgemennt, if they doe not their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, diligently as God hath commanded. But though they preach most commonly in their owne cures, yet doe they sometimes helpe their felowe brethren to breake the bread of life to their charges also. Wherein me thinke they do not amisse. For if a watch man appointed by a whole citie, or towne to giue warning when the enimie commeth, seeing an other citye, or towne to be in danger, giueth sufficient warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his owne citie, and goeth and warneth the other citie also, and so by this meanes deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth them both, I say, that in so doing, hée doth well, and according to charitie. And yet
<pb facs="tcp:12936:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
notwithstanding diuers new phangled felows sprong vp of late, as the Brownists, and there adherents, haue spoken verie blasphemouslie hereof, teaching in their railing pamphletes, that those who are lecturers or preach els wher than in their owne cures, are accursed before god. Than the which, what can be more absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or vntruely spoken? For if they grant (as they cannot deny) that the word of God is good, then cannot the declaration of that which is good in one place be hurtfull in another. And read we not that the apostles themselues went from place to place, preaching the word to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie congregation? Christ Iesus did the same, &amp; also taught vs, that he came not to preach to one citie onely, but to many?</p>

               <p>The reading ministers after they be hired of the parishes (for they are mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) they read commonly in their owne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and cures, except (which is a horrible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse) that they haue two or three cures to serue all vpon one day, and peraduenture two or three myles distant, one from another. Which maketh them to gallop it ouer as fast as they can, and to chop it vp with all possible expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>No truly. For if the other prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ministers bee not well prouided for (as in truth they be not) then how can the other be well maintained? And therfore they haue som of them ten pound a yeere (which is the most) some eight pound, some sixe pound, some fiue pound, some foure pound, some fortie shillings, yea and table themselues also of the same. And sometimes failing of this too, they runne roging like vagarents vp &amp; downe the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries like maisterlesse men, to seeke their maintenance. Whereby some fall to one mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, some to another, to the great slander of the Gospell of Iesus Christ, and scandall of the godlie. And yet part of these reading misters be too well prouided for, for some of them haue two or three, yea foure or fiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices apeece, being resident but at one of them at once, and peraduenture at neuer a one, but roist it out elsewhere, purchasing a dispensation for their discontinuance, and then may no man say: <hi>Domine cur ita fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis?</hi> Sir why doe you so?

               <p>That is an horrible abuse that one man should haue two or thrée, or halfe a dozen benefices apéece as some haue, may anie man haue so many liuings at one time by the lawe of God, and good conscience?</p>

               <p>As it is not lawfull for anie man to haue or enioie two wiues at once, so is it not lawfull for any man how excellent soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to haue mo benefices, mo flockes, cures, or charges in his handes than one at once. Nay I am fullie persuaded that it is more tollerable (and yet it is a damnable thing) for a man to haue two wiues or mo, than for a man to haue two benefices at once or mo. For by possibilitie a man might discharge the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a good husband to two or thrée wiues (yet to haue mo than one is the breach of Gods commandements) but no man though he were as learned as Saint Paule, or the apostles themselues to whome were giuen superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and extraordinarie giftes and graces, is able sufficientlie to discharge his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the instruction of one church, or congregation, much lesse of thrée or foure or halfe a dozen as some haue. And as one father cannot bee manie fathers, one pastor

manie pastours, nor one man diuerse men, so one sheepeheard or pastour cannot, nor ought not to haue diners charges, and flocks at once.

Now the cause why this ground bringeth not forth fruit is, for that it is not plowed, furowed, &amp; tilled al togither as it ought to be. So the cause where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pore churches doe not bring forth fruit
<pb facs="tcp:12936:84"/>
is, for that they are not furrowed, manured, and tilled, as they ought, and bicause the word of God is not preached vnto them, and as it were braied, punned, interpreted, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it sinking down into the good ground of their harts, might bring forth fruit to eternal life. If the strongest mans body that liueth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth should be nourished with nothing for a whole quarter of a yeeres space, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with two or three drops of aqua vite, aqua angelica, or the like, euery day, and at euery quarters end should be fed with all manner of dainties, I am perswaded that his bodie not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding would soone be weake inough. Nay do you thinke it were possible to liue one quarter of a yeere? Euen so falleth out in this case. For although our soules (which liue by the word of God, as our bodies doe by meate) be daily fedde with hearing the word read as it were with aqua vite, or swéet necter, and at euerie quarters ende, haue a most excellent &amp; sumptuous banquet to pray vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet may they macerate and pyne away notwithstanding for lacke of the continuance of the same. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worde of God is to be preached night and day, in time, and out of time, in season, and out of season, and that without ceasing, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission. And if that saieng of the prophet be

Haue they a greater priuiledge than the blessed apostle saint Paule had?

               <p>Bicause one man may easely be corrupted, and drawne to bestowe hys benefice eyther for fauour, affection, or monie, vppon such as bee vnworthie, the whole Church will not so.

giueth not the whole liuing himselfe, <hi>ergo</hi> hee ought not to haue in his owne power, the only gifture of the same. Thirdly the whole church will not giue the same for simonie, one priuate man may be induced to doe it. Fourthlie, the church will kéepe no part of the liuing backe from the pastor, if he doe his dutie, nor imploie it to ther owne vse, the singularitie of one man may easilie be abused: nay the most patrones kéepe the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it be woorth an hundred pound, they will hardly giue fortie pound. If woorth forty pound it is well if they giue ten pound, imploieng the better halfe to their owne priuate gaine. Now if this be not sacrilege, and a robbing of the poore churches of their substance, as also a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding of the Lords minister of his dutie and right, then I knowe not what sacrilege, and fraude meaneth.

But as they were taken from the churches for some causes, so ought they to be remooued and giuen againe to the Churches for greater causes.

               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>Yes that there are. As he that is patrone taking monie for his benefice, to loose the patronage of the same, and the

But doe you thinke they are fooles? Haue they no shift to defeate the lawe. Yes I warrant you. For though they giue two hundred, or three hundred pound for a benefice, yet it shall be done so cloosely, as no dogges shall barke at it. But bicause at the time of their initiation, institution, induction, and admission they are sworne whether they came by it by simonie or no, whether they gaue anie monie for it, or no, therefore to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the guilte of periurie, they the pastors themselues will not giue anie monie, but their friendes shall doe it for them, and than may they sweare (with as good a conscience as euer <hi>Iudas</hi> betraied Christ) that they gaue not a penny, but came by it freely, as of gifte. Or if this waie fayle them, than must they giue the patrones a hundred pounde, or two hundred pounds vpon some bargayne, that is not woorth a hundred pence, and then maye they sweare if neede be, that they came by the bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For now the poore pastours are so handled at the hands of their patrones, that they neyther haue mony to buy them bookes withall, nor which is lesse not to maintaine themselues vppon though but meanelye, but are manye times constrained either to wander abroad to séeke their liuings or els to take vp their Inne in an alehouse, or in some od corner or other, to the great discredite of the gospell of Christ, and offence of the godlie. This argueth flatly that we loue not Christ Iesus, who make so little of his messengers, and ambassadors.

<pb facs="tcp:12936:90"/>
for a pastor that hath a flocke, and a stipend appointed him, to receiue monie vppon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of strangers for preaching the worde abroad in other places, then is it not lawfull for him to take monie in his cure for preaching funerall sermons, marriage sermons, christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sermons, and the like, as many do.

               <p>There are manie woorthie of great blame in this respect. For though they rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iue fortie pound, a hundred pound, or two hundred pound a yéere, of some one parish, yet will they hardly preach once a moneth, nay happily not once in a quarter of a yéere, and sometimes not once a twelue moneth, for the same. And if a man request them to preach at a burial, a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or a christening, they will not doe it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an angell, or a noble at the lest. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the papists, and aduersaries to the Gospel call our Gospel, a polling Gospel, our sermons roiall sermons, angell sermons, and noble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. You call say they our blessed masse a polling masse, but say they your preachings are more polling. For we say they would haue sold a masse for a grote, you will not sell a sermon vnder a roiall, or a noble. And thus these fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes are a slander to the Gospel, and robbers of their fellowe brethren. If I should hire a
<pb facs="tcp:12936:91"/>
man for fortie pound, an hundred pound, or more, or lesse, to teach my children nurture and knowledge, if he for the execution therof shuld aske me more for the same than we agréed for, were not this man a naughtie, exacting, and fraudulent felowe? Nay if I compound with him to teach them in the best maner he is able for so much, and he doth it not, and yet receiue my monie, haue not I good lawe against him? If he should say vnto me, I will not doe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you giue me more, were not this a very vnreasonable man? For hauing his monie that was couenant, is hee not bound both by lawe and conscience to teach them to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of his power? Or if he shall not doe it, and yet take my monie, is not he a théefe and a robber? Is this true in a priuate man, &amp; not in an ecclesiasticall person? Is he not hired to that end &amp; purpose to preach the word of God to his flocke? And hath hee not wages for the same? Shall he now denie to preach the same word except he haue more monie? Or is he not bound in conscience to preach the same night and day without ceasing? And if he doe not, is he not a deceiuer, a théefe, &amp; a robber? The pastor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing taken vpon him the cure &amp; charge of his flocke, and hauing his stipend appointed for the same, is bound to preach the worde of
<pb facs="tcp:12936:91"/>
God to all his flocke indifferently whether it be at buriall, wedding, christening (yea then especially) or at any other time whensoeuer, without taking, or requiring of any more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, than the stipend he was hired for. For if he take any more, it is plaine theft before God, and one day shall be answered for: let them be sure of it.</p>

               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>No, God forbid. Why should not godlie sermons be as wholsome (and as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie) at the burials of christians, when wee haue such liuely spectacles before our eies, of our mortalitie, miserie, and end, as they be at all other times? Yea truely at that present I thinke godlie sermons verie necessarie to put the people in remembrance of their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, of their great miserie, and frailtie, of their fatall end, of the immortalitie of the soule, of the generall resurrection at the last day, and of the ioie, felicitie, and beatitude of the life to come, with the like godlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, that they may the better prepare themselues to the same when God shall call them hence to himselfe. And although of late some phantasticall spirites haue taught that the vse of them is naught, in that they
<pb facs="tcp:12936:92"/>
stand in place of popish diriges, and I cannot tell what, yet cannot I be easilie drawne to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto them, for that I sée them in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect a great deale more curious than godlie wise.</p>

               <p>Is it lawfull thinke you for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and preachers of the Gospell to receiue stipends, and wages for their preaching?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>Why not? Otherwise how should they bee able to kéepe themselues frée from worldly occupations, and trauels of this life (as they ought) to applie their studies for the discharge of their duties, to maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, their family, and houshold, or how shuld they kéepe hospitalitie for the reléefe of the poore, all which they are bound to doe both by Gods lawe, and good conscience? Therefore take away liuings, and wages from the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and ouerthrowe preaching altogither, the ordinarie meane to saluation in Christ. This caused the apostle to enter disputation of this point, where he prooueth by inuincible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that a preacher or minister of the Gospell of Christ Iesus, may (<hi>Salua conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> With a good conscience) receiue wages, and stipends for his paines susteined in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Gospell, and that for the causes abouesaid. Therefore saith this apostle: <hi>Boui
<pb facs="tcp:12936:92"/>
trituranti non ligabis os,</hi> Thou shalt not mussle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth foorth the corne. Whereby is ment, that he that laboreth, and taketh paines in any good exercise, ought not to be denied of his méed for his paines. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he saith: <hi>Dignus est operarius mercede sua,</hi> The workman is woorthie of his reward. And still insisting in the same argument, hee saith: <hi>Qui euangelium praedicant, ex euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio viuant,</hi> They that preach the Gospell, let them liue vpon the Gospell. And yet further prosecuting the same more at large, he saith: <hi>Quis militat, &amp;c.</hi> Who goeth on warfare at any time of his owne charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit? Who féedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flock. By al which reasons, and arguments it appeareth, that he who preacheth the Gospel ought to liue of the Gospell. But as euerie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor that hath a peculiar stocke assigned him may with the testimonie of a good conscience receiue wages, and maintenance of his flocke, for his paines taken amongst them: so may he not, nor ought not to take wages or salarie of any other flocke adioining, if so be it, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon request, or his owne voluntarie good will, he preach the word of God amongst them. To them that are thus prouided for, Christ our
<pb facs="tcp:12936:93"/>

But if any haue not a speciall flocke, or charge assigned him, then may he with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence receiue the beneuolencie, the friendly contributions, and rewards of the churches to whom he hath preached. And this is probable both by the word of God, and the examples of the apostles themselues.</p>

               <p>What say you of preachers, and lecturers, that haue no peculiar flockes, nor charges appointed them, are they necessarie, and may they receiue wages with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the flockes, and charges where they preach the word of God?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>First you aske me whether prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and lecturers that haue no peculiar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>swere. That considering the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate, &amp; condition of the church at this day, they are most necessarie. But if it were so, that euerie church and congregation had his preacher (as euery one ought to preach, else is he not sent by the Lord) then were they not so necessarie, but considering that most churches are planted and fraught with single reading ministers, they are verie behouefull to helpe to supplie the defect of the others, that
<pb facs="tcp:12936:93"/>
through the good industrie as well of the one, as of the other, the churches of GOD may bee instructed and nourished with the worde of GOD to eternall life. Then you aske mee whether these lecturers and preachers may receiue wages of the churches to whom they preach, with a good conscience, whereto I answere, that they may. But yet I am persuaded, that it were much better for them to haue particular flocks of their owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end that they receiuing sufficient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of them, might (if they were at anie time disposed to bestowe any spirituall graces abroad) doe it <hi>Gratis,</hi> frankly and freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any charges to the poore churches of Iesus Christ.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But what if the pastors liuing be not maintaineable nor sufficient for him to liue vpon, may hee not take wages of other flocks abroad?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>I am persuaded no. For if his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing be too little, then ought the church to mend it, but if the church either for want of zeale will not, or through extreame pouertie cannot increase his liuing, then ought the pastor to content himselfe with that little, which God hath sent him, following the example of the apostle, who biddeth the children of GOD
<pb facs="tcp:12936:94"/>
to be content with their wages, bee it little or be it much: for if they haue meate, drinke, and cloth, it is inough, and as much as nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. We brought nothing (saith he) into this world, neither shall we carrie any thing out. Againe, those that will be rich, fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers temptations, and snares of the diuell, which drowne men in perdition and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore if it be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fficient to yéelde him meate, drinke, cloth, and other necessaries, he is bound to content himselfe with the same. Which if he doe (for the zeale he beareth to his flocke) I doubt not but the Lord will open the harts of his flock towards him, and both make them able, and willing to support his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For if hee deliuer vnto them spirituall things, doubtlesse the Lord will moue them to giue vnto him temporall things. And therfore ought he to perseuere, and in his good time, without all peraduenture the Lord will looke vpon him, as he hath promised.</p>

knowing that it is most directly against the word of God, the example of the primitiue age and all good reformed churches thorough the world. Is it not a pitifull case that two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, thrée hundred, fiue hundred, a thousand, fiue thousand, yea possible ten thousand shall be called into the ministerie, in one countrie, not a quarter of them knowing where to haue any liuing or charge? And what do they then? Runne stragling, and rouing ouer countries, from towne to towne, from citie to citie, from shire to shire, and from one place to another, till they haue spent al that euer they haue, and then the most of them either become beggers, or else attempt wicked and vnlawfull meanes to liue by, to the great dishonour of God, and slander of the word.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Me thinke this is a great abuse, that so manie, or any at all should be called into the ministerie, not hauing flocks, and charges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for them before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>It is a great abuse indéed. For if pastor come of <hi>Pasco,</hi> to feed, if he be not a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard that hath no flock, and if he be not a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that giueth no sustinance, nor a father that hath no childe, then are they no shepheards, nor no watchmen sent from the Lord, that haue neither flocks, nor charges to watch ouer. For
<pb facs="tcp:12936:95"/>
he that is made a shepheard (or a minister) that hath no particular flocke readie to receiue him, is so far from being a lawfull shepheard, by reason of his former admission, that he is rather made a pastor by the church that hireth him to be their watchman and guide, than of him that first called him into that function. And therefore woulde I wish that bishops and others to whome it doth (<hi>Ex officio</hi>) apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to call, and admit pastors, and teachers in the church of GOD, to bee verie carefull héerein, and not rashly to lay their handes vpon any, before they haue had sufficient triall as well of their life and doctrine, as also of the flock and charge where they shal be resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they go not like maisterlesse hounds vp and downe the countries to the slander of the Gospell.</p>

               <p>I haue not, neither doe I meane to speake anie thing vnto you touching these matters, but what I am able (I trust) to prooue by the worde of GOD. And yet I grant <hi>Errare possum</hi> (for <hi>Hominis est labi, &amp; decipi,</hi> Man may bee deceiued and fall) but <hi>Hereticus esse nolo,</hi> Erre I may, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike I will not be. No, so soone as I shall be conuinced by the manifest worde of God, of any of my former positions or assertions, I will willingly subscribe to the truth. But being persuaded as I am, giue me leaue, I beséech you (vnder correction) to speake what I thinke. But now to the purpose. In the first chapter of the Actes of the apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the Euangelist Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> wee read that <hi>Matthias</hi> succéeding <hi>Iudas</hi> the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in the administration of the apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, was not chosen nor elected (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the apostles by the reuelation of the spirite of GOD, knew that he should fall from the same in the end) vntill the place was voide, and emptie. In the sixt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Actes of the apostles wee reade also of seuen deacons, which were chosen for the dailie ministring to the poore, but when I pray you? Not before the church (destitute of their seruice) had néed of them, nor before there
<pb facs="tcp:12936:96"/>
were places readie to receiue them, wherein they might exercise their function, and calling. Then if the apostles would not choose not so much as deacons, which is an office in the church of God farre inferiour to the office of the pastor, or preacher, before places were void and readie to receiue them, much lesse would they, or did they choose or call any pastor into the church of God, before the church stood in need of him, and before there be a place readie to receiue him. Besides that, we read not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the whole euangelicall historie, that euer the apostles called any to be pastors and preachers of the word, before such time as there were places void for them. Common reason me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>inke, and daily experience should teach vs this truth sufficiently, if we were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blinded, that when any church or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is destitute of a pastor, it were better to place there one able person, than to make two or three hundred, or mo vnable fellowes, and they for want of liuing to runne stragling the countries ouer, without any liuing or mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at all, being glad of any thing.

               <p>Me thinke this were a verie good order. That euerie church or congregation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destitute of a pastor should present to the bishops, and others to whom it dooth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, one or two, three or foure able persons, or mo, or lesse, as they conueniently can, whose liues and conuersations they haue had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent triall of, whose soundnesse in religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of life, and godly zeale to the truth they are not ignorant of. Then the bishops and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to whom it doth apperteine, to examine and trie them thoroughly for their sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in learning, soundnesse in doctrine, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie in teaching, and finding them furnished with sufficient gifts for such an honorable cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to admit them, to lay their hands vppon them, and to send them foorth (the chiefest of them) to that congregation or church so desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. Which order if it were strictly obserued and kept (as it ought to be) then should not so manie run abroad in the countries to seeke li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, then should not churches bee pestered with insufficient ministers. Then should not the bishops be so deceiued in manie as they be. And no maruell. For how should the bishop choose but be deceiued in him, whom he neuer sawe before, whose conuersation he knoweth not, whose disposition hee is ignorant of, and
<pb facs="tcp:12936:97"/>
whose qualities and properties in generall, he suspecteth not? Whereas if this order were established, that euerie church destitute of a pastor should present certeine able men, whose conuersation and integritie of life in euerie respect they perfectly knowe (for the whole church is not likely to erre in iudging of their conuersations, who haue béene either altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or for the most part conuersant amongst them) then (as I say, should not the bishop be deceiued in any, nor yet any church scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the wicked liues of their pastors (or rather depastors) as they be. For now it is thought sufficient for the certeintie of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, if he either haue letters dimissorie from one bishop to another (whereas they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing knowe the conuersation of the man) or else letters commendatorie from any gentleman, or other, especially if they be of any reputation. If he can get these things, he is likely to spéede I warrant him. Which thing is scarce well in my iudgement. For you knowe one priuate man, or two, or thrée, or foure may peraduerture either write vpon affection, or else bee corrupted with bribes or gifts, whereas the whole church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor would not. Therefore is the other the surer way.</p>

               <p>In the first chapter of the Actes of the apostles before cited, we read, that after the defection of <hi>Iudas</hi> the traitour, the apostle <hi>Peter</hi> knowing it necessarie that one shoulde be chosen in his place, to giue testimonie and witnesse of the resurrection, and ascension of Christ Iesus, commanded the church to present one or two, or mo, as they thought good, that hee with his fellowe brethren might confirme and allow them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon saith the text, they chose two, to wit, <hi>Matthias,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> surnamed <hi>Bersabas.</hi> And the church hauing presented them, they were elected, confirmed, and allowed of the apostles and elders. Also in the foresaide sixt chapter of the Acts of the apostles when the deacons (whose office was to make collections for the poore, and to sée the same bestowed vpon them without fraud or deceit) were to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, the text saith, that the apostles desired the church to choose foorth seuen men from amongst them, of honest report, &amp; ful of the holie Ghost, which they might appoint to that businesse.
<pb facs="tcp:12936:98"/>
By all which reasons appereth, that the church ought to present him, or them, whom they would haue to be admitted, and not that the bishop ought to present, to allow,, or to intrude him vpon the church at his pleasure against the will thereof.</p>

               <p>I pray you what is your iudgement in this? What if a man be once lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the ministerie, may he euer vpon anie occasion whatsoeuer, leaue off the same functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and applie himselfe to secular affaires?</p>

               <p>There is a twofold calling. The one a diuine calling immediately from God, the other a humane calling immediately from and by man. Now he that hath the first diuine calling (his conscience suggesting the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and the spirit of God certifieng his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the certeintie thereof) being furnished with gifts and graces necessarie for such a high function and office (as God calleth none, but he indueth them first with gifts, and graces neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for their calling) and afterwards is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called of man according to the prescript of Gods word, hauing a flocke appointed him wherevpon to attend, this man may not, nor ought not at any hand to giue ouer his calling, but to perseuere in the same to the end, for that he hath both the diuine and humane callings, being furnished with all gifts, and graces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie (in some measure) for the discharge of his high function and calling. Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in time of extreame persecution, when Gods truth is persecuted, and his glorie defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb facs="tcp:12936:99"/>
if he have not wherewithall to maintaine his estate otherwise, he may for the time giue himselfe to manuall occupations, and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall exercises in the affaires of the worlde, as we sée the apostles themselues did, who after Christ Iesus was crucified gaue themselues to their old occupations of fishing, making of of nets, tents, pauilions, and the like. But vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other side, if a man haue not this diuine calling, his conscience bearing him witnesse thereof, nor yet the graces, gifts, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the minde, fit for his calling (which whosoeuer hath not, it is a manifest argument that the Lorde hath not sent him, for those that hee sendeth, hee furnisheth with all kinde of graces, and giftes necessarie for their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) this man though he be called by humane calling neuer so precisely, yet he may, nay hee ought to leaue his function, as vnwoorthie to occupie a roome in the church of God, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting (as an idoll doth) that thing which hee is not. Besides, hee that is compelled, and inforced either by friendes (as manie are) or by pouertie (as not a few bee) or for anie other respect else to take that high function vpon him, without the testimonie of a good conscience, being not furnished with gifts, and graces fit for such a calling (which argueth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb facs="tcp:12936:99"/>
that God hath not called him) hee I say is so farre from being bounde neuer to leaue his function and calling, that hee ought not one minute of an houre to continue in the same, though he bee called by man a thousande times. Therefore he that is a minister, and hath charge of soules committed vnto him, let him if hee bee not furnished with such gifts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But I haue heard of some that considering the naughtinesse of their calling, and their owne insufficiencie to discharge the same, haue therefore left off their function, giuing themselues to secular exercises, and in the ende haue béene inforced to resume their former function vpon them againe, and that whether they would or not.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>I thinke truely that they who compelled them to take againe that function which they were not able to discharge, and
<pb facs="tcp:12936:100"/>
therefore lest it haue gréeuously offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. This is as if I knowing a simple ignorant foole presumptuously to haue taken vpon him a great and waightie charge, yea such a charge as all the wisedome in the world is not able thoroughly to performe, and when he in taking a view of his owne insufficiencie, shuld be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to leaue his charge to others better able to execute the same than hee, I should notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing not onely counsell, but also compell him to resigne againe his former great charge which I knowe he is neither woorthie, nor yet able euer to accomplish. Thinke you not that he that compelleth him to take againe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or calling which before he had least for his inabilitie, shall not answere for the same, yes truely, you may be sure of it? In conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he that is sufficiently furnished with such gifts as are necessarie for his calling, &amp; withal is found able to discharge in some sort his duty ought not to leaue his function (for to such a on that so doth, Christ saith hee that laieth hande vppon the plough, and looketh backe, is not fit for the kingdome of God.) But againe, he that hath not these gifts, and graces suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for his calling, to the discharge of his dutie ought not to occupie a place in the church of God, as the pastor thereof, much lesse ought he
<pb facs="tcp:12936:100"/>
when he hath (for his inabiltie) leaft the same to be constraied to resume againe his former function, and calling, which he is not able to discharge. But hereof inough.</p>

               <p>Then I perceiue that any minister or ecclesiasticall person that hath not gifts suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to discharge his duty may with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science leaue their functions, and giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to liue by their labors, as others tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men doe, may they not?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, with a better conscience than to retaine them being not able to discharge them in any small measure. For with what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science can he receiue temporall things of his flocke, and is not able to giue them spirituall? With what face can a shepeheard receiue of his sheepe, the milke, the wooll, and fleece, and yet will not, or cannot giue to the same either meate or drinke sufficiently? With what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science can he receiue fortie pound, a hundred pound, or two hundred pound, a yeere of his poore flocke, and is not able to breake to them the breade of life, in such forme, and maner as he ought? Nay how can he euer haue quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that knowing that the blood of all those that die ghostlie for want of instruction shal be powred vpon his head at the day of iudgment, and be demanded at his handes, will yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb facs="tcp:12936:101"/>
refeane the same charge, and function to himselfe still, not being able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the least iote of the same? Therefore would I wish euery man of what office, func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or calling soeuer he be, if he be not able to discharge his dutie in the same, to giue it ouer, and not for greedinesse of a little mucke or dung of the earth, (For monie is no better) to cast away their soules, which Iesus Christ hath bought with his most precious blood.</p>

               <p>Is it lawfull for a pastor or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister that hath a flocke to departe from the same. In the time of plague, pestilence, or the like, for feare of infection?</p>

               <p>Is he a good sheepeheard that when he seeth the wolues comming, will take him to his heeles and runne away? Or is he a sure freend that when a man hath most neede of his helpe, will then get him packing, not shewing any fréendship towardes him at all? I thinke not? And truly no more is he a good pastor, or minister, (but rather a depastor, and minisher) that in time of any plague pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or sicknes, whatsoeuer will conuey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe away from his flocke, for feare of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the houre of death, when the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue most need of comfort aboue all other times, then is he their pastor that shoulde féede

them, the furthest from them. When they stande vppon the edge as it were of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or damnation, then permits he the wolfe to haue the rule ouer them. Our Sauiour Christ saith <hi>Bonus pastor animulam dat pro ouibus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A good shepheard giueth his life for his shéepe, but these felowes are so far from giuing their liues for their sheepe, that they seeke to saue their owne liues with the destruction of their whole flocke. This is the loue that they beare vnto their flocke, this is the care they haue ouer their soules health, which Christ Iesus bought so deere with the price of his blood. Out vppon those shepheards that for feare of incurring of corporall death (which is to the Godly an entraunce into parpetuall glorie) will hazard manie a thousande to die a corporall and a spirituall death both, yea, &amp; death of damnation both of body &amp; soule for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Do they thinke that their blod shall not be asked at their hands at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gret day of the Lord. Do they thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their flieng away from their flock, is a mean to preserue their liues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> longer vpon earth: Is not God able to strike them as well in the fields, as in the city, as well in the country as in the towne, in one place, as well as in another? Is not his power eueriewhere? Is not his messenger death in al places? Saith he not in the booke of Deuteron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if we doe
<pb facs="tcp:12936:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not those things, which he hath commanded vs in his sacred word, cursed shall wee bee at home, and cursed in the fields. And saith he not further, that the plague and pestilence, the botch, bile, blaine, or else what deadly infection soeuer shall followe vs, and lay hold vpon vs, in what place soeuer we be, and shall neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from vs, till it haue quite consumed vs from the face of the earth? And doe these fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues that ouerrun their flocks in time of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thinke that they shall escape the heauie wrath and vengeance of God for their tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation and backsliding from their duties? Doe they thinke that God cannot saue them frm corporal death, but with the breach of their duties towards God? Is not the Lord as well able to defend them from any deadly infection if it be his good pleasure, as he was to defend <hi>Sidrach, Misaach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> from the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire? <hi>Daniell</hi> from the mouth of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Ionas</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iawes of the mightie whale, with manie others that trusted in him? Doe they thinke that his arme is shortened, or his power weakened? Is he not able to deliuer his children, that in dooing of their duties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon his prouidence? And to bee plaine with them, me think that in flieng away from their flockes, they shew themselues to thinke
<pb facs="tcp:12936:102"/>
that either God is not almightie, or else noc mercifull, or neither. For if they beléeued that he were almightie, and that hee were able to saue them, then they would neuer run awaie from their flocke, but depending vpon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, beléeue that he is as well able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them in one place as in another, if it bee his good pleasure. And if they beléeued that he were mercifull, then would they rest vpon the same, not doubting, but as he is almightie, and omnipotent, and therefore can doe al things, so he is most mercifull, and therfore wil preserue al those that put their trust in him. If a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall magistrate that exerciseth but a ciuil office in the commonwealth shuld go away from his charge for feare of infection or plague, wheras his present abode might do more good than his absence, he greatly offendeth, how much more then offendeth he, that being a pastor or féeder of soules, flieth away from his charge, wheras his presence might doe a thousand times more good than his absence? And if it please the Lord to take them away to himselfe, are they not most happie? Enter they not into eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? And haue they not an end of all miseries and paines in this life, and the perfect fruition of perpetuall ioie in the heauens? Are they not blessed, if when the Lord shal call them, he find
<pb facs="tcp:12936:103"/>
them so well occupied as in féeding, &amp; breaking the bread of life to the pore members of Christ Iesus for whose sakes he shed his hart blood?</p>

Againe, euery thing fleeth from his contrarie, but death is contrarie to nature, for it came through the corruption of nature, therfore we flie from the same by the instinct of nature. These and the like fond reasons they alledge, for their excuse in flieng from their flocks, and charges, what say you to them?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>I can saie little to them. But one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie this, that none of all these reasons doe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge them to discontinue from their flockes and charges. And whereas they saie, that their staieng were a tempting of God, it is verie vntrue, it is rather a reuerent obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to this tripled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, <hi>Pasce oues meas, pasce oues meas, pasce oues meas,</hi> Feede my sheepe, feede my sheepe, feede my sheepe. But indeede if it were so that a priuate man who hath no
<pb facs="tcp:12936:103"/>
kind of function nor office, neither ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call nor temporall, seeing himselfe if he staie stil in great danger of death, &amp; might auoid the danger by flieng, &amp; so by the grace of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his life, and yet will not, this man if he tarie tempteth the Lord, and is a murtherer of himselfe before God. And to such it is said, thou shalt keepe the whole from the sicke, &amp; the sick from the whole. This is the meaning &amp; sence of these words, and not that they do priuiledge any man for not doing of his dutie. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all that can be said in confutaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this great &amp; extreeme contempt of their duties, I haue knowne and doe know some ministers (nay wolues in sheepes clothing) in <hi>Dnalgne</hi> that in time of any plague, pestilence or infection, thogh there hath bin no gret dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all that haue bin so far from continuing amongst their flock, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if any one of them were sicke, although of neuer so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon or vsuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, yet fearing to be infected with the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion thereof they haue absented themselnes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither, from visiting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sick according as they ought, &amp; as dutie doth bind them. Yea some of them (suppose you of mercenaries, &amp; hirelings, but not of god pastors) are so nice, so fine &amp; so feareful of death forsoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in no case they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to visit the sicke, neither by day nor
<pb facs="tcp:12936:104"/>
by night. But in my iudgement it is as inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their office and dutie, to visite, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to instruct, and relieue the sicke, at the houre of death, as it is for them to preach the word of God to their flocke al the daies of their life. And peraduenture they may doe more good in one howre at the last gaspe, then they haue done all the daies of their life before. For he that in his life time hath had in small esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the blessed worde of God, but follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his owne humors in hope to liue long, hath lead a very wicked and impenitent life, nowe through the consideration and sight of death, which he seeth before his eies, togither with godly exhortations, admonitions, and consolations, out of the word of God, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selie be withdrawne from his former wicked life, and dieng in the faith of Iesus Christ, with true repentance for his sinnes, to fore commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, liue for euer in ioye both of body &amp; soule, whereas if exhortations had not bin, he might (happily) haue died irrepentant, or vtterly des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate to his euerlasting destruction for euer. Yea, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly seene, that those who could neuer be wonne to Christ Iesus, all the daies of their life before, yet at the last howre they are soone recouered. Therefore ought not the pastors to neglecte their duties therein, but
<pb facs="tcp:12936:104"/>
warely, and carefully to watche ouer their flocks, night and day without ceasing that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the great shephard of the sheepe commeth, he may rewarde them with the immercessible crowne of eternall glory. And thus much be it spoken hereof.</p>

               <p>I tolde you before (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) that the church might examine the life, the conuersation, and disposition of him, or them, whome they would haue to be their pastor, and finding the same good to present him, or them, to the bishops, or elders to whome it appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, to examine for his sufficiencie in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and dexteritie, in teaching and handling the word of God, and finding him a man fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with gifts and graces necessary for such a high vocation, to call him lawfullie according to the word of God, and so to sende him foorth into the Lords haruest, as a faithfull laborer therein.</p>

               <p>The churches haue no further
<pb facs="tcp:12936:105"/>
power in the election of their pastor, than as I haue told you, that is, to iudge of his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation &amp; integritie of life, referring the whole action besides to the bishops, and elders. For if the churches should elect their minister or pastor of themselues absolutely, besides that it would bréed confusion (for some would choose one, some another, some this, and some that, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer contenting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with any) the church should doe that also, which were directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the word of God.

Neither was it euer séene that any church did euer practise the same. For in the dais of the apostles did the churches any more than choose foorth certeine persons of a tried conuersation, &amp; presented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the apostles? And did not the apostles then whom our bishops now in this action do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) lay their hands vpon them, approue them (after triall had of their sufficiencie in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) and sent them forth into the Lords vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard? The churches laid not their hands vpon them, or as some call it consecrated them not, nor vsed not any other ceremoniall rite in the

And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I grant that a seigniorie in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry congregation were to be wished, if it could be brought to passe, yet cannot I perceiue, but that it would rather bring confusion, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, considering the state of the church at this day. For in the apostles times when seigniories were ordeined, we read not of any shires, dioces, or precincts, where bishops and ecclesiasticall magistrates might exercise their authoritie and gouernement, as now they doe, and therefore, there being neither bishops, ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall nor ciuill magistrates (as we haue now) it was necessarie that the seigniories shuld be ordeined. But now we hauing al these things, stand not in such necessitie of them, as the churches in the apostles daies did. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the institution of elders was but meere ceremoniall, and temporall, and therefore not to continue alwaies, neither ought the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie thereof to binde all churches. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I thinke that all churches are bound for euer to one forme of externall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that euery church may alter, and change the same, according to the time, and present state therof, as they shal see the same to make for the glorie of God, and the common peace of the church.</p>

               <p>Their office (which was to make collections for the poore, to gather the beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and contributions of euerie one that were disposed to giue, and to sée the same besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the poore and néedie members of the church) is very necessarie, and without doubt ought to be continued for euer. But yet is not the church tied to their names onely, but to their office.

So that the superioritie that they haue ouer their brethren, resteth in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, authoritie, and honour, which it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the prince to dignifie them withall aboue their felowe brethren, and not in calling, func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or office, for therein they are all coequall togither. But if any curious he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

to refuse the same? Nay is it not extréeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude towards his prince? Besides, who seeth not, that if there should be no superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (I meane in dignitie, &amp; authoritie only) the same honorable office or calling would growe into contempt? For is it not an old saieng, and a true, <hi>Familiaritas, siue aequalitas parit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptum,</hi> Familiaritie, or coequallitie doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bring contempt. And therefore take awaye authoritie, and honor from the magistrates ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporall or spirituall, and ouerthrowe the same altogither. If authoritie should not be dignified, as well with glorie, and externall pompe the better to grace the same, &amp; to shew forth the maiestie thereof, would it not soone grow to be dispised, vilipended and naught set by? And therefore the more to innoble, and set foorth the excellencie of this honorable cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a bishop, hath the prince, &amp; the churches thought it good to bestow such authoritie, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and honor vpon them, and not for anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause whatsoeuer. And therefore seeing it is the pleasure of the prince to bestowe such dignitie, authoritie, and honor vpon them, me thinke, any sober christians should easely tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the same.</p>

               <p>Indeede amongst the apostles there was no superioritie, I grant, neither in office calling, authoritie, nor otherwise, but al were equall in ech respecte, one to another. But what than? The apostles were sent to preach, to the churches, and not to gouerne (and therefore they choose elders to rule the same) but our bishops are as well to gouerne, and to rule the churches in some respects, as to preach the worde. And therfore though there were no superioritie amongst the apostles, yet maye there be amongst our bishops in respect of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, dignitie, and authoritie. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they saie there ought to be no superioritie in the ministerie at all, I answeare no more there is in respect of euerie ones function, forme of calling, and office to preach the word and minister the sacraments. But in respect of gouernement, authoritie, dignitie, and honor, there is superioritie, and I am perswaded so ought to be. In which opinion, vntill they haue disprooued it, I meane Christ willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siste.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But they adde further, and say that it strengtheneth the hands of the aduersaries,
<pb facs="tcp:12936:109"/>
the papists. For saie they the papists may as well affirme that christian emperours kings, and potentates, and euen the churches of God themselues haue giuen to the pope that authoritie, that dignitie, and honor which he hath or claimeth aboue his fellowe brethren, as well as the bishop may say so. Besides it confirmeth the opinion of soueraigntie ouer at the churches in the world, For say they may not the pope saie that he receiued plenarie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be head ouer all the world, from christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an kings, emperours, and potentates, as well as the bishops may say, we receiued this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be superior to our brethren from christian kings and princes. Now whether these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be a like I would gladly know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>They be verie vnlike, and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as there is no equallitie comparison, or semblance betwixt them. For first of all let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> note, that the pope nor any of his complices, and adherents doe not holde, nor pretende to holde (no they dare as well eate off their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as to say so, for then were their state in a wofull case) that their archdiuell, their god the pope I should say doth receiue his power ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of authoritie, superioritie, primacie, soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigntie, or head ouer all the world from any earthly creature, but immediately from God
<pb facs="tcp:12936:109"/>
himselfe. But whereas hée sayth that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his power of superioritie ouer all the worlde from no earthie creature, but from God himselfe, it is manifest that he receyued it neyther from God, (for his vsurped power is contrarie to God, and to his words in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie respecte) nor from anie christian man, but from the Deuill himselfe, whose vicegerent or Liefetenant generall in his kingedome of impietie he shewes himselfe to be. Than let them note, that although hee pretended to holde his vsurped authoritie from man (as hee doth not,) yet is there no man howe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie an Emperour, King, Prince, or Potentate soeuer, that is able <hi>proprio iure</hi> to giue him authoritie ouer all the worlde, without great and manifeste iniurye done to all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to giue the soueraigntie, or chieftie of their Landes from them, to a straunger. But a Prince may lawfullye bestowe, and geue to his subiectes anie prerogatiue, title, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, office function, gouernment, or superioritie of anie thing within his owne dominions and kingdomes, but no further he maye not. And therefore this reason of theirs holdeth not, that the Pope maye as well arrogate the one to himselfe, as the Byshops may the other to themselues.</p>

               <p>Séeing now it cannot be denied, but that bishops are most necessarie, and that they may also lawfully hold superioritie ouer their brethren (in respect of gouernement, regiment or authoritie) being giuen them of the prince, what say you then to this? Whether may a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop be called by the name of an archbishop, metropolitane, primate, or by the name of my Lord bishop, my Lords grace, the right honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the like, or not? For me thinke these titles and names are rather peculiar to the temporaltie than to them, &amp; do sauour of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie, and worldly pompe, rather than of any thing else. And which is more, me thinke they are against the expresse word of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I couet greatly to heare your iudgement thereof?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Amphil.</speaker>
               <p>These names and titles may séeme to sauour of vaineglorie indéed, if they should arrogate them to themselues <hi>Iure diuino,</hi> as they doe not. But if you wil consider by whom they were giuen them, and how they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them, you wil not thinke it much amisse, nor farre discrepant from the sinceritie of the Gospell. First therefore note that they were giuen them by christian princes to dignifie, to innoble, to decore, and to set foorth the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the excellencie, and worthines of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
<pb facs="tcp:12936:110"/>
Secondly let them note that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them as due vnto them by the donation and gifture of men, and not <hi>Iure diuino,</hi> and therefore being giuen them for the causes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid by christian kings and princes, they may in that respect hold them still without any offence to the diuine goodnesse, or his faithfull spouse vpon the earth. But if they shuld claime them as due vnto them by the lawe of God, as they doe not, then should they offend. For our sauiour Christ seeing his disciples and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles ambiciously to affect the same vaineglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious titles and names, set before them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the heathen kings, thereby the rather to withdrawe them from their vaine humour, saieng: <hi>Reges gentium dominantur eis, &amp;c.</hi> The kings of the gentils beare rule ouer them and those that exercise authoritie ouer them, be called gratious Lords, but <hi>Vos autem non sic,</hi> You shall not be so. In the which words he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denieth them (and in them all others to the worlds end, that in the same office and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of life should succeed them) the titles of Lords, graces, or the like. The apostle also bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to beware that they challenge not those vaine titles to themselues by the lawe of God, when he saith (speaking to bishops and pastors) Be not Lords ouer your flocks, &amp;c. By
<pb facs="tcp:12936:111"/>
these and manie other the like places of holie writt, it is cleare that they cannot arrogate these names, or titles to themselues by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, neyther doe they, but (as I haue said) by the donation, the beneuolence, and gifture of christian Princes for the reuerent estimati- they bare and ought to beare to their high func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and calling, in that they are his Liefete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, his vicegerents in his Church, his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, his Ambassadors, the disclosers and proclaimers of his secretes, and his Aungels, (for so are they called in the scriptures) &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in respecte of the excellencie hereof, these names were giuen and attributed vnto them. And truely to speake my simple iudgement, I sée not but that these names doe dignifie their callinges, shewe forth the maiestie thereof, and des moue the Churches to haue the same high calling in more reuerence, &amp; honor, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would, if they were called by bare &amp; naked names onelie. But notwithstanding either this that hath béene saide, or anie thinge els that can be said herein, there are some wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward spirits lately reuiued, who held the same names to be méere Antichristian, blasphemous and wicked, and suche as at anie hande a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Gospell ought not to bee called by. But whereas they holde them to bée Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb facs="tcp:12936:111"/>
I holde them to be Christian names, and geuen by Christian Princes to the innobling and garnishing of their offices, functions, and callinges, which doubtlesse is a glorie to God denie it who will, or who can. And therefore in conclusion I say, that Byshops though not by the lawe of God, yet by the positiue law, dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gifture of Christian Princes, maye lawfully assume the saide titles, and names to them for the causes before cited. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these names and titles béeing meere indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and not derogating from the glorie of God, but rather making for the same, they are not of anye wise, sober, or faythfull Christian, neyther to bee inueighed against nor yet to bee in anye respecte dislyked beeing vsed as before. And thus much of the names and titles of Byshops.</p>

               <p>Maye Byshops exercise tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall authoritie together with Ecclesiasticall, and maye they bee Iustices of peace, Iustices of Quorum, Iustices of Assises, Ewer, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminer, and the lyke, or maye they as Capytall Iudges geue desinytiue sentence of lyfe and death vpon malefactors and others, that by the iudiciall lawe of man haue deserued to dye?</p>

               <p>There is neither of the callings temporall, nor ecclesiasticall, but it requireth a whole and perfect man, to execute the same. And if there were neuer founde any one man yet so perfect, as could throughly, and absolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie performe his office in either of the callings temporall or ecclesiastical, much lesse can there euer one man be found, that is able to discharg them both. It is hard therefore that these two callings should concurre in one man. This is as though a man hauing an importable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then alreadie vpon his backe, should yet haue an other almost as burthenous vrged vppon him. And therefore as it were absurde to see a temporall magistrate mount into the pulpit, preach the worde, and minister the sacraments so absurde it is to see an ecclesiasticall magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate exercise the authoritie temporall, and to giue sentence condemnatorie of life, &amp; death, vpon any criminous person, which properlie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elongeth to the temporall power. Besids, it is a great discredite to the temporall magistrate, because it may be thought that they are not wise nor politique inough to execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor discharge their duties without the aide, and assistance of the other. And which is more it hindereth them from the discharge of their duties in their owne calling, for
<pb facs="tcp:12936:112"/>
it is written, no man can serue two masters, but either he must betraie the one or the other. When the woman taken in adultery was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and brought vnto Christ, he refused to giue iudgement of hir, and yet it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in effect ecclesiasticall, &amp; appertained to an ecclesiasticall iudge. Then what ought they to do in matters meere ciuil? Againe our sauior Christ, when the yong man requested him to deuide the inheritance betwixt his brother, &amp; him, refused the same saieng, <hi>Quis me consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit iudicem inter vos</hi>? Who made me a iudge or a deuider betwixt you. Whereby appeareth how farre ecclesiasticall persons ought to bee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing to doe, with temporal matters. But whereas they say the bishops of <hi>Dnalgne</hi> do exercise temporall authoritie, and doe it as iudges capitall, giuing sentence condemnato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of life, and death, it is verie vntrue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than thus, to be present at the same, &amp; to haue a consultatiue exhortatiue, or consenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue voice onely. Which vse me thinkes is v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good and laudable in my iudgement. For whereas the temporal magistrates not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in euerie point the deapth of Gods lawe if they shoulde doe anie thing either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same, or the lawe of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they might informe them thereof, that

The apostle <hi>Paule</hi> with a poore cloke, and the like, wherby appeareth, how farre a minister of the Gospell ought to be from pride, and worldly vanitie, obseruing the rules of christian sobrietie, as well in apparell, as in al things else, knowing that he is as a citie set vppon an hill, and as a candle set vppon a candlesticke to giue light, and shine to al the whole church of God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith Christ: <hi>Sic luceat lux vestra coram hominibus, &amp;c.</hi> Let your light so shine before men, that they seeing your good works, may glorifie your father which is in heauen: which God grant we may all doe.</p>

               <p>It is not required as of necessitie, bnt thought méete and conuenient to bee vsed for a decencie, and comlines in the Church of God. But notwithstanding the chiefest thyng wherby a pastor or minister oght to be known from the common, &amp; vulgare sorte of people is, the preaching of the word of God, the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the sacraments, the execution of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical discipline, and other censures of the Church, and withall his integritie of lyfe, and soundnesse of conuersation in euerie respecte. These are the true notes, and markes wherby a Minister of the Gospell ought to bee knowen and distincted from the other common sorte of people. And yet though these bee the chiefest notes whereby they are distinct from others of the temporaltie and laitie, yet are they not the onelie notes, or markes, for they are knowen and discerned from others also, by exteriour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, and attire, as namely by cappe, tippet, sur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plesse,
<pb facs="tcp:12936:115"/>
and such like: That as the first doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them from others, whilest they are ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ercised about the same, (for who is so doltishe that séeing a man preache, minister the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; execute other ecclesiasticall censures of the church, that will not iudge him to bee a Minister of the Gospell?) so the other notes of apparell (the surplesse except) may make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and distinguishe them from others of the laitie abroad. To this end, that the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which is due to a good pastor, or minister of the Gospell may be giuen vnto them. For as the Apostle saith, those elders that rule well, are worthie of double honour.</p>

               <p>Indéede there are some I confesse, that are of that opinion, and they bring in the example of Saule, enquiring of Samuell for the feers house, inferring that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was not distinct from other common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his attire, for than Saule should easelie
<pb facs="tcp:12936:115"/>
haue knowen him by the same. And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the damosell, that spake to Peter, inferring that whereas the mayde sayde, <hi>Thy speech bewrayeth thee,</hi> if he had bene distincte from others in attire, or outwarde apparell, shee would than haue sayd, <hi>Thy apparel shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee to bee such a fellowe.</hi> These with the like examples they pretende to prooue that pastors and Ministers are not to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and knowen from the lay people, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye kinde of apparell. But as I will not saie that they are to bee knowen, and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from others by apparell or habite onelye, (but rather by the lifting vp of their voices like Trumpetes as saith the Prophet) so I wyll not denye the same to bee no note or marke at all to knowe a Pastour or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Gospell by from others of the temporaltie, and laitie. And truelye sor my parte, I sée no great inconuenience, if they bee by a certaine kinde of decente habite (commaunded by a Christian Prince) known and discerned from others. Yet some more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than wise, before they would weare anie distinct kind of apparell from others, they haue rather chosen to render vp both lininges, goods, families, and all, leauing their flockes to the mouth of the wolues.</p>

               <p>It is no good reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to say such a thing came from the Papistes, <hi>ergo</hi> it is naught. For we read that the Deuils confessed Iesus Christ to be the sonne of God, doth it follow therefore that the same profession is naughte, because a wicked creature vttered the same? All thinges are therefore to bee examined, whether the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse consist in the thinges themselues, or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that abuse them. Which being found out, let the abuses be remoued, and the thinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine still. A wicked man maye speake good wordes, doe good works before the world, (but because they wante the oile of faith to souple them withall, they are not good workes before the Lord) and maie ordaine a good thing which maie serue to good ends, and purposes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the same hath afterward béene abused, shall the thing it selfe therefore be quite saken away? No, take away the abuse, let the thinge

remaine still, as it maye very well without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie offence, except to them, <hi>quibus omnia dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur scandalo,</hi> to whom all thinges are offence. And further, if these presicians would haue all things remoued out of the Church which haue béene abused to Idolatrie, than must they pull downe Churches, (for what hath bene abused more to Idolatrie and superstition?) pulpits, belles, and what not. Than must they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the vse of bread and wine, not onely from the church, but also from the vse of man in this life, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same was abused to most shame full idolatrie, iu béeing dedicate to <hi>Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> twoo stinking Idols of the Gentiles. Than must they take away not onely the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and Gospels, but also the whole volume of the holy scriptures, because the Papistes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused them to idolatrie. By all which reasons with infinite the like, it manifestly appeareth, that manie things which haue beene instituted by Idolaters, or by them abused to Idolatrie, may be applied to good vses, and may serue to good ends, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abuses being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away. Yet wold I not that any thing that hath béen idolatrously abused by the papists, should be reteined in the churches of Christians, if by any meanes they might be remoued, and better put in place.</p>

               <p>You say the truth, for the Papistes haue their misteries in all thinges after their maner. Therfore thus they say that white doth signify holines, innocency, &amp; al kind of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, putting them in mind what they ought to be in this life, and representeth vnto them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude, the felicitie, and happines of the life to come.

with whome hee dispenceth, maie weare the same euerie where, bicause none haue <hi>plenari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am potestatem</hi> plenarie power in euerie place, but <hi>(Beelzebub)</hi> the Pope.

Thus foolishlie do they deceiue themselues with vaine shewes, shadows, and imaginations, forged in the mint of their owne braines to the destruction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. But who is he, that because these sottishe Papistes haue and doe gréeuouslie abuse these thinges, will therefore haue them cleane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued?

Let vs consider that this contention of ours among our selues, doth hinder the course of the Gospell from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such deepe roote in the heartes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, as otherwise it would doe. And thus for this time brother <hi>Theodorus,</hi> we will breake off our talke concerning this matter, vntill yt please God that we may meete againe. Which if it please God we doe, I promise you in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woorke to discourse of the same more at large. In the mean time let vs giue our selues
