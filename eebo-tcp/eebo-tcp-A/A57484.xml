            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu have ſufficiently ſatisfied the World of the Curioſity you have for whatever, in any meaſure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it: You were pleas'd to give me a hint of the Piece I here preſent you withal; and your recommendation of the Original might well raiſe in me a hope of your readier accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Tranſlation. It is the nobleſt of humane Actions to vouchſafe a kind Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the Diſtreſs'd, whether Nature or Fortune hath made them Calamitous. The equality of Miſery makes the Endurers of it moſt commonly the more compaſsionate; ſo far as that thoſe who have been firſt reliev'd charitably direct others to the ſame Almoners.</p>
            <p>Thus do I bring to your doors a company of poor <hi>Caribbians,</hi> to offer you their Reſpects and Submiſsions, in the name of all thoſe Iſlands, whereof their Anceſtors have been heretofore poſſeſs'd in the Ocean of <hi>America:</hi> They are in hopes, that neither the obſcurity of their Origine, nor the harſhneſs of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor the barbariſme of their Manners, nor their ſtrange courſe of Life, nor the cruelty of their Wars, nor their ancient Poverty, nor
<pb facs="tcp:58704:3"/>
laſtly the unconſtancy of their Fortune, will hinder your favourable Reception of them. And what heightens this hope of theirs, is, an imagination, that you, who find leiſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow your Eye and Thoughts on ſo infinite a Multitude of Volumes as preſs from all parts of the World into your Library, may be pleas'd with ſomething that is done among them; and that the Hiſtory of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> may entertain you, not only with a delightful Variety, as to the divertiſement of the Sight, but alſo with many occurrences capable of exciting your Admiration.</p>
            <p>What may be further ſaid on their behalf, I leave to be expreſs'd in their own natural Rhetorick, and bethink me of making ſome Apology for my ſelf; which is only this, That the preſumption of the preſent Addreſs is in ſome meaſure the effect of your Goodneſs and Candor, and that it had been but a neceſſary expreſsion of my Gratitude, had I many years ſince profeſs'd how much I am,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE, Giving an account of both the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Edition of this Work.</head>
            <p>THE Relations we have from remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, for the moſt part, come attended with this misfortune; that many times they are written by Perſons, who, being concerned therein, for ſome Reaſons and Conſiderations only known to themſelves, make it their buſineſs to diſguiſe the Truth, and repreſent things otherwiſe than they are. Sometimes alſo we have to do with certain Writers, who, in cold blood, and to gratifie their own humour, would impoſe upon our credulity, as it were out of a defiance of being diſproved. And laſtly, it is our fate to receive Pieces of this nature from men little vers'd in ſtudy, and ſo ſuch as are not able to lay down things with the requiſite exactneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as, upon many occaſions, they take one thing for another, and relate not things truly and naturally, though they have not any intention to deceive us. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is a great advantage, when ſuch Works are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Authors, in whom theſe three conditions are found combining together; to wit, That they are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; That they dally not with Truth; and, That they have all the Requiſites for the right framing of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who ſhall caſt their Eyes on the preſent Hiſtory, are to expect therein theſe advantages: For as to the two firſt of the forementioned Conditions, that is, to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them under one word, Sincerity, the Authors of this Work preſume to attribute it to themſelves, ſince it is an Elogy any one may innocently aſſume to himſelf, if his own Conſcience give him not a check for ſo doing: But for the third, which relates to the ability of the mind, though
<pb facs="tcp:58704:4"/>
an over-earneſt pretention thereto may ſeem to proceed from a certain vanity and ſelf-confidence; yet when all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhall be conſidered, the ingenuous will eaſily be induced to allow them even that alſo.</p>
            <p>For 1. The Relations they had to work upon came from Perſons who had been Eye-witneſſes of what they delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, diſ-intereſſed, and of known integrity, and endued with the abilities requiſite to manage ſuch a Work. 2. There was a deſign of this Hiſtory drawn at Paris, ſome years before it came abroad, and then thought worthy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, by divers intelligent men, to whom it was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, who carefully read it over, and honoured it with their Remarks. Yet that it might come forth with greater exactneſs, it was laid aſide, till the obſervations of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Voyages had added much to its perfection. So that if the Publick receive any ſatisfaction from this Hiſtory, it will have reaſon rather to congratulate, than quarrel at its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; ſince it comes out now more enriched and exact, than it would have been, at the firſt proffer of it to the Preſs. For beſides that many Obſervations and Relations came ſince to hand, the Authors made alſo great advantages of the private Diſcourſes they had with one Father <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> eſpecially as to the <hi>Moral</hi> part of the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Hiſtory. For this man having lived many years in thoſe Iſlands, and had much converſation with the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of <hi>Dominico,</hi> came by that means to be acquainted with their Language, their Manners, and the most particular Cuſtoms of that Nation. From the ſame F. <hi>Raymond</hi> they had alſo the <hi>Caribbian Vocabulary,</hi> which may be ſeen at the end of the Book.</p>
            <p>They thought fit to divide the Hiſtory into two Parts, the <hi>Natural</hi> and the <hi>Moral,</hi> in imitation of that of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Joſephus Acoſta,</hi> and they hope the Piece will be found ſuch as to anſwer the Title; comprehending in the former whatever is of the natural growth of the Country, as <hi>Plants, Fruits, Flowers, Birds, Beaſts,</hi> &amp;c. and under the latter, whatſoever relates to their <hi>Manners, Cuſtoms, Religion, Vertues, Vices,</hi> &amp;c. Not that they would have it inferr'd thence, that this Treatiſe ſhould contain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over might be written on the ſubject of the <hi>Caribbies;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58704:4"/>
nay they acknowledge, that both the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> part of this Hiſtory might be much enlarged; but with this advertiſement, that if every part of the <hi>New-world</hi> were ſo diligently examined by Hiſtorians as this hath been, the <hi>Old-world</hi> would have a much more particular account thereof, than it hath at the preſent.</p>
            <p>They have alſo thought it not beſide their purpoſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>Moral</hi> part of the Hiſtory, to cite the Writings of divers other well-known Authours, not out of any deſign to enlarge the Volume, as ſome might haply imagine; but to make a certain parallel between the Morality of our <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> and that of divers other yet Barbarous Nations; which they conceiv'd would not be undelightful to ſome, even though they looked on them as ſo many digreſſions from, or interruptions of the <hi>Carribbian</hi> Hiſtory. But what cenſure ſoever may be paſſed on them, they hope that if any ſhall think them not neceſſarily relating to the main deſign of the Draught, they may nevertheleſs view them with a certain pleaſure, as the Drapery, conſiſting of Flowers and Fruits, &amp;c. for the greater ornament of the Piece.</p>
            <p>Diſcourſe is the image of the thought; but the Draught of a thing by way of Painting or Graving repreſents the thing it ſelf. From this conſideration it came, that this Piece is further adorn'd with ſeveral pieces of Sculpture, to the end that the Idaeas of the things particularly treated of might be the more throughly imprinted in the Readers mind, by a ſenſible demonſtration thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus much as to the Authours and Directors of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Edition. The Publiſher of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hath only theſe few Remarks to trouble the Reader withal.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That poſſibly thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> may have peculiar names for divers of the Plants, Beaſts, Birds, Fiſhes, &amp;c. mentioned in this Treatiſe, much different from thoſe which the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher hath uſed. Some of them, upon conſulation with ſuch as had lived in thoſe parts he made a ſhift to get, and in all likelihood might have gotten moſt of the rest, had not the breaking forth of the lâſt years Contagion caus'd moſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> to retire to their Country Habitations and Friends.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:58704:5"/>2. The Reader is to note, that where ſome accident is ſaid to have happened four or five, or ſome other number of years ſince (as for inſtance, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. where it is ſaid in theſe words, that, <hi>two years ſince they were forced to quit their Villages, &amp;c.</hi>) it is to be referred to the coming forth of the Original Edition, which was in the year M. DC. LVIII.</p>

               <p>Theſe Iſlands were firſt diſcovered by <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> in the year of our Lord, One thouſand four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety and two.</p>
               <p>There are numbred of them in all twenty eight, lying under the Torrid Zone, acounting from the eleventh degree of the Aequator, to the nineteenth Northward. Some Authors, as <hi>Linſcot</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>America,</hi> taking the name of the <hi>Antilles</hi> in a more general ſignification, attribute it to the four greater Iſlands, to wit, <hi>Hiſpaniola, Cuba, Jamaica,</hi> and <hi>Porto-Rico,</hi> as well as to theſe twenty eight.</p>
               <p>The Air of all theſe Iſlands is temperate, and healthy enough, eſpecially to ſuch as have lived any time in them. The Plague heretofore was not known in theſe Parts, no more than it was in <hi>China,</hi> and ſome other places of the Eaſt: But ſome years ſince moſt of theſe Iſlands were much troubled with malignant Fevers, which the Phyſitians held to be contagious. That cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Air was occaſion'd by ſome Ships which came from the Coaſt of <hi>Africk;</hi> but now there is no talk of any ſuch Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The heats are not greater in theſe parts than they are in <hi>France</hi> during the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and through a particular care of Divine Providence, between eight and nine in the morning there riſes a gentle Eaſt-wind, which many times continues till four in the afternoon, refreſhing the Air, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the ſoultrineſs of the heat. <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> affirms, That in the greater Iſlands of <hi>America</hi> this cooling wind blows about Noon. Thus through all the compaſs of the Torrid Zone, the wiſe Diſpoſer of humane concernments hath ordered cool and regular Winds, to alleviate the ſcorching heats of the Sun.</p>
               <p>It is never cold in the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> and Ice is a thing was never ſeen in thoſe parts; nay, it would be accounted a kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy to find that where,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>All things are clad in a perpetual green,</l>
                  <l>And Winter only in the Snow of Lillies ſeen.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But the Nights there are extreamly cool; and if a Man be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered during that time, he is apt to catch Colds, and great and dangerous pains in the Cheſt and Stomach: Nay, it hath been obſerv'd, That thoſe who have expos'd themſelves unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to that pleaſing coolneſs, if they have eſcaped pains and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58704:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gripings in the Stomack, have turn'd pale, yellowiſh, and ſwell'd up, and in a ſhort time loſt the lively vermilion Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions they had before. There are indeed others attribute theſe effects to their feeding on <hi>Caſſava,</hi> which is commonly eaten in theſe Iſlands inſtead of bread, and may poſſibly have ſome quality not conſiſtent with the natural conſtitution of the Inhabitants of our Climates. There is the ſame temperature in the night time at <hi>Peru,</hi> and in the <hi>Maldivas.</hi> And thoſe who have travell'd to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and through all the hot Countries, do affirm, That the greater the heats are in the day time, ſo much the colder are the nights; the reaſon whereof is, that the great Vapours rais'd by the Sun in the day time, being condens'd at night, and falling down in Dew, do extreamly cool and refreſh the Air.</p>
               <p>The Aequinox laſts in theſe Iſlands neer one half of the year, and all the reſt of it the longeſt days are fourteen hours, and the ſhorteſt nights ten. And thus hath the Divine Wiſdom beſtow'd on thoſe Parts of the World which lye moſt expos'd to the ſcorching beams of the Sun, long and cool nights, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and reſtore to vigour what the too neer approaches of that Planet had dry'd up and almoſt blaſted in the day.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Year be here divided into four equal and diſtinct parts, as we do in <hi>Europe:</hi> But the Rains, which are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent there from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>November,</hi> and the great Droughts which reign all the reſt of the Year, make the only difference which may be obſerv'd between the Seaſons.</p>
               <p>Now how theſe different Conſtitutions and Temperatures of the Air ſhould be called, there is a great diverſity of Opinions. Some conſidering, that as in theſe Parts there is in a manner no <hi>Crepuſculum</hi> or Twilight (which is a certain competion of, or ſomthing between night and day) ſo neither is there any Spring or Autumn to make a certain connexion between Summer and a kind of Winter, which they admit there. Others maintain on the contrary, That there is no juſt reaſon that that part of the Year which goes under the name of Winter, ſhould be ſo called, in regard the Earth there is never cover'd with Froſt or Snow, which are the unwelcom attendants of Winter, but at all times cloath'd with a delightful Verdure, and almoſt in all ſeaſons crown'd with Flowers and Fruits, though in a different meaſure; whence they conclude, That the Year may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd into three different and equal parts, and thoſe be called Spring, Summer, Autumn; though not ſo eaſily diſtinguiſhable as haply they may be in ſeveral parts of the World.</p>
               <p>But the common expreſſion of thoſe people, who make up the Colonies now planted in theſe Iſlands, is not conſiſtent with this diſtinction; for they take the ſeaſon of the rains to be Winter, and that of the droughts, which is fair, clear, and pleaſant, to be Summer. 'Tis true, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Acoſta</hi> quarrels at the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58704:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for expreſſing themſelves in that manner, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe rainy moneths for Winter. He affirms, that the time of the drought and fair weather is the true Winter in all the Torrid Zone, becauſe then the Sun is at the greateſt diſtance from that Region; and on the contrary, that the ſeaſon of Rains and Miſts ought there to be called Summer, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the nearneſs of that Planet. To ſpeak properly and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, there is ſome reaſon we ſhould comply with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of <hi>Acoſta;</hi> yet inaſmuch as not only the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but alſo many other Nations, expreſs themſelves otherwiſe, we ſhall keep to their terms rather, eſpecially in a thing of ſo little conſequence.</p>
               <p>But how rainy ſoever this Seaſon may be in the <hi>Carribies,</hi> thoſe who have liv'd there ſeveral years affirm, that there hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſes a day, but the Sun is ſeen. The ſame thing is ſaid of the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> whence Antiquity dedicated it to the Sun, out of an imagination, that that Star had a particular care of it.</p>
               <p>The Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea is regulated in theſe Countries, as in our parts; but it riſes not above three or four foot at moſt.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of theſe Iſlands are cover'd with ſeveral ſorts of excellent Woods, which being green at all times, afford a very delightful proſpect, and repreſent a perpetual Summer.</p>
               <p>The Soil, in moſt places, is as rich and as pregnant as in any part of <hi>France;</hi> Inſomuch that all thoſe Iſlands that are inhabited give not the Inhabitants any occaſion to repent them of the pains they take. In which particular, they differ much from thoſe Countries of <hi>New-France,</hi> where the poor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages are ſo put to it to get their ſubſiſtance, that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, going out of their Hutts in the morning, and finding their Parents a hunting, are wont to cry out as loud as they can, <hi>Come Tatous; come Caſtors; come Orignacs;</hi> calling thus to the relief of their neceſſities thoſe creatures, which yet come not in their ſight as often as they ſtand in need thereof.</p>
               <p>The ſame inhabited Iſlands are alſo furniſhed with good ſources of freſh Water, Springs, Lakes, Brooks, Wells and Ciſterns, and ſome of them have fair Rivers. There are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſeveral places Mineral-waters, which are ſucceſsfully uſed, in order to the curing of divers Diſeaſes. Brimſtone is got out of the bowels of the Mountains in divers places; and the bright ſilver ſpangles which the Torrents and Rivers bring down along with them, and are found in the ſand, and the froth of their waters, after they have been over-flown, are certain <hi>indicia</hi> and diſcoveries, that there is Cryſtal to be had in them, and that there are alſo Mines of thoſe precious Metals, which are ſo much ſought after by moſt men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58704:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thoſe running waters, which deſerve the name of Rivers, are never dry'd up, even in the greateſt droughts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well ſtor'd with Fiſh, for the moſt part different from thoſe ſeen in <hi>Europe.</hi> But there is ſuch abundance on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſts, that the Inhabitants will hardly take the pains to fiſh in the Rivers.</p>
               <p>The Vine thrives very well in theſe Iſlands, and, beſides a wild kind of Vine they have, which grows naturally in the Woods, and bears a very fair and large Grape, there are in all the Inhabited ones great Gardens, with the Walks ſet about with Vines; nay in ſome places perfect Vine-yards, as thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> which bear twice a year, and ſometimes oftener, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cultivation beſtow'd on them, with reſpect had to the Moon and conveniency of the Seaſons. The Grape is excellent good, but the Wine made of it will not keep many days; and therefore there is but little of it made.</p>
               <p>As for Wheat, which grows in <hi>New-Spain</hi> as well as in any place of the World, it grows no further then the blade in the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> and is only for the making of Green-ſauce, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that Grain requires winter, and the ſoil there being too rank, it ſhoots forth too much at firſt, and there is not ſtrength enough left in the root to force it to ſtaulk and knit in the ear. But if tryal were made of the ſowing of Barley and Rye, and other Grains which require heat, its probable they would thrive well. And yet, ſhould they come to maturity, and with great increaſe, the Inhabitants, being at little trouble to get <hi>Manyoc, Potatoes, Turkey-wheat,</hi> and ſeveral kinds of Pulſe, would not take the pains to put them into the ground.</p>
               <p>All the natural Proviſions of theſe Iſlands are light, and of eaſie digeſtion; in regard the Country being hot, the ſtomack ought not to be burthened, as may be preſumed in colder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. Upon this account it is, that ſuch as are newly come into theſe parts are advis'd to eat little, and often. Nor doth what is eaten breed much blood, and therefore Phlebotomy is not much uſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe Iſlands are inhabited by four different Nations; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt are the <hi>Indigenae,</hi> or <hi>Originary Inhabitants,</hi> who have lived there time out of mind; and theſe are the <hi>Caribbians</hi> or <hi>Cannibals,</hi> of whom we ſhall give a perfect accompt in the Second Book of this Hiſtory. The other three are the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The eſtabliſhment of theſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations in thoſe parts happen'd about the year of our Lord one thouſand ſix hundred twenty five, ſince which time they have ſo encreas'd, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very numerous people; as will be ſeen more at large in the ſequel of this Hiſtory.</p>

               <p>THat we may obſerve ſome order in the Deſcription we intend of each of theſe Iſlands in particular, we ſhall divide them into three Claſſes; whereof the firſt ſhall comprehend thoſe which lye towards the South, and are neereſt the Line; the ſecond thoſe which lye Northward; and the laſt, thoſe which are commonly called the Lee-ward Iſlands, which reach Weſtward from St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> the beſt known of them all.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>TABAGO.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt, and moſt Southerly of all the <hi>Caribbies</hi> is <hi>Tabago,</hi> or <hi>Tabac,</hi> diſtant from the Equinoctial Northward eleven degrees and ſixteen minutes. It is about eight leagues in length, and four in breadth. There are in it ſeveral pleaſant Mountains, out of which ariſe eighteen Springs or ſmall Rivers, which, having drench'd the Plains, fall into the Sea. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the air of it would be healthy enough, if the Trees were cut down, and the ground opened.</p>
                  <p>The extraordinary height of the Trees growing in this Iſland argue the fruitfulneſs of its ſoil. There are in this the five kinds of four footed creatures, whereof there are but one or two in any of the other Iſlands. As 1. a kind of <hi>Swine,</hi> not much furniſh'd with briſtles, which have a certain hole on their backs. 2. <hi>Tatous. 3. Agoutis. 4. Opaſſums,</hi> and 5. <hi>Musk-Rats,</hi> all which we ſhall deſcribe in their proper place. Not to mention the Wood-Quiſts, Turtles, Partridges, and Parrats, which are commonly ſeen there, it affords abundance of other Birds, not known in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sea which encompaſſes this Iſland is abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with all ſorts of excellent Fiſh. Sea-Tortoiſes come in multitudes to hide their Egges in the ſand, which lyes on the ſhoars. On the Weſt and North ſide of it there are Bayes, where Ships may ſafely Anchor.</p>
                  <p>About ſixteen years ſince, a Company of Burghers of <hi>Walcre</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> ſent thither 200 men, to plant a Colony there, under the States-General of the United Provinces, and call'd the Iſland, the <hi>New-Walcre.</hi> But the natural Inhabitants of the Country, fearing the Neighbourhood of thoſe Foreigners, maſſacred ſome of them, which forc'd the reſt, who were troubled with ſickneſs and feared the treatment their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had receiv'd, to retire elſewhere. Whereupon the Iſland
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58704:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was along time deſtitute of Inhabitants, and frequented only by ſome <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who, coming and going to their Wars, ſtruck in there to get neceſſary refreſhments; as alſo by ſome French of the Iſlands of <hi>Martinico</hi> and <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> who came thither to fiſh for <hi>Lamantine</hi> and <hi>Tortoiſes,</hi> at certain ſeaſons of the year.</p>
                  <p>But now the <hi>Zealanders</hi> are re-eſtabliſh'd there, and about three years ſince <hi>Lampſen,</hi> an ancient Burgo-maſter of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and one of the States-General, ventur'd to people the Iſland anew. He brought thither, in his own Ships, ſeveral gallant perſons, who are likely reſtore the Colony which his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men had planted there before.</p>
                  <p>This Iſland lying next to the Continent of that part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> which lyes Southward, lyes very convenient for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the <hi>Arovagues,</hi> the <hi>Calibis,</hi> the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other <hi>Indian</hi> Nations; and the keeping together of a conſiderable force of men, which might be eaſily ſent over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Continent, and lay the foundations of a powerful Colony.</p>

                  <p>THe Iſland of <hi>Granada,</hi> lying at twelve degrees and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſcruples on this ſide of the Line, does properly begin the Semicircle of the <hi>Antilles.</hi> It is in length about ſeven leagues, the breadth not the ſame in all places, reaching North and South like a Creſcent. The French became maſters of it about ſix years ſince. They had at the beginning great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations with the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who, for ſome moneths, diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poſſeſſion of it with them by force of arms. But at laſt Monſieue <hi>Parquet,</hi> Governour of <hi>Martinico,</hi> who had reſolv'd, at his own charge, to make an eſtabliſhment there, oblig'd them, out of a conſideration of their own concernments, grounded principally on the great advantages they received from the Neighbourhood of the French, to leave him quietly poſſeſs'd of it.</p>
                  <p>The ground produces all manner of the Country proviſions, as Sugar-Canes, Ginger, and excellent Tobacco. The air is very healthy. It is well furniſh'd with Springs of freſh water, and places of good Anchorage for Ships. It hath alſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of fair Trees, ſome excellent for their fruit, others for their fitneſs for building. There is good Fiſhing all about it, and the Inhabitants have alſo good Fiſhing and Hunting in and about three little Iſlands, called the <hi>Granadines,</hi> lying North-Eaſt from it. The firſt Governour of this place was, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Le Comte</hi> Governour of <hi>Martinico,</hi> who was ſucceeded by Mon. <hi>dela Vaumeniere.</hi> It hath ſince been bought by the Count of <hi>Serillas,</hi> of Monſ. <hi>Parquet.</hi>

                  <p>THe Iſland of <hi>Bekia</hi> is diſtant from the Line twelve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 25 ſcruples. It is ten or twelve leagues about, and would be fruitful enough, if it were cultivated. There is in it a good Haven for Ships; but inaſmuch as it is not furniſh'd with freſh water, it is not much frequented, unleſs it be by ſome <hi>Caribbians</hi> of St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s, who ſometimes go thither a fiſhing, or to dreſs ſome ſmall Gardens they have up and down there for their diverſion.</p>

The <hi>Caribbians</hi> have many fair Villages, where they live pleaſantly, and without any diſturbance.

There is in the whole Iſland but one River, which truely deſerves that name: but the Countrey lying low and even, there are, in ſeveral places, Pools and Reſervatories of freſh water, which ſupply the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Springs and Rivers. Moſt houſes have alſo Ciſterns, and Wells which are never dry.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt Cultivation the Earth promiſed not much; but experience hath evinc'd the contrary, it plentifully producing Tobacco, Ginger, Cotten, and eſpecially Sugar-Canes, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, next to St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> it is the moſt frequented by Merchants, and the moſt populous of all the <hi>Antilles.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58704:9"/>
About the year 1646. they accounted in it about twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inhabitants, not comprehending in that number the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro-Slaves, who were thought to amount to a far greater.</p>
                  <p>There are many places in this Iſland, which may juſtly be called Towns, as containing many fair, long, and ſpacious Streets, furniſh'd with a great number of noble Structures, built by the principal Officers and Inhabitants of this flouriſhing Colony. Nay indeed, taking a full proſpect of the whole Iſland, a man might take it for one great City, inaſmuch as the houſes are at no great diſtance one from another; that many of thoſe are very well built, according to the rate of Building in <hi>England;</hi> that the Shops and Store-houſes are well furniſh'd with all ſorts of Commodities; that there are many Fairs and Markets; and laſtly, that the whole Iſland, as great Cities are, is divided into ſeveral Pariſhes, which have very fair Churches. The moſt conſiderable of the Inhabitants think themſelves ſo well, that it is ſeldom ſeen they ever remove thence.</p>
                  <p>This Iſland is very famous in all parts, by reaſon of the great abundance of excellent Sugar it hath afforded theſe many years. 'Tis true, it is not ſo white as that which comes from other parts, but it is better eſteemed by Refiners, becauſe it hath fairer grain and yields more, when it is purifi'd.</p>

                  <p>THe Iſland of <hi>Martinico,</hi> which the Indians call'd <hi>Madanina,</hi> lyes at the altitude of fourteen degrees and thirty ſcruples on this ſide the Line. It is about ſixteen leagues in length, of an unequal breadth, and about forty five in compaſs. The Soil of it is pleaſant, which makes it at this day one of the moſt populous of all the <hi>Caribbies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> are joyntly poſſeſs'd of it, and have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58704:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
liv'd a long time in very good correſpondence. Monſ. <hi>Parquet</hi> is the preſent French Governour of it.</p>
                  <p>Of all the <hi>Caribbies</hi> this is the moſt uneven Iſland, that is, the moſt full of Mountains, which are very high, and intermixt with inacceſſible Rocks. The fruitful parts of it conſiſt in certain round Hills or eminences; as alſo in very delightful ſkirts of Mountains, and ſome Plains or Valleys, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>The Mountains of it are not to be inhabited, and ſerve for the feeding and retreat of wild Beaſts, Serpents and Snakes, whereof there is great abundance. Yet are theſe Mountains well furniſh'd with wood, which, in bigneſs and length, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any in <hi>Europe,</hi> and bears fruit and food for the wild Boars and Birds.</p>
                  <p>As for the Hills and ſkirts of Mountains, they are for the moſt part, inhabitable; and of a good ſoil, but very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to manure. For ſome of them are ſo high and ſteepy, that people can hardly work on them without danger, or at leaſt without holding by a Tobacco-ſtalk, or ſome Tree with one hand, that they may work with the other.</p>
                  <p>The Tobacco which grows on theſe eminent places is ever the beſt, and eſteem'd above that which grows in the Valleys, and bottoms, which have not ſo much preſence of the Sun. For the Tobacco, which grows in bottoms, and places encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd with Woods, is ever full of yellow-ſpots, as if it were burnt, and neither takes well, nor keeps well. Theſe encloſed places are alſo unhealthy, and thoſe who work in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an ill colour, and the new-comers, who are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to that air, do ſooner, in theſe, then in any other places, catch that griping of the Belly, which is ſo common in theſe Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>There being two different Nations in this Iſland, it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly divided between them, to wit, the <hi>Indians,</hi> the natural Inhabitants of the Country; and the <hi>French,</hi> who laid the foundations of this Colony in <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1635. under the Conduct of Monſ. <hi>Deſnambuc,</hi> who brought them from St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> and left them in quiet poſſeſſion of this place.</p>
                  <p>That part of the Iſland which is inhabited by the Indians is comprehended in one quarter, which is called the <hi>Cabes-terre,</hi> without any other diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The part occupied by the <hi>French,</hi> and called <hi>Baſſe-terre,</hi> is divided into five quarters, which are by them called, <hi>La Caſe du Pilote, La Caſe Capot, Le Carbet, Le Fort St. Pierre,</hi> and <hi>Le Preſcheur.</hi> In each of theſe Quarters there is a Church, or at leaſt a Chappel, a Court of Guard, and a Magazine for Arms, about which are built ſeveral large and fair Store-houſes, both for the Commodities that are imported, and thoſe of the growth of the Iſland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58704:10"/>The Quarter of the <hi>Caſe du Pilote</hi> is ſo called from a Savage Captain, who had ſometimes lived there, and glory'd much in the name <hi>Pilot,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> had given him. He diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to Monſ. <hi>Parquet,</hi> the engagements which thoſe of his Nation entred into againſt him.</p>
                  <p>In the Quarter of <hi>Caſe Capot,</hi> there is a very noble <hi>Savanna,</hi> (thus they call in the Iſlands pleaſant Meadows and Paſtures) which hath, on the one ſide the River called <hi>Capot,</hi> and on the other, many fair Edifices.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Carbet</hi> Quarter hath its name from the ancient Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who ſometime had there one of their greateſt Villages, and a publick Houſe which they called <hi>Carbet,</hi> a name yet common to thoſe places, where they have their meetings. The French Governour liv'd in this Quarter a long time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving built a noble Brick-houſe, neer the Haven, in a pleaſant bottom, refreſh'd by a conſiderable River, which falls down out of the Mountains. The Indians, who never had ſeen Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of any ſuch material, look'd on it at firſt with a great aſtoniſhment, and having attempted to ſhake it, by the ſtrength of their ſhoulders, but not ſtirring it, they were forc'd acknowledg, that if all Houſes were ſo built, the Tempeſt which they call the <hi>Hurricane</hi> would not prejudice them. But ſince, the Governour not having his health perfectly there, he made a preſent of it to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> together with the Gardens about it, as alſo the rarities and curioſities of the Country, and ſeveral other habitations dependent on it, and a great number of Negro-ſlaves, who cultivate them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fort St. Pierre,</hi> or St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fort, is the place where the Governour now lives. There are in it ſeveral great pieces of Cannon, ſome of Braſs, ſome of Iron. This Fort commands all the Haven. About a ſtones caſt from the Governours, ſtands the fair Colledge of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> ſituate on a pleaſant River, which is thence called, <hi>The Jesuits River.</hi> This Structure is of Free-ſtone and Brick, very delightful to the eye. The Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues alſo want not their temptation, and, all about it, are Gardens and Orchards, producing whatever is moſt delicious of the growth of the Iſlands; as alſo ſeveral Plants, Herbs, Flowers and Fruits brought thither from <hi>France.</hi> There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Vine-yard, which yields yearly good ſtore of Wine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Le Preſcheur,</hi> or the Preachers Quarter, contains an even low part of the Country, very conſiderable for its extent, and ſeveral high Mountains, upon the ſkirts whereof, there are a good number of fair Habitations.</p>
                  <p>Between the <hi>Cabes-terre,</hi> and the <hi>Baſſe-terre,</hi> there is a kind of bottom, where is abundance of that Wood by which the Tobacco climes up. There they have alſo the Reeds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Hutts are Paliſado'd; as alſo the wild <hi>Mahot,</hi> the bark whereof ſerves for ſeveral things about the houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58704:11"/>Moſt of the Houſes in this Iſland are of wood, very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and delightful to the eye. The moſt conſiderable are built on certain eminences. That advantageous ſituation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes much to their health who live in them, for the air is clearer then that of the Valleys. It alſo adds much to the beauty of thoſe pleaſant Structures; and cauſes a very diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proſpect.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Haven of this Iſland lyes between <hi>Carbet</hi> and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Fort. It is more ſafe then any of the neighbouring Iſlands, as being encompaſs'd with high Mountains, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Ships lying in it from the violence of all winds.</p>
                  <p>Between <hi>Caſe du Pilote,</hi> and a bottom called <hi>Culde Sac des Salines,</hi> there is a Rock, running about half a league into the Sea, which is called the <hi>Diamond,</hi> from its figure, and is a retreat for an infinite number of Birds, and among others Wood-quiſts, which breed in it. It is hard getting up to it, yet ſome viſit it, as they paſs by, when the young ones are fit to eat.</p>
                  <p>There is another place on the ſame ſide as the <hi>Diamond,</hi> into which Ships are brought, to be refreſh'd, and mended. The Sea there is always calm, but the air not healthy, in regard the Sea-men commonly catch Fevers, which yet are not very dangerous, inaſmuch as they ſhake them off, as ſoon as they depart thence.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Torrents, which in times of rains fall down with great violence, and the inundations of this Iſland, there are nine or ten conſiderable Rivers which are never dry. Their ſources are at the aſcent or foot of the higheſt Mountains, and having watered the Valleys they fall into the Sea. They are prejudicial to the places neer them, in regard that when they overflow, they root up Trees, undermine rocks, and make a deſolation over the Fields and Gardens, carrying along with them, the houſes which lye in the plain Country, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever oppoſes the impetuoſity of their courſe. This inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience hath oblig'd the Inhabitants of this Colony to take up their habitations on the tops of thoſe little Mountains, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their Iſland is richly furniſh'd; for they ſecure them from theſe inundations.</p>
                  <p>But what is moſt conſiderable in this Iſland, is the multitude of the Inhabitants poſſeſſing it, who are thought to amount to nine or ten thouſand perſons, not comprehending in that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Indians and Negroes, who are neer as many. The mildneſs of the Government and the advantageous ſituation of the Iſland contribute much to the advancement of it and the multiplication of its Inhabitants. For moſt of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, bound for <hi>America,</hi> ſo order their courſe, that they may touch here, rather then at any other of the Iſlands: and as ſoon as they have caſt Anchor in any of the Havens, to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58704:11"/>
take in the refreſhments neceſſary for them, they ſet a ſhoar their Paſſengers, if they be not expreſly oblig'd to bring them to ſome other place. Nay it hath often hapned that whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which had left <hi>France,</hi> with a deſigne to paſs over into ſome of the other Iſlands which lye beyond this, and are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to it, either as to Air or Soil, being wearied out with the inconveniences of a long Voyage, have ſetled here to avoid expoſing themſelves to the ſame again.</p>
                  <p>Among the great multitude of people which make up this Colony, there are many perſons of worth and quality, who after their honorable imployments in other parts of the world, have at laſt made choice of this place, for their repoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. Among theſe are particularly to be mentioned Monſ. <hi>Courcelas,</hi> Lieutenant-General under the Governor, a perſon who by his excellent conduct hath gain'd the affections of both Inhabitants and Strangers; Monſ. <hi>Le Comte,</hi> and Monſ. <hi>de L' Oubiere,</hi> as being the principal Officers.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of our Deſcription of this Iſland, we ſaid, that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> lived there a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in good correſpondence. But the Letters that came thence lately, giving an account of the ſtate of it, affirm, that about four years ſince, the <hi>Caribbians</hi> made an inſurrection, and have continued a War with the French ever ſince; that ſince that time, thoſe Barbarians had done great miſchiefs in the French Quarters; and that neither the height of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, nor depth of the precipices, nor yet the horror of vaſt and dreadful ſolitudes, which till then had been accounted an impenetrable wall, lying between the ſeveral diviſions of both the Nations, hindred not their falling upon them, and filling their habitations with fire, maſſacres, deſolation, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the implacable ſpirit of revenge could ſuggeſt to them of greateſt cruelty, to feed their rage, and ſatisfie their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
                  <p>Of the occaſions of this Rupture there are ſeveral accounts given. Some attribute it to Monſ. <hi>Parquet</hi>'s eſtabliſhing of <hi>French</hi> Colonies in the Iſlands of <hi>Granada</hi> and St. <hi>Lucy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who thereupon took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diſcontent. Others affirm that they took up Arms, to revenge the deaths of ſome of their Nation, Inhabitants of the Iſland of S. <hi>Vincent,</hi> whom they believe to have come to their end by drinking ſome poiſon'd Strong-water which had been brought them from <hi>Martinico.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Immediately upon the breaking forth of this War, and the firſt devaſtations made by the <hi>Caribbians</hi> in one of the <hi>French</hi> Quarters (which, according to their cuſtom, was by a baſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe) thoſe who envy'd the glory of thoſe Colonies, and their progreſs and eſtabliſhment in thoſe Iſlands, ſcattered their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious reports, That the <hi>French</hi> would never be able to keep
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58704:12"/>
under thoſe Barbarians; That thoſe of the ſame Nation, who live in <hi>Dominico</hi> and S. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s, had ſecretly apply'd themſelves to all their Allies of the Continent, to incite them to engage in an unanimous War againſt the <hi>French;</hi> That the more eaſily to effectuate that deſign, and make their Party ſtronger, they had gone ſo far as to treat of a Peace with the <hi>Arovagues,</hi> their ancient Enemies; And, That they had ſo far engag'd all theſe Salvages in their Quarrel, that they were reſolv'd with a joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to fall upon the <hi>French,</hi> and over-run them with their multitude.</p>
                  <p>It is not certainly known whether there were really any ſuch Aſſociation againſt them or not; but certain it is, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>of it appear'd not; and that after the firſt Irruptions of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of <hi>Martinico</hi> into the <hi>French</hi> Quarters, which were indeed with ſome advantage of the Barbarians, they have been ſo unſucceſsful in their Enterpriſes ſince, and worſted ſo with the loſs of the chief amongſt them, that about two years ſince they were forc'd to quit their Villages, and leave their Gardens to the diſpoſal of the Victorious, and retire for ſafety into Woods, and inacceſſible Rocks and Mountains. So that the World is now perſwaded of the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That if thoſe Barbarians ſhall make any further attempt to recover themſelves out of that wretched Conſternation in which they live, by the force of Arms, they will in all likelyhood be forc'd either to quit the abſolute poſſeſſion of the Iſland to the <hi>French,</hi> or accept of ſuch Conditions of Peace as they can obtain, to renew the ancient Alliance, which they have been but too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to break.</p>

                  <p>This Iſland is inhabited by the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in it. They have a long time entertain'd thoſe who came to viſit them with a ſtory of a vaſt and monſtrous Serpent, which had its aboad in that bottom. They affirmed that there was on the head of it a very ſparkling ſtone, like a Carbuncle, of ineſtimable price; That it commonly veil'd that rich Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel with a thin moving ſkin, like that of a mans eye-lid; but that when it went to drink, or ſported himſelf in the midſt of that deep bottom, he fully diſcover'd it, and that the rocks and all about receiv'd a wonderful luſtre from the fire iſſuing out of that precious Crown.</p>
                  <p>The ſupream Perſon of this Iſland was heretofore one of the moſt conſiderable among thoſe of the ſame Nation.

                     <hi>GArdeloupe</hi> is one of the greateſt and nobleſt Iſlands of any poſſeſs'd by the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Caribbies.</hi> It was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by the Indians <hi>Carucueïra;</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave it the name by which it is now known. Some would have it preciſely at 16 Degrees; others add therto 16 minutes. The Circumference of it is about 60 Leagues, and, where broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, about nine or ten in breadth. It is divided into two parts by a little Arm of the Sea, which ſeparates the <hi>Grand'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre</hi> from that which is properly called <hi>Gardeloupe.</hi> The more Eaſterly part of this latter is called by the French <hi>Caebes-Terre,</hi> and that towards the Weſt <hi>Baſſe-Terre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That part of it which is called the <hi>Grand'-Terre</hi> hath two

Salt-pits, where the Sea-water is converted into Salt, as in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Iſlands, by the force of the Sun, without aſſiſtance of Art.</p>
                  <p>That part which is inhabited hath in ſeveral places, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards the middle of it, divers high Mountains, whereof ſome are full of bare and dreadful Rocks, riſing out of a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, encompaſſed with many inacceſſible Precipices; others are cover'd with delightful Trees, which are to them at all times a kind of pleaſant Garland. At the foot of theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains there are ſeveral Plains of a vaſt extent, which are refreſh'd by a great number of pleaſant Rivers, which occaſioned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships to touch there, to take in freſh water for the continuance of their Voyage. Some of theſe Rivers when they are overflown bring down pieces of Wood that have paſs'd through the Sulphur-mines, that are in one of the moſt remarkable Mountains in the Iſland, which continually caſts up ſmoak, whence it is called the <hi>Sulphur-Mountain.</hi> There are alſo in it Springs of hot water, which have been found by experience good for the Dropſie, and all Indiſpoſitions proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a cold cauſe. There are between theſe two parts of the Land two great Gulphs, whence thoſe Inhabitants who delight in Fiſhing may at any time take Tortoiſes, and ſeveral other excellent Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> firſt planted themſelves in this Iſland in the year <hi>M. DC. XXXV.</hi> M.

                  <p>Monſieur <hi>d' Howel</hi> is now Lord and Governor of this Iſland, which is yet better ſince his eſtabliſhment, for the number of the Inhabitants is much encreas'd, and they have built very fair Houſes, and brought ſuch Trading thither, that now it is one of the moſt flouriſhing and moſt conſiderable Iſlands of the <hi>Caribbies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are in it very fair Plains, wherein the ground is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Plough, a thing not to be ſeen in any of the other Iſlands. And after the Plough, it bears Rice, Turky-wheat, the <hi>Manioc,</hi> whereof <hi>Caſſava</hi> is made, <hi>Potatoes,</hi> nay, in ſome places Ginger and Sugar-canes, with great increaſe.</p>
                  <p>The reformed <hi>Jacobins,</hi> or <hi>White-Friers,</hi> are poſſeſs'd of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58704:14"/>
ſome part of the beſt Land in this Iſland, on which they have many delightful Plantations. The good condition wherein they are is to be acknowledg'd an effect of the care of the R. Father <hi>Raymond Breton,</hi> who, amidſt many great difficulties, preſerv'd them to his Order.</p>
                  <p>In that part of the Iſland, which is called <hi>Baſſe-terre,</hi> there is a little Town which grows daily bigger: It hath already ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Streets adorned with many handſome houſes of Timber, moſt of two Stories, of a convenient ſtructure and delightful to the eye. Beſides a fair Pariſh-Church, there are in it a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and a Monaſtery of <hi>Carmelites,</hi> brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lately by the Governors means; as alſo ſeveral Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, well furniſh'd with Proviſions and Commodities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the ſubſiſtance of the Colony.</p>
                  <p>The Governor lives in a Caſtle, not far from the Town. It is built four-ſquare, having at each corner Spurs and Redoubts of Maſons work, of ſuch thickneſs as to bear the weight of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Pieces of Braſs, which are mounted there. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beyond the Caſtle there is a very high Mountain which might ſomewhat incommodate it; but the Governor not omitting any thing that might contribute to the ornament or ſecurity of the Iſland, hath planted ſome great Pieces there, and to prevent ſurpriſe of an Enemy, he hath made a kind of Cittadel there, which is at all times furniſh'd with Proviſions and Ammunition. The <hi>Cabes-terre</hi> hath alſo a conſiderable Fort, which ſecures the whole Quarter; it is called St. <hi>Mary's</hi> Fort.</p>
                  <p>Many perſons of quality have made their retirement into this Iſland, and have ſet up a great number of Sugar-Mills.</p>

                  <p>It is ſubject to this annoyance, which is alſo common to the Iſlands of <hi>Antego</hi> and <hi>Mont-Serrat,</hi> that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minico,</hi> and other places, do many times commit great ſpoils in it.

It is not above ſix leagues about, and in the midſt of it there is but one only Mountain, which is very high, and cover'd with great Trees up to the very top. The Plantations are all about the Mountain, beginning from the Sea-ſide, till you come to the higheſt part of it, the aſcent being commodious enough. This Iſland may eaſily be compaſs'd either by land or water. There are in it divers ſprings of freſh water, whereof ſome are ſtrong enough to make their way to the Sea: Nay there is one ſpring, whereof the waters are hot and mineral. Not far from the ſource there are Bathes made, which are frequented with good ſucceſs, in order to the curing of thoſe diſeaſes for which the waters of <hi>Bourbon</hi> are recommended.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who planted themſelves there in the year <hi>M. DC. XXVIII.</hi> are ſtill the Inhabitants of this Iſland, and they are now thought to be between three and four thouſand men, who ſubſiſt and live handſomly, by the trade they drive in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Ginger and Tobacco.</p>
                  <p>This Iſland is the beſt governed of any in the <hi>Caribbies.</hi> Juſtice is there adminiſtred with great prudence by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, conſiſting of the moſt eminent and moſt ancient Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Colony: Swearing, Thieving, Drunkenneſs, Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and all diſſolutions and diſorders are ſeverely puniſh'd. In the Year <hi>M. DC. XLIX.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lake,</hi> a knowing perſon and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, had the Government of it. He is ſince departed this life.</p>
                  <p>There are in this Iſland three Churches, which have nothing extraordinary, as to Structure, but are very convenient as to the performing of Divine Service. For the ſecurity of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that are in the Road, and to prevent the invaſion of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, there is a Fort built, wherein are ſeveral great Pieces which command as far as the Sea. It ſecures alſo the publick Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, into which all the Commodities that are imported, and neceſſary for the ſubſiſtance of the Inhabitants, are diſpoſed. And thence it is, that they are afterwards diſtributed to thoſe private perſons who ſtand in need thereof, provided thoſe who have the over-ſight of them think them ſolvent perſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time and price agreed upon, and ordered by the Governor and Council.</p>
                  <p>A further recommendation of this Iſland, is, that it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided only by a ſmall arm of the Sea from that of St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> the nobleſt and moſt famous of all the <hi>Caribbies.</hi> Having given but a ſhort Deſcription of the other Iſlands, what we

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Iſland of St. <hi>Chriſtopher.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ST <hi>Christophers</hi> was ſo called by <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> who finding it very pleaſant, would needs give it his own name. He was engag'd to give it this name from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the figure of its Mountains, the Iſland having on its upper part, as it were upon one of its ſhoulders, another leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Mountain, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> is painted like a Gyant, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Saviour upon his, as it were a little Child. Its altitude is at 17 degrees, 25 minutes.</p>
               <p>It is about 25 leagues in compaſs. The Soil being light and ſandy, is apt to produce all ſorts of the Country Fruits, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many of the choiceſt growing in <hi>Europe.</hi> It lyes high in the midſt, by reaſon of ſome very high Mountains, out of which ariſe ſeveral Rivers, which ſometimes are ſo ſuddenly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown through the rains falling on the Mountains, ſo as that there is none ſeen at the extremities of them, or in the Plains, that the Inhabitants are many times ſurpriz'd by thoſe Torrents.</p>
               <p>The whole Iſland is divided into four Cantons, or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, two whereof are poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the other two by the <hi>French;</hi> but in ſuch ſort, as that people cannot croſs from one quarter to the other, without paſſing over Lands of one of the two Nations. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have in their part a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number of little Rivers then the <hi>French;</hi> but in requital, the latter have more of the plain Country, and Lands fitter for cultivation. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo exceed the <hi>French</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but the latter have more fortified places, and are better armed. The <hi>French</hi> have four Forts, well furniſh'd with great Pieces, which carry a great way into the Sea; and one of them hath regular works, like a Citadel. The moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable next that lyes at the Haven, or Anchoring-place, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Baſſe-terre.</hi> There is in both a conſtant Guard kept: And to prevent the differences which might happen between two different Nations, each of them upon the Avenues of their Quarters hath a Guard which is, renew'd every day. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have two fortifi'd places, whereof one commands the great Haven, and the other a Deſcent, not far from <hi>Pointe de Sable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Iſland is furniſh'd with a fair Salt-pit, lying on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which the Inhabitants commonly call <hi>Cul-de-Sac.</hi> Not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58704:16"/>
far thence, there is a ſmall Point of Land, which reaches out ſo far towards the Iſland of <hi>Nieves,</hi> that it is not above half a league of Sea between the two, inſomuch that there have been thoſe who have ſwam from one to the other.</p>
               <p>It is conceiv'd there is a Silver-mine in St. <hi>Chriſtophers;</hi> but in regard the Salt-pits, Woods, Havens, and Mines are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both Nations, no body looks after it: Beſides, ſuch an enterpriſe would require a great ſtock, and an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Slaves. The true Silver-mine of this Iſland is Sugar.</p>
               <p>A man may eaſily compaſs the whole Iſland by Land, but cannot paſs through the midſt of it, by reaſon of ſeveral great and ſteepy Mountains, between which there are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful precipices, and ſprings of hot water: Nay there are ſome ſprings of Sulphur, which hath occaſion'd one of them to be called, the <hi>Sulphur-Mountain.</hi> Taking the Circumference from without, the body of the Iſland ſeems to extend it ſelf, by a gentle deſcent, down to the Sea-ſide, and is of an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual breadth, according as the Mountains dilate their ſkirts more or leſs towards the Sea, or the more the Sea advances, and forces the land againſt the Mountains. The Soil, as far as it is cultivated, that is, to the ſteepy aſcent of the Mountains, is divided in a manner about into ſeveral ſtages or ſtories, through which there are drawn fair and ſpacious ways, in a ſtrait-line, as much as the places would permit. The firſt of theſe lines of communication begins at about a hundred paces from the Sea-ſide; another three or four hundred paces high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo aſcending to the third or fourth, whence a man may take a very pleaſant proſpect of all the Plantations from thence downwards.</p>
               <p>Every Stage, which makes a kind of girdle, or encloſure, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſſer about the Mountains, according to the greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer diſtance of it from the Mountains, hath alſo its ways, which like ſo many croſſing ſtreets afford an eaſie acceſs to thoſe who live higher or lower; and this with ſuch a noble ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that when a man compaſſes the Iſland by Sea, he cannot imagine any thing more delightful, then to ſee that pleaſing verdure of ſo many Trees, which are planted along the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and are the diviſions between the ſeveral Plantations. The proſpect is ſuch, that the eye can hardly be wearied with it: If it be directed upwards, it is terminated by thoſe high Mountains, which are crown'd with a perpetual verdure, and cloath'd with precious Woods: If downwards, it is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the delightful proſpect of Gardens, which taken in from thoſe places where the Mountains are inacceſſible, are thence by a gentle and eaſie deſcent continu'd to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. The delightful bright-green of the Tobacco, planted exactly by the line, the pale-yellow of the Sugar-Canes, when come to maturity, and the dark-green of Ginger and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58704:16"/>
Potatoes, make ſo delightful a Landſkip, as muſt cauſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary recreation to the unwearied eye. What very much adds to this delight, is, that in the midſt of every Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or Garden, there may be ſeen ſeveral fair houſes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtructures, particularly thoſe which are cover'd with red or glaz'd ſlate, contribute a greater luſtre to that pleaſant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective. And in regard there is a perpetual aſcent in the Iſland, the lower ſtage or ſtory deprives not the ſight of the pleaſure ariſing from the proſpect of that which lyes at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but a man may at one graſp of the eye, as it were in an inſtant, behold all thoſe delightful diviſions, all thoſe ways which look like ſo many walks of an Orchard, planted with ſeveral ſorts of Trees; all thoſe Gardens regularly beſet with divers Fruits; and all thoſe Edifices, which for the moſt part are not diſtant one from another above a hundred paces. In a word, ſo many agreeable objects offer themſelves to the eye, at the ſame intuition, that it is at a kind of loſs on which moſt to faſten it ſelf.</p>
               <p>There is indeed a certain neceſſity, for the greater conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Inhabitants, and eaſier managing of their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that their houſes ſhould be diſtinct one from another, and plac'd in the midſt of that piece of ground which they have to manure. The French, beſides the houſes they have thus diſpos'd at certain diſtances, have, in their Quarter of <hi>Baſſe-terre,</hi> a Town which grows bigger daily, and whereof the Houſes are of Brick and Timber. It lyes neer the Haven, where commonly Ships lye at Anchor. The moſt conſiderable of the Inhabitants, and Foreign-Merchants have Store-houſes there.</p>
               <p>The French and Dutch Merchants, who reſide there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, are well furniſh'd with excellent Wines, <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and Beer, all ſorts of Stuffes, of Silk, or Wooll, fit for the Country, and generally all the refreſhments, which being not of the growth of the Iſland, are yet neceſſary for the better accommodation of the Inhabitants. All is ſold at a reaſonable rate, and in exchange for the Commodities growing in the Country. In the ſame place live ſeveral ſorts of Trades-men, whoſe employments are neceſſary to Commerce and civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. There is alſo a Hall for the adminiſtration of Juſtice, and a fair Church able to contain a very great Congregation: The Structure is of wood, rais'd on a foundation of Free-ſtone: Inſtead of Glaſs-windows there are only turned Pillars, after the faſhion of a Balcony. It is cover'd with red Slate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Capuchins</hi> for ſome years had the overſight of the ſaid Church, and the charge of the Souls, as to the French, over the whole Iſland: but in the year one thouſand ſix hundred forty and ſix, they were diſengag'd from that employment by the unanimous conſent of the Inhabitants, who civilly diſmiſs'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58704:17"/>
them, and receiv'd in their ſtead <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Carmelites,</hi> who have very fair Houſes and Plantations, which are manured by a great number of Slaves belonging to them, through whoſe means they are very handſomly maintained. The R. F. <hi>Henry du Vivier</hi> was the firſt Superior of the Jeſuitical Miſſion.</p>
               <p>His Excellency the General hath alſo built a very fair Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, in a very healthy place, where ſuch ſick perſons as are unable to effect their recovery at their own houſes, are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and maintained, and viſited by Phyſitians and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till they are reſtored to their former health. Strangers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo who fall ſick in the Iſland are receiv'd in there. Order is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taken that Orphans be diſpos'd into convenient houſes, where they are brought up and inſtructed.</p>
               <p>There are many noble Structures built both by the the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and French; but the moſt magnificent of any is the Caſtle of the French General, the particular Deſcription whereof we ſhall nevertheleſs forbear, in regard it makes not much to the Natural Hiſtory oft he <hi>Caribbies.</hi>

               <p>Of the Engliſh building the moſt conſiderable are thoſe of the late Mr. <hi>Warner,</hi> firſt Governour General of this Nation; Mr. <hi>Rich's,</hi> his ſucceſſor; Mr. <hi>Everard's,</hi> and Col. <hi>Geffreyſon's,</hi> which may well be ranked among the moſt noble, and beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd of any in the <hi>Caribbies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Engliſh have alſo built in this Iſland five very fair Churches, well furniſh'd within with Pulpits, and Seats, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Joyners work, of precious wood.

               <p>ALL the Iſlands lying Weſt from St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Lee-ward Iſlands, inaſmuch as the conſtant wind of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> is an Eaſt-wind, with ſome point of the North, and that there is ſeldom any Weſt or South-wind. Of theſe there are nine principal ones, whereof we ſhall give an account in this Chapter, according to the order they are placed in the Map.</p>

                  <p>THe Iſland of St. <hi>Euſtace</hi> lyes North-Weſt from St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> at the altitude of ſeventeen degrees, and forty minutes. It is about five leagues in compaſs. To ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58704:17"/>
it is but a Mountain riſing up in the midſt of the Ocean, much like a Sugar-loaf, which is thought to be the figure of Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and the <hi>Pic</hi> of <hi>Teneriffe,</hi> ſave that the laſt named is incomparably higher. The Colony inhabiting it, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of about ſixteen hundred men, acknowledg the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the States-General, who have granted the Government of it to Monſ. <hi>Van Ree,</hi> and his Aſſociates, Merchants of <hi>Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in <hi>Zealand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Iſland is the ſtrongeſt, as to ſituation, of all the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> for there is but one good deſcent, which may be eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; ſo that a few men might keep off a great Army: But beſides this natural Fortification, there is in it a ſtrong Fort which commands the beſt Haven, the Guns of it carrying a good diſtance into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants have neat houſes, and thoſe well furniſh'd, as their Country-men have in <hi>Holland.</hi> Only the very top of the Mountain is cover'd with Wood; all the compaſs is manur'd. It can hardly be credited what quantities of Tobacco it hath heretofore and ſtill doth yield.</p>
                  <p>Though the top of this Mountain ſeems to be very picked, yet is there a kind of bottom of a large extent, affording a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to a great number of wild Beaſts. The Inhabitants are very induſtrious in keeping on their Lands all ſorts of Poultry, as alſo Swine and Conies, which breed exereamly.</p>
                  <p>There are no Springs in this Iſland; but there are now few Houſes but have a good Ciſtern to ſupply that defect: There are alſo Store-houſes ſo well furniſh'd with all things requiſite to life, and the accommodation of the Inhabitants, that many times they have wherewith to pleaſure their Neighbours. The Inhabitants live decently and Chriſtianly, and cannot juſtly be reproach'd with thoſe crimes which ſome have impos'd upon them. There is in the Iſland one Church, which hath from time to time been ſupply'd with very able Paſtors; of whom one was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>There is no freſh water in this Iſland, but what when it rains is receiv'd into Ciſterns, which are common enough.

                  <p>The Soil of this Iſland returns with good intereſt whatever is ſown in it: there are in it fair and ſpacious Plains, of a black earth, and eaſie to be manured: there are alſo ſeveral fair and precious kinds of Trees good for Dying and Joyners work. The Air is good, but the Waters not ſo wholſom, if drunk im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after they are drawn: To take away the ill quality they have, they are put to reſt a certain time in earthen veſſels, which makes them good; and thence it is conceiv'd that the bad quality proceeds from their mud, as is obſerved in thoſe of the <hi>Nile.</hi>

                  <p>OF <hi>Citrons</hi> there are three kinds, different as to bigneſs, and which conſequently are not all called <hi>Citrons.</hi> The firſt kind, which is the faireſt and largeſt, is called <hi>Lime:</hi> it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good to be preſerv'd, having very little juyce; but preſerv'd, it is excellent. The ſecond kind is the <hi>Lemon,</hi> about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Citron</hi> brought from <hi>Spain:</hi> but its juyce is little, in compariſon of its bulk. The little <hi>Citron,</hi> which makes the third kind, is the beſt and moſt eſteem'd: it hath a very thin ſkin or pellicle, and is full of a very ſharp juyce, which gives an excellent taſte to Meats, and a picquancy to ſeveral Sawces: it is a particular Fruit of <hi>America.</hi> Some curious perſons have in their Gardens a kind of very ſweet <hi>Citrons,</hi> both as to their peel and juyce, which as to bigneſs and taſte come not behind thoſe which grow in <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All other Trees growing in the <hi>Caribbies</hi> have their Leaves, Flowers, Fruit, and Bark, of a Figure, Taſte and Colour dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe of our Countries.</p>

                  <p>TO begin with the Fruit-Trees; there is ſome account made of the <hi>Goyavier,</hi> which comes neer the figure of the <hi>Laurel,</hi> ſave that the Leaves are ſofter, of a brighter green, and more cottened on the lower-ſide. The Bark of this Tree is very thin and ſmooth: It ſhoots forth at the roots ſeveral ſuckers, which if not taken away, will in time make a thick wood about it, as far as there is any good ground. Its branches, which are thick and well furniſh'd with leaves, are loaden twice a year with little white Flowers, which are follow'd by ſeveral green Apples, which become yellow, and of a good ſmell when they are ripe. This Fruit hath on the top a little poſie like a Crown, and the meat within is either white or red, full of little kernels, like thoſe of a <hi>Pomegranate;</hi> whence the Dutch call it the ſweet <hi>Pomegranate:</hi> It is about the bigneſs of a <hi>Pearmain,</hi> and ripens in one night.</p>
                  <p>Being eaten green, it is aſtringent: whence it is uſed by many againſt Bloody-Fluxes: but being ripe it hath a quite contrary effect.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>PAPAYER.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Papayer</hi> is a Tree which grows without boughs, about 15 or 20 foot high, big proportionably to its height, hollow and ſpongious within, whence it is uſed to convey Springs and Rivulets to diverſe places. There are two kinds of it; one commonly found in all the Iſlands. The leaves of it are divided into three points, much like the leaf of the <hi>Fig-tree:</hi> They are faſtened to long tails, as big as a mans thumbs, and hollow within. They ſhoot out of the top of the Tree, and bending downwards, they cover ſeveral round fruits, about the bigneſs of the great <hi>Quince-pear,</hi> which grow round the boal to which they are faſtened.</p>
                  <p>The other kind is particular to the Iſland of <hi>Sante Croix.</hi> It is fairer, and hath more leaves then the former: but what cauſes it to be more eſteem'd is its Fruit, which is about the bigneſs of a <hi>Melon,</hi> and of the figure of a womans breaſt, whence the <hi>Portugheſe</hi> call it <hi>Mamao.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is this particularly remarkable in theſe Trees, that they bring forth new fruits every moneth in the year. The flower of both kind is of good ſcent, and comes neer that of <hi>Jeſſemine.</hi> The Fruit of the latter is accounted among the choiceſt entertainments of the Iſlands, in as much as being come to perfection it hath a firm ſubſtance, and may be cut in pieces like a <hi>Melon,</hi> and is of a very pleaſant taſte. The rind is yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, intermix'd with certain green lines, and within it is full
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58704:20"/>
of little ſeeds, round, viſcous, and ſoft, of a picquant taſte, and approaching that of Spice. This fruit fortifies the ſtomack, and helps digeſtion.</p>

'Tis true, the Iſlanders commonly call it <hi>Coraſol,</hi> becauſe the ſeeds of thoſe they have was brought from <hi>Coraſol,</hi> an Iſland poſſeſs'd long ſince by the Dutch, who have there a good Fort, and a numerous Colony, which hath ſpred it ſelf into ſeveral other Iſlands neer it. This Fruit is like a little Cucumber not fully ripe; the rind of it is always green, and enamell'd with ſeveral ſmall partitions like ſcales: if it be gathered in its maturity it is within as white as cream, and of a mixture of ſweetneſs and ſharpneſs, which much heightens the taſte of it. This Fruit is extreamly cooling, and pleaſant to the palate: In the midſt of it lyes the ſeed, which is of the bigneſs and figure of a Bean, very ſmooth, and of the colour of a Touch-ſtone on which a piece of gold had been newly try'd; for it ſeems to ſparkle with little golden veins.</p>

The wood of it is ſolid, and in colour of a pearly grey. The Inhabitants cut down theſe Trees while they are yet young, to make ſtocks for Muskets and Fire-locks, in regard the wood being eaſie to be wrought, may be excellently poliſh'd. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moneth it is cloath'd with ſome new leaves: It bears a kind of Apples, which being ripe ſeem to have been baked in an Oven, about the bigneſs of an ordinary Apple: Falling from the Tree they make a noiſe like that of a gun diſcharg'd: which proceeds hence, that certain winds or ſpirits pent up in the thin pellicles which encloſe the ſeed, being ſtirr'd by the fall, force their way out with a certain violence. Whence it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it is the ſame Fruit which the Indians in <hi>New-Spain,</hi> by a barbarous name call <hi>Quant la Lazin.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Junipa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>apples</hi> eaten without taking away the little skin within them, are extreamly binding. This Fruit is much ſought after by Hunts-men, in regard that being ſouriſh it quenches thirſt, and comforts ſuch as are wearied by travelling.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58704:21"/>
The juice of it dyes a very dark Violet, though it ſelf be as clear as rock-water: nay when it is applied twice to the ſame part of the body which a man would dye, it makes the place appear black. The Indians uſe it to fortifie the body, and to make it more ſupple before they go to the wars. They are alſo of a perſwaſion that this colour renders them more terrible to their enemies. The tincture this Fruit gives cannot be taken away with Soap; but after nine or ten days it diſappears of it ſelf. The Swine which eat of this fruit when it falls off the Tree, have the fleſh and fat of a violet colour, as hath been found by experience. The ſame thing hath been obſerv'd in the fleſh of Parrots, and other Birds, when they have eaten of it. There may be made of theſe Apples a drink pleaſant enough, yet ſuch as is only us'd among the Indians and Hunts-men, who have no ſetled habitation.</p>

Under the bark of the trunk, having rais'd a white ſoft ſubſtance about two inches thick, a man finds a wood of a violet colour, ſolid, and fit for excellent pieces of Joyners work. It bears in its branches ſuch fruits, as when they are ripe might be taken for great violet Grapes; but in ſtead of kernels, every Grape hath under a tender pellicle, and under a very ſmall ſubſtance, which is a little ſowriſh, cooling, and of a good taſte, a hard ſtone like that of a Plumb.</p>

                  <p>THere are three kinds of Trees known by the name of <hi>Acajou;</hi> but of thoſe, only that we ſhall here deſcribe bears any fruit: 'Tis a Tree of no great height, ſpreading its branches down towards the ground: The leaves of it are fair and large, cloſing to a roundneſs before, and divided by certain veins. The flowers of it at the firſt ſhooting forth are white, but afterwards they become incarnate, and of a purple colour: They grow in tuffes and buſhes, and they ſend forth ſo ſweet a ſcent, that it is eaſie to diſtinguiſh the Tree which bears them: Theſe flowers fall not till they are thruſt off by a kind of <hi>Cheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,</hi> much after the form of an Ear, or a Hares kidney. When this <hi>Cheſtnut</hi> is come to its growth, there is fram'd under it a very fair Apple, ſomewhat long, which is crown'd with that as a creſt, which as it ripens becomes of an Olive-colour, while
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58704:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Apple puts on a thin delicate skin of a lively Vermilion. Within it is full of certain ſpungious filaments, which yield a kind of ſweet and ſharp juice extreamly good to quench thirſt, and accounted very good for the ſtomach, as alſo in ſwoonings and fainting, being qualifi'd with a little Sugar: But if it chance to fall on any Linen, it makes a red ſtain therein, which continues till ſuch time as the Tree brings forth new flowers.</p>
                  <p>The Indians make an excellent drink of this fruit, which being kept ſome days inebriates as ſoon as the beſt French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine would. The Nut which is above, burnt, yields a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick oyl, which is ſucceſsfully uſed to mollifie, nay to take away Corns, and the callouſneſs of the feet. If it be crack'd there is within a kernel, cover'd with a thin pellicle, which being taken away it is of an excellent taſte, and its vertue is to warm and extreamly to fortifie the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>This Tree bears but once a year; whence the Braſilians number their age by the Nuts growing on this Apple, laying up one for every year, which they keep very carefully in a little basket for that purpoſe. If an inciſion be made at the foot of this Tree there will come forth a clear and tranſparent Gum, which many have taken for that which is brought out of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia.</hi> The ſeed of the Tree is in the Nut, which put into the ground grows without any trouble.</p>

                  <p>THe ſecond kind is the <hi>Franc-Palm:</hi> It is a ſtrait Tree of extraordinary height. The roots of this Tree are above ground, round about the ſtock two or three foot high, and about the bigneſs of a Hogſhead: Theſe roots are ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the height of the Tree they ſuſtain; but they are ſo confuſedly ſhufled one within another, that they afford it a ſubſtantial ſupport. One thing particular to this Tree is, that it is bigger above then below: While it is young the bark is tender, of a dark-grey colour, and mark'd at every foots diſtance with a circle, which diſcovers very neer how many years it hath been in the ground: But when it is come to its full growth, it is all over ſo ſolid and ſmooth, that there is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58704:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing to be ſeen. The top of it is adorned with ſeveral fair branches chanell'd, and ſmooth, which have on each ſide an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of leaves, green, long, narrow and very thin, which add much to its beauty. The tendereſt of theſe branches, which are not yet fully blown, ſtart up directly from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Tree, while the others which bend downwards all about make it as 'twere a rich and beautiful crown.</p>
                  <p>This Tree diſburthens it ſelf every month of ſome one of its branches, as alſo of a bark which is looſned from below, which is four or five foot long, about two broad, and of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of tann'd leather. The Inhabitants of the Iſlands call this bark <hi>Tache,</hi> and they uſe it for the covering of their Kitchins, and other places belonging to their habitations, as they make uſe of the leaves neatly ty'd together in little ſheaves to cover their houſes.</p>
                  <p>We have purpoſely ranked the <hi>Palms</hi> among the Fruit-trees of theſe. Iſlands, in regard all of them, the <hi>Latanier</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, contribute ſomewhat to the nouriſhment of men. For if the <hi>Prickly-Palm</hi> before deſcribed, afford Wine, this bears on the top of its trunk, and as it were in its heart, a whitiſh mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or pith, very tender and ſavory, taſting like a ſmall Nut, if eaten raw, and being boiled, and ſeaſoned with the thin and white leaves which encompaſs it, and are as it were ſo much linen about it, it may be numbred among the moſt delicious diſhes of the <hi>Caribbies.</hi> The French call that marrowy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the leaves encloſing it, <hi>Chou de Palmiſte,</hi> Palm-Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, for they put it into the Pot inſtead of Cabbage, and other Herbs.</p>
                  <p>Cleave the trunk of this Tree in two, and take away, as may eaſily be done, a certain filiamental and ſoft matter, which lyes within, the remaining wood, which is by that means made hollow, and a good inch thick, makes excellent long gutters, which will laſt a great while. They are uſed alſo to cover with one piece only the roof of the <hi>Cazes,</hi> and to convey wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to any place. Turners and Joyners make of this wood, which is almoſt black and eaſily poliſh'd, ſeveral excellent pieces which are naturally marbled.</p>

                     <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of Trees ſo prodigiouſly high, that an arrow could not be ſhot over them: and the Author of the <hi>General Hiſtory of the Indies</hi> ſpeaks of a Tree ſo high that a man could not caſt a ſtone over it. But though the <hi>Palm</hi> we now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe much exceeds all the other Trees of the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> yet dare we not affirm it to be of ſuch an extraordinary height, ſince that from the foot of the Tree there may be eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a fair branch, which riſing out of the top of the trunk, is always turn'd towards the Sun-riſing.

which afterwards falling, their places are ſupply'd by certain round fruits, about the bigneſs of a ſmall Hens egge.

about ten pound. From the firſt bearing the Tree is never found without fruit, for it bears new every moneth.

It is encompaſs'd with a thick covering which is all of filaments.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Coco-nut</hi> is opened, there is firſt met with a meat, white as ſnow, which is extreamly nouriſhing, and taſtes like an <hi>Almond:</hi> There is ſo much of this marrowy ſubſtance in every fruit as may well fill an ordinary diſh.

It is only this water which is turned into ſeed, and among other vertues hath that of clearing the face of all wrinkles, and giving it a bright and Vermilion colour, ſo it be waſhed therewith as ſoon as the fruit is fallen from the Tree.</p>

                  <p>THere are few of the Iſlands but afford good Trees for the Carpenters and Joyners-Work. Of theſe one of the moſt conſiderable is the <hi>Acajou,</hi> which grows to that exceſſive height, that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> will of one trunk make thoſe long Shallops called <hi>Pyrages,</hi> which are able to carry fifty men. It ſhoots forth many branches which grow very cloſe together, by reaſon of the abundance of leaves they are loaden with. The ſhade of this Tree is very delightful; nay ſome affirm that it contributes to their Health who repoſe themſelves under it.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Acajou,</hi> which differ only in the height of the trunk, and colour of the wood. The wood of the moſt eſteem'd is red, light, of a good ſcent, and eaſily wrought. It hath been found by experience that it receives no prejudice from the Worm; that it rots not in the water when it hath been cut in ſeaſon; and that the Cheſts and Cabinets made of it communicate a good ſcent too, and ſecure the Cloaths kept in them from Vermine, which either breed in, or get into thoſe made of other wood. Hence ſome have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd it to be a kind of <hi>Cedar:</hi> There are alſo made of it Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles for the covering of Houſes. Some Maſters of Ships who Trade to the <hi>Caribbies</hi> many times bring thence Planks of this wood, which are of ſuch length and breadth that there needs but one to make a fair and large Table.</p>
                  <p>The other kind of <hi>Acajou</hi> is of the ſame figure, as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as that before deſcribed; but it grows not up ſo high, and the bark and pith taken away, the wood is white: Newly fell'd it is very eaſily wrought; but left abroad in the air, it grows ſo hard that there can hardly be any uſe made of it. The Inhabitants uſe it only for want of other, becauſe it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to worms, and putrifies in a ſhort time. If an inciſion be

But the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering imaginations of a return into the place of their birth, whereof moſt have their hearts full, induce them to a neglect of all thoſe conſiderable advantages which theſe Iſlands pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them withall, and an indifferency, if not a contempt, for that abundance of precious things which they ſo liberally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. For not to ſay any thing at preſent how eaſily they might makes Stuffes of the Cotton growing here; how they might keep all ſorts of Fowl, and tame Cattel, which breed there as abundantly as in any place in the World, they might, no doubt, enrich themſelves very much by ſeveral ſorts of precious wood, through the Trade they might drive into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince they think not fit to make uſe of them in order to the better accommodation of their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                  <p>Of theſe, as we ſaid before, the <hi>Roſe-wood</hi> is to be ranked among the chiefeſt. This Tree grows to a height proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable

to its bigneſs. The trunk of it is commonly ſo ſtrait, that it is one of the greateſt ornaments of the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Foreſts. It is cover'd with many fair boughs, and thoſe loaden with ſoft leaves, downy on one ſide, and neer as long as thoſe of a Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-tree. During the ſeaſon of the Rains it bears white flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of a good ſcent, which growing in buſhes, or as it were Poſies, add very much to the natural beauty of the Tree. Theſe flowers are follow'd by a ſmall blackiſh and ſmooth ſeed. The bark of the boal is of a whitiſh-grey: The wood within is of the colour of a dead leaf, and when the Smoothing-plane and Poliſher hath paſs'd upon it, there may be ſeen ſeveral veins of different colours, waving up and down, which gives it a luſtre, as if it were marbled: But the ſweet ſcent it caſts forth while it is handled and wrought cauſes it to be the more eſteem'd, and procur'd it the name it is now known by. Some have imagin'd, that that ſweet ſcent, which indeed is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant then that of a Roſe, ſhould have given it the name of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian-wood,</hi> and indeed in ſome parts of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> it paſſes under that denomination.

It is not inferior to the <hi>Roſe-wood,</hi> but grows big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and higher when it meets with good ground. The roots of it ſpread themſelves very deep into the ground, and the trunk is very ſtrait: The bark is ſmooth, thin, and even all over, of a bright ſilver-grey colour, and in ſome places inclining to yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which is a diſtinction between this Tree and all others: It flouriſhes once a year, in the ſeaſon of the Rains, and then it renews ſome part of its leaves. The wood of it is very ſolid and weighty, whence it comes that it may be poliſh'd, and ſome Savages make their Clubs of it. Having taken off a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion-pith which is under the bark, there appears the heart of the tree, which is extream hard, and of a Violet colour, for which it is much eſteemed by the curious.</p>
                  <p>The good ſcent of this tree conſiſts particularly in its leaves: they are of the ſame figure with thoſe of the <hi>Guava-tree,</hi> and when they are handled, they perfume the hands with a ſweeter ſcent then that of the <hi>Laurel:</hi> they derive to Meat and Sauces ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate a <hi>guſto,</hi> as might be attributed rather to a compoſition of ſeveral Spices, then to a ſimple leaf: It is uſed alſo in the Baths preſcrib'd by Phyſicians to fortifie bruiſed Nerves, and dry up

This tree, which may be ranked among the higheſt and beſt proportioned of any in theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iſlands, is well furniſh'd with branches, and thoſe with little leaves with ſharp points, and divided neer the ſtalk. It flouriſhes twice a year, to wit, in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> The flowers of it, which are of a Violet colour, are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a ſmall fruit about the bigneſs of a Cherry, which as it ripens grows black, and is much ſought after by the Birds. The bark of the trunk is of a browniſh colour: The wood is of a very bright red being newly fell'd, but lying abroad in the air it loſes much of its livelineſs and luſtre. The heart of the Tree is of a very dark red, like that of <hi>Braſil,</hi> and of ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the wedges muſt be very ſharp and well try'd before, to bring it to the ground.

                  <p>There is alſo another Tree known by the ſame name, but it is not comparable to the former: It bears only ſmall leaves, and when it flouriſheth, it is loaden with abundance of Poſies, as it were, riſing up above the branches like ſo many Plumes of Feathers, which give it an extraordinary ornament. It is of a great height, and the inner-bark is yellowiſh or white, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the places where it grows.

The Tree is very buſhy by reaſon its root ſhoots forth a great number of Suckers, which hinder it from growing ſo high and big as it might, if the ſap were directed only to the trunk. The leaves are ſmooth, and of a bright-green colour. Within the outer-bark there is about two inches of white inner-bark, and the reſt of the wood to the heart is of ſo dark a green that it inclines to black: but when it is poliſh'd, there appear certain yellow veins which make it look as if it were marbled.</p>

                  <p>The wood of this Tree is eaſily broken: It is very good for firing, and if the fire ſhould be quite out, it is only rubbing for a certain time two pieces one againſt another, and they will eaſt forth ſparks like a Fire-lock, which will ſet fire on the Cotton, or any other matter ſuſceptible thereof, that is laid neer to receive it.

the infirmities whereby they might be aſſaulted, and divers ſovereign Remedies for their recovery when they are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Not to make mention of any other part of the World, we may affirm it of the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> that they have all theſe rare advantages in a very great meaſure: For they do not only entertain their Inhabitants with a delightful variety of Fruits, Roots, Herbs, Pulſe, Wild-Fowl, Fiſh, and other delicacies for the Table, but they alſo ſupply them with a great number of excellent Remedies to cure them of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions. And this the judicious Reader may eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all through this Natural Hiſtory, and particularly in this Chapter, where we ſhall deſcribe the Trees which are very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Medicine.</p>

                  <head>CASSIA-TREE.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Caſſia-tree</hi> grows up to the bigneſs, and comes neer the figure of a <hi>Peach-tree,</hi> the leaves of it being ſomewhat long and narrow: They fall off once a year, in the time of the great Droughts, and when the ſeaſon of the Rain comes in, it puts forth new ones: They are preceded by ſeveral Poſies of of yellow flowers, which are ſucceeded by long Pipes or Cods about the bigneſs of a mans thumb, and ſometimes a foot and a half, or two foot in length: They contain within them, as in ſo many little Cells, that Medicinal Drug ſo well known to the Apothecaries, called <hi>Caſſia,</hi> which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> call <hi>Mali Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi> Before the fruit is grown to its full bigneſs and length it is always green; but as it advances to perfection and ripeneſs it becomes of a browniſh or Violet colour, and ſo continues, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the branches.</p>
                  <p>When the Fruit is ripe and dry, and the Trees which bear it are ſhaken by great winds, the noiſe cauſed by the colliſion of thoſe hard and long Cods ſtriking one againſt another is heard at a great diſtance: This frightens the Birds, and keeps them from coming neer it; nay ſuch men as are ignorant of the cauſe of that confuſed ſound, if they ſee not the Trees ſhaking, and ſtirring their branches and fruits, imagine themſelves neer the Sea-ſide, and think they hear the agitation of it, or take it for the claſhing of Arms in an Engagement of Souldiers. 'Tis the obſervation of all thoſe who have viſited that part of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo</hi> where there are whole Plains, and thoſe of a large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, full only of theſe Trees. It is thence, in all probability, that the ſeed of thoſe growing in the <hi>Caribbies</hi> was brought.

                  <head>MEDICINAL NUTS.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Medicinal Nuts,</hi> which are ſo common in all the Iſlands, grow on a ſmall Tree, which is for the moſt part uſed to partitions between the Gardens and Plantations. If it were not hindred from growing, it would come up to the height of an ordinary Fig-tree, which it ſomwhat reſembles in figure. The wood of it is very tender and pithy, and it ſhoots forth ſeveral bracnhes which ſcamble confuſedly about the trunk: They are loaden with pretty long leaves, green and ſoft, round below, and ending in three points.</p>
                  <p>Out of the wood and leaves of this Tree there comes a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky juice, which ſtains Linen: nay there is no pleaſure in being neer it when it rains, for the drops which fall from the leaves have the ſame effect as the juice: It bears ſeveral yellow flowers conſiſting of five leaves, which when they are fully blown look like ſo many ſtars. The flowers falling, there come in the places of ſome of them little Nuts, which at firſt are green, then turn yellow, and at laſt black, and a little open, when they are ripe. Within every Nut there are three or four ſtones, in ſo many little cells, the rind whereof is blackiſh, in bigneſs and figure ſomwhat like a bean. The rind being taken away, there is in every one of them a white kernel of an oily ſubſtance, which is incloſed and divided in the midſt by a thin film or pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licle: Theſe kernels are of a taſte pleaſant enough, not much different from that of Small-Nuts: but if they be not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately eaten they will violently purge both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, eſpecially if the ſkin which encloſes them, and the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licle dividing them in the midſt be ſwallow'd: To moderate their quality, and that they may be taken with leſs danger, the way is to cleanſe them of thoſe ſkins and pellicles, and put them for a little while upon the coals; then being beaten, or bruis'd, four or five of them may be taken in a little Wine, as a vehicle or corrective.</p>
                  <p>The boughs of this Tree being cut off and thruſt into the ground do eaſily take root. The <hi>Portuguez</hi> extract an oyl out of the kernels, which is good enough for the uſes of the Kitchin, and may alſo be uſeful in Medicine.</p>

                  <p>THe Tree which bears that kind of <hi>Cinamon</hi> which is ſo common in all the Iſlands, may be ranked among thoſe which are uſeful in Medicine, ſince its Aromatick Bark is ſought after by all thoſe who are troubled with cold diſtempers, and ſucceſsfully uſed to diſburthen the cheſt of the viſcous and phlegmatick humors which oppreſs it. The ſweet ſcent and perpetual verdure of this delightful Tree have perſwaded ſome that it was a kind of Laurel: but it grows much higher, its trunk is alſo bigger, its branches larger, and its leaves, which are not altogether ſo long, are much ſofter, and of a more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly green. The bark of it, which is cover'd by an Aſh-colour'd ſkin, is thicker, and of a whiter colour then the <hi>Cinamon</hi> which comes from the <hi>Levant:</hi> It is alſo of a ſharper and more biting taſte: but being dried in the ſhade, it gives a pleaſant taſte to Meats.</p>

This flower conſiſts of five leaves which are of a bright yellow colour, having towards the ſtem ſmall lines of a purple colour, and a yellow button or crown encompaſſed with little filaments of the ſame colour: The flowers are ſucceeded by a fruit of an oval figure, about the bigneſs of a ſmall Nut with its ſhell: when it is come to maturity it is all black on the out-ſide, and opens in three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, at which appears the whitneſs of the <hi>Cotton</hi> lying within that rough covering: there are in every of the fruit ſeven little beans, which are the ſeed of the Tree.</p>
                  <p>There is another kind of <hi>Cotton-tree</hi> which creeps along the ground like an unſupported Vine: this bears the beſt and moſt eſteemed <hi>Cotton:</hi> Of both there are made Cloths, and ſeveral cheap Stuffs, very uſeful in Houſe-keeping.</p>

                  <p>THere are two ſorts of Trees which the Iſlanders uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Soap:</hi> one of them hath this quality in its fruit, which grows in cluſters, round, yellowiſh, and about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſmall Plumb, which hath alſo a hard black ſtone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it that may be poliſh'd: It is commonly called the <hi>Soap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruit:</hi> the other hath the ſame vertue in its root, which is white and ſoft: both of them lather as well as any Soap; but the former uſed too frequently burns the Linen. Theſe Trees are called the <hi>Soap-trees</hi> from the vertue they have to whiten Cloaths.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Arched-Indian-Fig-Tree</hi> is a Tree thrives beſt in fenny places, and on the Sea-ſide: Its leaf is green, thick, and of a good length: the branches which bend down to the ground, no ſooner touch it but they take root and grow up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Trees, which afterwards produce others, ſo that in time they ſpread over all the good ground they meet with, which is by that means ſo hardly reducible to bear other things, that it will yield no profit: under theſe Trees the wild Boars, and other beaſts are ſecurely lodg'd. They are alſo in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places the lurking-holes of the Inhabitants of the Iſlands, who having garriſon'd themſelves within theſe Trees, defie all enemies: There is further this great advantage made of them, that there being no Oaks in theſe Iſlands, their bark is good for Tanners.</p>

               <p>IT hath pleaſed the great Contriver of all things to divide that Element, which we call Earth, into ſeveral Countries, each whereof he hath endued with certain advantages and conveniences not to be found in other places, that by ſuch a delightful variety of things he might make a more diſtinct and remarkable demonſtration of his own all-cheriſhing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. But it muſt be acknowledg'd, that in the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Divine Wiſedome hath made of its bounties, the <hi>Caribby-Iſlands</hi> have had a very large portion: For, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our ſelves to the deſign we intend to proſecute, not only the greater ſorts of Trees, which we have deſcribed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapters, contribute to the Shelter, Nouriſhment, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Health, and ſeveral other accommodations of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; but there are alſo divers ſhrubs, or leſſer Trees, which either ſhoot forth Roots, or bear Fruits conducing to the ſame purpoſe, as ſhall be ſeen in the peruſal of this Chapter.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>MANYOC.</head>
                  <p>INſtead of Wheat the Inhabitants make uſe of the root of a ſmall Tree called <hi>Manyoc,</hi> by ſome <hi>Manyot,</hi> and by others <hi>Mandioque,</hi> of which is made a kinde of Bread delicate enough, called <hi>Caſſava:</hi> whence it is alſo ſometimes called the <hi>Caſſava-tree.</hi> This root is ſo fruitful, that a ſmall parcel of ground planted therewith will feed more perſons then ſix times as much ſown with the beſt Wheat could do: It ſhoots forth crooked branches about the height of five or ſix foot, eaſie to be broken, and full of ſmall knots: the leaf is narrow and ſomewhat long: at nine moneths end the root comes to its maturity: Nay it is reported, that in <hi>Braſil</hi> it grows to the bigneſs of a mans thigh in three or four moneths. If the ground be not too moiſt the root may continue in it three years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corrupting, ſo that there needs no Store-houſe, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Garret to put it up in; for it is taken out of the ground as it is ſpent.</p>
                  <p>To propagate this Root, you muſt take of the branches, and cut them in pieces about a foot in length: then make trenches in your Garden with a Hoe, and thruſt in three of thoſe ſticks triangle-wiſe into the earth which had been taken out of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58704:30"/>
trenches, and wherewith a little hill or tump had been rais'd: this is called Planting by the trench. But there is another way of planting <hi>Manyoc,</hi> much more expeditious and more eaſie, but the <hi>Manyoc</hi> is neither ſo fair, nor ſo much eſteemed as the other. The way is only thus, to make a hole in the ground with a ſtick, and to thruſt the <hi>Manyoc</hi> ſtrait into it: care muſt be had in the planting of it, that the knots be not ſet down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for if they ſhould the <hi>Manyoc</hi> ſticks would not grow. The Indians never plant it otherwiſe; but that it may ripen in its ſeaſon, they obſerve a certain time of the Moon, and ſee that the ground be not too moiſt.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral kinds of theſe ſhrubs differing one from the other only in the colour of the bark of their wood and of their root: Thoſe which have the bark greyiſh, or white, or green, make a very good taſted bread, and grow up in a ſhort time; but the roots they produce do not keep ſo well, nor thrive comparably to thoſe of the red or violet <hi>Manyoc,</hi> which is the moſt common, the moſt eſteem'd, and the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous in houſe-keeping.</p>
                  <p>The juice of this root is as cold as Hemlock, and ſo effectual a poyſon, that the poor Indians of the greater Iſlands being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with fire and ſword by the Spaniards, to avoid a more cruel death, made uſe of this poyſon to deſtroy themſelves. There is to this day to be ſeen in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe call'd S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> a place called the <hi>Cave</hi> of the Indians, where there are the bones of above four hundred perſons, who ended their lives there with this poyſon, to avoid the cruelties of the Spaniards. But let this juice, which is ſo venemous to all ſorts of living creatures, reſt four and twenty hours after it is taken from the root, and it loſes that malignant and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality.</p>

                  <p>THere are in theſe Iſlands an infinite number of the ſhrubs called <hi>Palma-Chriſti</hi> or <hi>Ricinus;</hi> and they grow up ſo high, and ſo big in ſome places, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would be taken for a different kind from thoſe commonly ſeen in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Negroes gather the ſeed, and extract an oyl from it, wherewith they rub their hair to keep themſelves clear from vermine.

                  <p>There grow in all theſe Iſlands two kinds of ſhrubs, or rather great Reeds, ſpongy within, growing of themſelves in fat ground neer little rivulets, or in Valleys not annoyed by winds. They are commonly called <hi>Banana-trees,</hi> or <hi>Planes,</hi> and <hi>Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:58704:31"/>
or <hi>Apple-trees of Paradiſe:</hi> Theſe two kinds of ſhrubs have this common to both.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 That they grow of equal height, to wit about twelve or fifteen foot above ground.</item>
                     <item>2 That their ſtalks, which are of a green colour, ſhining, ſpongious, and very full of water, ſhoot out of a great Onion, like a Pear, encompaſs'd with many little white roots, which faſten it to the ground.</item>
                     <item>3 That they have ſhooting forth at the foot of the ſtems cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Scyons, which bear fruit at the years end.</item>
                     <item>4 That when one ſtem is cut off for the getting of the fruit, the moſt forward next that ſucceeds in its place, and ſo the ſhrub is perpetuated, and multiplies ſo exceedingly, that in time it ſpreads over all the good ground neer it.</item>
                     <item>5 That the ſubſtance of both is very ſoft, and reducible into water, which though extreamly clear, yet hath the quality of dying Linen and white Stuffs into a dark browniſh colour.</item>
                     <item>6 That their Fruits lye at the top of the ſtem, like great clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or poſies.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And laſtly, that their leaves, which are about four foot or more in length, and a foot and a half in bredth, may ſerve for Napkins and Towels, and being dried make a ſoft kind of Couch or Bed to lye upon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two ſhrubs have this further reſemblance, that which way ſoever their fruit be cut when it is come to maturity, the meat of them which is white as ſnow repreſents in the middle the form of a Crucifix, eſpecially when it is cut in thin ſlices. Hence the Spaniards are ſo ſuperſtitious as to think it a kind of mortal ſin to uſe a knife about it, and are ſcandaliz'd to ſee any thing employ'd about it but the teeth.</p>
                  <p>But there is this to be ſaid particularly of the <hi>Banana-tree.</hi>

                  <list>
                     <item>1 That its fruit is in length about twelve or thirteen inches, a little bending towards the extremity, much about the bigneſs of a mans arm: whereas that of the Fig-tree is but half as big, and about ſix inches in length.</item>
                     <item>2 The <hi>Banana-tree</hi> hath not in its poſie or cluſter above 25 or 30 <hi>Bananas</hi> at the moſt, which do not lye over-cloſe one to another; but the Fig-tree hath many times 120 Figs, which lye ſo cloſe together that they can hardly be gotten aſunder.</item>
                     <item>3 The meat of the <hi>Bananas</hi> is firm and ſolid, and may be dreſs'd either by roaſting it under the embers, or boiling it in a Pot with meat, or preſerv'd, and dry'd in an Oven, or in the Sun, and afterwards eaſily kept: But the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </list>
                  <p>To get in theſe fruits, the trees, which it ſeems bear but once, are cut at the very foot, and the great cluſter is ſupported by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

yellowiſh; for that is a ſign of their maturity, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried into the houſe, thoſe which were green ripen by degrees, and ſo they have every day new fruit.</p>
                  <p>The cluſter is commonly as much as a man can well carry; nay ſometimes it is laid on a Leaver, and carried upon their ſhoulders between two, as that bunch of Grapes which the Spies of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> brought out of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Some have thought this fruit ſo excellent and delicate, that they have imagined it to be the ſame which God forbad our firſt Parents to eat of in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> accordingly they have named it <hi>Adams Fig-tree,</hi> or the <hi>Fruit-tree of Paradiſe:</hi> the leaf of theſe Reeds being of the largeneſs we have before deſcribed, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be allow'd very fit to cover the nakedneſs of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and as to the figure of the Crucifix which may be ſeen within the fruit when it is cut, we leave it to find work for their profound ſpeculations who buſie their thoughts in ſearching out the ſecrets of Nature.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome who affirm that the figure of a Croſs is alſo marked in the ſeed of the Herb commonly called <hi>Rue.</hi> The ſmall <hi>Gentiana,</hi> or <hi>Cruciata,</hi> hath the leaves diſpos'd in the form of a Croſs upon its ſtalk; and it is to be acknowledg'd that Nature, as it were ſporting her ſelf, hath been pleas'd to make ſeveral ſuch repreſentations in Plants and Flowers. Hence it comes that ſome have the reſemblance of Hair, others of Eyes, others of Ears, others of a Noſe, a Heart, a Tongue, a Hand, and ſome other parts of the Body: There are in like manner divers famous Plants which ſeem to repreſent ſeveral other things, as Eagles, Bees, Serpents, Cats-clawes, Cocks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, Bears-ears, Harts-horns, Darts, and the like: whence many times thoſe Plants derive their names from the ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance.

                  <head>PYMAN.</head>
                  <p>THe Plant called by the French and others <hi>Pyman,</hi> or <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Pepper,</hi> is the ſame which the natural Inhabitants of the Country call <hi>Axi,</hi> or <hi>Carive;</hi> it grows cloſe like a little Briar without any prickles: the ſtem of it is covered with an Aſh-colour'd rind, and bears ſeveral little boughs loaden with an infinite multitude of leaves, which are pretty long, full of jags, and of a graſs-green colour: Of theſe there are three kinds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> differing only in the figure of the huſk or cod, or the fruit they bear. One bears only a little red button, ſomewhat long like a Clove, within which there are very ſmall ſeeds, much hotter then the Spices brought from the <hi>Levant,</hi> and in a manner cauſtick, which eaſily communicates that picquant qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to all things wherein it is us'd.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond kind hath a much larger and longer Cod, which when ripe is of a perfect Vermilion colour, and being us'd in Sauces, it makes them yellow, as Saffron would do.</p>
                  <p>The third hath yet a larger Cod then the precedent, which is thick enough, red as any Coral, and not ſmooth in all parts:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58704:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The ſeed, which is not ſo biting, nor ſo ſpicy as thoſe of the other two kinds, lies in the midſt of it: Being ripe it is one of the moſt delightful fruits that may be. The ſeed hath been brought over into <hi>France</hi> and other parts, and hath come to perfection; but the fruit is not ſo big as that of <hi>America.</hi> This cod and the ſeed within it is us'd inſtead of pepper, becauſe it communicates a certain picquancy to things, like that ſpice: But the operations of them differ much; for after it hath bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the tongue, and by its acrimony inflam'd the palat, inſtead of fortifying and warming the ſtomach, it weakens it, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes coldneſs in it; or rather, according to the opinions of ſome Phyſicians, it over-heats it, and by its cauſtick vertue weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens it, cauſing coldneſs in it only by accident, inaſmuch as it diſperſes the radical moiſture, which is the ſeat of heat. Whence it is obſerv'd in the Iſlands, that thoſe who ordinarily uſe it in their meat are ſubject to pains in the cheſt, and apt to contract a yellow colour.</p>

                  <p>All theſe kinds of Tobacco-Plants grow in the Iſlands to the height of a man and higher, if their growth be not check'd by cutting off the tops of their ſtems: They bear good ſtore of leaves, which are green, long, downy on the lower ſide, and ſeem in the handling as if they were oiled: Thoſe which grow towards the ſtock of the Plant are larger and longer, as deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more nouriſhment from the moiſture of the root. At

the tops they ſhoot forth little branches, which bear a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er like a ſmall Bell, which is of a clear violet colour: And when that flower is dry, there comes into its place a little button, wherein is contained the ſeed, which is of a brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, and very ſmall.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe <hi>Topinambous</hi> or Artichokes, which are now not only very common in moſt parts, but cheap, and ſlighted, as being a tteatment for the poorer ſort, were heretofore accounted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies: For in ſome extraordinary Entertainments made at

                  <p>But the <hi>Potatoe</hi> is infinitely beyond it: It thrives beſt in a light ground, ſomewhat moiſt, and well ordered: It ſhoots forth abundance of ſoft leaves, of a very dark green, in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure like thoſe of <hi>Spinage:</hi> They ſpring from certain fibres which creep along the ground, and in a ſhort time over-run the place where it is ſown. And if the ground be well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, theſe fibres within a certain time frame divers roots by the means of certain whitiſh filaments which ſhoot forth below the knots, and eaſily faſten into the earth. It bears a flower near the ſame colour with the root, and like a bell, within which lies the ſeed: But commonly to propagate this fruit they take only of theſe ſtrings or fibres, which lye ſcattered all over the ground, as we ſaid, and thruſt them into ground pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for them, and at the end of two or three months they will have produc'd their root, which hath this further ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that being cut into ſmall pieces, and thruſt into the ground, it produceth its root and leaf as effectually as if the ſeed lay in each of its leaſt parts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe roots are of ſeveral colours, and in the ſame piece of ground there will be ſome white ones, which are the moſt ordinary, ſome of a violet colour, ſome red as beet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots, ſome yellow, and ſome marbled: They are all of an excellent taſte: For, provided they be not full of water, and grew in a ground moderately moiſt and dry, that is, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating of both, they taſte like Cheſt-nuts, and are a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nouriſhment then the <hi>Caſſava,</hi> which dries up the body; for they are not ſo dry. Some, as particularly the Engliſh, uſe theſe roots inſtead of bread and <hi>Caſſava,</hi> and to that purpoſe bake them under the Embers, or upon the coals: For being ſo prepar'd they are of a better taſte, and are clear'd of that windy quality which is commonly obſerv'd to be in moſt roots. But for the moſt part they are boyl'd, or ſtew'd in a great iron pot, into which there is a little water put to keep the bottom from burning; then the pot-lid is ſet on as cloſe as may be, that they may ſtew by that ſmother'd heat. This is the ordinary treatment of the Servants and Slaves of the Country, who eat them out of the pot with a ſauce made of <hi>Pyman</hi> and juice of Oranges.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Ananas</hi> or <hi>Pine-Apple</hi> is accounted the moſt delicious fruit, not only of theſe Iſlands, but of all <hi>America.</hi> It is ſo delightful to the eye, and of ſo ſweet a ſcent, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be ſaid to have been extreamly prodigal of what was moſt rare and precious in her Treaſury to this Plant.</p>
                  <p>It grows on a ſtalk about a foot high, encompaſſed by about 15 or 16 leaves, as long as thoſe of ſome kinds of Thiſtles, broad as the Palm of a mans hand, and in figure like thoſe of <hi>Aloes:</hi> they are pointed at the extremity, as thoſe of <hi>Corn-Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> ſomewhat hollow in the midſt, and having on both ſides little prickles, which are very ſharp.</p>
                  <p>The fruit which grows between theſe leaves, ſtrait up from the ſtalk, is ſometimes about the bigneſs of a <hi>Melon:</hi> its figure is much like that of a <hi>Pine-Apple:</hi> its rind, which is full of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle compartiments like the ſcales of fiſh, of a pale-green co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, border'd with Carnation upon a yellow ground, hath on the out-ſide ſeveral ſmall flowers, which, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Aſpects of the Sun, ſeem to be of ſo many different colours as may be ſeen in the Rain-bow; as the fruit ripens moſt of theſe flowers fall. But that which gives it a far greater luſtre, and acquir'd it the ſupremacy among Fruit is, that it is crown'd with a great Poſie, conſiſting of flowers and ſeveral leaves, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and jagged about, which are of a bright red colour, and extreamly add to the delightfulneſs of it.</p>
                  <p>The Meat or Pulp which is contained within the rind, is a little fibrous, but put into the mouth is turn'd all to juice: it hath ſo tranſcendent a taſte, and ſo particular to it ſelf, that thoſe who have endeavour'd to make a full deſcription of it, not able to confine themſelves to one compariſon; have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd what they thought moſt delicate in the <hi>Peach,</hi> the <hi>Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> the <hi>Muſcadine-grape,</hi> and the <hi>Pippin,</hi> and having ſaid all they could, been forc'd to acknowledg that it hath a certain particular taſte which cannot eaſily be expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>The vertue, or ſhoot by which this fruit may be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated lyes not in its root, nor yet in a ſmall red ſeed, which is many times found in its Pulp, but in that Garland wherewith it is cover'd; for as ſoon as it is put into the ground it takes root, ſhoots forth leaves, and at the years end produces new fruit. It happens ſometimes that theſe fruits are charg'd with three poſies or crowns, all which have the vertue of propagating their ſpecies: but every ſtalk bears fruit but once a year.</p>
                  <p>There are three or four kinds of them, which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants diſtinguiſh by the colour, figure, or ſcent, to wit, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58704:34"/>
                     <hi>White-Ananas,</hi> the <hi>Pointed,</hi> and that called the <hi>Pippin,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette:</hi> This laſt is more eſteem'd then the other two, inaſmuch as being ripe it hath as to the taſte all the rare qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed; it hath alſo a ſweeter ſcent then the others, and does not ſet the teeth ſo much on edge.</p>
                  <p>The natural Indians of the Country, and the French who live in the Iſlands make of this fruit an excellent drink, not much unlike <hi>Malmſey,</hi> when it hath been kept a certain time: there is alſo made of it a liquid Conſerve, which is one of the nobleſt and moſt delicate of any brought out of the <hi>Indies:</hi> they alſo cut the rind into two pieces, and it is preſerv'd dry with ſome of the thinneſt leaves, and then the pieces are neatly joyn'd together again, and they ice it over with Sugar, by which means the figure of the fruit and leaves is perfectly preſerv'd; and there may be ſeen in thoſe happy Countries, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the heats of the Torrid Zone, a pleaſant repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſad productions of Winter.</p>
                  <p>In Phyſick the Vertues of it are theſe: The juice does ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably recreate and exhilarate the Spirits, and comfort the Heart; it alſo fortifies the Stomack, cureth Queaſineſs, and cauſeth Appetite: it gives preſent eaſe to ſuch as are troubled with the Stone, or ſtoppage of Urine; nay it deſtroys the force of Poyſon. If the fruit be not procurable, the root will do the ſame effects. The water extracted from it by diſtilling hath a quicker and more effectual operation; but in regard it is too corroſive, and offends the mouth, palat, and uretory veſſels, it muſt be very moderately uſed, and with the advice of an able Phyſician, who knows how to correct that Acrimony.</p>

It is call'd the <hi>Sugar-Cane,</hi> and grows up in height between five and ſix foot, and two inches about: it is divided by ſeveral knots, which are commonly four or five inches diſtant one from another; and the greater the diſtance is between the knots, the more Sugar are the Canes apt to yield.</p>
                  <p>The leaves of it are long, green, and grow very thick, in the midſt whereof riſes the Cane, which alſo at the top is loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſeveral pointed leaves, and one kind of knot of them which contains the ſeed: it is as full as it can be of a white and juicy pith, out of which is drawn that liquor that makes the Sugar.</p>

                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58704:35"/>It thrives extreamly in a fat ſoil, ſo it be light and ſomewhat moiſt: it is planted in trenches made at equal diſtances one from another, either with a Hoe, or a Plow, about half a foot deep: Having there laid the Canes, being ripe they cover them with earth, and a little while after out of every knot ſhoots forth a root, and out of that a ſtem which produces a new Cane. As ſoon as it appears above ground, it muſt be carefully weeded all about, that the weeds choak it not: but as ſoon as it hath cover'd the ground it ſecures it ſelf, and keeps its footing as well as any Copſe-wood might do, and it may laſt fifty years without being renew'd, ſo the main root be ſound and not injured by the worm; for if there be any jealouſie of that, the remedy is to take up the whole Plant as ſoon as may be, and to order it all anew.</p>
                  <p>Though the Canes be ripe at the end of nine or ten moneths, yet will they not be any way prejudic'd if continu'd in the ground two years, nay ſometimes three, after which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: But the beſt and ſureſt way is to cut them every year as neer the ground as may be, and below the laſt knot or joynt.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who croſs the Fields when theſe Canes are come to maturity may refreſh themſelves with the juice of them, which is an excellent beverage, and hath the ſame taſte with the Sugar: But if it be taken immoderately it may occaſion fluxes and looſeneſs, eſpecially to ſuch as are newly come into the Country; for thoſe who by a long abode there are in a manner naturaliz'd, are not ſo ſubject to that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>

In the ſeaſon of fruits there grows out of the midſt of this Plant a round flower, conſiſting of ſeveral leaves ſtanding much after the ſame order as thoſe of the Marigold; but they are of a bright violet colour, and being handled have a good scent; the nature of this Plant is ſuch, that if one pluck off the leaves of it, or ſo much as touch them, the whole Plant withers, and all the other leaves fall to the ground, as if it had been trod under feet; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the leaves that had been pluck'd off it will be a longer or ſhorter time ere it recover that loſs.</p>

                  <p>There is alſo another kind of living or ſenſitive Plant in ſome of the other Iſlands: it grows ſometimes to the height of a ſhrub: it hath many little branches, which are at all times loaden with an infinite number of long and narrow leaves, which during the rains are enamell'd with ſmall golden flowers, like ſo many ſtars. But what makes this Plant eſteem'd one of the rareſt and moſt admirable of any in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, that as ſoon as one would faſten on it with his hand, it draws back its leaves, and wriggles them under its little branches, as if they were wither'd; and when the hand is remov'd, and the party gone away ſome diſtance from it, it ſpreads them abroad again.</p>
                  <p>Some call this Plant the <hi>Chaſte Herb,</hi> becauſe it cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be touch'd without expreſſing its reſentment of the injury. Thoſe who have paſs'd by the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to <hi>Panama</hi> relate, that there are whole Woods of a Tree called the <hi>Senſitive-tree,</hi> which being touch'd the branches and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58704:37"/>
leaves ſtart up, making a great noiſe, and cloſe together into the figure of a Globe.</p>
                  <p>Some years ſince there was to be ſeen in the Kings Garden at <hi>Paris</hi> a <hi>Senſitive-ſhrub,</hi> valued at a very great rate: But ſome body having advis'd the putting of it in the bottom of a Well to keep it from the cold, and the ſharpneſs of Winter, it there miſerably periſh'd, to the great regret of the Curious.</p>

                  <p>THere is another Plant in theſe Iſlands famous for the beauty of its leaves, the ſweet ſcent of its flowers, and the excellency of its fruit: The Spaniards call it <hi>Grenadile;</hi> the Dutch, <hi>Rhang-Appel,</hi> and the French, <hi>La Fleur de la Paſſion,</hi> that is, <hi>The Paſſion-Flower,</hi> becauſe it bears that rare flower wherein may be ſeen, not without admiration, ſome of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Bleſſed Saviours Paſſion plainly repreſented. 'Tis true, ſome curious Perſons, who have attentively conſidered it do affirm, that they have obſerv'd therein a certain reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Crown of Thornes, the Scourges, the Nails, the Hammer, and the Pillar: but they add withall, that moſt of thoſe things are therein repreſented or figured much after the ſame manner as Virgins, Lyons, and Bears are ſeen among the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodies; ſo that to find all theſe repreſentations of the Paſſion in thoſe flowers, they ſay with <hi>Acoſta</hi> in his Hiſtory, <hi>Lib. 4. Ch.</hi> 27. that there is ſome piety requiſite to help on the belief of ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of them, all which have this common, that if they meet not with ſome Tree to faſten themſelves too, they creep along the ground as Ivy doth; that their flowers are diſplay'd after Sun-riſing, and cloſe again before it ſets; and that they bear a delicate and very refreſhing fruit: but the leaves, flowers, and fruits of ſome are ſo different, as to their outward figure, that it is not to be wondred if the Authors who treat of this Plant, imagining there had been but one kind, agree not in their deſcriptions thereof. The Inhabitants of <hi>Braſil</hi> number ſeven kinds thereof; but in the <hi>Caribbies</hi> there are but thoſe two known, which are repreſented among the Sculps of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>One hath very large leaves, which are divided into five leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer leaves, whereof that in the midſt is round at the top, and the four others pointed: its flower being fully blown is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a Roſe; it is enclos'd neer the ſtem in three little green leaves, the body conſiſts of ſeveral other beautiful leaves, whereof ſome are of a Sky-colour, chequer'd with little red pricks, which have the figure of a Crown, and others are of a purple colour: All this fair flower is encompaſs'd with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58704:39"/>
number of ſmall waving filaments, which are as it were the beams of this little Sun among the flowers; they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amell'd with White, Red, Blew, Carnation, and ſeveral other lively colours, which contribute an admirable grace thereto.</p>
                  <p>The other kind hath alſo its leaves divided into five parts as the former; but its flower, which is like a little bowl, border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above with little white and red ſtrings, is not ſo large: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is adorned with white pointed leaves: there ſhoots as it were out of the heart of both theſe kinds of <hi>Paſſion-Flowers</hi> a ſmall round Pillar, which hath on its chapter a button be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with three grains, ſomewhat like Cloves. From this Pillar there iſſue out alſo five white ſtrings, which ſupport little yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low knobs, like thoſe which may be ſeen in the cavity of the Lillies; and theſe they ſay repreſent our Saviours five wounds.</p>
                  <p>Theſe flowers, which are of a ſweet ſcent, falling off, the button that is on the pillar grows ſo big, that it comes to be a fair yellow fruit, ſmooth, and about the bigneſs of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Apple. The rind of it is as thick as that of a Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and it is full of a certain juice, very delicious to the taſte, among which there is a great number of kernels, which are black, and extreamly hard. This fruit is preſcrib'd as a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign refreſhment to ſuch as are in Fevers, and it hath been found by experience, that it hath a ſingular vertue to retrive loſt Appetite, to comfort the vital Spirits, and to abate the heat of the Stomack. The Inhabitants of <hi>Braſil</hi> are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the cultivation of this Plant, uſing it as a ſingular orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the covering of their Arbours, and other places in their Gardens; for its leaves and flowers make a very delightful ſhade, and they make of the fruit a cordial ſyrrup, which is highly eſteem'd among them upon this account, that beſides the properties aſſigned it in our deſcription, it hath alſo this remarkable quality, that thoſe who are once accuſtomed to uſe it ſhall never have an averſion againſt it.

               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Foreign kinds of Cattle, there were before in theſe Iſlands certain ſorts of four-footed beaſts, ſuch as are the <hi>Opaſſum,</hi> the <hi>Javaris,</hi> the <hi>Tatau,</hi> the <hi>Agouty,</hi> and the <hi>Musk-Rat,</hi> whereof we ſhall here give the ſeveral deſcriptions.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Opaſſum</hi> is the ſame creature which the <hi>Braſilians</hi> call <hi>Carigueya,</hi> about the bigneſs of a Cat: it hath a ſharp Snout, the neather Jaw being ſhorter then the upper, as a Pigs, the Ears long, broad, and ſtrait, and the Tail long, Hairleſs towards the extremity, and turning downwards: the Hair on the Back is black intermix'd with grey, and under the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and about the Throat it is yellowiſh: it hath very ſharp Claws, and thence doth eaſily climb up Trees: he feeds on Birds, and loves a Hen as well as the Fox does; but for want of prey he can make a ſhift to live on fruits.</p>
                  <p>What is particular in this Creature, is, that by a remarkable difference it hath a purſe or bag of its own ſkin, folded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under its Belly, in which it carries its young ones, which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58704:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it leaves upon the ground when it pleaſes, by opening that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural purſe: when he would leave that place, he opens it again, and the young ones get in, and ſo he carries them with him where-ever he goes. The Female ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Female commonly brings ſix young ones; but the Male, who hath ſuch another natural purſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Belly, carries them in his turn to eaſe the Female, but cannot ſuckle them. Theſe creatures are common in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and <hi>New-Spain:</hi> Nature having not thought fit to beſtow on the Whale the convenience of ſuch a bag, gave her the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hiding her young ones in her Throat, as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> affirms. And the Weaſil is ſo fond of her young ones, that out of a fear they might be taken from her, ſhe alſo takes them into her mouth, and removes them from one place to another.</p>

Some affirm, that their fleſh is a very delicate meat, and that there is a ſmall bone in their Tails which helps Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: It hath been confirm'd by experience, that it helps the Noiſe or Humming, and cures the pain of the Ear, being

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Reptiles found in theſe Iſlands.</head>
               <p>WE come now to treat of the <hi>Reptiles,</hi> which, being naturally enemies to cold, muſt needs exceedingly multiply in theſe hot Countries: Beſides, the vaſt Woods and the Rocks of theſe Iſlands very much advance their production, in regard they afford them ſecure retreats.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Several kinds of Serpents and Snakes.</head>
                  <p>THere are indeed very few venemous Beaſts in the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> though there be many Serpents and Snakes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colours and figures: There are ſome nine or ten foot long, and as big as a mans arm or thigh: Nay there hath been heretofore kill'd one of theſe Snakes, which had in her belly a whole Hen, feathers and all, and above a dozen egges, the Hen having been ſurpriz'd as ſhe was ſitting: Another was found that had devour'd a Cat; whence a gueſs may be made at their bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>But how prodigious ſoever they are, as to their bulk, yet are they not venemous in moſt of theſe Countries: Nay ſome Inhabitants having of them on the thatch of their houſes, which is commonly of Palm-leaves, or Sugar-Canes, drive them not thence, becauſe they force away and devour the rats. But we muſt acknowledge withal, that there is an hoſtility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Poultry. It hath been obſerv'd, that ſome of them have been ſo ſubtle, as, having ſurpriz'd a Hen ſitting, not to meddle with her during that time; but aſſoon as the chickens are hatch'd, they devour them, and kill the Hen, if they be not able to ſwallow her down whole.</p>
                  <p>There are others very fair and delightful to the eye; for they are green all over, ſave that under the belly they are of a very light grey: They are about an ell and a half in length, and ſometimes two; but, proportionably to that length, they are very ſmall, as being at moſt not above an inch about: They feed either on Frogs, which they find near ſome brooks, or on Birds, which they ſurprize on the Trees, or in their neſts, when they meet with them. Accordingly, this kind of Snake is accounted noble in compariſon of the others; for it ſubſiſts by its fiſhing and hunting. Some of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who have been us'd to ſee all theſe kinds of Snakes, handle them without any fear, and carry them in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms. Thoſe who have travell'd into <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affrick</hi> affirm, that they have there met with ſomewhat of the like nature:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58704:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For they relate, that in <hi>Great Tartary</hi> there are mountains where may be ſeen Serpents of a prodigious bulk, but not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous at all, nay they are good meat: And that in the Kingdom of <hi>Syr</hi> ſome of theſe Creatures have been ſeen playing with children, who fed them with bread. It is ſaid alſo, that in the Provinces of the <hi>Antes,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru,</hi> there are dreadful Snakes between 25 and 30 foot in length, which never hurt any body.</p>
                  <p>As to the Iſlands of <hi>Martinico</hi> and S. <hi>Alousia</hi> it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for there ſome are not dangerous at all, others are very much ſo: Thoſe which are not, are bigger and longer then the others; whence it comes, that thoſe who know them not are more afraid of them, then of ſuch as ſhould really be feared: Yet do they not any harm; nay aſſoon as they perceive any body, they make all the haſte they can away; which hath occaſion'd their being call'd the <hi>fugitive Snakes.</hi> They are alſo eaſily diſtinguiſh'd from the others by the black and white ſpots on their backs.</p>
                  <p>Of the dangerous Snakes there are two kinds: Some are grey on the back, and to the feeling like velvet; others are all yellow or red, and dreadful to look upon by reaſon of that colour, though they be not more dangerous, nay haply leſs then the former. Both kinds are great lovers of rats, as well as thoſe without venome; and when a Cott is much pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd with rats, 'tis ſtrange if there be not alſo Snakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. They are of different bigneſs and length, and it is conceiv'd the ſhorteſt are moſt to be feared: Their heads are flat and broad, their jaws extreamly wide, and arm'd with eight teeth, and ſometimes ten, whereof ſome are forked like a Creſcent, and ſo ſharp, that it is impoſſible to imagine any thing more: And theſe being all hollow, it is by that ſmall channel that they diſperſe their poyſon, which lies in little purſes on both ſides of their throat, juſt at the very roots of their teeth: They never chew any thing they eat, but ſwallow it down whole after they have cruſh'd and made it flat. Some affirm, that if they did chew their food they would poyſon themſelves, and that to prevent that they cover their teeth with their gums when they take their nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>Theſe creatures are ſo venemous in thoſe two Iſlands, that when they have ſtung any one, if there be not a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy immediately apply'd, the wound within two hours will be incurable. All the commendation can be given them is this, that they never ſting any one if he do not touch either them, or ſomething on which they repoſe themſelves.</p>

                  <head>LIZZARDS.</head>
                  <p>THere are alſo in theſe Iſlands ſeveral kinds of <hi>Lizzards:</hi> The greateſt and moſt conſiderable are thoſe which ſome <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Iguanas,</hi> the <hi>Braſilians, Senembi,</hi> and our <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Onayamaca:</hi> Being come to their full growth they are about five foot in length, meaſuring from the head to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the tail, which is as long as all the reſt of the body; and for their bigneſs they may be a foot about: their ſkins are of ſeveral colours according to the different ſoils they are bred in. Hence it is probably that the <hi>Portuguez</hi> have call'd them <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons,</hi> out of an imagination that they were a ſpecies of that creature. In ſome Iſlands the Females are of a light green, chequer'd with black and white ſpots, and the Males are grey: In others theſe laſt are black, and the Females of a light grey, intermixt with black and green: Nay in ſome places both Males and Females have all the little ſcales of their ſkin ſo glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and as it were ſtudded, that ſeen at a diſtance one would think them cloth'd in rich cloth of gold or ſilver: They have on their backs prickles like combs, which they force up, and let down as they pleaſe, and appear leſs and leſs from the head to the end of the tail: They go on four feet, each where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath five claws which have very ſharp nails: They run very faſt, and are excellent at the climbing of Trees: But, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that they love to look on men, or are of a ſtupid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſive nature, when they are perceiv'd by the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they patiently expect without ſtirring till they are ſhot: Nay they ſuffer to be put about their necks that gin with a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knot, which is faſten'd to the end of a pole that is often us'd to get them off the Trees where they reſt themſelves: when they are angry, a certain craw they have under their throat ſwells, and makes them ſeem the more formidable: Their jaws are very wide, their tongues thick, and they have ſome very ſharp teeth: they will hardly let go what they have once faſten'd on with their teeth, but they are not venemous at all.</p>
                  <p>The Females lay egges about the bigneſs of thoſe of Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſts, but the ſhell is ſoft: they lay them deep enough under the ſand on the Sea-ſide, and leave them to be hatch'd by the Sun, whence ſome Authors have rank'd them among the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibious creatures. The Savages taught the Europaeans the way to take theſe Lizzards, and by their own examples en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd them to eat thereof: They are very hard to kill, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that ſome having receiv'd three ſhots of a Gun, and thereby loſt ſome part of their entrails, would not fall: And yet if a ſmall ſtick be thruſt into their noſes, or a pin between their eyes, where there is a little hole into which the pin eaſily
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58704:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enters, they preſently dye: The <hi>Caribbians</hi> are very dextrous in the taking of them by a Gin with a running knot, which they cunningly get about their necks: or having overtaken them by running, they lay hold on them with one hand by the tail, which being very long gives them a good hold, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can turn back to bite them, they take them by the chine-piece of the neck, and then having turn'd their paws on their backs, they bind them, and ſo keep them alive above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days without giving them any ſuſtenance: Their fleſh is white, and in ſome places over-laid with fat: Thoſe who are accuſtomed to it think it very delicate, eſpecially the luſhious taſte it naturally is of being taken away by good Spices, and ſome picquant ſauce; yet is it not ſafe to eat often thereof, becauſe it over-dries the body, and abates ſomewhat of the good conſtitution thereof: the egges have no white, but are all yolk, which makes the Pottage they are uſed in as excellent as our Hens-egges might do.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe greater forts of Lizzards, there are in theſe Iſlands four others, which are much leſs; and theſe are called, <hi>Anolis, Roquets, Maboujats,</hi> and <hi>Gobe-monches,</hi> or <hi>Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catchers.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Anolis</hi> are very common in all the Plantations: they are about the bigneſs and length of the Lizzards ſeen in <hi>France;</hi> but they have a longer head, the ſkin yellowiſh, and on their backs they have certain blew, green and grey ſtreaks drawn from the top of the head to the end of the tail: their abode is in holes under ground, whence in the night time they make a very loud and importunate noiſe: In the day time they are in perpetual exerciſe, and they only wander about Cottages to get ſomewhat to ſubſiſt on.</p>

or ſlime, as the ordinary Snail does, but as ſoon as they are produc'd out of ſome corrupted matter, or otherwiſe, they have this inſtinct (to ſecure the weakneſs of their little bodies againſt the injuries of the air, and the attempts of other Beaſts) to ſeek out ſome empty habitation, and to take poſſeſſion of ſuch a ſhell as they find moſt convenient for them, within which they fit and accommodate themſelves, as Souldiers, who having no ſetled habitation take up their quarters in other mens houſes, according to their neceſſities, and the then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſture of their affairs.</p>
                  <p>They are commonly ſeen in the ſhells of Periwincles, or great Sea-Snails, which they find on the ſhore, whither they are caſt by the waves upon the death of the fiſh which had been the firſt inhabitant thereof: but indeed theſe little Souldiers are found in all ſorts of other ſhells caſt up by the Sea, nay even the ſhells of the <hi>Liene-nuts,</hi> and ſome have took up their quarters in the clawes of great dead Crabs. They have this further induſtry, that as they grow bigger they ſhift ſhells ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of their bodies, and take a larger, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they enter, quitting the former: ſo that they are of ſeveral forms and figures, according to the diverſity of the ſhells they poſſeſs themſelves of: It is probably of theſe <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> that <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks, under the name of a kind of ſmall Crab, to which he attributes the ſame properties: their bodies are very tender except their heads and clawes: they have inſtead of a foot, and for a defenſive weapon ſome inſtrument that is like the claw of a great Crab, wherewith they cloſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of their ſhells, and ſecure their whole body: it is all jagged within, and it holds ſo faſt whatever it faſtens on, that it takes away the piece with it. This Inſect marches faſter then the common Snail, and fouls not with its foam or ſlimineſs the place over which it hath paſs'd.</p>
                  <p>When this Souldier is taken he grows angry, and makes a noiſe: to make him quit the habitation he hath taken up, there needs only to ſet him neer the fire, and immediately he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his Quarters: if it be preſented to him to get into it again, he goes in backwards: when there are many of them met together with an intention at the ſame time to quit their former lodgings, and to take up new ones, which they are all much inclin'd to do, they enter into a great conteſtation, there happens a ſerious engagement which is manag'd with the ſaid claſping inſtrument, till at length the weaker is forc'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the victorious, who preſently poſſeſſes himſelf of the ſhell, which he afterwards peaceably enjoys as a precious conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Inhabitants eat of them, as the common Snails are eaten in ſome parts among us: but they are more fit for Phyſick then Food; for being got out of their ſhells there may

be extracted from them an oyl, which is excellent for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of cold Gouts, and is very ſucceſsfully uſed to mollifie the hard and callous parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>There are beſides, two other ſorts of ſmall Snails which are very beautiful: One is flat, after the faſhion of a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Bonnet, and of a dark colour: The other is ſharp, and turned like the Vice of a Preſs, and hath ſmall, red, yellow, or blew ſtreaks or lines, for which they are much eſteemed by the curious.</p>

                  <p>THere are in theſe Iſlands ſeveral kinds of great Flies of divers figures and colours: but we muſt aſſign the firſt place to thoſe which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Mouches Lumincuſes,</hi> and we may Engliſh <hi>Glo-wormes:</hi> Some Savages call them <hi>Cucuyos,</hi> and the <hi>Caribbians</hi> by a name not much differing from it, <hi>Coyou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you.</hi> This Fly is not recommendable for its beauty, or figure, as having nothing extraordinary as to either, but only for its <hi>luminous</hi> quality: they are of a dark colour, and about the bigneſs of a Locuſt: it hath two hard and ſtrong wings, under which are two leſſer wings very thin, which appear not but when it flies; and it is then alſo it may be obſerv'd that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe leſſer wings there is a brightneſs, like that of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which enlightens all about it: beſides, the eyes of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect are ſo luminous, that be it ever ſo dark, it flies any where in the night, which is the time that this glittering light may be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>It makes no noiſe flying, and lives only on flowers which it gathers off the Trees. Being taken between ones fingers, it is ſo ſmooth and ſlippery, that by the little endeavours it makes to recover its liberty, it inſenſibly gets away: Being kept in captivity it conceals all the light it hath under the wings, and communicates only that of its eyes, but even that very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in compariſon of the brightneſs it ſheds being at liberty: it hath no ſting, nor any claw for its defence: The <hi>Indians</hi> are glad to have of them in their houſes, for they ſerve them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Lamps: but indeed of their own accord, in the night time, they come into thoſe rooms which are not kept too cloſe.</p>
                  <p>There are in theſe Iſlands certain <hi>ſhining Worms,</hi> which alſo flie. All parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and all the other parts of the <hi>Levant,</hi> are alſo full of them.</p>
                  <p>But how famous ſoever theſe little Stars of the Eaſt may be, yet are they but ſmall ſparkles in compariſon of the great fire which theſe flying Torches of <hi>America</hi> caſt forth: For they do not only guide the Traveller by ſhewing him his way in the night, but with the aſſiſtance of this light a man may eaſily
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58704:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
write, and read the ſmalleſt Print that may be. A <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian relates, that the Indians of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> having theſe Flies faſten'd to their hands and feet, they ſerv'd them inſtead of Torches to go a hunting in the night time: it is affirmed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by others, that ſome other Indians extract that luminous liquor which theſe Flies have in their eyes and under their wings, and that they rub their faces and breaſts therewith in their nocturnal meetings, which makes them appear in the dark to the beholders, as if they were covered with flames, and like dreadful apparitions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Flies are eaſily taken in the night time; and that is done by turning a lighted ſtick in the air: For as ſoon as thoſe which at the cloſe of the evening are ready to come out of the woods perceive that fire, imagining it to be one of their companions, they immediately flye to the place where that light appears to them, and ſo they may be either ſtruok down with a Hat, or flying of themſelves againſt the lighted ſtick, they fall to the ground, not knowing where they are.</p>
                  <p>Nor will it be amiſs to inſert in this place what a learned and curious French Gentleman, one Monſ. <hi>du Montel,</hi> from whoſe generous liberality came ſeveral other remarks which enrich this Hiſtory, lately writ to a friend of his concerning theſe Flies.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Being in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> (ſaith he) I have often at the beginning of the night walk'd about the little Huts we had ſet up for our abode there while our Ship was repairing, to conſider how that the Air was in ſome places enlightned by thoſe little wandring Stars: But the moſt pleaſant ſight of all was, when they came neer thoſe great Trees which bear a kind of Figs, and were not far from our Huts; for ſometimes they flew about them, ſometimes they would be within the thick boughs, which for a time obſcur'd and eclips'd thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Luminaries; yet ſo as that their beams might ever and anon be ſeen to break through, though weakly, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed leaves: thoſe pretty interruptions of light came to us ſometimes obliquely, ſometimes in a ſtraight line, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly: Afterwards thoſe glittering Flies extricating themſelves out of the obſcurity of thoſe Trees, and coming neerer us, we had our pleaſure heightned by ſeeing them on the adjacent Orange-trees, which they ſeem'd to ſet a fire, gilding thoſe beautiful fruits, enamelling their flowers, and giving ſuch a luſtre to their leaves, that their naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful verdure was extreamly encreas'd by the pleaſant combination of ſo many little lights. I wiſh'd my ſelf at that time the Art of Painting or Drawing, that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a night enlightned, and as it were turn'd into day by ſo many fires, and ſo pleaſant and luminous a piece of Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkip.

                  <p>TO come to the other kinds of great Flies to be ſeen in theſe Iſlands, and which ſome call <hi>Phalanges,</hi> beſides the <hi>Cucuyos</hi> there are ſome that be much bigger, and of a ſtrange figure: There are ſome have two ſnouts like that of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, one turning upwards, the other downwards: Some others have three horns, one riſing out of the back, and the other two out of the head: The reſt of their body, as alſo their horns, is black, and ſhines like Jet. There are ſome have one great horn about four inches in length, much after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a Wood-cocks bill, very ſmooth on the upper ſide, and covered with a certain downineſs on the lower, which horn riſing out of their back reaches in a direct line to the head, on which there is another horn, like that of the horned Beetle, which is as black as Ebony, and tranſparent as glaſs: The whole body is of the colour of a wither'd leaf, ſmooth, and flouriſhed like Damaſk: their head and mouth are like thoſe of an Ape; they have two large, yellow, and firm eyes, a wide mouth and teeth like a little Saw. Hear what account our curious Traveller gives of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I have ſeen, ſaith he, one kind of theſe great Flies, which I thought extreamly beautiful: It was about three inches in length: the head of it was azure, not unlike that of a Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper, ſave that the two eyes were as green as an Emerald, and encompaſs'd by a ſmall white ſtreak: the upper ſide of the wings was of a bright violet colour, damaſk'd with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral compartiments of carnation, heightned by a ſmall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58704:48"/>
thread of ſilver: the compartiments were diſpos'd with ſuch an exact obſervance of Symmetry, that a man would think that the Compaſs and the Pencil had in the doing of it employ'd all the rules of Perſpective, and the Shadows of Painting: The neather part of the body was of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with the head, ſave that there were ſix black feet neatly bending towards the belly: When the wings, which were hard and ſolid, were ſpread abroad, there might be ſeen two other leſſer wings which were thinner then any ſilk, and as red as Scarlet. This kind of Fly I ſaw in the Iſland of <hi>S. Croix,</hi> in the cuſtody of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, and I immediately writ down this deſcription of it. I thought at firſt it had been artificial, becauſe of that lively Carnation colour, and the ſtring of ſilver; but having taken it into my hands, I acknowledg'd that Nature muſt certainly have been in an excellent good humor, and had a mind to divert her ſelf, when ſhe beſtow'd ſuch ſumptuous robes on that little Queen among the Inſects.</q>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58704:49"/>
which are of a ſolid matter, and of a black colour, ſo ſmooth and ſhining, that ſome curious perſons have them ſet in gold for Tooth-picks, and are highly eſteemed by thoſe who know they are endued with a vertue to preſerve from pain and all corruption thoſe parts that have been rubbed therewith.</p>
                  <p>When theſe Spiders are grown old they are covered all over with a ſwarthy Down, which is as ſoft and as cloſe as Velvet: their body is ſupported by ten feet, which are a little hairy on the ſides, and have below certain ſmall points like briſtles, which help them to faſten more eaſily on thoſe places up which they would climb: All theſe feet iſſue out of the fore-part of the Inſect, having each of them four joynts, and at the ends they are armed with a black and hard horn, which is divided into two parts like a fork.</p>
                  <p>They every year ſhift off their old ſkin as the Serpents do, as alſo the two tuſhes which ſerve them for teeth, and are their defenſive arms; thoſe who meet with theſe precious <hi>exuviae</hi> may therein obſerve the perfect figure of their body, ſuch as it is repreſented among the Sculps of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Their eyes are very little, and lye ſo deep in their heads that they ſeem to be only two ſmall points: they feed on Flies and ſuch vermine, and it hath been obſerv'd, that in ſome places their Webs are ſo ſtrong, that the little Birds caught in them have had much ado to get away: the ſame thing is affirmed of the Spiders which are found in the <hi>Bermudez,</hi> Iſlands inhabited by the Engliſh: It is probable they are of the ſame kind.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> have beſtow'd on them the name of <hi>Fregates, Frigots,</hi> becauſe of the continuance and lightneſs of their flight. Their body is about the bigneſs of a wild Drake's; but their wings are very much larger, and they make their way through the air with ſuch ſwiftneſs, that in a very ſhort time they will be out of ſight: There are ſeveral kinds as to their feathers; for ſome are all black, others all grey, ſave only the belly and wings, in which there are ſome white feathers: They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good at fiſhing; and when they perceive a fiſh lying even with the water, they fail not, yet as it were only ſporting themſelves, to ſeiſe it, and immediately devour it: They have a ſtrange dexterity in taking the <hi>flying Fiſhes;</hi> for as ſoon as they perceive that that delicate prey makes the water to riſe and bubble a little, and is juſt upon the taking of its flight, to avoid the cruel purſuits of its Sea-enemies, they place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo directly on that ſide on which they ſhould make their ſally, that as ſoon as they are out of the water they receive them into their Beaks, or Claws: So theſe innocent and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate fiſhes, to avoid the teeth of one enemy, many times fall into the claws of another who gives them no better quarter.</p>
                  <p>The Rocks which are in the Sea, and the little un-inhabited Iſlands are the places where theſe Birds make their abode and their neſts: The meat of them is not much eſteem'd; but their fat is carefully kept, it having been found by experience that it helpeth the Palſey, and all ſorts of cold Gouts.</p>

Under the belly, wings, and neck, it was of a waving Aurora-colour, the back and one half of the wings of a very bright ſky-colour, the tail and greater feathers of the wings were mixt with a ſparkling carnation, diverſify'd with a ſky-colour, as upon the back a graſs-green and a ſhining black, which very much added to the gold and azure of the other plumage: But the moſt beautiful part was the head, cover'd with a murrey down, checquer'd with green, yellow, and a pale blew, which reach'd down wavingly to the back: The eye-lids were

He had this quality of a dog, that he would lick with his ſhort and thick tongue thoſe who made much of him and gave him ſomething he liked, put his head to their cheeks to kiſs and careſs them, and expreſſing his acknowledgments by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pretty inſiouations, he would ſuffer himſelf to be put into what poſture one would, and took a certain pleaſure in diverting thoſe he thought his friends: But as he was mild and tractable to thoſe who were kind to him, ſo was he as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and irreconcileable to ſuch as had injur'd him, and he could diſtinguiſh them from others, and make them feel the ſharpneſs of his beak and claws.</q>

                  <p>If this Bird be miraculous as to his bulk and plumage, he is no leſs as to the activity of his flight, which is ſuch, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably the greateſt Birds make not their way through the air with ſo much force, and make not ſo loud a noiſe as this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Colibry</hi> does by the agitation of wings; for a man would think it a little whirle-wind rais'd of a ſudden in the air, and blowing in his ears: And in regard he takes a pleaſure to flye neer thoſe who paſs by, he ſometimes by his ſudden ſurpriſal frightens thoſe who hear him before they ſee him.</p>
                  <p>He lives only on the Dew which he ſucks from the Flowers of Trees with his tongue, which is much longer then his beak, and hollow as a ſmall reed, and about the bigneſs of a ſmall needle: He is very ſeldom ſeen on the ground, nor yet ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Trees, but ſuſpended in the air, neer the Tree whence he hath his nouriſhment: He is born up by a gentle agitation of his wings, and in the mean time he draws to him the dew which ſtays longeſt at the bottom of the flowers half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blown: 'Tis pleaſant to look on him in that poſture: For ſpreading abroad his little creſt, a man would think he had on his head a crown of Rubies, and all ſorts of precious ſtones; and the Sun adding ſomewhat to the natural luſtre of his plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage makes him look as if he were a compoſition of precious ſtones animated, and flying in the air: In thoſe places where there are moſt Cotton-trees is commonly the greateſt ſtore of <hi>Colibris.</hi>

                  <p>This miraculous Bird is not only extreamly delightful as to his colours, but there is one kind of it which having recreated the eye, ſatisfies alſo the noſtril by the ſweetneſs of his ſcent, which is like that of the fineſt Muſk and Amber.</p>
                  <p>He commonly makes his neſt under a ſmall branch of ſome Orange-tree, or Cotton-tree, and as it muſt be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſmallneſs of his bulk, he ſo covers it among the leaves, and ſo induſtriouſly ſecures it againſt the injuries of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is in a manner imperceptible: he is ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Architect, that to prevent his being expos'd to the Eaſterly and Northerly Winds, which are the ordinary winds in thoſe parts, he places his neſt towards the South: It conſiſts on the out-ſide of little ſtrings taken from a Plant called <hi>Pite,</hi> and wherewith the Indians make their cordage: Theſe little ſtrings or filaments are as ſmall as a mans hair, but much ſtronger: He ties them and weaves them one into another ſo cloſely about the little forked branch which he hath choſen for the perpetuation of his ſpecies, that the neſt being thus among the leaves, and hanging under the branch, is, as we ſaid before, both out of ſight and out of danger: Having made it ſtrong and fortifi'd it on the out-ſide with theſe filaments, and by ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bits of bark and ſmall herbs interlaced one within another by a miraculous artifice, he furniſhes it within with the fineſt Cotton, and the Down of certain little feathers ſofter then any ſilk: The Female commonly lays but two egges which are oval, about the bigneſs of a Pea or ſmall Pearl.</p>
                  <p>To what is aboveſaid we ſhall add the account given of it by our noble Traveller (<hi>du Montel</hi>) in his familiar Relations to a friend of his: <q>There are, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> ſometimes found the neſts of the <hi>Colibris</hi> under the branches of thoſe Plants of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco which are ſuffered to grow as high as they can for ſeed. I remember a Negro of ours ſhew'd me one of them, which was very neatly faſhioned, under one of thoſe branches: Nay being in <hi>S. Chriſtophers,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> ſhew'd me one of them, which was faſtened to one of the Reeds that ſuſtain'd the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of a Hut. I ſaw alſo one of theſe neſts, together with the egges, which was faſtened to a branch that had been cut off to adorn the Cloſet of a curious perſon, who had alſo the Male and Female dried and preſerv'd entire; and there it was that I attentively conſidered both the Neſt and Bird; and having admired the operations of Divine Providence in that little creature, how could I leſs then be aſtoniſh'd at the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Architecture of the Neſt, which though built with an unexpreſſible artificel, was nevertheleſs performed only with his little beak?</q>

                  <p>It might haply be here expected we ſhould ſpeak of the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Bird, and that having entertain'd the ſight with its beauty, and the ſmelling with its ſcent, it ſhould alſo ſatisfie the ear with its harmonious muſick: Some affirm that there is a kind of them that ſings at a certain ſeaſon of the year: But it is probable that what is called the ſinging of the <hi>Colibry,</hi> is only a little noiſe like that of the <hi>Cigale,</hi> which is always the ſame note. But though it ſhould not ſing at all, it is endued with ſo many other extraordinary advantages of Nature, that it may be ranked among the moſt beautiful, and moſt excellent of Birds.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have liv'd at <hi>Braſil</hi> do unanimouſly affirm, that there is in thoſe parts a little Bird called <hi>Gonambuch,</hi> of a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning white colour, whoſe body is no bigger then that of a Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and as to a clear and diſtinct note is nothing inferiour to the Nightingale: It's poſſible it may be a kind of <hi>Colibry,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome do make it; yet is it not comparable, either as to beauty of feathers or ſcent, and other tranſcendent qualities, to that whoſe deſcription we have here made.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe have come neerer the mark who have affirmed that this maſter-piece of Nature is a kind of thoſe little Birds, which ſome <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Guaraciaba,</hi> or <hi>Guacariga,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam,</hi> and <hi>Guaracigaba,</hi> that is, <hi>Hair of the Sun:</hi> The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> call it <hi>Tomineios,</hi> foraſmuch as having put one of them with his neſt into a pair of Scales wherewith gold is weigh'd, it commonly weighs not above two of thoſe little weights, which the ſame <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Tominos,</hi> that is, four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grains.</p>
                  <p>Some have been of opinion that ſome of theſe excellent <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libris</hi> were at firſt Flies, which were afterwards transform'd into Birds: Others have written that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> called theſe Birds <hi>Renati,</hi> or <hi>New-born,</hi> becauſe they ſleep one half of the year, as the Dormice do, and that they awake in the Spring, recovering as it were a new life with that delightful ſeaſon of the year: Nay there are ſome affirm, that when the leaves fall they thruſt their little beaks into the trunks of the Trees, and there remain immoveable, and as it were dead, for ſix moneths, till the earth puts on a new livery of flowers: But theſe are frivolous ſtories grounded on conjectures, which may be touch'd by the way, but not admitted to any competion with the true account we give of our <hi>Colibry.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Requiem,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Shark-Fiſh,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Sea-Dog</hi> or <hi>Sea-Wolf,</hi> the moſt devouring of all Fiſhes, and the moſt greedy of mans fleſh: He is much to be feared by ſuch as go a ſwimming: He lives altogether by prey, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly follows the ſhips to feed on the filth caſt out of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea. Theſe Monſters ſeem to be of a yellowiſh colour in the water: Some of them are of an unmeaſurable length and bigneſs, and ſuch as are able to cut a man in two at one bite: Their ſkin is rough, and there are made of it ſoft files to poliſh wood: Their heads are flat, and the opening of their mouth is not juſt before the ſnout, but under it: Whence it comes, that to faſten on their prey they are forc'd to turn their bellies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt upwards: Their teeth are very ſharp and very broad, being jagged all about like a Saw: Some of them have three or four ranks of theſe in each jaw-bone: Theſe teeth lye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the gums, but they make them ſufficiently appear when there is occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe cruel <hi>Sea-Dogs</hi> are attended by two or three ſmall fiſhes, and ſometimes more, which go before them with ſuch ſwiftneſs, and ſo regular a motion, that they either advance or halt more or leſs according as they perceive the <hi>Requiems</hi> do: Some call them <hi>Rambos,</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and the French Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the <hi>Requiems Pilots,</hi> inaſmuch as thoſe ſmall fiſhes ſeem to be their convoys: They are not much above a foot in length, and of a proportionable bigneſs: But their ſcales are beautified with ſo many pretty and lively colours, that it might be ſaid, they were encompaſs'd which chains of Pearl, Coral, Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, and other precious ſtones: A man can hardly be weary of looking on them in the water.</p>
                  <p>It is in like manner affirmed, that the Whale where-ever ſhe goes hath marching before her a little fiſh like a <hi>Sea-Gudgeon,</hi> which from that ſervice is called her <hi>Guide:</hi> The Whale fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him, ſuffering her ſelf to be led and turn'd as eaſily as the Rudder cauſes the Ship to turn about; and in requital of this ſervice, whereas whatever elſe enters into the horrid Chaos of this Monſters throat is immediately loſt and devour'd, this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fiſh makes it his retiring, and his reſting place; and while he lyes there a ſleep the Whale ſtirs not, but as ſoon as he gets out ſhe preſently follows him: and if it happen the ſaid fiſh ſhould be a little out of the way, ſhe wanders up and down, ſtriking many times againſt the Rocks, as a Ship without a Rudder; which thing <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms that himſelf was an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of in the Iſland of <hi>Anticyra.</hi> There is ſuch another friendſhip between the little Bird called the <hi>Wren</hi> and the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile;</hi> and that Shell-fiſh called the <hi>Naker</hi> lives in the ſame

                  <p>The meat of the <hi>Requiem</hi> is not good, and therefore not eaten, unleſs it be in caſe of great neceſſity: yet is it conceiv'd by ſome, that while they are young they may be tolerable meat. Some curious perſons do carefully ſave the Brains found in the heads of the old ones, and being dried they keep it, and they ſay it is very good for ſuch as are troubled with the Stone or Gravel.</p>
                  <p>Some Nations call this Monſter <hi>Tiburon</hi> and <hi>Tuberon:</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portuguez</hi> commonly call it <hi>Requiem,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Reſt,</hi> haply, becauſe he is wont to appear in fair weather, as the Tortoiſes alſo do, or rather becauſe he ſoon puts to reſt whatever he can take: His Liver being boiled yields a great quantity of oyl very good for Lamps, and the Skin of it is uſed by Joyners to poliſh their work.</p>

This Fiſh lives on the graſs and herbage that grows about the Rocks, and on the ſhallow places that have not much above a fathom of Sea-water. The Females are diſbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd of their young ones much after the ſame manner as Cows are, and they have two teats wherewith they ſuckle them: They bring forth two at a time, which forſake not the old one till ſuch time as they have no longer need of milk, and can feed on the graſs as ſhe does.</p>
                  <p>Of all Fiſhes there is not any hath ſo much good meat as the <hi>Lamantin;</hi> for many times there needs but two or three to load a great Canow; and this meat is like that of a Land crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eating ſhort, of a Vermilion colour, not cloying or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and mixt with fat, which being melted never grows mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: It is much more wholſom eaten two or three days after it hath been laid in ſalt then freſh: Theſe Fiſh are more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken at the entrance of freſh-water Rivers then in the Sea.

                  <p>ON the Coaſts of theſe Iſlands there is ſometimes taken by the Fiſhers a Monſter which is ranked among the kinds of <hi>Sea-Devils,</hi> by reaſon of its hideous figure: It is about four foot long, and proportionably big: it hath on the back a great bunch full of prickles like thoſe of a Hedg-Hog: The ſkin of it is hard, uneven and rugged, like that of the Sea-dog, and of a black colour: The head of it is flat, and on the upper part hath many little riſings, among which may be ſeen two little ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry black eyes: The mouth which is extreamly wide, is arm'd with ſeveral very ſharp teeth, two whereof are crooked and bent in like thoſe of a wild Boar: it hath four fins, and a tail broad enough, which is forked at the extremity: But what got it the name of <hi>Sea-Devil,</hi> is, that above the eyes there are two little black horns, ſharp enough, which turn towards his back like thoſe of a Ram: Beſides that this Monſter is as ugly as any thing can be imagin'd, the meat of it, which is ſoft and full of ſtrings, is abſolute poyſon; for it cauſes ſtrange vomiting, and ſuch ſwoonings as would be follow'd by death if they be not ſoon prevented by the taking of a doſe of good <hi>Mithridate,</hi> or ſome other Antidote.

                  <p>There is another kind of <hi>Sea-Devil,</hi> no leſs hideous then the precedent, though of another figure: The largeſt of this kind are not much above a foot in length from the head to the tail: They are almoſt as much in bredth; but when they pleaſe they ſwell themſelves up, ſo as that they ſeem to be round as a bowl: Their wide mouths are arm'd with many little but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp teeth, and inſtead of a tongue they have only a little bone which is extreamly hard: Their eyes are very ſparkling, and ſo ſmall, and deep ſet in the head, that the ball thereof can hardly be diſcerned: They have between the eyes a little horn which turns up, and before it a pretty big ſtring that hath at the end of it a little button: Beſides their tail, which is like the broad end of an Oar, they have two plumes, one on the back which ſtands as it were upright, and the other under the belly: They have alſo two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <p>This <hi>Unicorn,</hi> ſaith he, was purſuing a <hi>Carangue,</hi> or ſome other leſſer fiſh, with ſuch earneſtneſs and impetuoſity, that not conſidering that it needed a greater depth of water then the other, it ſtuck with half the body dry on a ſand-bank, whence it could not recover the deeper waters ere it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by the Inhabitants: It was about eighteen foot in length, being at the largeſt part of its body about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a great Barrel: It had ſix great fins like the ends of Galley-oars, whereof two were placed neer the gills, and the other four on the ſides of the belly at equal diſtances; they were of a Vermilion red colour: all the upper part of the body was cover'd with great ſcales about the bigneſs of a Crown-piece, which were of a blew colour intermixt with certain ſpangles of ſilver: neer the neck the ſcales were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and of a dark colour, ſeeming as it were a collar: The ſcales under the belly were yellow; the tail forked, the head ſomewhat bigger then that of a horſe, and neer the ſame figure: It was cover'd with a hard and dark colour'd ſkin; and as the Land-Unicorn hath one horn in his forehead, ſo this Sea-Unicorn had a very fair one iſſuing out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of his head, about nine foot and a half in length: it was as ſtrait as could be, and from the place whence it came out it grew ſmaller and ſmaller to the very point, which was ſo ſharp, that being thruſt hard it would enter into wood or ſtone, or ſome more ſolid ſubſtance: It was at the place where it came out of the head about ſixteen inches about, and from thence to two thirds of the length it was like a ſcrew,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58704:65"/>
or to ſay better, made waving like a wreath'd pillar, ſave that the channels grew ſmaller and ſmaller till they gently ended in a point, which was two inches beyond the fourth foot. All that lower part had over it an aſh-colour'd ſkin, which was all over cover'd with a ſmall ſoft hair, ſhort as pluſh, and of the colour of a wither'd leaf, but under that it was as white as Ivory. As to the other part, which ſeemed naked, it was naturally poliſh'd, of a ſhining black, marked with certain ſmall white and yellow ſtroaks, and of ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, that a ſharp file could hardly get a little ſmall powder from it. It had no ears ſtanding up, but two ſpacious gills, as the other fiſhes: The eyes were about the bigneſs of a Hens egge; the Ball, which was of a ſky-colour enamell'd with yellow, was encompaſs'd with a certain vermilion, which had beyond it another as clear as Chryſtal: The mouth was wide enough, and furniſhed with ſeveral teeth, whereof thoſe before were extremely ſharp, and thoſe towards the throat in both jaws were broad, and a little knobbed: The tongue was of a length and thickneſs proportionable, and covered with a rough ſkin of a vermilion colour. What was further remarkable, is, that this fiſh had upon the head a kind of crown, riſing above the ſkin about two inches, and made oval-wiſe, the extremities whereof ended in a point. Above three hundred perſons of that Iſland did eat of the meat of it, and that plentifully, and thought it extremely delicate: It was interlarded with a white fat, and being boiled it came up in fleaks like freſh Cod, but it had a much more excellent taſte.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who had ſeen this rare fiſh alive, and had with great Levers broken the back of it, affirmed, that he had made prodigious attempts to thruſt them with his horn, which he turned with an inexpreſſible dexterity and nimbleneſs, and that if he had had as much water under him as would have born him up, he would have been too hard for them all. When the entrails were taken out, it was found that he liv'd by prey; for there were within him the ſcales of ſeveral kinds of fiſh.</p>
                  <p>What could be preſerv'd of this miraculous Animal, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the head, and the precious horn faſten'd in it, hung up neer two years at the Guard-houſe of the Iſland, till Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Le Vaſseur,</hi> the Governour of it, preſented one Monſieur <hi>des Trancarts</hi> (a Gentleman of <hi>Xaintonge</hi> who had given him a viſit) with the Horn. Not long after, coming over in the ſame Ship with the Gentleman who had that precious rarity put up in a long Cheſt, our Ship was caſt away neer the Iſland of <hi>Fayala,</hi> one of the <hi>Aſſores,</hi> and all the Goods were loſt, but nothing ſo much regretted as the loſs of that Cheſt.</p>

               <p>There is in the Northern Seas another kind of Unicorns,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58704:65"/>
which are many times by the Ice carried to the Coaſt of <hi>Iſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> They are of ſo prodigious a length and bulk, that moſt Authors who have written of them rank them among Whales: They are not cover'd with ſcales as the formentioned deſcrib'd by us was, but with a hard black ſkin like the <hi>Lamantin:</hi> They have but two fins on both ſides, and a large plume upon the back, which being narrower in the midſt then at either end, makes as it were a double creſt riſing up for the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent dividing of the waters: they have three vent-holes a little below their necks, at which they caſt up the ſuperfluous water they had ſwallow'd, as the Whales do: their heads are ſharp, and on the left ſide of the upper jaw there comes out a horn white all over as the tooth of a young Elephant, which horn is ſometimes fifteen or ſixteen foot in length: It is wreath'd in ſome places, and ſtreaked all over with ſmall lines of a pearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, which are not only on the ſuperficies of it, but run through the ſubſtance: The horn is hollow to the third part, and all over as ſolid as the hardeſt bone.</p>
               <p>Some will have this prominency to be rather a tooth then a horn, becauſe it riſes not out of the forehead, as that we have ſpoken of, nor yet from the upper part of the head, as thoſe of Bulls and Rams, but out of the upper jaw, in which it is ſet, as the teeth are in their proper places: Thoſe who are of this opinion ſay further, that it is not to be wondred theſe fiſhes ſhould have but one ſuch tooth, when the ſubſtance out of which others ſhould be produced is quite exhauſted in the making of that one, which is of ſuch a prodigious length and bigneſs as might ſuffice to make a hundred.</p>
               <p>But whether this ſtrange defenſive wherewith theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous fiſh are armed be called Tooth or Horn, certain it is that they uſe it in their engagements with the Whales, and to break the Ice of the Northern Seas, wherewith they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times encompaſſed: Whence it came, that ſome times there have been ſeen of them ſuch as by reaſon of the violent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they have been in, in diſingaging themſelves out of thoſe icy mountains, have not only had their horns blunted at the point, but alſo ſhattered and broken off: The figures of both this kind and that caſt aſhore in the <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> Iſland may be ſeen among the Sculps.</p>
               <p>While we were ordering the foregoing ſtory for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Publick, a Ship of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> commanded by <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Tunes,</hi> wherein M. <hi>Lampſen,</hi> one of the Deputies of that Province, in the Aſſembly of the States-General, and other conſiderable Merchants of the ſame Town were concern'd, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in from <hi>Davis-ſtreight,</hi> brought thence among other rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſeveral excellent pieces of the Unicorns of the Northern Seas, of that kind we ſpoke of before; and in regard the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſent us of that Voyage may very much clear up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58704:66"/>
we treat of, we conceive the Reader will take it kindly to be entertain'd with it, aſſuring himſelf he hath it with the ſame ſincerity as it was communicated to us.</p>
               <p>The Captain of whom we have this Relation, leaving <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at the end of the Spring, 1656. with a deſign to diſcover ſome new Commerce in the Northern parts, arrived at the end of <hi>June</hi> following in <hi>Davis-ſtreight,</hi> whence having entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a River which begins at the ſixty fourth degree, and ten minutes of the Line Northward, he ſailed to the ſeventy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, under which the Country we intend to deſcribe lyes.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Inhabitants of the Country, who were then a fiſhing, perceived the Ship, they came towards it with their little Boats, which are ſo made as that they carry but one perſon: The firſt who attempted it occaſion'd the joyning of ſo many others to them, that in a ſhort time there was a ſquadron of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty of thoſe little veſſels, which parted not from the foreign Ship till it had caſt Anchor in the beſt Haven, where by their acclamations and all the ſigns of friendſhip and good will that could be expected from a Nation ſo far unacquainted with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, they expreſs'd the extraordinary joy they conceived at its happy arrival: Theſe little veſſels are ſo admirable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider their materials, or the ſtrange induſtry in the making of them, or the incomparable dexterity whereby they are conducted, that they may well be allow'd a place among the deſcriptions which this delightful digreſſion ſhall furniſh us with.</p>
               <p>They conſiſt of little thin pieces of wood, whereof moſt are cleft like Hoops: Theſe pieces of wood are faſten'd one to another with ſtrong cords made of the guts of fiſhes, which keep them together in a figure fit for the uſes to which they are deſign'd: They are cover'd on the out-ſide with the ſkins of Sea-Dogs, which are ſo neatly ſewn together, and ſo artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially done over with Rozin about the ſeams, that the water cannot make the leaſt entrance into them.</p>
               <p>Theſe little Boats are commonly about fifteen or ſixteen foot in length, and they may be in the midſt where they are biggeſt about five foot circumference; from that place they grow ſmaller and ſmaller, ſo that the ends or extremities of them are very ſharp and plated as it were with a white bone, or a piece of the Unicorns horn before deſcribed: The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part is flat and even, and cover'd with leather as the reſt, and the lower part is faſhion'd like the belly of a great fiſh; ſo that they are very ſwift upon the water: they have but one overture, or open place, which is juſt in the midſt of the whole ſtructure: It is rais'd a little about with a ſmall ledge of Whale-bone, and it is made fit for the reception of one man, ſo as that being in it, his waſte fills the hole. When the Savages who invented theſe kinds of Boats would make uſe of them,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58704:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either to go a fiſhing or to divert themſelves on the water, they thruſt down their feet and thighs in at the hole, and then ſitting down they ſo faſten the ſhort Coat they have about them to the ledge which is about the hole, that they ſeem to be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into the little veſſel, and to be part of it.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the figure and materials of theſe little veſſels; let us now conſider the accoutrement of the men who have the conduct of them: When they intend to go to Sea, they put over their other cloths a certain ſhort coat, which is kept only for that purpoſe: This Sea-coat conſiſts of ſeveral ſkins having the hair taken off, which are well dreſs'd and ſet together, that a man would think it to be all of a piece: It reaches from the crown of the head to the Navel: it is rubb'd over with a blackiſh gum, which is not diſſolved in the water, and keeps it from paſſing through; That <hi>Capuchon</hi> or part of it which comes over the head, comes ſo cloſe under the neck and upon the forehead, that it leaves nothing but the face open: The ſleeves are ty'd at the wriſt, and the lower part of the coat is faſten'd to the ledge, about the hole of the veſſel, with ſo much care and induſtry, that the body thus covered is always dry in the midſt of the waves, which with all their toſſing can wet only the face and the hands.</p>
               <p>Though they have neither Sail, nor Maſt, nor Rudder, nor Compaſs, nor Anchor, nor any thing of all thoſe conveniences which are requiſite to make our Ships fit for the Sea; yet will they undertake long voyages with theſe ſmall veſſels, upon which they ſeem to be ſewn: they have an experienc'd know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Stars, and need no other guide in the night time: The Oars they uſe are broad at both ends like a Chirurgeons palet, and that they may the more eaſily make their way through the waves, and laſt the longer, they tip them with a white bone which covers the edges of the wood; which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament they faſten with pins of horn, which they uſe inſtead of nails: The middle of theſe Oars is beautifi'd with a bone or precious horn, as well the ends, and by that place they hold them that they may not ſlip out of their hands: They handle theſe double Oars with ſuch dexterity and nimbleneſs, that theſe ſmall veſſels will out-run Ships that have all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſails, wind, and tide: They are ſo confident in them, and ſo vers'd in the guiding of them, that they ſhew a thouſand tricks in them, for the divertiſement of the beholders: Nay ſometimes they will raiſe ſuch waves, that the water will be all foamy, as if there had been a great tempeſt; and then they ſeem rather like Sea-monſters courſing one another then men: And to make it appear they fear not dangers, and that they hold a good correſpondence with that Element which feeds them, they ſhew ſeverall tricks, diving and rouling themſelves in the Sea three or four times together; ſo that they may be taken for perfect <hi>Amphibia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:58704:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>When they intend to take voyages longer then ordinary, or are afraid to be driven far into the Sea by ſome Tempeſt, they take with them in the hollow place of their veſſel a bladder full of fair water to quench their thirſt, and fiſh dry'd in the Sun or Froſt to eat inſtead of freſh meat: But they are ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the neceſſity of uſing thoſe proviſions; For they have certain Darts like little Lances, which are faſten'd to their Boats; theſe they ſo dextrouſly caſt at the fiſh they meet with, that they are very ſeldom deſtitute of theſe refreſhments: They need no fire to dreſs their meat, for on the Land, as well as at Sea, they are wont to eat it raw: They alſo carry along with them the teeth of certain great fiſhes, or pieces of ſharp bones, which ſerve them for knives to dreſs and cut the fiſh they take: Beſides, another advantage of theſe veſſels is, that there can happen no mutiny in them, ſince one and the ſame perſon is Maſter, Mariner, Purſer and Pilot of it, who may ſtop it when he pleaſes, or let go with the wind &amp; water, when he would take the reſt neceſſary to retrive his ſpent forces: In this caſe he faſtens his Oar to certain ſtraps of Hart-ſkin deſign'd for that purpoſe, which are faſtened to the Boat, or elſe he ties it to a buckle which hangs before on his coat.</p>
               <p>The Women have not the uſe of theſe little Boats; but that they may alſo ſometimes divert themſelves on the water, their huſbands, who are very fond of them, bring them abroad in other veſſels which are about the bigneſs of our Shallops or Long-boats, and ſuch as may carry fifty perſons: They are made of Poles ty'd together, and cover'd with Sea-Dogs ſkins, as the former: When it is calm they go with Oars, when there is any wind they faſten the Maſt to certain Sails of Leather.</p>
               <p>The Reader may ſee among the Sculps of this Chapter a Cut of one of theſe Boats, with the perſon that conducts it ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therein, which may render the deſcription we have given of it more intelligible and compleat.</p>
               <p>As to the Country where theſe excellent Navigators are bred, the degrees under which we have placed it ſhew it to be of a very cold conſtitution: Tis true, in the moneths of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> which make the Summer of thoſe parts, and are but one continu'd day, (as <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January</hi> make but one night) the air is warm, pleaſant, and clear, but between thoſe two ſeaſons, the days growing alternately longer and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are attended with thick Miſts, Snow, or Icy-rains, which are extream cold and tedious.</p>
               <p>That part of the Country which lyes neer the Sea, is dry, and full of rough and dreadful rocks; and when the Snow melts it is overflown in many places by certain impetuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents lying between them: But when a man hath travell'd one league of very bad way, he comes into pleaſant fields, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Summer time: There are alſo mountains cover'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58704:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with little Trees, which extreamly recreate the eye, and feed abundance of Fowl and Wild-beaſts; and there are Valleys through which there run many clear and pleaſant Rivers of freſh water, which have ſtrength enough to make their way into the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Captain who commanded the <hi>Fluſhinger,</hi> from whoſe late Voyage we have this Relation, being landed with ſome part of his men, and having made a diligent obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he found there, among other things worth his notice, a vein of a certain browniſh earth full of ſhining ſpangles, as it were of ſilver, wherewith he cauſed a barrel to be filled, that trial might be made thereof: But having been in the crucible, it was found fit only to be put on the covers of Boxes, and ſuch pieces of Joynery, to which it adds much beauty and luſtre: Yet is there ſome hope derived from this diſcovery, that upon further trial there may be Silver-Mines found in theſe parts.</p>
               <p>Though this Country be very cold, yet are there in it many beautiful and large Birds of a black and white plumage, and ſome of divers other colours, which the Inhabitants flay that they may have their fleſh to eat, and their ſkins to cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withall: There are alſo Harts, Elks, Bears, Foxes, Hares, Conies, and abundance of other four-footed beaſts, whoſe Furs are either black or of a dark grey, very thick, long, ſoft, and beſides the uſes may be made thereof as Furs, excellent for Hats.</p>
               <p>Our Relation tells us that the Country is inhabited by two ſorts of Inhabitants, who live together in perfect friendſhip and good correſpondence: Some are of a very high ſtature, well-ſhap'd in their bodies, of a pretty clear complexion, and very ſwift in running: The others are much lower, of a dark Olive-colour'd complexion, and well proportioned as to their members, ſave that they have ſhort and big legs. The former ſpend their time in Hunting, whereto their activity naturally inclines them, while the latter employ themſelves in Fiſhing: Both kinds have their teeth very white and cloſe, black hair, lively eyes, and their faces ſuch as that there can no remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deformity be obſerv'd in them: They are all of them ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and of ſo healthy a conſtitution, that many of them being above a hundred years of age are very active and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious.</p>
               <p>In their ordinary converſation they ſeem to be of a cheerful humor, courageous and confident: They love thoſe ſtrangers who viſit them, becauſe they bring them Needles, Fiſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks, Knives, Hedge-bills, Wedges, and all the other Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Iron they have need of, which they ſo highly eſteem that they will give their cloths, and what they account moſt precious for them: but they have ſuch an averſion from all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, as to feeding and clothing, that it were hard to induce
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58704:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them to admit of any change in either: nay though they are one of the pooreſt and moſt barbarous Nations under the Sun, yet do they think themſelves the moſt happy, and beſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for of any; and they are ſo well conceited of their manner of life, that the civilities of all other people are accounted by them unbeſeeming, ſavage, and extreamly ridiculous actions.</p>
               <p>This high eſteem they have conceiv'd of their condition contributes not a little to that ſatisfaction and tranquility of mind which is legible even in their countenances: beſides that they are not diſturb'd by any vain deſigns which might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their quiet: They know nothing of thoſe gnawing cares and pinching diſtractions wherewith the inordinate deſire of wealth torments the greateſt part of mankind. The conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of fair and ſumptuous buildings, the fame attending gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant actions, the delights of great entertainments, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of excellent things, and what we think moſt advances the pleaſure and enjoyments of life, having not yet found the way into theſe Countries, their thoughts accordingly are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about the acquiſition thereof: but to get thoſe things which are preciſely neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence and clothing, with as little trouble as may be, is the end of all their conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and deſigns.</p>
               <p>Their ordinary Exerciſes, nay indeed Employments, are Fiſhing and Hunting; and though they have no Fire-arms nor Nets, yet ingenious and inventive Neceſſity hath inſpir'd them with other ways whereby they effect their deſires. They eat whatſoever they feed on without any dreſſing, or any other ſauce then hunger: nay they laugh at thoſe who boil fiſh or fleſh, affirming that the fire takes away the natural taſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and what makes them acceptable to them.</p>
               <p>Though they need no fire to dreſs their meat, yet they very much commend the uſe of it, and their Caves are not deſtitute of it in the winter time; both by its light to abate ſomwhat of the tediouſneſs of that long night which reigns in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and by its heat the cold whereby they are beſieged of all ſides: But when they take their reſt, or are forc'd to go out of their Caves, they put on a certain Fur, which by the excellent diſpoſal of Divine Providence ſecures them againſt the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the cold, though they lay in the midſt of the ſnow.</p>
               <p>The mens cloths, are a Shirt, a pair of Breeches, a ſhort Coat, and a kind of Buſkins: The Shirt comes but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Waſte: It hath a Capuchon, or Cap annexed to it, to come over the head and neck: It is made of the bladders of great fiſhes cut into long pieces of equal bredth, and very neatly ſewn together: It hath no opening at the breaſt as ours have; but that it may not rent when it is put on, the ends of the ſleeves, the head-piece, and the bottom of it are hemm'd</p>

in with a very thin black ſkin; as it is repreſented among the Braſs-cuts.</p>
               <p>The reſt of their cloths, even their Buſkins, are of ſeveral pieces cut proportionably one to another, as their Shirts are; but they are of a ſtronger ſtuff, to wit, Harts-ſkins, or Sea-dogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkins very well dreſs'd with the hair on: The cloaths of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage whoſe pourtrait is to be ſeen among the Sculps, taken by the Original, were of Leather of two ſeveral colours, the pieces were cut of the ſame bredth, and put together ſo handſomly, that a white piece was ſewn between two dark colour'd pieces, which ſhew'd very prettily: The hair which was on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide was as ſmooth and as ſoft as Velvet, and the ſeveral pieces were ſo neatly joyn'd together, that a man would think by the out-ſide that the Garment was all made of the ſame ſkin. As to the faſhion of the Coat, and the external ornaments of the Savage, the Graver hath ſo naturally repreſented them in the Sculp, that we need not trouble the Reader with any further deſcription thereof.</p>
               <p>The Savages inhabiting about the foreſaid Streight never go abroad into the Country but they have at their back a Quiver full of Arrows, and a Bow or a Lance in their hands: Their Arrows are of ſeveral kinds, ſome are for the killing of Hares, Foxes, great Birds, and all ſorts of ſmall Game; others for Harts, Elks, Bears, and other greater Beaſts: The former are not above two or three foot in length, and inſtead of iron at the top they put a ſmall ſharp bone, which on one of the ſides hath three or four little hooks, ſo that it cannot be taken out of the place wounded without widening the wound: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which are at leaſt four or five foot long, have alſo at the end a ſharp bone jagged like the teeth of a Saw: They caſt theſe latter with the hand; but to give them the greater force, and make them do execution at a greater diſtance, they faſten to their right arm a piece of wood a foot and a half long, which on one ſide hath a deep channel into which they put the butt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of the Javelin, which being caſt thence goes off with a greater violence.</p>
               <p>They ſometimes alſo carry in their hands a kind of Lance, of a tough and heavy wood, which is tipp'd at the ſmaller end with a round bone, the point whereof had been ſharpened on a ſtone, or they ſtrengthen it with the horns or teeth of the fiſh before deſcribed: Theſe Lances are ſeven or eight foot in length, and beautifi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d at the butt-end with two little wings of wood, or Whale-bone, which make them a little more ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they would be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ſeveral ſorts of hooks wherewith they take the ſmaller fiſhes frequenting their Coaſts, they have divers kinds of Javelins, which with a wonderful dexterity they dart at the great and monſtrous fiſhes they take in the Sea: And that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58704:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe they have hurt with theſe Darts may not ſink to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and elude their expectation, there is faſten'd to the butt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of them a thong of Harts-leather 25 or 30 fathom in length, and at the end of that thong or line of leather there is a bladder, which keeping above water ſhews where the fiſh is, and ſo they draw it to them, or gently drag it to land after it hath ſpent it ſelf in ſtrugling.</p>
               <p>The young women differ not much in their cloaths from the men; but the more ancient are commonly clad with the ſkins of certain great Birds, whoſe feathers are white and black, and very ordinary in thoſe parts. Theſe women have the art to flay them ſo neatly, that the feathers ſtay in the ſkin: Theſe cloaths reach but to half the leg: They are girt with a thong of leather, at which inſtead of keys there hang a great many little bones as ſharp as any bodkins, and about that length: They wear neither Bracelets, nor Neck-laces, nor Pendants; nor mind any ornament, ſave that they make a gaſh in each cheek, and fill it with a certain black colour, which as they think adds very much to their beauty.</p>
               <p>While the men are a hunting or fiſhing they ſtay at home, and employ themſelves in making of Cloths, Tents, Baſkets, and ſuch things as are neceſſary about the houſe: They are extreamly fond of their little ones, and if they be forc'd to change their habitations, or to accompany their huſbands in ſome jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they either carry or lead them where-ever they go, and to recreate them by the way, and quiet them when they cry, they have little drums cover'd with fiſhes bladders, on which they can make as good Muſick as any on the Taber: They alſo beat them to frighten away the Bears, and other wild Beaſts which wander up and down neer the Caves where theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages paſs over the Winter with their families, and about the Tents where they are lodg'd in the Summer. Among the Sculps of this Chapter there is the pourtraiture of one of theſe women, to which we refer the Reader for further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>Though theſe poor Barbarians cannot be imagin'd to ſtudy much Policy, yet have they among them petty Kings and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who preſide in all their Aſſemblies: They advance to theſe dignities thoſe who have the handſomeſt bodies, are the beſt Hunts-men, and the moſt valiant: Theſe wear the richeſt Skins and more precious Furs then their Subjects; and as a badge of their Supremacy they have a certain badge which is ſown before on their Coats, and when they go abroad they are always attended by certain young men arm'd with Bows and Arrows, who punctually execute their commands.</p>
               <p>They have not the invention of building houſes; but in the Summer they live in the fields under Tents of Leather, which they carry along with them to be pitch'd where they think it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58704:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
moſt convenient; and in Winter their abode is in Caves, which are naturally made in the Mountains, or they have taken the pains to make ſuch.</p>
               <p>They neither Sow nor Reap any kind of Grain in order to their ſubſiſtence: Nor have they any Trees or Plants bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruits fit to eat, unleſs it be ſome Straw-berries, and a kind of Raſpices; but indeed their livelihood depends wholly on their Fiſhing and Hunting: Fair water is their ordinary drink, and their moſt delicate entertainment, as to drink, is the blood of Sea-dogs, and that of Deer, and other Land-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they either kill or take in Traps, at the ſetting of which they have an admirable induſtry.</p>
               <p>The Winter being ſo long and hard in this Country, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants muſt needs ſuffer great inconveniences during that ſeaſon, eſpecially that tedious night which keeps them in two whole moneths: But beſides that in caſe of neceſſity they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hunger a long time, they have this foreſight that in the Summer they dry ſome part of their fiſhing and hunting, and lay it up with as much Fat and Suet as they can get together, in order to their ſubſiſtence during that comfortleſs time: Nay ſome affirm they are ſo ſucceſsful in their hunting by Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that they are ſeldom deſtitute of freſh meat, even during this long Eclipſe.</p>
               <p>They deſire not to ſee any other Country beſides that they were born in, and if a tempeſt or other accident chance to caſt them upon ſome other, they perpetually ſigh after their own, and are never quiet in their minds till they have recover'd it: If they are deny'd or too long delay'd that favour, they will attempt it with the hazard of their lives, expoſing themſelves to the Sea in their little Veſſels without any other guide then the Stars, by which they regulate their courſe.</p>
               <p>Their Language hath nothing common with any other in the World; there is a Vocabulary of it, but not to be publiſh'd till there be a further diſcovery made of theſe parts; what is ſaid here thereof being only by way of digreſſion.</p>
               <p>Nor hath it been yet obſerved what Religion they have among them; but from their, looking towards the Sun, and their pointing at him with a certain admiration, lifting up their hands on high, it is inferr'd that they account him a God.</p>
               <p>The Ship from which we have this Relation, brought from <hi>Davis-ſtreight</hi> ſeveral conſiderable Commodities, whereof we ſhall here give a Liſt, to ſhew that the cold which reigns in that Country is not ſo inſupportable as to freeze up all manner of Commerce in thoſe parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Nine hundred Sea-dogs ſkins, moſt of them between ſeven and eight foot long, ſpotted and wav'd with black, red, yellow, tawny, and ſeveral other colours, which height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58704:71"/>
their price beyond thoſe commonly ſeen in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Many rich Hides of Harts, Elks, Bears, as alſo the ſkins of Foxes, Hares, and Conies, whereof moſt were perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly white.</item>
                  <item>3. A great number of precious Furs of divers kinds of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Beaſts particular to that Country, and not known yet by any name among us.</item>
                  <item>4. Several Packs of Whale-bone of extraordinary length.</item>
                  <item>5. Some compleat ſuits of Cloths of the Inhabitants of the Country, whereof ſome were of the ſkins of Beaſts, others of thoſe of Birds, of the faſhion before repreſented.</item>
                  <item>6. Many of their Shirts made of Fiſhes Bladders very neatly ſew'd; as alſo Caps, Gloves, and Buſkins, Quivers, Arrows, Bows, and other Arms uſed by them; as alſo ſome of their Tents, Bags, Baſkets, and other little pieces of Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuff.</item>
                  <item>7. A great number of thoſe ſmall Veſſels made to carry only one man: A great Boat or Shallop forty five foot in length, which might conveniently carry fifty perſons.</item>
                  <item>8. But the moſt rare and precious Commodity was a very conſiderable quantity of the Teeth or Horns of the fiſhes called Sea-Unicorns, which are thought to be the largeſt, the faireſt and the moſt exactly proportion'd of any that have yet been ſeen.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Some of them were ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> where they were well receiv'd: Nor is it unlikely but that they will be much more highly eſteemed, when the admirable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues they have in Phyſick are known: For though their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rarity may procure them the beſt places in the Cloſets of the Curious; yet will they be more kindly received there, when ſome others have found true what many famous Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Apothecaries of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> who have made trial thereof upon ſeveral occaſions, unanimouſly affirm of them, to wit, that they expell poyſon, and have all the properties commonly attributed to the Land-Unicorn's Horn.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of certain Shell-Fiſh, rare Shells, and other remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able productions of the Sea, found on the Coaſts of the <hi>Caribbies.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO dive into the deep Secrets of the Waters to take a view of all the excellent Creatures ſporting themſelves therein, and obſerve the vertues and occult qualities wherewith they are endow'd, is a work might be expected from that Wiſdom which was communicated to <hi>Solomon,</hi> who treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Trees, from the Cedar in <hi>Libanon</hi> to the Hyſſop growing on the Wall: For the watery Element is furniſhed with ſuch a miraculous plenty, that it abundantly produces not only Fiſhes of ſeveral kinds fit for the ſuſtenance of man, and thoſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary bulk and monſtrous figures, as hath been ſhewn in the precedent Chapters, but alſo ſuch a multitude of precious Shells, and other Rarities, that we may well acknowledg that the Divine Wiſdom hath diſplay'd all theſe rich beauties of its inexhauſtible Treaſures, to ſhew its Omnipotency in the midſt of the Waves, and gently to win us into an admiration of his Goodneſs and adorable Providence, which humbles it ſelf to deſcend into the Abyſſes of the Sea to people them with ſome excellent Creatures not to be ſeen elſewhere, and an infinite number of others bearing the Characters and Idaeas of the moſt conſiderable Bodies that either adorn the Heavens, flye in the Air, or embelliſh the Earth. Hence it comes, that there are found in the Waters, Stars, Cornets, Trumpets, Purcelains, Trees, Apples, Cheſt-nuts, and all the delightful curioſities which are ſo highly eſteemed among men. But to begin with the Shell-fiſh, there are in the Seas about, and in the Rivers of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> ſeveral kinds of them: The more particularly eſteemed are the <hi>Homars,</hi> the <hi>Sea-Spiders,</hi> and the <hi>Crabs.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>HOMARS.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Homars</hi> are a kind of <hi>Crevices,</hi> of the ſame figure as thoſe of our Rivers; but they are ſo big that there needs but one to make a good large diſh: Their meat is white, and of a good taſte, but a little hard of digeſtion: The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Iſlands take them in the night time upon the ſands, or in the Shallows neer the low-water-mark; and with the aſſiſtance of a Torch, or Moon-light, they catch them with a little iron fork.</p>

                  <head>SEA-SPIDER.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Sea-Spider</hi> is by ſome conceiv'd to be a kind of <hi>Crab:</hi> It is cover'd with two very hard ſcales, whereof the uppermoſt is ſomewhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> rough, and the lowermoſt is more ſmooth, and jagged with ſharp points: It hath many legs or claws, and a ſtrong tail, ſometimes about a foot in length: They are much ſought after by ſome of the Savages to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about their Arrows: When this fiſh is dried in the Sun, the ſcale or ſhell of it becomes gliſtering, and in a manner tranſparent, though naturally it be of an Aſh-colour.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>CRABS.</head>
                  <p>THe ordinary <hi>Crabs</hi> of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> are of the ſame figure as thoſe taken in theſe parts: There is a great difference among them as to bigneſs, but the rareſt are thoſe which live by prey: They are very common in moſt of the Iſlands, but above all in thoſe called the <hi>Virgins:</hi> They lurk under the ſtumps and ſtocks of the Trees growing on the Sea-ſide, and as it were imitating a kind of Frogs, called the <hi>Fiſhing-Frogs,</hi> they diſcover from their lurking-holes the Oyſters and Muſcles, which they prey upon; and the ſleight they uſe in the taking of them is worth our notice. Having found by experience that their Mordants or Claws are not ſtrong enough to break the ſhells wherein thoſe delicate fiſhes are contain'd; and having obſerved that ſeveral times of the day they open their ſhells to take the air, they diligently watch the time, and having fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd themſelves with a little round pebble, they hold it ready in one of their claws, and coming to the Oyſter or Muſcle, let it fall ſo cunningly into the half-open'd ſhell, that not being able to cloſe again, the fiſh becomes the prey of theſe ſubtle Crabs.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Shells</hi> found in theſe Iſlands, in the Creeks and Nooks into which they are caſt by the Sea there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of them, and of ſeveral kinds: The moſt ſought after and moſt conſiderable are theſe.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>BURGAU.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Burgau,</hi> which is of the figure of a Snail, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas'd out of the outermoſt coat, preſents to the eye a ſilver ſhell intermixt with ſpots of a bright black, a lively green, and ſo perfect and ſhining a grey, that no Enameller could come neer it with all the aſſiſtances of his art. As ſoon as the fiſh which had been lodg'd within this precious little Manſion hath been diſſeiz'd thereof, there is immediately ſeen a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58704:73"/>
entry beſet with pearls', and afterwards ſeveral rich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partements ſo clear, ſo neat, and enamell'd all over with ſo bright a ſilver-colour, that there cannot in matter of ſhell any thing be imagin'd more beautiful.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>CASK.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Cask,</hi> or <hi>Head-piece,</hi> is of a different bigneſs proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to the heads of ſo many fiſhes as had worn it; and it is ſo named from its figure: It is lin'd within and at the edges, which are thick, flat and jagged, of a Satin carnation colour extreamly bright and ſhining; and on the out-ſide it is faſhion'd like a neat Country-building, having many little riſings which are interlaced with a thouſand compartiments, on which there may be ſeen a waving pannache or feather of divers rare colours.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>LAMBIS.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Lambis</hi> hath haply receiv'd that name becauſe the fiſh which makes it move hath the figure of a great Tongue, which licks that glutinous moiſture lying on the rocks againſt which the waves of the Sea beat. This is one of the largeſt ſiz'd ſhells that are: One of the ſides is turned up, as it were to make the greater diſcovery of the fair purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour wherewith it is beautifi'd within: But it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, that the ſhape being none of the handſomeſt, and the outer coat prickled with ſeveral rough and ſharp riſings, it would hardly be receiv'd into the Cloſets of the Curious, if Art taking off that outer coat did not diſcover the beauty and ſmoothneſs of the divers-colour'd ſhell which lay within that courſe ſhag: The fiſh which is lodg'd within the clefts of this little moving rock is ſo big, that one of them will make a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty round diſh: It may be ſerv'd up to the Tables of the daintieſt Palats, ſo it be well dreſs'd with good ſtore of Pepper to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect its indigeſtion: The ſhells burnt to powder and mixt with ſand make a cement which defies rain, and all other injuries of the weather. The <hi>Lambis</hi> yields a ſound like that of a Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans horn, and is heard at a great diſtance; whence ſome of the Inhabitants of the Iſlands uſe them to bring their people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to meals.</p>

               <div type="part">

                  <p>THe <hi>Venus-ſhells</hi> may juſtly be numbred among the rareſt productions of the Sea, whether we conſider the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſmoothneſs wherewith they are glaz'd both within and without, or the diverſity and livelineſs of their colours:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58704:74"/>
Their jagged edges are turned inwards, and though all are not equally beautiful, yet are they all of the ſame oval figure, gaping in the midſt, and turning in a little: But they are very different as to bigneſs and colour.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary ones are of a gilt-yellow, checquer'd with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle white or red ſpots, ſo as that at a diſtance a man would think them little Pearls, or grains of Coral: Of the reſt, ſome are blewiſh, ſome as it were beſet with ſtars, ſome greyiſh, ſome like Chryſtal, and ſome colour'd like Agats, which are all delightful to the eye.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt eſteem'd by the Curious are on the out-ſide of a colour between coral and carnation, and of a ſilver-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or of a bright ſky-colour within, and a rich porphiry with ſmall golden ſtreaks: Thoſe alſo are with reaſon well eſteem'd, which on the upper part are of a bright green like an Emerald, and within on the edges, and in the diſtances of a pearl-colour: The ſame account is made of thoſe which on the back are black as Jet, and all elſewhere of a pale blew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt with little purple veins.</p>
                  <p>In fine, there are ſome have ſuch a delightful mixture of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as if the Rain-bow had communicated ſome of its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to theſe little creatures: Nay there are abundance of them ſo diverſifi'd with odd figures and characters, that it may be imagin'd Nature was in a very pleaſant humor when ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of theſe miracles.</p>
                  <p>But the miſchief of it is, that the Sea, which is poſſeſs'd of them as her moſt precious jewels, never parts with them but againſt her will: For if the Winds did not enrage her, and ſhaking her bowels ſearch into the bottom of her Treaſures, and force them thence, ſhe alone would enjoy theſe beauties, and never let us have any of them.</p>
                  <p>The Curious, to heighten their luſtre, place them according to their value and eſteem in ſeveral Cabinets, lin'd with green Pluſh, or ſome other rich ſtuff: And after the example of the Flowriſts, who call their Tulips and Gilly-Flowers by the names of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and moſt illuſtrious Heroes, they in like manner give them the titles of Emperours and Princes.</p>

                  <head>SEA-CORNETS.</head>
                  <p>THere are alſo ſeen in the <hi>Caribbies</hi> two ſorts of thoſe great Shells called <hi>Sea-Cornets,</hi> which are turned at the end like a ſcrew: Some are white as Ivory, and not inferior to it in luſtre: Others are within of a ſhining pearl-colour, and without of ſeveral fair and lively colours, which are ſometimes like ſcales, ſometimes waving, falling one upon another from the edge of the wide opening to the turn'd end, where they ceaſe: If a little hole be made at the ſmall end of theſe Cornets,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58704:74"/>
they become a kind of muſical Inſtrument which makes a ſharp and piercing ſound, and forc'd through the windings of the ſhell, may be heard at as great diſtance as the ſmalleſt kind of Trumpet might be: But there is a great ſecret in the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>MOTHER of PEARL.</head>
                  <p>SHells do not only afford a pleaſant divertiſement which may excite men by a conſideration of thoſe ſmall, but admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble works of Nature, to bleſs the Author thereof; but having cloy'd the eye, they find ſomewhat to ſatisfie the taſte, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe wealth: For <hi>Oyſters,</hi> and other ſhell-fiſh are welcome to the greateſt Tables; and the <hi>Naker</hi> or <hi>Mother of Pearl</hi> is big with that Pearl which enriches the Crowns of Kings. 'Tis true, there is ſeen only the ſeeds of theſe Pearls in the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> and that they are to be had in perfection only at S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets</hi> Iſland, and the South-part of <hi>America:</hi> But though this ſeed is not hardned into great Pearls in the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> yet are not the ſhells wherein it is found without their advantages; for the meat within them is for food, and the two parts of the ſilver ſhell make ſo many Spoons, which may creditably appear upon the Table.</p>
                  <p>It is not eaſie to determine whether the dew which falls in the <hi>Caribbies</hi> be not fruitful enough to make the <hi>Mother-Pearl</hi> produce its fruit in perfection; or whether after it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that ſeed from the Heavens they miſcarry, and have not natural force enough to retain it: But not to enquire whence the defect proceeds, it is moſt certain they have as ſtrong an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to avoid the reproach of ſterility, as thoſe fiſh'd for on the Coaſts of S. <hi>Margarets:</hi> For he who will be at the curioſity to obſerve their ſecret Loves from the rocks, at the foot where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they moſt delight to be, ſhall find, that at the break of day they ſtart up ſeveral times to the ſurface of the water, as it were to do homage to the Riſing-Sun; then of a ſudden they open themſelves upon that ſoft bed, expecting the firſt beams of that all-enlivening Star: If they be ſo happy as to receive ſome drops of the dew he cauſes to diſtill from the Heavens at his riſing, they immediately cloſe their ſhells, leſt any touch of ſalt-water come in, and corrupt that celeſtial ſperm: And then they cheerfully return to their deep cells.</p>
                  <p>A certain Author named <hi>Fragoſus</hi> conceives, that the Pearls ingender in the meat of the Oyſter, as the ſtone does in ſome living creatures, of a thick and viſcous moiſture which remains of the aliment. Some learned Phyſicians who are alſo of the ſame opinion, fortifie it with what is affirmed by <hi>Joſephus Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> a very creditable Writer, to wit, that the Slaves who fiſh for Pearls, dive ſometimes twelve fathom deep in the Sea to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58704:75"/>
take the Oyſters which are commonly faſtened to the Rocks, that they get them thence by violence, and come up loaden with them: Whence they conclude, that it cannot be well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that thoſe Oyſters which are faſten'd to the rocks ſuck in the dew, and that thence comes the generation of Pearls.</p>
                  <p>But not to enter into any conteſtation with theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor yet abſolutely to reject their opinion which hath its grounds, we may affirm, that the true account given by <hi>Acoſta</hi> of the fiſhing for Pearls makes nothing againſt the opinion commonly receiv'd of their generation; for it is not impoſſible but that the Mother-Pearls which have conceived of the Dew, feeling themſelves burthened with that precious fruit, have no great inclination to appear ever afterwards on the ſurface of the waters; and being ſatisfi'd with the treaſure they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of, they from thenceforth faſten themſelves to the rocks, whence they cannot be gotten off without violence.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of ſeveral other ſorts of Shells.</head>
                  <p>THoſe who living in populous Cities would counterfeit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, Rocks and ſolitary Places, or in their Gardens raiſe little Hills, under which there ſhould be Grotts encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd with all the moſt curious ſpoils of Sea and Land, might find in moſt of theſe Iſlands what may ſatisfie their humor. This only is to be feared, that abundance and diverſity would puzzle their choice, and occaſion a certain contempt of them: There are on the Coaſts of theſe Iſlands an infinite multitude of ſeveral ſorts of Shells, eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>Sea-tops, Whelks, &amp;c.</hi> which have no names among us, whereof ſome are of a ſilver-colour, ſome full of ſtars, ſome ſanguine, ſome green, ſome ſtreaked with carnation, ſome checquer'd with ſeveral ſorts of colours, which make them ſhine along the ſands like ſo many precious ſtones: The Sun extreamly heightens their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre and beauty; and when after an extraordinary tempeſt the Sea hath enrich'd the ſurface of thoſe ſhores with theſe little ſparkling gems, the eye is ſo dazzled at it, that a man cannot but acknowledg that Nature loves to make different demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of her power, and ſhews what ſhe can do, when ſhe beſtows ſo much beauty, and ſo many rich ornaments on theſe little inconſiderable Creatures.</p>
                  <p>The Savage Iſlanders ſometimes gather theſe little play-games of the Sea, only for diverſion ſake, and having made holes in them put them on ſtrings for Neck-laces and Bracelets: But moſt of the Southern part of <hi>America</hi> have a far greater eſteem for them; for they drive a Trade with them, and they are in ſome places the current Money, and thoſe who have moſt ſhells are accounted the richeſt. The Shells uſed for this purpoſe are of a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58704:75"/>
pretty bigneſs, ſolid, and of extraordinary luſtre; and to be current Money, they muſt be marked by certain Officers, who aſcertain the value thereof by certain little Characters engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on them.</p>

                  <head>MUSICK-SHELL.</head>
                  <p>THere is a very conſiderable Shell, which Monſ. <hi>du Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> thinks may be found in ſome of the <hi>Caribby-Iſlands,</hi> though he never ſaw any of that kind but only at <hi>Coraſſao:</hi> It differs not much as to figure from the <hi>Venus-ſhells:</hi> It may be called the <hi>Muſical-ſhell,</hi> becauſe on the out-ſide of it there are blackiſh lines, full of notes, which have a kind of key for the ſinging of them, ſo that it might be ſaid there wants only the letter to that natural pricking: The forementioned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man relates, that he ſaw ſome that had five Lines, a Key and Notes, which made good Muſick: Some perſon had added the Letter, which it ſeems Nature had forgotten, and caus'd it to be ſung, and the Muſick was not undelightful.</p>
                  <p>This might afford the ingenious many excellent reflections: They might ſay among other things, that if according to the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Heavens have their Harmony, the ſweetneſs whereof cannot be heard by reaſon of the noiſe made upon Earth; if the Air reſound with the melody of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Birds who ſing their ſeveral parts there; and if Men have invented a kind of Muſick, after their way, which by the Ears recreates the Heart; it were but juſt that the Sea, which is not always toſs'd and troubled, ſhould have within its territories certain Muſicians to celebrate, by a Muſick parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to them, the praiſes of their Sovereign Maker. The Poets might adde, that theſe natural tablatures are the ſame which the <hi>Syrens</hi> had in their hands, when they had their melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Conſorts; and that being perceiv'd by ſome eye which came to diſturbe their recreations, they let them fall into the water, where they have been carefully kept ever ſince: But leaving theſe imaginations to thoſe they belong to, let us pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue our deſign.</p>

Hence it comes, that there are Stars to be ſeen in it, having five points or beams, ſomewhat of a yellowiſh colour. This <hi>Star</hi> is ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a foot diametre, and an inch thick; the ſkin is hard enough, and full of little riſings, which adde much to its beauty. If theſe Sea-Stars may not enter into any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with thoſe of the Heavens, as to magnitude and light, they exceed them in this, that they are animate, and that their motion is not forc'd, and that they are not fix'd nor confin'd to the ſame place: For the fiſh, which hath taken up its abode in this ſtarry manſion, moves which way it pleaſes on the azure plains of the waters while the weather is calm, but as ſoon as it foreſees any tempeſt, out of a fear to be forc'd to the Land, which is not fit to entertain Stars, it caſts out two little anchors out of its body, whereby it is ſo firmly faſtened to the Rocks, that all the violent agitations

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of Amber-greece; its Origine; and the marks of that which is good, and without mixture.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>AMber-greece</hi> is found in greateſt abundance on the Coaſts of <hi>Florida,</hi> beyond what is had of it in any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>America:</hi> Whence it comes, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have built Forts there, to keep poſſeſſion of the Land, and entertain with the Indians, who inhabit it, the Commerce of that rich Commodity, which they carefully gather ſince they have been acquainted with the value of it. There hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been taken up of it, after extraordinary tempeſts, on the Coaſts of <hi>Tabago, Barboudos,</hi> and ſome other of the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> as we have received by very authentick Relations: Upon
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58704:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which aſſurance, it will be no digreſſion from the Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory we treat of, if we perfume this Chapter with the ſweet ſcent of this Aromatick Drug, which certainly is the rareſt and moſt precious of all thoſe productions which the Ocean hath yet caſt up out of its vaſt and unexhauſted boſom to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich that new world.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maldives</hi> call Amber-greece <hi>Panahambar,</hi> that is, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of gold,</hi> by reaſon of its worth: The Inhabitants of <hi>Fez, Morocco,</hi> and the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> call it by the ſame name as they do the Whale; whence it is probably conjectur'd, that they thought it proceeded from the Whale. Moſt certain it is, that neither <hi>Hippocrates, Dioſcorides,</hi> nor <hi>Galen,</hi> ever heard any thing of Amber-greece, no more then they had of the <hi>Bezo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar-ſtone, Guayacum, Saſſafras, Saſſaparilla, Rhubarb, Mechoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> and many other Drugs: Amber-greece therefore is one of thoſe whereof the knowledge is wholly modern, and the origine not well known.</p>
               <p>Some have imagin'd that this Amber, not known among the Ancients, is an excrement of the Whales: Others are of opinion, that it comes from the Crocodiles, in regard their fleſh is perfum'd: Some others are perſwaded, that they are pieces of Iſlands and fragments of Rocks conceal'd in the Sea, and carried away by the violence of the waves, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there are ſometimes found pieces of this Amber which weigh a hundred pound, and of the length of ſixty hands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bredths, and that, as is affirmed by <hi>Linſcot,</hi> in the Year M. D. L. V. there was a piece found neer <hi>Cape Comorin,</hi> which weigh'd thirty hundred weight. There are alſo thoſe who conceive it to be a kind of Sea-foam, which gathers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and grows thick after a certain time by the agitation of the Sea-water, and is hardned by the heat of the Sun.</p>
               <p>But the moſt probable conjecture is, that it is a kind of <hi>Bitumen</hi> engendred at the bottom of the Sea; and when it comes to be extremely agitated by ſome extraordinary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, it lets go this Bitumen, and forces it towards the ſhores: for indeed it is commonly found only after ſome great tempeſt. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in the life of <hi>Apollonius</hi> affirms, that the Panthers which are neer the Mount <hi>Caucaſus</hi> are very much delighted with the ſweet ſcent of that place: But certain it is, that of all creatures the Birds are very great lovers of this Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece, and that they will ſcent it at a great diſtance: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſoon as the tempeſt is laid it muſt be ſought after and taken away, otherwiſe it will be devoured. Nor is it the ſweet ſcent of it, but the ill, which cauſes the Birds to flock to it; for this precious and admirable perfume, when it is freſh and ſoft, and newly come out of the Sea, ſmells very ſtrong, and thoſe creatures which run to it do but as they would do to ſome carrion; for the ſcent of it is like that of ruſty bacon,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58704:77"/>
and 'tis likely for that reaſon that it was ſo long ere 'twas known and uſed: The Ancients judg'd of its vertue by its ill ſcent, fit rather to injure the heart then refreſh it, and ſo they rejected it as unprofitable, nay hurtful. Beſides it is not ſo commonly, nor in ſo great quantities found towards the Coaſts of <hi>Greece,</hi> nor yet in <hi>Europe;</hi> and there were but very few Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages heretofore made into the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Foxes do alſo think it a good diſh, and eat much of it: In thoſe Countries where much of it is gather'd, theſe creatures wait at the Sea-ſide, and having diſcover'd any, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately devour it: But having kept it a while in their bellies, they caſt it up again before it be any way digeſted; yet does it loſe ſome of its vertue and ſweet ſcent: Whence it comes, that this kind of Amber-greece is leſs eſteem'd then the other, and us'd only in perfumes.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſs hereto give the marks whereby the true Amber-greece is to be diſtinguiſh'd from the adulterate, ſince thoſe who have written of it, as <hi>Garcias, Monard, Scaliger, Ferdinand Lopez, Cluſius,</hi> and others, ſpeak very little thereof, and aſſign not the eſſential marks of it.</p>
               <p>It is in the firſt place to be obſerv'd, that Amber-greece is generally diſtinguiſh'd into that which comes from the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas, and that which comes from the Weſtern Sea: That which is taken up on the Coaſts of the <hi>Levant,</hi> eſpecially on thoſe of <hi>Barbary,</hi> where there is much, and in great pieces had, is for the moſt part black, and cannot be dried ſo well as to be reduc'd to powder, as that of the Weſt, let what will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to promote the pulverization of it: It is alſo more eaſily melted by the fire, hath not ſo ſweet a ſcent, and is of a lower value: There is little of the Amber brought into theſe parts, in regard it is not much eſteem'd, and not very uſeful either as to Phyſick, or Perfumes.</p>
               <p>The Amber-greece of the Weſt, whereof the beſt is that found on our Coaſts, is commonly of an aſh-colour'd grey, looking as if aſhes were mixt with wax, yet ſo as that the aſhes appear diſtinctly, and are not perfectly mixt with the wax: The upper part of it having raked along the ſhore, and lain more open to the air, is commonly of a tawny colour, or at leaſt not ſo white as it is within, hard and ſolid like a cruſt, and ſometimes full of ſand and little ſhells: which happens hence, that being ſoft as Bitumen or Pitch, ſuch filth eaſily ſticks to it; and that abates ſomwhat of its price, but not of its goodneſs.</p>
               <p>To know whether this Amber, which is of the beſt kind, be good, in the firſt place conſider the figure of it, which for the moſt part ſhould incline to roundneſs, inaſmuch as all things that are any way ſoft being toſs'd to and fro by the Sea are reduc'd to a certain roundneſs: It ſhould be alſo ſomewhat
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58704:78"/>
ſmooth, and of a dark colour between a dark-grey and tawny: If it be very dry it ſhould be the lighter, proportionably to the bigneſs of the piece: Hereby it may be judg'd whether there be any mixture of Scamony, Bitumen, Wax, Pitch, or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, all theſe adding much to its weight: By the ſame tryal it may be known whether there be any mixture of ſand; as alſo whether it be not the black Amber-greece of the <hi>Levant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Owners of it are unwilling to have the piece broken, take a needle heated, and thruſt it into the piece, and if it enter eaſily, conclude there are no ſtones within it; and if you ſmell at the liquor which will come forth by the heat of the needle whereby the Amber is melted, you will find it of a ſcent not unlike that of gumm'd wax, but at laſt will end in an odour ſweet enough.</p>
               <p>But the ſureſt way is, having agreed about the price of the piece of Amber conditionally it be good, to break it; ſo you will find whether there be any ſmall pebbles in it. The Amber, as we ſaid before, muſt be of an aſh-colour, having ſmall ſpecks, as our Water-nuts: When it is freſh it is of a darker colour then when it is very dry: but if it differ not much from that colour, and be not too black nor too white, it matters not; above all it ſhould appear of a mixt colour: Take alſo a little out of the middle of the piece, or from that part which you think worſt, and put it on a knife heated in the fire, and it will preſently melt like wax, and if the knife be very hot what was put upon it will be quite conſum'd.</p>
               <p>When you have thus melted it, obſerve whether it hath the ſcent we mentioned, which cannot be well known but only to ſuch as have made tryal thereof, becauſe it is particular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and by that means you will alſo diſcover whether there be any mixture in the Amber: You may alſo while it is melting put a little upon your hand, and ſpreading it you may ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any mixture: It ſhould ſtick ſo faſt to your hand that it can hardly be got off: When it melts it becomes all of one colour, though before it ſeemed to be mixt, and inclines to that of ſome kind of Rozin: It ſhould not diſſolve in either water or oyl; not but that there is a way to diſſolve it in either of them, by the addition of a certain ingredient, which thoſe who know it would not have diſcover'd: Nor ſhould it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to powder, unleſs being very dry it may be ſcraped or grated, and be mixt with ſome fine powder: It alſo ſticks much to the Mortar, which therefore muſt be often made clean: The black will never be reduc'd to powder, neither this, nor any other way.</p>
               <p>The difference between the black and the grey conſiſts chiefly in the colour, which inclines to that of black pitch, and not mixt with whitiſh-grey ſeeds, but all over alike: The black is alſo ſofter and more weighty, and ſmells more like <hi>Bitumen.</hi>

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:58704:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>There is a third kind of Amber-greece, which is white, the rareſt, as <hi>Ferdinand Lopez</hi> affirms, but not the beſt as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it. On the contrary, it is the moſt inconſiderable of any, and there being no account made of it, there is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tranſported: But this is indeed ſome of the other kinds of Amber-greece, which having been devoured and digeſted by Birds that have very hot ſtomacks, turns white, as moſt of the excrements of Birds are: That which hath been devour'd by Fiſhes, as it happens many times, is not much alter'd either as to colour or ſubſtance: which proceeds hence, that their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks are not ſo hot as thoſe of the Birds, and perhaps finding the Amber-greece hotter then their ordinary ſuſtenance, and burthen'd therewith, they ſoon caſt it up again: But what had been eaten by the Fox is in a manner corrupted, and of little value, by reaſon of the heat of his ſtomack. This white Amber-greece is like ſalted or pickled Suet, eaſily melted, and ſmells like tallow; whence ſome conceive it is but ſome kind of ſuet ſo ordered.</p>
               <p>Having given the marks of the right Amber-greece, we ſhall omit the adulterations of it, becauſe they are almoſt infinite: Nor ſhall we treat of its uſe in Phyſick, its excellent qualities, and eſpecially the ſweet ſcent it gives to liquid Conſerves, and all other things wherein it is uſed: Of theſe ſome other Books lately come forth, and experience may ſatisfie the curious Reader.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of certain Creatures living partly on Land, partly in the Waters, commonly called <hi>Amphibia,</hi> which may be found in the <hi>Caribby-Iſlands.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE ſhall begin with the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> by the Iſlanders cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cayeman:</hi> It is a very dangerous Monſter, which ſometimes grows to an extraordinary bulk and length: The Skeletons of ſeveral of them being frequently brought into theſe parts, we ſhall not be ſo large in our deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, as otherwiſe we might.</p>
               <p>This Creature keeps in or neer the Sea, and in the Rivers of the Iſlands that are not inhabited, and ſometimes on the Land among the Reeds, very hideous to look on: It is conceiv'd to live a long time, and that its body encreaſeth in all its dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the very laſt day: Whence it is not to be wondred, if there have been ſeen of them ſome which were eighteen foot in length, and as big about as a Hogſhead: It hath four feet
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58704:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
well arm'd with crooked claws: The ſkin, which is cover'd all over with ſcales, is ſo hard on the back, that a bullet from a Muſket ſhot at him ſhall hardly make any impreſſion on it: but if he be hurt under the belly, or in the eyes, he is ſoon gone: His lower jaw is immoveable, but hath ſo wide a mouth, and ſo well ſet with ſharp teeth, that he makes nothing to divide a man in two.</p>
               <p>He runs faſt enough on land; but the weight of his body cauſes him to make ſo deep a track in the ſand, as a Coach-horſe might do; and having no <hi>vertebrae</hi> in the back-bone, no more then the <hi>Hyaena</hi>'s, he goes ſtreight forwards, not being able to turn his vaſt body, but with much difficulty; ſo that the better to avoid his purſuit, a man need only turn ſeveral times a ſide.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which are bred in freſh water do ſo ſmell of Muſk while they are alive, that the air is perfum'd a hundred paces about the place where they are: nay the water retains ſomwhat of the ſame ſmell. This obſervation of the ſweet ſcent of the Crocodile may, by the way, diſcover the error of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who imagin'd that of all living creatures only the <hi>Panther</hi> had a ſweet ſcent with it, as he ſomewhere affirms, though in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he writes, that the entrails of the Crocodile ſmell ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweet, and that proceeds from the odoriferous flowers on which he feeds: Now this muſky ſcent of the Crocodile of <hi>America</hi> is enclos'd in certain glandules in the Emunctories, which he hath under the thighs, and which being taken thence keep the ſaid ſmell a long time: It may be imagin'd that God hath beſtow'd this ſcent on them, that men and other creatures, which many times become the prey of theſe cruel Monſters, might by the ſcent diſcover the place where they lurk, and avoid them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which have their abode in the Sea have no ſmell of muſk, but both kinds are very dangerous, and to be dreaded by ſuch as either go to waſh themſelves, or are forc'd to croſs ſome river by ſwimming: This dreadful Monſter hath a ſtrange ſleight to make his prey of Oxen and Cows: One of them will lye lurking at thoſe places of the Ponds and Rivers where thoſe creatures are wont to water, and finding one at his advantage, he half-ſhuts his eyes, and floats on the face of the water, as if it were a piece of rotten wood; by which means getting neerer and neerer to the poor beaſt which is a drinking, and is not aware of him, he immediately faſtens on him, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him by the lips, and forcing him under water, he drowns him, and then feeds on him: He taketh men alſo by the ſame ſleight, as is affirmed by <hi>Vincent le Blanc,</hi> who hath a Relation of the ſervant of a Conſul of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who going to take one of theſe cruel beaſts, thinking it had been a piece of wood, was drawn by it to the bottom, and never ſeen afterwards.</p>

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:58704:80"/>There are abundance of theſe monſtrous Crocodiles in thoſe Iſlands, which from them are called the Iſlands of <hi>Cayeman,</hi> and not frequented but only in the time of Tortoiſe-fiſhing: For having pick'd out the beſt meat out of the Tortoiſe, and a great deal caſt away, the Crocodiles come in great numbers in the night time to feed on the entrails and carcaſes left on the ſand: So that thoſe who are watching for the Tortoiſes are oblig'd to carry about them great wooden Leavers to keep off thoſe <hi>Cayemans,</hi> which they many times kill, having firſt broken their backs with thoſe Leavers.</p>
               <p>Theſe creatures have a whitiſh fat, which was heretofore uſed by Phyſicians in fluxions proceeding from a cold cauſe; it being hot, and conſiſting of ſubtile parts: Upon the ſame account were ſuch as had Fevers rubb'd therewith upon the approach of their fits, to cauſe ſweating: Many other properties are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Crocodile by <hi>Pliny,</hi> in order to the curing of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: Some are very deſirous to get certain little ſtones, like little bones, which are in his head, and having reduced them to powder, they uſe them to clear the Reins of Gravel: Some alſo affirm, that the ſharpeſt teeth of this Animal, which are on the ſide of each jaw, cure the Tooth-ach, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the teeth from corruption, being only rubbed every day therewith: There are in like manner in the heads of Dragons, and Toads, ſtones good againſt ſeveral diſeaſes: So the cruel <hi>Requiems,</hi> by us before deſcribed, afford a remedy againſt the Stone and Gravel. Thus hath it pleas'd the wiſe Author of Nature, that we ſhould have ſome advantages from thoſe creatures which are otherwiſe moſt pernicious.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chineſes</hi> have a way to take and tame theſe Crocodiles, as ſome Hiſtorians affirm: And when they have bred them a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, and made them fat enough, they kill them, and feed on them: But the <hi>Europeans</hi> who have taſted thereof, affirm, their fleſh, though white and delicate, is not pleaſant to the taſte, as being too luſhious, ſweetiſh, and retaining much of the muſk.</p>

                  <p>THere are taken in theſe Iſlands ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Tortoiſes,</hi> for there are <hi>Land-Tortoiſes, Sea-Tortoiſes,</hi> and <hi>Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water-Tortoiſes,</hi> which are of different figures: The <hi>Caribbians</hi> call them all by the name of <hi>Catallou;</hi> but when they ſpeak of the Land-Tortoiſes, they adde the word <hi>Nonum,</hi> which in their Language ſignifies the Earth, or that of <hi>Tona,</hi> that is to ſay, of the River or Water.</p>
                  <p>The Sea-Tortoiſes are commonly divided by the Iſlanders into three kinds, that which the French call <hi>Tortue Franche,</hi> that called <hi>Caouanne,</hi> and the <hi>Carets:</hi> They are all of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58704:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the ſame figure; but the meat only of the firſt kind is good to be eaten, unleſs it be in caſe of neceſſity, and for want of other proviſion; ſo that of the two laſt, only the ſhell is of value.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tortue-Franche,</hi> and the <hi>Caouannes</hi> are commonly of ſo vaſt a bulk, that the upper ſhell is about four foot and a half in length, and four in bredth: Which is not to be much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, ſince that in <hi>Maurice-Iſland</hi> there are ſome which having four men on their backs, are nevertheleſs able to go. <hi>Aelian</hi> relates, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Taprobana</hi> cover their houſes therewith: And if we may credit <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> certain Nations of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> convert them into Boats, in which they will croſs a great arm of the Sea that lies between them and the Continent.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Amphibious creatures ſeldom come to Land, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſpoſe of their Egges, in order to propagation: To that end they make choice of a very light ſand which they find on the Sea-ſide, in ſome place not much frequented, and to which they may have eaſie acceſs.</p>
                  <p>The Iſlanders, who at a certain ſeaſon of the year go to the <hi>Cayeman-Iſlands,</hi> to make proviſion of the meat of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes which come to land there in infinite numbers, affirm, that they make their recourſe thither from all parts within a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues and more to lay their egges, by reaſon of the eaſineſs of the acceſs, the ſhore being flat, and cover'd with a ſoft ſand: The Tortoiſes come to land about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and their landing continues till <hi>September,</hi> and then may they be taken in abundance; which is thus performed.</p>
                  <p>At the cloſe of the evening ſome men are ſet aſhore, who lying on the ſands without making any noiſe, watch the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes when they come out of the Sea to lay their egges in the ſand; and when they perceive that they are got a good way from the Sea-ſide, and hear them making a deep hole in the ſand with their claws, into which being a foot and a half deep, and ſometimes more, they lay the egges, they come and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them at that employment, and turn them upſide-down; and being in that poſture they are not able to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but continue ſo till the next day that they are brought thence in Shallops to the Ships: When they are thus turned upſide-down, they are obſerv'd to ſhed tears, and are heard to ſigh. 'Tis generally known that the Stag weeps when he is put to his extremities: And it is almoſt incredible what cries and groans proceed from the Crocodiles about the <hi>Nile,</hi> and what tears they ſhed when they find themſelves taken.</p>
                  <p>The Sea-men of thoſe Ships which go to the <hi>Cayeman-Iſlands</hi> to take in their loading of Tortoiſes, may every night in leſs then three hours turn forty or fifty of them, the leaſt whereof weighs a hundred and fifty pound, and the ordinary ones two
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58704:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hundred pound; nay ſome of them will have two great pails full of egges in their bellies: Theſe egges are round, and about the bigneſs of a Tennis-ball; they have white and yolk like Hens-egges, but the ſhell is not ſo hard, but ſoft, feeling as if it were wet parchment. The <hi>Fricaſſeys</hi> and <hi>Omeletts</hi> made of them are good enough, but a little drier then thoſe made with Hens-egges. There is ſo much meat about one Tortoiſe as may well maintain ſixty perſons a whole day: When they are deſirous to eat of them, they cut off the ſhell which is under the belly from that on the back, unto which it is joyn'd by certain griſtles which are eaſily cut: What Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes are taken by the Sea-men in the night, finds them work all day to cut into pieces and ſalt them. Moſt of the Ships which come to theſe <hi>Cayeman-Iſlands,</hi> after they have taken in their loading, that is, after ſix weeks or two moneths continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance there, return to the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> where they ſell that ſalted Tortoiſe; and it becomes the ſuſtenance of the ordinary ſort of people, and the ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>But the Tortoiſes that have eſcaped, having laid their egges at two or three ſeveral times, return to the place whence they came, the egges which they have cover'd with ſand on the Sea-ſide being about ſix weeks after hatch'd by the heat of the Sun, and not by their looking on them, as <hi>Pliny,</hi> and ſome of the Ancients imagined: as ſoon as the young Tortoiſes have broken the ſhells wherein they were inclos'd, they make their way through the ſand, and get out of the grave which gave them birth, and by an inſtinct of nature go ſtreight to the Sea to the old ones.</p>
                  <p>The meat of this kind of Tortoiſe is as dainty as any Veal, ſo it be freſh, and kept but one day: It is intermixt with fat, which when it is dreſs'd is of a greeniſh yellow: It is of eaſie digeſtion, and very wholſom, whence it comes, that thoſe ſick perſons who cannot recover in the other Iſlands are carried to that purpoſe to the <hi>Cayemans</hi> in the Ships that go for Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes; and commonly having refreſh'd, and purg'd themſelves with that diet, they return thence perfectly recover'd. The fat of this kind of Tortoiſe yields an oyl, which while it is freſh is good enough to fry withall, being ſtale it is employ'd in Lamps.</p>

                  <p>THe third kind of Sea-Tortoiſe, called by the French <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> differs from the two others in bigneſs, as being much leſs, and that it lays not its egges in the ſand, but in a kind of gravel which is mixt with ſmall pebbles: The meat of this Tortoiſe is not pleaſant, but the egges more delicate then thoſe of the other two kinds: It would be as little regarded as the <hi>Caouanne,</hi> were it not ſought after for its precious ſhell: It conſiſts of fifteen greater and leſſer leaves or pieces, ten where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are flat and even, four a little bending, and that which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the neck, made triangle-wiſe, hollow like a little buckler: All the ſhells of an ordinary <hi>Caret</hi> may weigh three or four pound; but there have been ſome taken whoſe ſhells have been ſo large and ſo thick, that all together have weigh'd about ſix or ſeven pounds.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſhell of this kind of Tortoiſe are made Combs, Cups, Boxes, Caſes, Cabinets, and ſo many excellent things of great price: It alſo enriches Houſhold-ſtuff, the borders of Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes and Pictures, and is uſed now in the covering of Pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books of Devotion. To get this precious ſhell, they put a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fire under the upper ſhell which conſiſts of ſo many pieces; and as ſoon as they feel the heat they are eaſily taken off with the point of a knife.</p>
                  <p>Some affirm, that this kind of Tortoiſe is ſo vigorous, that its ſhell being taken away it will get another if it be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt into the Sea. The moſt plentiful fiſhing for theſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes is at the <hi>Peninſula</hi> of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> and ſeveral little Iſlands within the Gulf of <hi>Hondures:</hi> So that honeſt <hi>Pirard</hi> was ill-inform'd, who in his Treatiſe of the Animals and Fruits of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> Chap. 2. affirmes, that this kinde of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe is to be found only in the <hi>Maldivos</hi> and the <hi>Philippine-Iſlands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is affirmed by ſome, that the oyl of this kind of Tortoiſe helpeth all kinds of Gouts proceeding from cold cauſes: It is alſo very ſucceſsfully uſed to ſtrengthen the Sinews, to take away the pain of the Reins, and cure all cold Fluxions and Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>Having given ſo particular an account of the Tortoiſes, it will not be amiſs to adde thereto the manner how they are fiſh'd for, and how all the great fiſhes of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> are taken.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Sea-Tortoiſes are not only taken upon the ſand, as we ſhew'd before, but alſo by means of an Inſtrument, which is a pole about the length of a half-pike, at the end whereof there is faſten'd a nail pointed at both ends, which is ſquare in the midſt, and about the bigneſs of a mans little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Some make notches on that ſide of it which ſtands out of the wood, that it may take faſter hold when it is entred into the ſhell of the Tortoiſe.</p>
                  <p>In the night time, the Moon ſhining and the Sea calm, the Maſter-fiſher being in a little boat with two others, one at the oar to turn it of any ſide as faſt as ever he can, that the boat may go much faſter and with leſs noiſe then if it were row'd; the other is in the midſt of the Canow or Boat, holding the line which is faſten'd to the nail, and in a readineſs to draw it it as ſoon as the inſtrument hath done execution on the Tortoiſe.</p>
                  <p>Being thus provided, they go where they think to find of them; and when the Maſter-fiſher, who ſtands up on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Canow, perceives one of them by the glittering of the Sea, which by getting up ever and anon to the face of the water it cauſeth to foam, he directs him who guides the little veſſel to make to the place where he would have him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gently got neer the Tortoiſe, he violently darts the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into its back: The nail piercing the ſhell, gets alſo a good way into the fleſh, and the wood keeps up above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: As ſoon as the fiſh finds it ſelf hurt, it ſinks down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with the nail ſticking faſt in the ſhell: And the more it ſtrives and ſtruggles, the more it is entangled. At laſt having wearied it ſelf, and ſpent its forces in ſtriving by reaſon of its loſs of blood, it ſuffers it ſelf to be eaſily taken, and is either taken into the Canow, or drawn to the ſhore.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner they alſo take <hi>Lamantins,</hi> and ſeveral other great fiſhes; but inſtead of the nail there is put into the wooden inſtrument a great hook, or a ſmall dart of iron made like that of a ſharp lance: On one ſide of that piece of iron there is a hole, through which there paſſeth a line, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo woond about the dart, ſo that when it is darted into the fiſh, the line eaſily is let looſe, that it may have the liberty to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble up and down in the water, and when it hath ſpent its forces, and reduc'd to extremity, if it cannot be gotten into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now, it is eaſily drawn to the ſhore, where they divide it into quarters.</p>

                  <p>THe Land-Tortoiſes are found in ſome Iſlands neer the freſh-water Rivers, which are leaſt ſubject to inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or in the ponds and fenny places that are fartheſt from the Sea: They are cover'd all over with a hard and ſolid ſhell, which is not to be rais'd by ſeveral pieces or leaves, as thoſe of the Sea-Tortoiſes, and it is ſo thick in all parts, that it ſecures the Animal living within it from any hurt, and will not be broken even though the wheels of a loaden Cart ſhould go over it. But what is yet more ſtrange, is, that the creature never finds this moving lodging too narrow for him; for it grows larger proportionably as the body of the poſſeſſor grows bigger: The upper covering is in ſome of them about a foot and a half in length: it is of an oval figure, ſomewhat hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low like a Buckler, and on the outſide hath ſeveral ſtreaks, which as it were divide it into ſo many compartiments, with a certain obſervance of Symmetry: All theſe intermixtures are laid on a black ground, which in ſeveral places is enamell'd with white and yellow.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Tortoiſe hath a very ugly head, like that of a Serpent: It hath no teeth, but only jaws, which are ſtrong enough to break what it would ſwallow down: It is ſupported by four feet, ſomewhat weak to ſuſtain the weight of its body; nor does it upon purſuit truſt much to them: For if he be not neer ſome river or pond into which he may caſt himſelf, he places all refuge and ſafety in the covering of his manſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which like a Hedg-hog he immediately draws in his head, feet and tail, upon the firſt apprehenſion of any danger.</p>
                  <p>The Female lays egges about the bigneſs of thoſe of Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but a little longer: Having cover'd them with ſand, ſhe leaves them to be hatch'd by the Sun. Though there be ſome who hold that the meat of theſe Land-Tortoiſes is of hard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, yet thoſe who have eaten thereof rank it among the moſt delicate diſhes of <hi>America:</hi> The Phyſicians of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try adviſe thoſe who are inclin'd to Dropſies to uſe it often for a preventive: They have alſo found by experience, that the blood of theſe Tortoiſes dried and reduc'd to powder takes away the poyſon of Vipers and Scorpions, being apply'd to the wound: It is alſo certain, that the aſhes of their ſhells mixt with the white of an egge cures the chaps in Nurſing-womens nipples; and if the head be powder'd therewith, it prevents the falling of the Hair.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere are found in all the <hi>Caribby-Iſlands</hi> certain Crabs or Crab-fiſh, which are a kind of amphibious <hi>Crevices,</hi> and very good meat, whereas thoſe of <hi>Braſil</hi> are unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, in aſmuch as they ſmell of the Juniper-root. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Indian Inhabitants very highly eſteem theirs, and make them their ordinary entertainment: They are all of an oval figure, having the tail turning in under the belly: Their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are cover'd all over with a ſhell hard enough, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſeveral feet which are all full of little prickles, which facilitate their climbing up to thoſe places whither they would get up: The two fore-feet are very big, and of thoſe one is ſomewhat bigger then the other: The French call theſe two fore feet or claws, <hi>Mordants,</hi> ſignificantly enough, foraſmuch as with theſe they twitch and ſecure whatſoever they have faſtened on: The fore-part which is ſomewhat broader, and ſtands up higher then the other, hath ſtanding a little out two eyes, which are ſolid, tranſparent, and of ſeveral colours: Their mouths are armed with two little white teeth diſpos'd on each ſide like a pair of ſharp pincers, wherewith they cut the leaves of Fruits, and the roots of Trees on which they feed.</p>

                  <p>THere are three kinds of them, differing in bigneſs and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, of which the leaſt are thoſe commonly called <hi>Tourlourous:</hi> They have a red ſhell marked with black-ſpots; they are pleaſant enough to the taſte, but in regard there is much picking work about them, and but little to be gotten from them, and that it is conceived they incline people to the bloody flux, they are uſed only in caſe of neceſſity.</p>

                  <p>THere are others all white, and have their abodes at the foot of Trees on the Sea-ſide, in certain holes which they make in the ground, into which they retreat, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies do into their Clappers or Hutches: Theſe are the biggeſt of all the kinds, nay there have been thoſe taken which have had in one of their claws as much meat as an egge might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58704:84"/>
and as delicate as that of the River-Crevices: They are ſeldom ſeen in the day time; but in the night they come in multitudes out of their holes to feed under the Trees; and it is then that they are taken with the help of a Lanthorn or Torches: They delight very much to be under the Arched-Indian-Fig-tree, and other Trees which are on the Sea-ſide, and in the moſt fenny places: If a man ſhall ſearch into the ground, or in the ſand to get them out of their lurking places, he ſhall always find half their bodies in water, as moſt of the other amphibious creatures are.</p>

                  <p>BUt thoſe of the third kind, which as to bulk is between the two others before mentioned, are the moſt beautiful, the moſt to be admired, and the moſt eſteem'd of all: They are indeed much of the ſame figure with the precedent; but according to the ſeveral Iſlands, and different ſoils wherein they are bred, they are painted with ſo many colours, and thoſe ſo beautiful and lively, that there cannot be a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement then to ſee theſe creatures at mid-day creeping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Trees where they ſeek for their ſuſtenance: Of ſome of them the bodies are of a violet colour intermixt with white: others are of a bright yellow interlaced with ſeveral ſmall greyiſh and purple lines, which begin at the mouth and are drawn down over the back: Nay there are ſome which upon a dark-colour'd ground are ſtreaked with red, yellow and green, which makes the richeſt mixture of colours that can be imagin'd; looking on them at a little diſtance a man would think, that all thoſe delightful colours wherewith they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enamell'd, were not yet fully dry, ſuch is their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or that they were newly varniſh'd over to give them the greater luſtre.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Painted Crabs</hi> are not like the white ones, which dare not appear in the day time; for theſe are to be ſeen morning and evening, and after the rains under the Trees, where they recreate themſelves in great companies together: They will alſo ſuffer a man to come neer enough to them; but as ſoon as they perceive him make any attempt to take them (which is beſt done with a little wand, it being too dangerous to employ the hands) they make their retreat without turning their backs on thoſe that purſue them, and as they go back they ſhew their teeth, and opening their defenſives, which are thoſe two Claws or Mordants they have in their feet, they therewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their whole body, and they ever and anon ſtrike them one againſt another to frighten their enemies: And in that poſture they get into their forts, which are commonly under the root, or in the cleft of ſome rotten Tree, or that of ſome rock.</p>

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:58704:84"/>Theſe Crabs have this natural inſtinct, to go every year about <hi>May,</hi> in the ſeaſon of the rains, to the Sea-ſide to waſh themſelves, and diſburthen themſelves of their egges, in order to the perpetuation of their ſpecies: They come down from the Mountains in ſuch multitudes, that the high-ways and woods are covered with them; and they have this ſtrange direction given them, that they take their way towards that part of the Iſland where there are Creeks and deſcents, whereby they may the more eaſily come to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants are at that time very much annoy'd by them, in regard they fill their Gardens, and with their little Mordants they cut the Peaſe and young Plants of Tobacco: They obſerve ſuch an order in this deſcent, that they look like an Army marching in rank and file: they never break their ranks, and whatever they meet with by the way, Houſes, Mountains, Rocks, or other obſtacles, they attempt to get over them, that they may go on ſtill in a ſtrait line: Twice a day they make a halt, during the greateſt heat, both to feed and reſt themſleves a while: But they make greater journies in the night then in the day, till at laſt they get to the Sea-ſide.</p>
                  <p>When they are upon this expedition they are fat, and good to eat; the Males being full of meat, and the Females of egges: And indeed during that time, a man may have of them at his door: Nay ſometimes they come into the houſes if the palizadoes be not cloſe enough, and that they meet with a place to get in at: The noiſe they make in the night time is greater then that of the Mice, and keeps people from ſleeping: When they are come to the Sea-ſide, having reſted themſelves a little, and conſider'd the Sea as the nurſe of their young ones, they approach ſo neer it, that they waſh themſelves three or four times in the little waves which gently riſe and fall on the ſand: then having retired into the Woods or neighbouring Plains to recover their wearineſs, the Females return a ſecond time to the Sea, and having waſh'd themſelves a little, they open their tails, which are commonly thruſt up under the belly, and ſhake out the egges faſten'd thereto into the water: After which having once more waſh'd themſelves, they return in the ſame order in which they came thither.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrongeſt of them ſoon recover the Mountains, every one making to the quarter from whence he came, and by the ſame way through which he had paſs'd before: But then, that is, in their return, they are for the moſt part ſo weak and lean, that they are forc'd to make ſome ſtay in the next fields they come at to refreſh themſelves, and retrive their former vigour before they can get up to the tops of Mountains.</p>
                  <p>As to the Egges thus committed to the Sea, having been caſt up by it on the ſofter kind of ſand, and warm'd ſome time by the beams of the Sun, they are at laſt hatch'd, and become lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58704:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Crabs, whereof there may be ſeen millions about the bigneſs of a large farthing, getting into the neighbouring buſhes till ſuch time as they are ſtrong enough to get to the old ones in the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>Another conſiderable thing in theſe Crabs, is, that once a year, to wit, after their return from the Sea, they are under ground for the ſpace of ſix weeks, ſo that there is not one of them to be ſeen: During this time they change their ſkin or ſhell, and become wholly new: They work out the earth ſo neatly at the entrance of their retreats, that there is no hole to be ſeen; which they do to prevent their taking of any air; for when they put off their old coat, their whole body is as it were naked, being only cover'd with a very thin pellicle, which grows thicker and harder by degrees, till it come to the ſolidity of the ſhell they had put off.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>du Montel</hi> relates, that he purpoſely cauſed ſome places to be digg'd where it was likely there were of them hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Having met with them, he found them wrapp'd in leaves of Trees, which no doubt was their ſuſtenance, and ſerv'd them for a neſt during that retirement; but they were ſo weak and unable to endure the air, that they ſeemed as it were half dead, though fat enough, and excellent meat, and as ſuch high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed by the Inhabitants: Cloſe by them he found the ſhell they had put off, which ſeem'd to be as entire as if the animal had been ſtill within it: And what was ſtrange, though he look'd very narrowly, yet hardly could he find any hole, or cleft at which the body of it might get out of that priſon: But having view'd it very exactly, he found a little disjunction neer the tail, at which the Crab had ſlipped out.</p>
                  <p>They are commonly dreſs'd as the Crevices in theſe parts are; but the more delicate will take the time and pains, after they are boiled, to pick out all that is good in the claws, and to extract a certain oily ſubſtance which is in the body, and by ſome called <hi>Taumaly,</hi> and to fry all together with the egges of the female, putting thereto a little of the Country Pepper, and ſome juice of Oranges; and this makes it one of the moſt dainty diſhes in the <hi>Caribbies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe grounds where there are many of the Trees called <hi>Manchenillos,</hi> the Crabs which feed under them, or eat of the fruit, have a venemous quality, inſomuch that thoſe who eat thereof fall dangerouſly ſick: But in other parts they are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom enough, and as the Crevices in <hi>Europe</hi> are numbred among the delicacies: Such as are careful of their health open them them before they eat thereof, and if they be black within they think them dangerous, and uſe them not.</p>

                  <head>HURRICANE.</head>
                  <p>WHat is moſt to be feared is a general conſpiracy of all the Winds, which goes about the Compaſs in the ſpace of 24 hours, and ſometimes in leſs. This is that which is called a <hi>Hurricane,</hi> and happens commonly in the moneths of <hi>July, Auguſt,</hi> or <hi>September:</hi> at other times there is no fear of it. Heretofore it happened but once in ſeven years, and ſometimes ſeldomer; but within theſe few years it hath happened once every two years, nay in one year there happened two of them: Nay not long after Monſieur <hi>Auber</hi> was ſent to command in chief at <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> there were three Hurricanes in one year.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Tempeſt is ſo violent, that it breaks and unroots Trees, deprives thoſe it takes not away of all verdure, makes deſolate whole Foreſts, removes Rooks from the tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58704:86"/>
and caſts them into the Valleys, overthrows Houſes, carries away the Plants it hath forc'd out of the Earth into the Sea, makes a general waſte of all it meets with in the Fields; and in a word, leaves famine all over the Country, which groans a long time after that diſaſter, and will be a long time ere it recovers the ruines occaſion'd thereby.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the Hurricane all this miſchief only by Land, but it raiſes withall ſuch a tempeſt on the Sea, that it ſeems to be mixt and confounded with the Air and the Sky: It breaks to pieces the Ships that happen to be on the Coaſts at that time, caſting ſome upon the ſhores, and ſwallowing others into the Abyſſes of the Deep: So that thoſe which eſcape ſhipwrack at ſuch a time, are extreamly oblig'd to acknowledg the great mercy of God towards them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who obſerve the ſigns preceding this Tempeſt, have particularly noted theſe; That a little before it happens the Sea becomes of a ſudden ſo calm and even, that there appears not the leaſt wrinkle on her face; That the Birds by a natural inſtinct come down in multitudes from the Mountains, where they make their ordinary abode, to retire into the Plains and Valleys, where they keep on the ground to ſecure themſelves againſt the injuries of the cruel weather which they foreſee coming; And that the Rain which falls a little before is bitter and ſalt, as the Sea-water.</p>
                  <p>It is not many years ſince that there happen'd a memorable example of this Tempeſt upon ſeveral Ships lying in the Road of S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> loaden with Tobacco, and ready to ſet ſail; For they were all broken to pieces and caſt away, and the Commodities wholly loſt: Whereof there follow'd another ſtrange and unexpected accident, which was, that moſt of the fiſh upon the Coaſt was poyſoned by the Tobacco: The Sea ſeem'd in a manner cover'd with thoſe poor creatures, which turn'd upſide-down and languiſhing floated on the face of the water, and came to dye on the ſhore.</p>
                  <p>Nor are theſe diſaſters particular only to the New-World, but there have been ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> and other places ſuch dreadful Tempeſts as might well be accounted Hurricanes. In the year M. D. XCIX. there roſe neer <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wind, that it broke and unrooted moſt of the great Trees which were able to reſiſt, eſpecially the Wall-nut-trees, whoſe boughs are commonly very large, and tranſported ſome of them above five hundred paces from the place where they grew: But the weaker Trees which gave way were ſpared: The Palace of <hi>Poictiers</hi> receiv'd much hurt; divers Steeples were batter'd, and that of <hi>Cangres</hi> neer <hi>Saumur</hi> quite blown down: Some perſons on horſe-back in the fields were carried above ſixty paces out of their way: For the ſpace of ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven leagues, as far as it blew, there was nothing but ruine and confuſion.</p>

                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:58704:86"/>[To this place may be reduced, among others, that Tempeſt which happen'd here in <hi>England</hi> at the removal out of this world of the late Uſurper <hi>Oliver Cromwel;</hi> the miſchiefs whereof are yet freſh in mens minds; as alſo that in <hi>February,</hi> 1661.]</p>
                  <p>To give an example of a Hurricane that ſhew'd its malice here in <hi>Europe,</hi> particularly on the Sea, we ſhall adde the Copy of a Letter from a Merchant of <hi>Rochel</hi> to a Correſpondent of his at <hi>Rouen,</hi> dated <hi>January</hi> the 30th, M. DC. XLV.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We have been in a very ſad condition theſe two days, by reaſon of the extraordinary Tempeſt which began Saturday night laſt, the 28th of this month, and continues yet: We ſee from our Walls between thirty and forty Ships caſt a way, and forc'd to the ſhore, moſt Engliſh bottoms, and abundance of Merchandize loſt: One of theſe Ships of 200 Tun burthen was caſt neer a Wind-mill, which is twelve foot higher then any tide was ever ſeen; for the Tempeſt was not only in the Air, but it alſo forc'd the Sea much beyond its ordinary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, inſomuch that the ſpoil it hath done by Land very much exceeds the loſs of the Ships. All the Salt on the low Marſhes was carried away; all the Wheat on the lower grounds and reduced marches overflown: And in the Iſle of <hi>Ree</hi> the Sea croſs'd it from one ſide to the other, ſpoil'd abundance of Vineyards, and drown'd much Cattel. In the memory of man the Sea never came up ſo high; nay it came to ſome places almoſt a league within the Land: So that thoſe who have been at S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> affirm, that the Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes happening there are not more dreadful then this Tempeſt was here: The wind was North-weſt: The loſs both on Sea and Land is valued at five hundred thouſand Crowns: 'Tis conceiv'd there is as much Salt loſt as would have freighted two hundred Ships of three hundred Tun a piece. There are alſo loſt ſome Dutch Ships neer the Iſle of <hi>Ree,</hi> at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and <hi>Bayonne,</hi> which were very richly laden. Whence it appears that theſe Tempeſts are as violent in <hi>Europe</hi> as thoſe ſo much feared in the <hi>Caribbies.</hi>

                  <p>But in thoſe parts, ſome to ſecure themſelves from theſe Storms forſake their houſes, out of a fear to be over-whelm'd in their ruines, and make their abode in Caves and the clefts of Rocks, or lye flat on the ground in the open fields, till they be over: Others run to ſome houſe neer them, which they think ſo ſtrongly built, as that it may elude the ſhocks of that Tempeſt; for now there are in the <hi>Caribbies</hi> many ſtructures that in a manner defie the violence thereof: Nay there are ſome will get into the little Huts built by the Negroes, in imitation of thoſe of the <hi>Caribbians;</hi> for it hath been found by experience, that theſe Hurts, being round and having no place open but the door, and whereof the Rafters ſtand upon the ground, are

               <p>BEſides the Thunder, Earth-quakes and Hurricanes, which ſhake the very foundations, and blaſt the beauty of the <hi>Caribby-Iſlands,</hi> there are ſome other Inconveniences which much annoy the Inhabitants, though not ſo much to be feared as the precedent. Theſe we have reſerv'd to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this laſt Chapter, wherein out of the deſire we have to contribute all lyes in us to the well-being and ſatisfaction of thoſe amiable Colonies, we ſhall propoſe the remedies which the experience of the ancient Inhabitants, and the judgment of ſeveral eminent Phyſicians have found moſt proper and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to ſecure them from thoſe dangerous conſequences.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>MOUSTICOES, and MARINGOINS.</head>
                  <p>THere is then, in the firſt place, a ſort of very ſmall Flies, by ſome called <hi>Mouſticoes,</hi> which are felt commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſeen: But in that little weak body there is ſo ſharp and venemous a ſting, as cauſing an importunate itch that will not be ſatisfi'd till the ſkin be ſcratch'd off, the wound degenerates into a dangerous Ulcer if ſome remedy be not apply'd.</p>
                  <p>There is another kind ſomwhat bigger, and making a noiſe like that of the Flies, ſeen in theſe parts neer ponds and fenny places, by ſome of the Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringoins:</hi> They do the ſame effect with the former, being arm'd with a little ſting which pierces through cloaths, nay through the Hammocks, or hanging-beds on which people reſt themſelves: But both kinds have this particular to them, that they never do any miſchief, but they before-hand proclaim a war, and ſound a charge with their little Trumpet, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times does more frighten then their ſtinging hurts.</p>
                  <p>To avoid the annoyance of theſe two little Inſects, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants place their houſes on a little eminency, give them air on all ſides, and cut down all the Trees which may hinder the Eaſt-wind, which is the ordinary wind blowing in thoſe Iſlands, and which drives away theſe wicked and importunate enemies:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58704:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thoſe alſo who have their lodgings and beds very cloſe are not ſo much troubled therewith.</p>
                  <p>But if notwithſtanding theſe precautions any be annoy'd thereby, they need only take Tobacco in the room, or make a fire that ſhall ſmoak much, and theſe diſturbers of mens reſt will be gone: And if they have ſtung any one, and he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be rid of the itch which follows, let him only wet the place ſtung with Vinegar, or the juyce of the leſſer kind of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and he ſhall have eaſe.</p>

                  <head>MANCHENILLO.</head>
                  <p>IN moſt of theſe Iſlands there grow certain Trees called by ſome <hi>Manchenillo-trees,</hi> beautiful to the eye, bearing leaves like thoſe of Crab-trees, and a fruit called <hi>Manchenillo,</hi> like an <hi>Appius-apple;</hi> for it is ſtreaked with red, extreamly fair, and of a pleaſant ſcent, inſomuch that one can hardly forbear taſting it if he be not before-hand acquainted with its dangerous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for though it be ſweet in the mouth, yet is it ſo fatal that being eaten it ſends a man to ſleep, not for 24 hours, (as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeed of <hi>Peru,</hi> and an herb in the Eaſt, whereof <hi>Linſcot</hi> ſpeaks at large) but ſo as never to awake again; ſo that it is much worſe then thoſe Almonds of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which ſmell like muſk, but being eaten leave a taſte of rottenneſs behind them; as alſo then the fair Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which being opened yield only ſoot and aſhes; for if a man have the miſchance to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in them, it is without any hazard of his life: But theſe venemous Apples may be compared to the <hi>Indian-nut</hi> which grows in <hi>Java:</hi> It is ſomwhat like a Gall, and at the firſt eating thereof it taſtes like a ſmall Nut; but afterwards it cauſeth mortal gripings, and is a moſt dangerous poyſon: There is alſo in <hi>Africk</hi> a Tree called <hi>Coſcoma,</hi> which bears deadly Apples: The Tree of the <hi>Maldivas,</hi> named <hi>Ambou,</hi> bears a fruit no leſs deceitful and pernicious: And neer <hi>Tripoly</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> there are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58704:88"/>
certain large Apricocks, which are fair to the eye, and very ſavoury to the palat; but the ſubſequent qualities of them are many times mortal, or at beſt, cauſe long and painful diſeaſes to ſuch as have eaten of them.</p>
                  <p>There grow <hi>Manchenillo</hi>-Trees on the Sea-ſide and the banks of Rivers, and if the fruit fall into the water, the fiſh eating thereof will certainly dye; nay though it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long in the water, yet will it not rot, but is cover'd with ſalt-peter, which gives it a ſolid cruſtineſs, as if it were petrify'd. In thoſe Iſlands where this Tree grows in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance the Snakes are venemous, it being ſuppoſed by ſome, that they ſometimes ſuck the fruit of it: Nay the Crabs which feed under theſe Trees contract a dangerous quality from them, as we ſaid elſewhere; and many have been ſick after the eating thereof: Whence it comes, that when theſe fruits fall to the ground, ſuch as are careful of their health will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the eating of Crabs.</p>
                  <p>Yet do not the Snakes or Crabs wholly live on this fruit, but feeding under the Tree they draw the infection thereof to themſelves, eſpecially if they ſuck the venome of its fruit. It may well be, that what is mortal to ſome creatures is not ſo to all; and that theſe Inſects often feeding on this poyſon, do by cuſtom and continuance turn it into their ſuſtenance, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Mithridates:</hi> And ſo they may infect ſuch as eat thereof, receiving themſelves no hurt thereby.</p>
                  <p>Under the bark of the trunk and boughs of theſe Trees there is contained a certain glutinous water, which is white as milk, extremely malignant and dangerous: There being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them along the high-ways, if one ſhould careleſly break one of their branches, that milk or rather poyſon comes forth, and falls upon him: If it light on his ſhirt, it makes an ugly ſtain as if it were burnt; if on the ſkin, and the place be not immediately waſh'd, it will be all bliſtered: but if it ſhould chance that a drop of this cauſtick and venemous water ſhould fall into the eye, it will cauſe an inſupportable inflammation, and the party ſhall loſe his ſight for nine days, after which he will have ſome eaſe.</p>
                  <p>The dew, or rain-water, having continu'd a while on the leaves of theſe Trees, produces the ſame effect, and if it ſhould light on the ſkin, it would ſcorch it like Aqua-fortis: So that it is almoſt as bad as the drops of rain falling under the Line, which are ſo contagious, as thoſe who have felt them affirm, that if they fall on the hands, face, or any uncover'd part of the body, there immediately riſe up bladders and bliſters with much pain; and if the party do not preſently ſhift his cloths, his body will be full of wheals all over; not to mention the worms which are bred in the cloths.</p>
                  <p>Nay the very ſhade of theſe Trees is prejudicial to men,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58704:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and if a man reſt himſelf under them, the whole body ſwells after a ſtrange manner. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> mention a Tree of <hi>Arcadia</hi> no leſs dangerous; and thoſe who have travell'd into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> affirm, that there is an herb named <hi>Sapony,</hi> which cauſes their death who lye upon it. But what heightens the ill quality of the <hi>Manchenillo</hi>-Tree, is, that the meat dreſs'd with a fire made of its wood derives a certain malignity from it, which burns the mouth and throat.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the Savages of theſe Iſlands ignorant of the nature of the <hi>Manchenillo;</hi> for the compoſition wherewith they are wont to poyſon their arrows hath in it, among other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the milk of this Tree, and the dew falling from it, and the juice of the fruit.</p>
                  <p>To cure, in a ſhort time, the ſwelling and bliſters riſing on the body after ſleeping under the ſhade of theſe Trees, or receiving the rain or dew falling from their branches, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe occaſion'd by the milk within the bark, recourſe muſt be immediately made to a kind of Snails, whereof we have ſpoken before, under the name of <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and let the party take a certain cleer water which is contain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their ſhell, and apply it to the place affected: this remedy immediately allays the venome of that ſcorching liquour, and puts the party out of all danger: The oyl extracted without fire from the ſame Snail operates the ſame effect. But if any ſhall happen to eat of the fruit of theſe venemous Trees, he muſt uſe the remedies preſcribed hereafter, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the venome of Serpents, and all other poyſons.</p>

                  <p>THere is alſo a kind of Ant, or worm, which hath a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle black ſpot on the head, all the reſt of the body being white: They are bred of rotten wood, and thence ſome call them <hi>Wood-lice:</hi> Their bodies are ſofter then thoſe of our ordinary Ants, and yet their tooth is ſo ſharp, that they gnaw wood, and get into ſuch coffers as lye neer the ground: And in leſs then two days, if they be not deſtroy'd, there will get in ſuch abundance, that linen, cloaths, paper, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is within them will be eaten and devoured; nay they gnaw and eat the poſts which ſuſtain the ordinary hutts, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if ſome courſe be not taken they will at laſt fall down.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the breeding of theſe Inſects, and the miſchief done by them, there are theſe cautions: At the building of houſes not to leave any wood on the ground to rot, out of which they may breed: To burn the ends of thoſe pieces of wood that are planted in the ground: As ſoon as any of them are perceiv'd, to caſt ſcalding water into the holes which they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58704:89"/>
have made: To hang up Cheſts and Coffers in the air with cords, as they are forc'd to do in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> that they may not touch the ground: And laſtly, to keep the rooms very clean, and leave nothing on the ground. It hath alſo been obſerv'd, that the rubbing of their haunts with the oyl of that kind of <hi>Palma-Chriſti</hi> wherewith the Negroes rub their heads to avoid vermine, hath prevented their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more that way. The oyl of <hi>Lamantin</hi> hath the ſame effect, and if it be poured on their rendezvouz, which is a kind of Ant-hill made up of their own ordure, and faſten'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the forks which ſuſtain the hutts, they immediately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it.</p>

                  <head>RAVETS.</head>
                  <p>ANother dangerous vermine are the <hi>Ravets,</hi> of which there are two kinds: The bigger are almoſt like Locuſts, and of the ſame colour; the others are not half as big: Both kinds have their walks in the night-time, get into Cheſts if they be not very cloſe, foul all things wherever they come, and do miſchief enough, yet not ſo much, nor in ſo ſhort a time, as the Wood-lice. They are called <hi>Ravets,</hi> becauſe like Rats they gnaw whatever they come at: They are no doubt the ſame which <hi>de Lery</hi> calls <hi>Aravers,</hi> according to the Language of the <hi>Braſilians.</hi> This vermine hath a particular malice to Books, and their covers. The Wood-lice are as good, if they can get at them; but they are to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this particular, that they have a reſpect for the letters, and only nibble about the margents; for whether they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with the ink, or for ſome other reaſon, it muſt be an extraordinary famine that ſhall force them to feed on the impreſſion, or writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they are very great lovers of linen above any thing, and if they can get into a Cheſt, they will deſire but one night to make work enough for many Sempſtreſſes for a month.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Ravets,</hi> though they be not ſo quick at their work, yet they ſpare nothing but ſilk and cotton-ſtuffs; nay they have no ſtomach to ſilk or cotton even while it is raw; inſomuch that if the Cheſts be hung up in the air, and the cords be done about with cotton, as ſoon as they find their little feet faſten'd in it, they immediately endeavour to get away, and turn ſomewhere elſe. Such as dwell in houſes of brick or ſtone are not troubled with the Wood-lice, but with all their care they have much ado to avoid the miſchief done by the <hi>Ravets:</hi> Yet hath it been found by experience, that they cannot endure ſweet ſcents, and that they would not willingly get into Cheſts made of Cedar, and thoſe excellent ſweet woods which are common in all theſe Iſlands. At <hi>Cairo</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:58704:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they put the pedeſtalls of Cabinets in veſſels full of water, to prevent the creeping up of the Ants. This eaſie ſecret might produce the ſame effect in the <hi>Caribbies</hi> to keep off the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Ravets, nay alſo the Ants, which are there alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely troubleſome.</p>

                  <head>CHEGOES.</head>
                  <p>BUt what is moſt to be feared in all theſe Iſlands is a certain kind of little worm, no bigger then a hand-worm, which breeds in the duſt, in the ſweepings caſt out into the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and ſuch unclean places: Theſe are commonly called <hi>Chegoes.</hi> They get into peoples feet, and under the nails of their toes; but if they get any further, and are not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in time, they will get into all the other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. At firſt they only cauſe a little itching, but having once got through the ſkin, they cauſe an inflammation in the place affected, and though very little when they entred it, come in time to be as big as a pea, and produce abundance of nits, which may breed others; and ſo many times ulcers are bred in the places whence they are taken.</p>
                  <p>The Savages, as they relate who have liv'd among them, have a certain gum, wherewith having rubb'd their feet, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially under the nails, they are not annoy'd with this vermine: But ſuch as know not that ſecret are advis'd to have their feet ſearch'd by thoſe who have the ſkill to diſcover and take out thoſe dangerous Inſects, as ſoon as they feel the leaſt itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; at which work the Indians are very expert and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Thoſe who take out theſe <hi>Chegoes</hi> muſt have a care that they break not the bag wherein they are encloſed; which if they do, ſome of their little egges will remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, which will infallibly breed others. It is conceived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the <hi>Roucou,</hi> which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> uſe to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more beautiful, more nimble, and more active to run, hath a ſecret vertue to keep off all theſe vermine.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo a good remedy often to ſprinkle ſalt-water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the room; not to go bare-foot; to wear ſtockings of Goats-leather; and to keep ones ſelf very clean: For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly only ſuch as are careleſs of themſelves, and ſlovenly, are much troubled with them. Theſe little worms are the ſame with thoſe which the <hi>Braſilians</hi> call <hi>Tons,</hi> and ſome other Indians <hi>Nigas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have Ulcers cauſed by theſe little worms, either for want of taking them out ſkilfully or in time, are among the French called <hi>Malingres.</hi> Theſe Ulcers come alſo many times after ſome little ſcratching, which at firſt ſeems to be little or nothing: But afterwards, the party may well wonder to ſee it as big as the palm of a mans hand; for the Ulcer muſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58704:90"/>
have its courſe: Nay ſome of them, though little, yet are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to be cured. Of theſe Ulcers there are two kinds; one round, the other uneven: The round Ulcer is harder to cure then the other, for it is encompaſs'd with dead fleſh, which makes it the worſe; for till that dead and looſe fleſh be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Ulcer cannot be cured: Therefore as often as the wound is dreſs'd, that dead fleſh muſt be quite cut away, which cauſes extraordinary pains.</p>
                  <p>Among the remedies for the healing of theſe Ulcers, there are uſed Verdi-greece, Aqua-fortis, the ſpirit of Vitriol, and burnt Allom, which eat away the dead fleſh: They uſe to the ſame end the juice of the leſſer Citron, which is extreamly ſharp; and when the wound is foul, it makes it clean, and look well: True it is, the pain which the party feels when the wound is rubbed therewith is ſo great, that he would rather pitch on any of the other remedies; but they do not heal ſo ſoon: There is alſo an Unguent made of common honey, a little ſharp Vinegar, and the powder of Verdi-greece, which cures Ulcers in a ſhort time: And to prevent them, let not any one make ſlight of the leaſt hurt or ſcratch that happens in any part of the body whatſoever, eſpecially the feet or legs, but to apply a plaiſter thereto, to take away the heat which may be in the wound; and in caſe there be no other remedy procurable, to put ſome Tobacco-leaves to it, and to uſe the juice of Citron and Vinegar, to take away the itch which remains after the ſtinging of the <hi>Mouſticoes</hi> and the <hi>Maringoins,</hi> rather then to make uſe of the nails.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixth Chapter of this Hiſtory, we ſaid there were Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and Snakes in the Iſlands of <hi>Martinico</hi> and St. <hi>Alouſia,</hi> which have a dangerous venom: We ſhall here aſſign the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which may be ſucceſsfully uſed in order to the taking away thereof. In the firſt place, be it obſerv'd, that they are to be uſed both inwardly and outwardly: Inwardly to comfort the heart, and diſſipate the venemous quality which might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over it, there are ſucceſsfully uſed Treacle, Mithridate, the Confection of Alkermes, Egyptian-Balm, <hi>Peru-Balm,</hi> Rue, Scordium, Scorzonera, Vipers-graſs, Angelico, and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hierva: But above all, the party ſtung muſt take down in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Burrage-water, Bugloſs-water, or ſome other liquor, the powder of the Liver and Heart of Vipers, the weight of a Crown-piece: In a word, he muſt uſe all thoſe things which fortifie the heart, and revive and refreſh the ſpirits: Outwardly there are to be applyed all the Remedies which have the vertue to draw and diſperſe all manner of venom: Such are Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes apply'd upon the ſcarified wound, as alſo all hot and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Medicaments, ſuch as are Galbanum, Ammoniacum, the fomentation of wine boil'd with the root of Dragon-wort, or the leaves of Mug-wort, Garlick, Onions, Pigeons dung, the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58704:90"/>
blood of Land-Tortoiſes dry'd and reduc'd to powder, and the like.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo not only requiſite, but very ſafe, as ſoon as may be to bind up the member affected, a little above the place where the party was ſtung, and immediately to make an inciſion, nay indeed to take away the piece, or at leaſt, as ſoon as it is ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd to apply thereto the outermoſt feather of a Chicken or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons wing to take away the venom; and that Chicken or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon being dead, to take another, till there be no venom left to be drawn.</p>
                  <p>It were alſo to be wiſh'd, that all the Inhabitants of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbies</hi> were furniſh'd with that excellent Antidote, approved in ſo many places in <hi>France,</hi> which is known under the famous name of <hi>Orvietan,</hi> and ſold at <hi>Paris</hi> at the <hi>New-bridge</hi> end, in the ſtreet called <hi>Rue Dauphine,</hi> at the ſign of the Sun: For that admirable ſecret, among many other rare qualities, hath the vertue to drive away the venom of all ſorts of Serpents, and to allay the force of the ſtrongeſt poyſons: Such as have been ſtung by venemous Serpents are to uſe it thus.</p>
                  <p>Take of it about the bigneſs of a Bean, diſſolv'd in wine; and after ſcarification made on the place ſtung, and drawing blood by the Cupping-glaſs, apply thereto a little <hi>Orvietan,</hi> and let care be taken that the Patient be kept awake at leaſt for twelve hours after. This ſovereign remedy loſes nothing of its goodneſs, though it be kept many years, ſo it be put up in a place not too hot, where it may be dry'd up; and if it be, it may be reduc'd to its conſiſtence with <hi>Mel roſatum;</hi> it may be alſo had in powder.</p>
                  <p>As to the diet to be obſerv'd during the uſe of this remedy; the Patient muſt abſtain from all meats that enflame the blood, or cauſe melancholy: He muſt alſo forbear purging and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for fear of drawing the venom inward; unleſs ſome of the nobler parts be in danger, in which caſe he may purge abundantly, and uſe baths, and things good to open the pores, and cauſe ſweating.</p>
                  <p>If a perſon be reduc'd to ſuch an extremity as that none of the forementioned Antidotes can be procured, let him make uſe of this which is very common and eaſily got: Let him who hath been bitten or ſtung by any venemous creature immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately eat the rind of a raw Citron, for it hath the vertue to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the heart from the venom: if it may be done, the place hurt muſt be bound as hard as can be endured, a little above the biting or ſtinging; then it muſt be ſcarifi'd, and let there be often apply'd thereto a mans faſting ſpittle; and if the beaſt which hath done the miſchief can be had, cut off the head of it, and pound it till it be reduc'd to a kind of Unguent, which muſt be apply'd hot to the wound: This is the ordinary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy uſed by the natural Inhabitants of <hi>Braſil</hi> to free themſelves
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58704:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the violent poyſon of that dangerous and monſtrous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which in their Language they call <hi>Boicinininga,</hi> and the Spaniards <hi>Caſcavel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Letters we receiv'd from <hi>Martinico</hi> aſſure us, that ſome conſiderable families lately come from <hi>Braſil</hi> with their Negroes to live in that Iſland, acquainted the inhabitants with ſeveral Herbs and Roots growing in the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> as well as <hi>Braſil,</hi> which are excellent to allay the venom of all kinds of Serpents and poyſon'd Arrows.</p>
                  <p>The forementioned remedies may alſo be uſed againſt the venom of the <hi>Becune,</hi> and all the other dangerous fiſhes. They may alſo be ſucceſsfully employ'd to prevent the pernicious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the juice of <hi>Manyoc,</hi> the <hi>Manchenillo-tree,</hi> and the ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Waſpes, Scorpions, and all other venemous Inſects.</p>

                  <p>MIce and Rats were creatures heretofore unknown to the <hi>Caribbians;</hi> but now ſince the coming in of ſo many Ships to thoſe Iſlands, and the caſting away of divers of them in the very Roads, where they afterwards rot, they have got to land, and are ſo multiply'd, that in ſome places they do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of miſchief among the Potatoes, Peaſe, Beans, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that kind of Wheat which is called Turkey-wheat: Nay did not the Snakes deſtroy them, and ſearch for them in their holes under ground, in the clefts of rocks, nay even in the coverings of houſes, which conſiſt of Palm-leaves, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-canes, it would no doubt be a very hard matter to ſecure Proviſions from them. Now indeed there are Cats in theſe Iſlands, which give them no quarter; nay, Dogs are taught to hunt them, and it is no ſmall diverſion to ſee how ſubtle they are to find them out, and expert in the hunting and killing of them.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this inconvenience particular to the <hi>Caribbies;</hi> nay it is much worſe in <hi>Peru;</hi> for <hi>Garcilaſſo,</hi> in his <hi>Royal Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>

affirms, that theſe peſtilent creatures being extreamly numerous in thoſe parts commit very great ſpoils, ranſacking the places through which they paſs, making the Fields deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and gnawing the Fruits even to the ſtalks, and roots of the Trees.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of the Iſlands have an invention which they call <hi>Balan,</hi> to keep the Rats from eating their <hi>Caſſava,</hi> and other Proviſions. This <hi>Balan</hi> is a kind of round hurdle, or haply ſquare, conſiſting of ſeveral ſtakes, on which they place the <hi>Caſſava</hi> after it hath been dried in the Sun: It is faſten'd at the top of the Hut, hanging down by a Witth or Cord; and that the Rats may not come down along the Cord, and ſo get to the <hi>Balan,</hi> they put the Cord through a ſmooth gourd which hangs looſe in the midſt of it, ſo that the Rats being come to that place, being not able to faſten their feet in it, and fearing the motion of the Gourd, are afraid to venture any further: Were it not for this ſecret, the Inhabitants would find it a hard taſk to keep their proviſions.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath the wiſe Author of Nature been pleas'd, by an admirable equipollence of perfections and imperfections, that thoſe Countries which have ſome advantages above others ſhould alſo be ſubject to thoſe inconveniences that are not to be found elſewhere. Thus hath the Divine Providence, whoſe buſineſs it is liberally to ſupply the exigencies of his Creatures, plac'd the preſervative neer the poyſon, the Remedy walking as it were hand in hand with the Diſeaſe, and ſo laid open to Man the inexhauſtible Treaſures of Grace and Nature, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him againſt the injuries of Air, the outrages of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the violence of Poyſons, and whatever the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that is moſt dangerous, ſince it became envenomed by the firſt Tranſgreſſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the precedent Diſcourſe we have given a full account of whatever might relate to the Natural Hiſtory of the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands; our deſign leads us now to that part of the Hiſtory which we call the MORAL, wherein we are to treat of the Inhabitants of the ſaid Iſlands, of whom we have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally made mention in the Deſcription we have given of thoſe places in the precedent Book. In the firſt place we ſhall ſpeak of thoſe Inhabitants thereof who are Strangers, or <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:58704:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet only ſo far as the proſecution of our Deſign requires; which having diſpatch'd, we ſhall deſcend to a more large and particular conſideration of the <hi>Indians,</hi> the natural and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Inhabitants of the Country; a taſk which requires a more ample deduction, and a more exact and curious diſquiſition, upon this preſumption, that there hath yet been very little publiſh'd upon that ſubject.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> grounding their Title upon the Donation of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, and ſome other apparent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Pretences, preſume that the right of Navigation into the late diſcover'd part of the World, which is call'd <hi>America,</hi> and of eſtabliſhing and ſetling Colonies there, whether it be in the Continent, or in any of the Iſlands, properly belongs to them, excluſively to all others. But not to urge that the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that arrogant preſumption is ſufficiently diſcover'd of it ſelf, and that it would prove a great digreſſion from the deſign of our Hiſtory to engage our ſelves in a particular diſquiſition of that Controverſie, we need only ſay, that <hi>Bergeron,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and curious Authour, hath ſo exactly handled this Queſtion, and ſo cleerly ſhewn the abſurdity of that chimerical pretence, in his Treatiſe of <hi>Navigations,</hi> that it would be loſt labour for us to inſiſt upon it, or to think of any thing new that can be produc'd upon that account. Accordingly all Chriſtian Kings and Princes have always diſputed thar pretended Right with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as unanimouſly concluding that he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly attributed the ſame to himſelf: Nor have they engag'd againſt him only by words and writings, but have effectually proſecuted their own pretenſions, and from time to time ſent Fleets into <hi>America</hi> to ſetle Plantations there, and to take into their poſſeſſion ſeveral parts of that new World; wherein the moſt ſucceſsful have been the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is to be obſerv'd, that of all the Colonies which theſe three European Nations have planted in <hi>America,</hi> thoſe that ſetled themſelves in the <hi>Caribby-Iſlands</hi> are of greateſt account, and the moſt frequented by Merchants, as being the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous upon the ſcore of Trade. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as may have been noted in the firſt Book of this Hiſtory, are the moſt conſiderable in thoſe parts, and have divided between them the greateſt, the richeſt, and the moſt populous of all thoſe Iſlands.</p>
               <p>We may further affirm it as a thing generally known, that theſe Nations have not in their ſeveral eſtabliſhments follow'd the inhumane and barbarous maximes of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor after their example unmercifully exterminated the originary Inhabitants of the Country; for if they found any of them in actual poſſeſſion of the Lands where they liv'd, they have for the moſt part preſerv'd them therein, and contracted alliances
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58704:93"/>
with them. Yet muſt it be acknowledg'd that the the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> have had very great differences with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that the ſaid differences have continu'd a long time; but the ground of their quarrels proceeded from ſome occaſions of diſcontent which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> receiv'd from ſome particular perſons of that Nation, which repreſented in a Body hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approv'd their procedure, and upon all emergencies hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd it ſelf ſo far diſſatisfi'd therewith, as to deſire that they ſhould be treated with the ſame humanity, moderation, and Chriſtian mildneſs, as thoſe greater and flouriſhing Colonies of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> that are under the juriſdiction of the ſaid <hi>Engliſh,</hi> have hitherto us'd towards the natural Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that part of <hi>America</hi> which lies more Northerly, where they have eſtabliſh'd themſelves; for it is known that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> hold ſo ſacred and perfect a correſpondence with them, as hath opened a way for their inſtruction in the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, and the planting of a great number of fair Churches amongſt thoſe poor Barbarians.</p>
               <p>But above all, this is moſt certain, that when the <hi>French</hi> eſtabliſh'd themſelves in the Iſlands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Martinico, Gardeloupe,</hi> and <hi>Granada,</hi> it was done with the consent of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable perſons among the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who thereupon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd thoſe of their Country-men who would have obſtructed the ſaid eſtabliſhment: Nay ſuch was their earneſtneſs therein, that they employ'd all their Forces and Councils to oppoſe the deſigns of the others, and to ſecure the <hi>French</hi> in the peaceable poſſeſſion of what they had before granted them. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abſolutely clears the <hi>French</hi> of being guilty of the ſame violences which are charg'd upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and makes it appear, that the ſetlement of the former in thoſe Iſlands was not like that of the latter in thoſe places where they have the opportunities to eſtabliſh themſelves. And if it be objected to the <hi>French,</hi> that they have forc'd the natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants out of S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> and <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> and that even at this preſent there is a War between the ſaid Nation and thoſe of <hi>Martinico;</hi> it may be anſwer'd, that when the <hi>French</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled theſe Iſlands, they propos'd to themſelves no other deſign then the edification and inſtruction of thoſe poor Barbarians, and that if contrary to their firſt intention they had been forc'd to uſe a ſevere hand towards ſome particular perſons, and to treat them as enemies, they were themſelves the occaſion of their own misfortune, by being the firſt Aggreſſors, and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of previous violations of the ſacred Laws of Alliance, which they had contracted with them, and engaging themſelves in ſanguinary counſels, ſuch as would have ſmother'd their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ere they were fully ſetled, had there not been a timely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery made thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Colonies had their beginning at the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58704:94"/>
ſame time, which was in the year One thouſand ſix hundred twenty and five: Monſieur <hi>Deſnambuc,</hi> a French Gentleman, of the ancient Houſe of <hi>Vauderop,</hi> and a Captain under the King of <hi>France</hi> in the Weſtern Seas, and Sir <hi>Thomas Warner,</hi> an Engliſh Gentleman, joyntly took poſſeſſion of the Iſland of S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> on the ſame day, in the names of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and Great <hi>Britain,</hi> their Maſters, that they might have a place of ſafe retreat, and a good Haven for the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Ships of both Nations as ſhould be bound for <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> that Iſland being furniſh'd with all the advantages whereof we have given a full account in the Chapter particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſign'd by us for the deſcription of it; upon which ſcore it was visited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who often put in there for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, both as they were inward and outward bound in their long Voyages: Nay ſometimes they left their ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k there to be look'd to by the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> with whom they had made a peace upon thoſe terms.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Gentlemen therefore conſidering with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that if they were poſſeſ'd of that Country they might the better incommodate their common enemy in <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and have withall a convenient and ſecure habitation, in order to the eſtabliſhment of the Colonies they intended for thoſe Iſlands, became Maſters of it, and left men therein to keep it: But before they parted thence, having ſome grounds to fear that there might be ſome ſecret intelligence between the <hi>Indians</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or that in their abſence they might execute the reſolution, which by the perſwaſion of certain Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers (a ſort of people in great eſteem among the <hi>Indians</hi>) they had undertaken, which was to put to death all the Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who were come into their Country, they in one night rid their hands of all the moſt factious of that Nation, and not long after forc'd all the reſt, who had got together into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies, and intended to ſtand upon their guard, to retire to ſome other places, and to leave that to their diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>Things being thus order'd, <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> returns into <hi>France,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Warner</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> where their conqueſt and all their proceedings thereupon were approved by the Kings their Maſters; and having obtained a permiſſion to carry over ſome recruits of men, they came back to the Iſland in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Governours and Lieutenants, under the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and Great <hi>Britany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> before he went over to cultivate and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his conqueſt imagin'd to himſelf, that the moſt likely way to have a powerful ſupport in <hi>France,</hi> ſuch as ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it ſelf in the preſervation of that Iſland, and ſo to ſecure and promote his deſigns, would be to get together a Company of perſons of Authority, which ſhould have the direction and ſigniory of the ſaid Iſland, and what others might afterwards
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58704:94"/>
be conquer'd and reduc'd under the juriſdiction of the King of <hi>France;</hi> upon this proviſion, that the ſaid Company ſhould have a care, and make it their earneſt buſineſs to ſupply the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony with men for the keeping and cultivation of it; as alſo with Eccleſiaſticks to be maintain'd by allowances from the ſaid Company; and laſtly to build certain Forts there for the ſecurity of the Inhabitants, and to furniſh them with Canon, Powder, and all ſorts of Ammunition; in a word, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſufficient Arſenal, wherein ſhould be all things in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to oppoſe the Enemy.</p>
               <p>This Company, or Society, was eſtabliſh'd in the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſix hundred twenty and ſix, as well for the Government of S. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> as thoſe other Iſlands which are adjacent thereto, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the King of <hi>France.</hi> Since that time it hath been further confirm'd, and favour'd with ſome new Conceſſions, and very advantageous priviledges obtain'd from his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty the eighth of <hi>March,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred forty and two, for all the Iſlands of <hi>America</hi> lying between the tenth and thirtieth degree on this ſide the Equator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> having thus order'd his affairs in <hi>France,</hi> returns to S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> with a recruit of three hundred men, which the Gentlemen of the Company newly erected had raiſed, in order to the advancement of that Colony: He brought over a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>o along with him a conſiderable number of gallant Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who look'd on it as no ſmall honour to run fortunes with ſo famous an Adventurer, and to participate of his honourable hazards, out of a confidence in proceſs of time of reaping the fruit of his Conqueſts. They got all ſafely to S. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> about the beginning of the year, M. DC. XXVII. and though they had ſuffered much during their Voyage, and were moſt of them either sick or much weakned, yet were they not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd by thoſe difficulties, but reflecting that the nobleſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes are many times attended by great inconveniences, and that Roſes cannot be gather'd without thorns, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fell to work, and having in a ſhort time learn'd of thoſe whom they found in the Iſle what they were to do in order to their further eſtabliſhment, they behav'd themſelves anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the generous deſigns of their Captain, who on his part more and more encourag'd them by words and example.</p>
               <p>How the Iſland was to be divided between the two Nations had been deſign'd before that Voyage; but the particular Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Diviſion were ſolemnly agreed to and concluded on the 13th of <hi>May,</hi> in the ſaid year, M. DC. XXVII. For to the end that every one might employ himſelf with ſome aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon his own ſtock, and that no differences might ariſe between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> M. <hi>Warner</hi> being return'd from <hi>England</hi> ſome time before the arrival of <hi>Deſnambuc,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:58704:95"/>
where he had alſo recommended his affairs to the direction of a Company which undertook the advancement of his enterpriſes, they divided the whole Iſland between them, and ſet thoſe Boundaries to their ſeveral diviſions, which are remaining to this day, but with this particular proviſion that Fiſhing and Hunting ſhould be equally free to the Inhabitants of both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that the Salt-ponds, the more precious kinds of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fit for Dying, or Joyners-work, Havens and Mines ſhould in like manner be common.</p>
               <p>Nay it was further agreed upon by certain Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on both ſides, that a good correſpondence ſhould be maintain'd between them, as alſo for the preventing of all jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and avoiding the occaſions of diſputes and conteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which might eaſily ariſe between people of different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: They further made a Defenſive League for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual relief of each other, if occaſion ſhould require, againſt the attempts of the common Enemy, or any other who ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſturb the peace and quiet which they hoped to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy together in thoſe parts of the Country where they had planted themſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus ſetled, the two Governours betray'd a certain emulation in carrying on the eſtabliſhment of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; in the proſecution whereof it is moſt certain the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had very conſiderable advantages above the <hi>French</hi> to compaſs their deſigns: For beſides that that Nation, which is as it were nurs'd up in the boſom of the Sea, can better endure the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and inconveniences of long Voyages, and is better vers'd in the making of new Plantations; the Company which was eſtabliſh'd at <hi>London</hi> for the management of that of S. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> made ſuch generous proviſions, that at its firſt ſetlement it might be ſupply'd with Men and Proviſions, ſuch as ſhould be neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence, and took ſo particular a care of all things, that it was from time to time refreſh'd with new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, and whatever it might ſtand in need of at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that it viſibly proſper'd and advanc'd while the <hi>French,</hi> which was unfurniſh'd with all thoſe aſſiſtances, ſeem'd to pine and languiſh, nay indeed would have quite fallen away if the affection which it had for its chief Director, and the high eſteem it had conceiv'd of his valour had not kept it up.</p>
               <p>While therefore the <hi>French</hi> Colony was reduc'd to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and in a manner ſubſiſted only by its courage, that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being in a good plight and condition, ſpred it ſelf into a new one, which planted it ſelf in the Iſland of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> which is divided from S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> only by a ſmall arm of the Sea, as we have ſaid elſewhere: But if the ſmall number whereto the <hi>French</hi> were reduc'd permitted them not to make the like progreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, their Governour <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> had in the mean time the opportunity to make ſeveral uſeful regulations
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58704:95"/>
for the better ſetlement of it: Of theſe we ſhall not think it beſides our deſign to inſert here ſome few of the principal Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to the end the memory of them may be preciouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for the inſtruction of poſterity.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, taking it into his conſideration, that by peace and concord ſmall things come to be great, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion diſtracts and diſperſes the greateſt, he ordered that all the Inhabitants of the Iſland who were ſubject to his juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould maintain a perfect union among themſelves, and that he preſs'd and recommended to them upon all occaſions as the Pillar of their little State, and the ſacred Channel through which they were to expect the bleſſings both of Heaven and Earth abundantly to flow upon them: And whereas it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that in mutual converſation there ſhould not happen many things which might oftentimes offer ſome violence to that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable correſpondence, if ſome preſent proviſion be not made to the contrary, he deſired that ſuch differences might be with the ſooneſt either decided or ſmother'd, and all be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd with meekneſs, and that if poſſible before the ſetting of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Another command of his was, that his people ſhould be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their truſt, and free, and ſincere in all their affairs; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging and charitable towards their Neighbours, and as religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and punctual in the obſervance of the promiſes they had made, as if they had been put into writing, and ſeal'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd before witneſſes, or Publick Notaries.</p>
               <p>And that their being continually employ'd about their Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations might not cauſe them to forget the buſineſs of War, and out of a diſtruſt they would degenerate in point of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, through a long and undiſturbed quiet; and that if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould require they might be able to handle their Arms, and make uſe of them with dexterity, he appointed certain days for the exerciſing of them, that they might thereby be minded of the Rules of Military Diſcipline, and order'd, that though all profeſs'd the cultivation of the earth, yet that they ſhould have the generous looks and demeanors of Souldiers, and that they ſhould at all times have about them the Badges and Liveries of that kind of Life, and ſo never be ſeen out of their Quarters without Fire-arms, or at leaſt a Sword.</p>
               <p>But if he requir'd them to be thus qualifi'd, to the end that when occaſion ſerv'd they might make their enemies ſenſible of their valour and courage; he on the other ſide oblig'd them to be mild and courteous one towards another, and that the ſtronger ſhould not take their advantages of the weaker. Thence it came that he made this commendable order, which is ſtill in force in all thoſe Iſlands; to wit, that Maſters ſhould not take Servants for any longer term then three years, during which time they ſhould be oblig'd to treat them with all gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58704:96"/>
and moderation, and exact of them only ſuch ſervices as were rational and anſwerable to their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Nay his care and tenderneſs was very remarkable towards ſuch as were newly brought into the Country: To the end therefore that at their arrival they might be ſupply'd with all things requiſite to ſecure them againſt the injuries of the air, and that their labour might not be hindred through want of convenient lodging, he deſir'd, that as ſoon as the place which they had deſign'd for their building was uncover'd, all the Neighbourhood ſhould help them in the raiſing of it up: This commendable Inſtitution was ſo well receiv'd, and ſo carefully practiſed, that all the Inhabitants generally acknowledg'd the equity of it, and took a certain pleaſure in making a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contribution of their pains and cares upon that occaſion: Some went to cut down ſuch Timber as might be neceſſary; others were to find Reeds and Palm-leaves for palizadoes and covering; the ableſt Architects planted the forkes, rais'd the couples, and faſten'd the covering, and all ſeem'd to be kindly concern'd in the work, ſo as that the narrow ſtructure was in a few days become tenantable, yet without any charge to the owner, ſave only to ſee thoſe charitable aſſiſtants ſupply'd with the ordinary drink of the Country, as long as they were at work upon his account.</p>
               <p>In fine, he had a particular averſion againſt thoſe idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are baſely content to live by the ſweat and labour of others, as the Drones do on the Hony which the laborious Bee had brought into the common Treaſury. But to retrive in our days a little glimpſe of the Golden Age, ſo much celebrated by the Ancients, he incited all the Inhabitants to be liberal, and apt to communicate to one another the goods which God had plentifully beſtow'd on them, and to expreſs their charity and hoſpitality towards all thoſe who came to viſit them, that ſo there might afterwards be no occaſion to ſetle Inns and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualling-houſes among them, as being places which for the moſt part ſerv'd only for retreats to ſlothful, debauch'd, and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>lute perſons; and the diſorders and exceſſes committed therein were ſo great, as in time might haſten the deſolation and ruine of the whole Colony.</p>
               <p>But while the <hi>French</hi> Governor was thus taken up with the ordering of his little Republick, and kept up the ſpirits of his people with the expectation of ſudden recruits, the Gentlemen of the Company not much differing in conſtitution from many of that Nation who think of reaping as ſoon as they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the ſeed into the ground, were for their parts in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual expectation of ſome Ships loaden with the richeſt and moſt precious Commodities of <hi>America,</hi> that ſo they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburs'd with intereſt what they had laid out upon the firſt embarquing, and till that return were come, they thought of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58704:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing leſs then running themſelves into new charges. The Governor having ſeriouſly taken it into conſideration, that all the Letters he had ſent to thoſe Gentlemen upon that occaſion had not obtain'd any favourable anſwers from them, thought it would be his beſt courſe, ere the Colony were reduc'd to greater extremities, to come over to them in perſon, and by a ſecond Voyage undertake the ſollicitation of that relief, upon which the ſafety of their firſt advancements, and the ſubſiſtence of the <hi>French</hi> in that Iſland wholly depended. This good deſign, which the zeal he had for the glory of his Nation had inſpir'd him withall, prov'd as fortunate as he could have wiſh'd it: For being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> he was ſo prevalent in repreſenting the importance and neceſſity of that Recruit to the Gentlemen of the Company, that they granted him three hundred men, and Ships furniſh'd with all neceſſary Proviſions for their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation to S. <hi>Chriſtophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Recruit ſo impatiently expected by the Colony, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arriv'd about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> M. DC. XXIX. and it was receiv'd with ſo great joy by them who had ſo long ſtood in need of it, that now they thought nothing ſhould obſtruct the execution of their deſigns. But it ſeems the proſperities of this life are of a ſhort continuance; they had hardly ſolac'd themſelves two months in the enjoyments of that happineſs, ere there comes upon them a powerful Fleet from <hi>Spain; Dom Frederick de Toledo,</hi> who had the command of it, had receiv'd expreſs order from his Catholick Majeſty, that before he fell down to the <hi>Havanna, Carthagena,</hi> and the other more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Ports of <hi>America,</hi> he ſhould touch at S. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> and force thence all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> who had planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there ſome years before.</p>
               <p>The firſt act of hoſtility committed by this Naval force, which conſiſted of four and twenty great Ships of burthen, and fifteen Frigots, was the ſeiſure of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships then lying at Anchor neer the Iſland of <hi>Mevis;</hi> which done, it came and caſt Anchor in the Road of S. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> within Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of the <hi>Baſſe-terre,</hi> where Monſ. <hi>de Roſſey</hi> had the command in chief. The Forts of both the Colonies were not yet in ſuch a condition as to ſtand out a ſiege, they were unfurniſh'd with Proviſions, and all the Ammunition, as to Powder and Shot, in the whole Iſland could not amount to much; nay though both the Nations ſhould have joyn'd all their forces together, yet could they not have oppos'd ſo great an Army: But their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in ſome meaſure ſupply'd all thoſe defects; for that the Enemy ſhould not brag of his having compaſs'd his deſigns without ſome oppoſition, <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> diſpatch'd out of the <hi>Cabes-terre,</hi> where he began to fortifie himſelf, all his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Souldiers, in order to the relief of the place which was threatned by the Enemy, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent thither four of their beſt Companies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:58704:97"/>Theſe Forces being come to the appointed Rendezvouz, were joyntly employ'd with the Inhabitants of that Quarter to intrench themſelves along the Sea-coaſt, to make a more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous reſiſtance againſt the Enemy, and oppoſe his landing; and no doubt they would have put him to ſome trouble, had they been well commanded, and that firſt earneſtneſs had not receiv'd ſome remiſſion by the fright which ſo ſeiz'd the heart of <hi>de Roſſey</hi> that he would have ſuffer'd them to land, and make their approaches without any reſiſtance, if a young Gentleman, Nephew to Monſ. <hi>Deſnambuc,</hi> and elder Brother to Monſ. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi> the preſent Governour of <hi>Martinico,</hi> had not get leave to paſs over the Works, and to engage the firſt Company of the Enemy that appear'd upon the ſands: He was ſeconded by ſome Volunteers, who would needs participate of the glory of that action; but he went before them all, both as to courage and reſolution; for he ſo gallantly engag'd him who had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the party, that he kill'd him, and ſeveral others of the moſt valiant about him, who had the confidence to make tryal of his valour: But being afterwards forſaken by thoſe who had follow'd him in that encounter, he was over-power'd by number, knock'd down, and carry'd into one of the enemies Ships, where after all remedies apply'd in order to his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he dy'd, to the great regret of both ſides, as bemoaning the misfortune of ſuch a miracle of generoſity and reſolution.</p>
               <p>During this encounter, which ſhould have been maintain'd with more gallantry by thoſe who were in actual poſſeſſion of the Iſland, the General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet immediately gave order, that all the Ships ſhould at the ſame time ſend out their Shallops full of Souldiers well arm'd, which got a ſhore in very good order: This added not a little to the fright <hi>de Roſſey</hi> was in before, inaſmuch as being far from entertaining any thoughts of oppoſition, out of a fear of being oppreſs'd by that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he thought it his only way to make an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat before his people were encompaſs'd of all ſides. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution tumultuouſly taken was grumbled at by thoſe who wiſh'd the Enemy had more dearly bought the deſolation of their Colony; but ſuch a general conſternation was there in that fatal conjuncture, that it was carried, they ſhould take their way towards the <hi>Cabes-terre,</hi> and that there it ſhould be taken into futher conſideration what were beſt to be done in order to the common ſafety.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> perceiving that the <hi>French</hi> had quitted their Fort and their Works without making any great reſiſtance, imagin'd there might be ſome deſign in that retreat, and that it had been made purpoſely to draw him into ſome Ambuſcado laid for him in the Woods. This ſuſpicion kept him from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting his victory, and ſo occaſion'd his ſtay in the Quarter of the <hi>Baſſe-terre</hi> till he had a better account brought him of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58704:97"/>
the ſtate of the whole Iſland, and himſelf had conſider'd what was moſt expedient for him to do, in order to a more ſudden and punctual execution of his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>While the Enemy continu'd in this ſuſpence, and conſider'd with himſelf how to compaſs his deſigns with leaſt danger, <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> extreamly ſurpriz'd at ſo ſudden a change, and ſo unexpected ſucceſs, endeavour'd to comfort his own people, and to encourage them to expreſs their conſtancy in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of that miſcarriage. He thereupon took occaſion to remonſtrate to them, That the diſgrace was not paſt remedy; That it was not to be imagin'd the enemy would ſtay in the Iſland ſo long as to force all the Inhabitants out of it; That he had affairs of greater weight, which call'd him elſewhere; That he would not eaſily be drawn into the Foreſts, which it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary he ſhould paſs through ere he could come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Quarter; That they might put themſelves into ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence as ſhould not only give a check to his progreſs, but alſo force him to ſignalize his invaſion with his own blood; And laſtly, that there were in his way ſome places ſo fortifi'd by Nature, that a few men might force him to find his way back again.</p>
               <p>This advice was very ſolid, and might have prevail'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with thoſe to whom it was given, but the terror where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their ſpirits were prepoſſeſs'd, and the conſternation was ſo general, that it was not weigh'd as it deſerv'd. The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therefore being taken into deliberation, it was concluded, that the Iſland ſhould be deſerted, and that the Colony ſhould tranſport it ſelf to ſome other place which might give leſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of jealouſie to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and lye more out of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of his Fleets. <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> foreſeeing that what pretenceſoever might be made for the taking of that reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would ſtill be chargeable with ſomewhat of cowardice and baſeneſs, ſuch as ſhould blaſt the opinion conceiv'd of the gallantry of the <hi>French,</hi> and of a ſudden ſmother the great hopes which ſome had of the advancement of their Colony, could not be perſwaded to give his approbation thereto. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though he were of a contrary ſentiment, that it might not be ſaid he forſook in ſo ſad a conjuncture thoſe whom he had brought thither through ſo many Seas and dangers, he comply'd with their humor, and embarqu'd himſelf with them in certain Ships which chanc'd to be in the Haven; and ſo to avoid a greater diſorder, doing his own inclinations a violence, he only aſſur'd them that he ſhould one day reproach them with the little eſteem they made of his remonſtrances.</p>
               <p>The Quarters where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had themſelves were alſo in a great diſorder; they had intelligence brought them, that the enemy was become maſter of all the <hi>Baſſe-terre;</hi> That he had demoliſh'd the Fortreſs of the <hi>French,</hi> after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58704:98"/>
the pieces that were in it; That he had already burnt all their Huts, and made havock of all the Plantations of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They were in perpetual expectation when he ſhould come, and fall on them with all his forces, and in that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion ſome endeavour'd to make their eſcape by Sea, or ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves in the Mountains, while others ſomewhat more courageous were conſulting how to ſend Deputies to <hi>Dom Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric,</hi> to entreat him to admit of ſome accommodation: But all the Anſwer they receiv'd, was an expreſs command imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to depart the Iſland, which if they did not, they ſhould be treated with all the rigour which the Law of Arms permits to be uſed towards thoſe who againſt all right poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of what belongs not to them.</p>
               <p>To facilitate the departure which <hi>Dom Frederic</hi> had ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly commanded, he gave order that thoſe Ships which his Fleet had taken away from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> neer the Iſland of <hi>Mevis</hi> ſhould be reſtor'd to them, and that they ſhould embarque without any delay, and immediately ſet ſail for <hi>England.</hi> But whereas it was impoſſible thoſe Veſſels ſhould contain ſo great a number of people, he permitted the ſupernumerary to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Iſland till they had a favourable opportunity for their tranſportation.</p>
               <p>Theſe things diſpatch'd, <hi>Dom Frederic</hi> weigh'd Anchor, in order to the continuation of his Voyage, but as ſoon as the Fleet was out of ſight, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who had been left behind in the Iſland began to rally, and took a reſolution courageouſly to carry on the ſetlement of their Colony.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were in agitation at S. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> who had left it at the beginning of the diſtraction had ſuffer'd ſo many inconveniences at Sea, partly through want of Proviſions, and partly by reaſon of contrary Winds, that they were forc'd to put in at the Iſlands of S. <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> after they had by the way touch'd at that of <hi>Antego.</hi> They wiſh'd themſelves ſo happy, as that they might have ſetled in any of thoſe places; but they look'd on them as dreadful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts in compariſon of that out of which they had been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily forc'd: The pleaſant Idea of that was ſtill before their eyes, it was the continual ſubject of their regret; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful remembrance of that pleaſant abode, to the recovery whereof they were by Divine Providence re-invited by ways unknown to them, rais'd in them a deſire to be inform'd what condition the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had left it in, ſince they were then ſo neer it: To ſatisfie that commendable curioſity, they ſent one of their Ships to S. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> which returning gave them an account, that the Enemies Fleet was gone; and that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> who were left behind were courageouſly employ'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building their Hutts, planting Proviſions, and repairing their deſolations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:58704:98"/>This unexpected good News reviv'd their decay'd hopes, and heightned the courage of thoſe who were moſt caſt down, ſo that there needed not many arguments ro perſwade them to a return into that delightful Country which was already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of their hearts and tendereſt affections.</p>
               <p>Being arrived there, every one reſum'd his former place, with a reſolution to make an abſolute ſetlement; but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which preſs'd hard upon them, would no doubt have check'd the progreſs of all theſe promiſing deſigns, and they would have been cruſh'd by the extraordinary labours which they were at the ſame time oblig'd to undergo, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building their houſes, as planting things neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence, if in thoſe preſſing extremities God had not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thither for their relief ſome Ships belonging to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces, which, finding what a deplorable condition they were in, generouſly ſupply'd them with proviſions, cloaths, and all things neceſſary; nay to put an abſolute obligation upon them, they had no other ſecurity for their ſatisfaction then their bare words.</p>

               <p>What Colonies the <hi>Dutch</hi> have in the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands were eſtabliſh'd ſome time after thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their eſtabliſhments were not upon the account of the States, but upon that of ſome particular Companies of Merchants, who, the better to carry on the Trade which they have in all the Iſlands whereof the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> are poſſeſs'd, were deſirous to have ſome places of ſafe retreat for the refreſhment of their Ships. The moſt ancient of thoſe Colonies which have any dependence on the States-General of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, is that in the Iſland of S. <hi>Euſtace:</hi> It was eſtabliſh'd much about the ſame time that Sir <hi>Thomas Warner</hi> ſetled that of <hi>Mont-ſerrat,</hi> which was in the Year M. DC. XXXII. It is conſiderable upon this account, that it is a place naturally well fortify'd; as alſo for the number and quality of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, the abundance of good Tobacco which it ſtill yields; and for ſeveral other remarkable advantages, whereof we have given an account in the fifth Chapter of the former Book.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> expreſs'd no leſs earneſtneſs and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the dilatation of his Colony then other Nations did in that of theirs; but having not been ſo ſeaſonably reliev'd as was requiſite at the beginning, and his deſigns having been many times check'd by ſeveral unhappy obſtructions, he had this further diſpleaſure, to ſee divers of the moſt conſiderable Iſlands poſſeſs'd by others before he was in a condition to put in for a ſhare, and dilate his Conqueſt beyond the limits of S. <hi>Chriſtophers.</hi> He had a long time before caſt his eye on that of <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> as being one of the nobleſt and greateſt Iſlands of all the <hi>Caribbies;</hi> but while he was taking order for the tranſporting of men thither, he was prevented in his deſign by Monſieur <hi>de l' Olive,</hi> one of the principal Inhabitants of his own Colony, who making his advantage of a Voyage he had made into <hi>France</hi> about ſome private affairs of his own, as he pretended, joyn'd with Monſieur <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> and ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Dieppe,</hi> for the eſtabliſhment of a Colony there by Commiſſion from the Company which had the direction of the Iſlands of <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Gentlemen being made joint Governours of the Iſland of <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> and inveſted with equal authority, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd there the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> M. DC. XXXV. with a Company of five hundred men, who preſently after their arrival were preſs'd with a famine, and divers diſeaſes, which took away a great number of them. It is conceiv'd that the former miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58704:99"/>
happen'd to them upon this occaſion, that they had planted themſelves at their firſt landing in thoſe parts of the Iſland where the ſoil was moſt barren, and unfit for cultivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any in it, and that they had upon too light grounds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into a War with the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> the originary Inhabitants of the place, who might have plentifully furniſh'd them with moſt of the proviſions neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, till the earth and their own induſtry had ſupply'd them better. Diſeaſes were the conſequences of that unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome nouriſhment which hunger forc'd them to make uſe of for want of better: whereto this may be added, that the ground being not reduc'd to culture, the air was the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily corrupted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> reflecting on the misfortunes and inconveniences which daily fell one in the neck of another upon that unſetled Colony, and having juſt grounds to fear that other yet great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might happen to it, took it ſo much to heart, that he dyed out of pure grief, in the ſeventh month after his arrival. The loſs of him was much regretted by all the <hi>French,</hi> who had always expreſs'd a great ſubmiſſion to his advice, and much love and reſpect to his perſon. He was a man of ſingular pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of ſo affable and obliging a diſpoſition, that he gain'd the affections of all that treated with him.</p>
               <p>After the departure of Monſieur <hi>du Pleſſis, de l' Olive</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſole Governour. This latter was a Perſon of an humour as active and ſtirring as that of his Collegue was gentle and moderate; and he ſo much harkned to the violent counſels of ſome reſtleſs ſpirits, who like ſo many peſtilent Ear-wigs were continually putting him upon new projects, that he ſoon after engag'd himſelf in that fatal War againſt the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> which had almoſt prov'd the deſtruction of that newly-planted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. True it is, that at firſt he preſs'd ſo hard upon them, as to force them to leave him the abſolute poſſeſſion of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deloupe;</hi> but in regard that to compaſs the deſigns which he had fram'd to himſelf from the time of his arrival he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to commit ſeveral cruelties, ſuch as the very Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians themſelves would not have exercis'd upon their greateſt enemies, it prov'd ſuch a blaſt to his reputation, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of his conduct were only ſome ſanguinary perſons and Deſperadoes.</p>
               <p>The poor <hi>Caribbians</hi> which the Governour had forc'd out of the Iſland of <hi>Gardeloupe</hi> retreated into that of <hi>Dominico:</hi> Thoſe of the ſame Nation who were poſſeſs'd of the latter entertain'd them kindly, and to give them a greater aſſurance how much they were ſenſible of their misfortune, they prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to joyn with them to revenge by the way of Arms the injury which had been done them; a proffer too obliging to be refus'd. Their forces being thus united, they made
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58704:100"/>
ſeveral incurſions into <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> and became ſuch goads and thorns in the ſides of the <hi>French,</hi> that they were forc'd to give over the culture of Tobacco, nay indeed the planting of thoſe proviſions which were neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence, to the end they might always be in Arms, to prevent the attempts and deſigns of thoſe ſubtle enemies, whom they had by their own imprudence ſo much exaſperated againſt them.</p>
               <p>This cruel War, which laſted neer four years, reduc'd the Colony to great extremities, and brought it to ſo deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a condition, that it was out of repute in all places; and upon its being continually peſter'd by the incurſions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations of the irreconcileable <hi>Caribbians,</hi> it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be at no great diſtance from its utter deſtruction. The <hi>French</hi> being brought to this lowneſs, it pleas'd God that the Governour <hi>de l' Olive</hi> loſt his ſight, whereupon the Gentlemen of the Company ſent over Monſieur <hi>Auber</hi> to be Governour of it, who remedied all the precedent diſorders, appeas'd all troubles, and ſetled that Peace which afterwards brought in Trading and plenty of all things; as we ſhall ſhew more at large in the third Chapter of this Moral Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as M. <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> had receiv'd intelligence that <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deloupe</hi> was inhabited, he reſolv'd with the firſt convenience to ſetle himſelf in ſome other of the beſt Iſlands which were yet at his choice; and to prevent a ſecond ſupplantation, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had about him a conſiderable number of reſolute perſons, and furniſh'd with all proviſions of War, and what was neceſſary for the belly, and all things requiſite for the proſecution of ſuch enterprizes, he went in perſon to take poſſeſſion of the Iſland of <hi>Martinico,</hi> which having done, he left there for his Lieutenant Mr. <hi>du Pont,</hi> and for Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in chief Mr. <hi>de la Vallee.</hi> Not long after dying at S. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers,</hi> he left all his Eſtate, and Titles of what kind ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which he had in <hi>Martinico,</hi> which he had peopled at his own charge, to M. <hi>Parquet</hi> his Nephew, who is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Lord and Governour of it, as we have ſaid elſewhere.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman was a perſon of much gallantry, of eaſie acceſs, familiar with all, and maſter of a happy kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, ſuch as gently forc'd the love and obedience of thoſe who were under him. It is related of him, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having gone a little beyond the boundaries which by the mutual agreement concluded between both Nations had been ſet for the diſtinction of their ſeveral Quarters, he went to thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> attended by a ſmall number of perſons, and ſpoke with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governour, who expected him with a conſiderable number of Souldiers: But he behav'd himſelf with ſo much courage and reſolution, and gave ſuch good reaſons, intermixt with menaces, for what he did, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governour granted him what he deſir'd. That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58704:100"/>
ſhews how careful he was to preſerve the Rights and Priviledges of his Nation; and what he did then had this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſequence, that the two Governours were ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very good friends.</p>

               <p>AFter the death of Monſieur <hi>Deſnambuc,</hi> one Monſieur <hi>du Halde,</hi> who was his Lieutenant in that Government, was nominated to be Governour in Chief by the Gentlemen of the Company: But not long after, the ſaid <hi>du Halde</hi> coming over into <hi>France,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> whoſe care extended to the moſt remote places where the <hi>French</hi> had any thing to do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the conſervation and advancement of that Colony in <hi>America,</hi> out of an endeavour to render the name of <hi>France</hi> as glorious in that part of the new World, as it was here. To carry on that deſign he thought it requiſite that the Iſlands ſhould be ſupply'd with a Governour accordingly: Having therefore ſome while ſought for a perſon fit for that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one eminent for his conduct, prudence, generoſity, and the experience requiſite for ſo great a charge, he at laſt pitch'd upon Monſieur <hi>de Lonvilliers Poincy</hi> Knight, a Gentleman of a very ancient Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal preſented this excellent Perſon to King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. who approving the choice, inveſted him with the Charge of Governour, and Lieutenant-General under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the Iſlands of <hi>America:</hi> Whereupon Letters Patents were granted him in <hi>September</hi> M. DC. XXXVIII. That qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had not been given to any of thoſe who had preceded him in the Government of thoſe Iſlands.</p>
               <p>In the Year M. DC. XXXIX. the ſaid new Governour ſetting ſail from <hi>Diep</hi> about the midſt of <hi>January,</hi> arriv'd about a month after at the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> and was firſt receiv'd at <hi>Martini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> by the Inhabitants in Arms. He afterwards went to <hi>Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe</hi> and S. <hi>Chriſtophers;</hi> but his nobleſt reception was at the latter: All the <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants being in Arms receiv'd him in the quality of General with univerſal applauſe, and he was conducted to the Church, attended by his Gentlemen and Guards, where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon his reception the Iſland began to put on a new face, and within a ſhort time after things were viſibly chang'd from better to better; inſomuch that he not only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58704:101"/>
but exceeded the expectations of his Majeſty and the Cardinal. One of the firſt things he did, was to give order for the building of Churches in ſeveral Quarters of the Iſland: He took care that the Prieſts ſhould be well lodg'd and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, that they might not be diverted from the employments of their Function: He made ſuch proviſions in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice, as rendred it expeditious, and without Fees, by means of a Council conſiſting of the moſt prudent and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd among the Officers of the Iſland: His vigilance reform'd and prevented the diſorders which eaſily creep in among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhuffled together from divers places, and of different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: His prudence in compoſing and ſetling matters of greateſt difficulty was equally admir'd by thoſe who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Government, and his Neighbours of other Nations. That greatneſs of mind, which ſucceſsfully guided him to the accompliſhment of all his deſigns, made him dreadful to all reſtleſs and diſ-ſatisfy'd ſpirits: His affability, eaſineſs of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and his kind entertainment towards Strangers, brought Trading and plenty into the Iſland; and his goodneſs and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality juſtly gain'd the hearts and affections of the <hi>French:</hi> In a word, his Generoſity ſignaliz'd in many occurrences as well in <hi>France,</hi> during the noble Employments he had in his Majeſties Armies, as in <hi>America</hi> ſince his Government there, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, dilatation, and reduction of ſo many conſiderable places, wrought ſuch a terrour in the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that he never ſince proffer'd to oppoſe his glorious Enterprizes.</p>
               <p>Having ſetled S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> in good order as to Trading, and all other Concerns, and made it the moſt flouriſhing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of all the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> as we have repreſented it in the fourth Chapter of the precedent Book, he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the <hi>French</hi> Colony into thoſe of S. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> S. <hi>Martins,</hi> and <hi>Santa Cruce,</hi> whereof we have given an account in their proper places, yet ſo as we ſtill have many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable circumſtances to deliver concerning the Conqueſt of the Iſland of <hi>Santa Cruce,</hi> which we ſhall here take occaſion to inſert.</p>
               <p>The Iſland of <hi>Santa Cruce</hi> hath been ſubject to many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in a ſhort time, and for many years together the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> had ſome conteſtations about the propriety of it: At laſt they made a diviſion of it between them; but in the Year M. DC. XLIX. the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having obſerv'd that they much exceeded the <hi>Dutch</hi> in number, forc'd them to depart the Iſland. But they alſo continu'd not long Maſters of it; for ſoon after the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were Inhabitants of the Iſland of <hi>Porto-Rico</hi> made an incurſion into it, burnt their houſes, put to the ſword all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> they found in Arms, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the reſt with their baggage and wives to be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Barbouthos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:58704:101"/>Having thus laid the Iſland deſolate, as they were ſetting things in order for their returning aboard their Veſſels, and to take their courſe back to <hi>Porto-Rico,</hi> there arrives thither a Ship from the Iſlands of S. <hi>Euſtace</hi> and S. <hi>Martins,</hi> wherein there were a conſiderable number of men, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd intelligence of the defeat of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and imagining that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were gone, would have reviv'd the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to that Iſland: but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having the advantage, as being ten to one, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were forc'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſuch terms of accommodation as the others were pleas'd to give them. The crafty <hi>Spaniards</hi> had indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them good quarter, but their deſign was to tranſport them to <hi>Porto-Rico</hi> to their Governour, who, according to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> humour, would not have treated them over-chriſtianly.</p>
               <p>But as good fortune would have it, juſt as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were preparing for their return with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Priſoners, who had ſo unfortunately fallen into their hands, two <hi>French</hi> Ships well mann'd, and furniſh'd with all ſorts of Proviſions and Ammunition, arriv'd in the Iſland, ſent thither by the <hi>French</hi> General <hi>de Poincy,</hi> to ſend the <hi>Spaniard</hi> packing thence, and take poſſeſſion of it for the King of <hi>France.</hi> This relief came in very ſeaſonably for the deliverance of the ſurpriz'd <hi>Dutch;</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> perceiving the <hi>French</hi> landing cheerfully and in good order, and making a conſiderable Body of gallant men, and ready to fight, immediately let go their Priſoners; and after a ſhort capitulation, the <hi>French</hi> ſent them an expreſs order to be gone aboard their Ships, with a menace that if they did not, they would fall upon them as Enemies, and that they were not to expect any Quarter. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought it their beſt courſe rather to comply then ſtand to the hazard of an engagement, though they much exceeded the <hi>French</hi> in number.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> General taking it into his conſideration, of what importance the Iſland in time might be, eſpecially in order to the facilitation of other acqueſts of greater concernment, thought it worthy his endeavours to ſecure what he had ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately poſſeſs'd himſelf of, and thereupon ſent a prudent and experienc'd Governour to command there under him: The perſon he pitch'd on for that Employment was Monſieur <hi>Auber,</hi> Major of the Iſland of S. <hi>Christophers,</hi> who had exercis'd that Charge with great approbation for many years together; but now he was advanc'd to the quality of Governour of that Iſland: He died in the exerciſe of that Charge, to the great regret of all the Inhabitants, after he had ſetled the Iſland in good order, recover'd its ruines, and laid the foundations of a Fort which he had deſign'd himſelf for the ſecurity of ſuch Ships as ſhould afterwards come into the Haven, and to defeat the hopes of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to make any more incurſions there,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58704:102"/>
This reduction of the Iſland under the power of the <hi>French,</hi> as we have deſcrib'd it, happen'd in the Year M. DC. L.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> had built a very fair Church upon a pleaſant aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of this Iſland, in the form of a Croſs, which may ſtill be ſtanding, if the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſhould have a reſpect for that ſacred Sign which was on the top of the Steeple, have not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd it.

               <p>The preſent King of <hi>France</hi> being inform'd of all the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions done in thoſe parts by Monſieur <hi>de Poincy,</hi> and conſidering how neceſſary his continual reſidence in <hi>America</hi> was, granted him new Letters Patents, whereby he confirm'd him in the Charge of Governour and Lieutenant-General in thoſe places; and the Queen, during her Regency, gave him a great commendation for his noble Enterprizes, and Fidelity to the Kings ſervice.</p>

               <p>At the firſt coming of the forreign Nations into the Iſlands, they were lodg'd much after the ſame manner as the natural Inhabitants of the Country, in little cotts and hutts made of the wood they had fell'd upon the place as they clear'd the ground. There are ſtill to be ſeen, in ſeveral of the newly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Colonies, many of thoſe weak ſtructures, which are ſuſtain'd only by four or ſix forks planted in the ground, and inſtead of walls are encompaſs'd and palizado'd only with reeds, and cover'd with Palm or Plantane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaves, Sugar-canes, or ſome ſuch material: But in all the other Iſlands, where theſe Nations are better ſetled and accommodated, there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are many very fair houſes of Timber, Stone, and Brick, built af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as thoſe in their own Countries, ſave that for the moſt part they are but one or two Stories high at the moſt, that they may the more eaſily reſiſt the winds, which ſometimes blow in thoſe parts with extraordinary violence. Of theſe Edifices we have ſpoken already in ſeveral places of the precedent Book, when we gave a particular account of the ſeveral Iſlands.</p>
               <p>But we have this particularly to adde here, that the <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> are the beſt accommodated for Lodgings of any of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of thoſe Iſlands, and have their houſes well furniſh'd, which is to be attributed to their conſtant abode in their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, where they endeavour to get all conveniences as much
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58704:103"/>
as if they were the places of their birth: They are alſo moſt of them married, whence it comes that they take greater pains to ſupply themſelves with all things requiſite, then thoſe are apt to do who lead ſingle lives, as moſt of the <hi>French</hi> do.</p>
               <p>We had an intention to conclude this Chapter with the courſe taken by M. <hi>Auber</hi> to make up a peace with the <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> upon his taking poſſeſſion of the Government of <hi>Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe;</hi> but in regard the diſcourſe is ſomewhat long, and may conduce much to the diſcovery of the humours and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> of whom we are to treat more at large in this ſecond Book, we thought it better diſpos'd into a Chapter apart.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe firſt among the <hi>French</hi> who took poſſeſſion of the Iſland of <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> landed there in the Year 1635. by order from a Company of Merchants of the City of <hi>Deep,</hi> which, under the Authority of the General Company of the Iſlands of <hi>America</hi> conſtituted at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſent thither two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> and <hi>de l' Olive,</hi> to command there upon their account: But the former dying ſome few months after his eſtabliſhment, and the other becoming unfit for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a new-planted Colony, through the loſs of his ſight, and his continual indiſpoſitions, as we have mentioned in the precedent Chapters, the <hi>French</hi> Governour-General took or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Inhabitants of that Iſland ſhould be ſupply'd with all things neceſſary: For it is probable they would have abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forſaken it, had not the ſaid Governour ſent over re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits of Auxiliaries to them, under the conduct of <hi>Vernade</hi> and <hi>Sabouilly,</hi> to oppoſe the deſigns of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who with much animoſity diſputed the poſſeſſion of it with them: So that if that Colony is not oblig'd for its eſtabliſhment to the General <hi>de Poincy,</hi> this at leaſt muſt be acknowledg'd, that its preſervation and ſubſiſtence was the effect of his care. He accordingly approv'd and confirm'd, in the Kings name, the nomination which the Company of the Iſlands had made of M. <hi>Auber</hi> to be Governour of that Iſland.</p>
               <p>This new Governour took the Oath of Allegeance before the General, the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> M. DC. XL. but before he fell

down to S. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> the Ship which had brought him out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>America</hi> caſting Anchor neer <hi>Dominico,</hi> many of the Savages, who had obſerv'd the Ship at a diſtance, and concluded from the expreſſions of friendſhip which had been made to them, that they had no enemies in that Veſſel, grew ſo confident as to come into it. It fortunately happen'd, that thoſe who had come out upon the diſcovery were ſome of the chiefeſt Captains of the Iſland: M. <hi>Auber</hi> reſolv'd to make all the advantage he could of that opportunity, imagining it might conduce very much to the making of an alliance with that people, which had been exaſperated and incens'd againſt the <hi>French</hi> by the violences and cruel uſage of <hi>de l' Olive,</hi> one of his Predeceſſors in that Charge, as alſo by the ill conduct of thoſe who commanded the Recruits which the General had ſent over for the ſecurity of the Iſland: And having withal an inkling that thoſe of that Nation are eaſily drawn in by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and little Preſents, he omitted nothing which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd might promote his deſign.</p>
               <p>He thereupon acquainted them, that he was newly come from <hi>France,</hi> and that he was ſent over to be Governour of <hi>Gardeloupe;</hi> that he had been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much troubled to hear of the, differences which for ſome years had continued between them and the <hi>French;</hi> that he was come with an intention to make a friendly compoſure thereof; and that he would be their Companion and good Neighbour, and live with them, as their late old friend M. <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> had done. Theſe proffers were interrupted now and then with glaſſes of <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> which he order'd ever and anon to be preſented to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Savages finding ſo free and cordial a reception, after they had diſcours'd a while among themſelves, in the Language they ſpeak, concerning their military affairs, which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only by the moſt ancient Conductors of their Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, reſolv'd to accept of the proffer which had been made them, and to renew the ancient amity, by renouncing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might tend to the proſecution of that bloody War which had ſo much incommodated both parties. But before they would promiſe any thing, they ask'd Monſieur <hi>Auber,</hi> whether <hi>l' Olive, Sabouilly,</hi> and all thoſe who had follow'd their violent courſes, ſhould be forc'd to depart the Iſland? Whereto it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwer'd that they ſhould, they reply'd, that it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſo, and that otherwiſe they ſhould ſtill have an animoſity againſt the <hi>French,</hi> ſaying, <hi>l' Olive and Sabouilly are not good for the Caribbians:</hi> Thoſe were their words. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon M. <hi>Auber</hi> having aſſur'd them that their deſires ſhould be ſatisfy'd, and that for his part he would be good to them, if they on their parts would be good; which they promis'd to be. Theſe things concluded, he gave them a very noble treatment, beſtow'd ſome Preſents among them, and diſmiſs'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58704:104"/>
them the moſt ſatisfy'd people in the world.</p>
               <p>From the road of <hi>Dominico</hi> M. <hi>Auber</hi> went to <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> where having diſpos'd his equipage he return'd to S. <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> to give the General an account of what had paſt, who was well ſatisfy'd with the choice which the Company had made of him for that Employment.</p>
               <p>Being return'd to his Government, he was gallantly receiv'd by all the Inhabitants, who eſteem'd him for his experience in whatever might contribute to the advancement of newly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Colonies, as alſo out of a perſwaſion, that his prudence would remedy the diſorders paſt, and his generoſity oppoſe the preſent difficulties, and undertake all things requiſite for the quiet and welfare of the Iſland; and his mildneſs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability would gain him the affections of all there, as they had done at S. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> where he had been accounted one of their beſt Captains. His Commiſſion was read and publiſh'd two Sundays together, at the head of all the Companies of the Iſland.</p>
               <p>The War which had been fomented between the Savages and the <hi>French</hi> by the ill counſel of ſome reſtleſs ſpirits, and the credulity of the precedent Governour who had harkned thereto, together with the differences, jealouſies and animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which thoſe boutefeus had rais'd among the principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Iſland, had rendred it the moſt deſolate of all the Colonies of <hi>America:</hi> Want of proviſions had reduc'd many to ſo great extremities, that life grew weariſom to them, and death was the object of their wiſhes: The continual fear they were in of being ſurpriz'd by the Savages, oblig'd them to be always in Arms, and to leave their Gardens and Plantations uncultivated; and the inſupportable treatment they receiv'd from ſome Officers who abus'd their Authority, had brought them to the threſhold of inevitable deſtruction.</p>
               <p>But aſſoon as M. <hi>Auber</hi> had aſſum'd the Government, by the unanimous acclamations of all the Inhabitants, and brought them the news of an aſſured peace, which he had concluded with the Savages their neighbours, and hop'd very ſuddenly to ſee confirm'd by all the aſſurances could be expected from a Nation ſo unciviliz'd as that of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> the diſturbers of the publick tranquillity were diſpers'd, and the well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted found themſelves in ſafety under the prudent conduct of ſo worthy a Governour, who us'd all poſſible endeavours to bring the Iſland to a perfect ſetlement: Inſomuch that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony ſeem'd to have put on a new face; Juſtice began to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; the unity and labours of the Inhabitants retriv'd the plenty, trading, and peace, which had been forc'd thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the pious example of the Commander in chief had the expected influence over all the members of that Colony.</p>
               <p>Though he had motion'd a Treaty of peace with the Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

yet did he conceive it expedient, for fear of a ſurprize, that the Inhabitants ſhould ſtill keep their Guards: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he planted Sentinels in all thoſe places where the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> might moſt eaſily land without being diſcover'd: He chang'd the Guards, and plac'd them in other more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious places; and he thought it prudence to keep under thoſe who would have ruin'd the firſt foundations he had laid of the firm peace and alliance with thoſe reconciled enemies, charging the former by expreſs prohibitions to forbear all acts of hoſtility, that they might not by their particular animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties obſtruct the general agreement wherein all the Inhabitants were ſo much concern'd.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Governour taking further into his conſideration, that the Iſlands were to ſubſiſt by Trading; that nothing puts a greater ſlurre upon them then the bad Commodities vented therein; and that Tobacco was the only Commodity at that time of any eſteem at <hi>Gardeloupe;</hi> and that ſeveral perſons put off what was not merchantable, which procedure had caus'd the Iſland to be ſlighted by Forreigners, who upon that account had forborn ſending any Ships thither; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed certain perſons who well underſtood the management of Tobacco, and theſe carefully examin'd the making up of it, and had order to caſt into the Sea what was decay'd, or wanted thoſe qualities it ought to have to be allowable.</p>
               <p>This good order taken, as well in order to military affairs as policy, brought the Iſland in a ſhort time into a flouriſhing condition; and the report of its amendment occaſion'd the coming thither of many Merchants, and invited a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of conſiderable families to ſetle themſelves there.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Savages who had viſited M. <hi>Auber</hi> in his Ship at his firſt arrival, and had treated with him about a peace, upon the conditions before-mentioned; they were no ſooner got home into their Country, where they were expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much impatience, upon this ſcore, that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd a great while in the Ship, but they celebrated all over the Iſland the noble entertainment they had receiv'd from the Governour newly come from <hi>France.</hi> The conſiderable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents he had beſtow'd on them was an authentick aſſurance of his goodneſs and liberality. To this they added, that their enemies, <hi>l' Olive</hi> and <hi>Sabouilly,</hi> being ordered to depart <hi>Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe,</hi> they had made a peace with that brave Companion, who had treated them ſo kindly, that he was worthy of their alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. That he might take no further occaſion of diſtruſt, they urg'd the neceſſity there was that they ſhould forbear making thoſe incurſions into <hi>Gardeloupe</hi> which they had been wont to make in the time of War: And that when certain news came that the new Governour was fully eſtabliſh'd in his Government, they would give him a viſit, carry him Preſents,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58704:105"/>
and ſolemnly confirm that peace which was likely to prove ſo advantagious for the future. The <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who had loſt many of their men in the former engagements againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and grew weary of dealing with ſuch expert enemies, were glad to hear what was propos'd to them by the principal Captains in their Country: So that they approv'd all that had paſs'd between them and the <hi>French</hi> Governour, and behav'd themſelves as they ſhould do in order to the confirmation of the peace.</p>
               <p>About the ſpace of five months the Savages punctually obſerv'd the promiſe they had made to M. <hi>Auber,</hi> of not giving any further diſturbance to the <hi>French:</hi> Imagining that time ſufficient to let all the Inhabitants of <hi>Gardeloupe</hi> know what alliance had been contracted at the road of <hi>Dominico,</hi> they reſolv'd to ſend thither a ſolemn Deputation, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the peace, and wiſh the Governour all proſperity. There was a great competition among the Savages who ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with a Commiſſion of ſo great importance: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd then, to ſatisfie the moſt eminent among them who were competitors for that Embaſſie, to pitch upon two of their moſt ancient and moſt renowned Captains, and to give each of them a conſiderable Convoy, conſiſting of the choice of their braveſt Officers and Souldiers: And that there might be no jealouſie among the Captains, they thought it fit they ſhould depart in two ſeveral <hi>Piragas,</hi> each of them with his retinue, and in ſuch order as that one ſhould precede the other by one day.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt of theſe Embaſſadours was call'd Captain <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon,</hi> a perſon very conſiderable among them, and he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by thirty of the moſt active and moſt expert of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minico.</hi> M. <hi>Auber</hi> was wont to ſay, that he had never ſeen any Savages ſo well ſhap'd and active as they were. Theſe Savages therefore, relying on the promiſe he had made them in the Road, landed at <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> where hearing by the Guards that M. <hi>Auber</hi> was in the Iſland, and in good health, they confidently landed, and deſired to ſee him, having in the mean time left ſome of the leſs conſiderable of their party to look to the <hi>Piraga.</hi> While ſome went to acquaint the Governour with the arrival of theſe Deputies of <hi>Dominico,</hi> Captain <hi>Amichon,</hi> who was to be the Speaker, diſpatch'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way two of his retinue loaden with the beſt fruits of their Country, which they had brought along with them for a Preſent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Governour was extremely glad to hear of their arrival, and having immediately commanded all thoſe of his houſhold and the whole Quarter not to give them the leaſt occaſion to fear any ill treatment, he would needs go himſelf to meet them, with a countenance which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58704:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
expreſs'd how welcome they were. We ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves to inſert here the Speech and Complements made by Captain <hi>Amichon</hi> at this firſt interview: He was one of thoſe who had viſited M. <hi>Auber</hi> in his Ship, ſo that he eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew him again. He immediately gave him to underſtand, that he was come to confirm what they had reſolv'd together at the Road of <hi>Dominico</hi> concerning the peace; and that all the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of his Country were deſirous of it. The <hi>French</hi> Governour in anſwer thereto, made them ſenſible as well by his Interpreter as his countenance, that for his part he would inviolably obſerve that union, provided they were not the firſt breakers of it. Having afterwards brought them to his houſe, and knowing that good cheer was the beſt ſeal could be put to that Treaty of peace, he call'd for ſome Aqua-vitae, and order'd to be brought what was moſt delicious in the Iſland: At laſt he crown'd the Entertainment with Preſents of all the curioſities moſt in eſteem among the Savages. And that all the Deputies might participate of the good cheer and liberality of the Governour, thoſe who had been treated went to relieve thoſe who were left behind to look to the <hi>Piraga,</hi> who alſo in their turn receiv'd the ſame treatment and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents which the others had had. Captain <hi>Amichon</hi> forgot not, according to the cuſtom they obſerve towards their friends, to take M. <hi>Auber</hi>'s name, and to give him his own.</p>
               <p>Having been thus civilly receiv'd and treated, they return'd very joyfully to their <hi>Piraga,</hi> and ſet ſail towards their own Iſland: They met at a certain rendezvouz, which they had agreed upon before they had left <hi>Dominico,</hi> with the other <hi>Piraga,</hi> which brought over the other Embaſſadour, whoſe name was Captain <hi>Baron,</hi> with his retinue. This ſecond Captain underſtanding from the former what reception he and his retinue had at <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> got thither the next day. This <hi>Baron</hi> had been a great friend of M. <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> who dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Governour of <hi>Gardeloupe,</hi> but having equal authority with M. <hi>de l' Olive,</hi> his Collegue, who after <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> death impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently engag'd the <hi>French</hi> into a War with the Savages.</p>
               <p>This Captain then, who had often viſited M. <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> and remembred the friendſhip he had born him, being ſatisfy'd of the generoſity of the <hi>French,</hi> went aſhore with his Company, and was conducted to the Governour's, who treated him with the ſame ceremonies as he had done the former: But when he came to hear that the Captain had been intimately acquainted with M. <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> and that there had been a familiar corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between them, he treated him with greater teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of affection then he had done the others, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into a particular friendſhip with him, receiving his name, and giving him his own. Thus was the latter Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation diſmiſs'd with greater ſatisfaction then the former,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58704:106"/>
and promis'd to continue their viſits for the future: But both of them gave a large account at their <hi>Carbetts,</hi> of the civilities and good entertainment of the new Governour.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Baron,</hi> who had been ſo kindly receiv'd at his firſt viſit, ſtaid not long ere he made a ſecond: At the latter the Governour ſhew'd him one of M. <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> Sons, to whom the Captain made a thouſand careſſes, in remembrance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he call'd his Companion, and the Friend of his Nation. True it is, that Gentleman had inſinuated himſelf into the affection of thoſe <hi>Barbarians;</hi> who had a reſpect for his merits and excellent endowments.</p>
               <p>After this viſit, and ſeveral others which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, M. <hi>Auber</hi> would be aſſur'd of them by Hoſtages, that they would obſerve the alliance: To that purpoſe he apply'd himſelf to Captain <hi>Baron,</hi> with whom he had contracted a greater friendſhip then with the others, and whom he call'd his Companion, as ſucceeding to the alliance there had ſometime been between him and M. <hi>du Pleſſis.</hi> M. <hi>Auber</hi> aſk'd him one day, whether he thought it not rational, that, to be aſſur'd of thoſe of his Nation, he ſhould require ſome of their children to be deliver'd up to him as Hoſtages? The Captain, who was of a judgment and underſtanding much beyond the ordinary rate of Savages, immediately reply'd, that the mutual ſafety was to be procur'd upon equal conditions; and that if they deliver'd up ſome of their children to the <hi>French,</hi> it was but juſt the <hi>French</hi> ſhould do the like with them. He thereupon preſented to M. <hi>Auber</hi> ſome of his own children who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd him; and the other accepting of the proffer, made choice of one of them, a young lad, whoſe countenance and demeanour was ſomewhat more pleaſing and attractive, in a word, one who was in ſeveral reſpects more amiable then any of his brethren: The Father was content to part with his Son, and the Son was content to ſtay with M. <hi>Auber;</hi> an accident that ſeldom happens among the Savages. His name was <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labouy.</hi> From that day M. <hi>Auber</hi> treated him as his Son, and always call'd him ſo; and the young Fellow call'd him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When he was put into cloaths, he made a ſhift to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf well enough; nor did he find it any hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enure himſelf to the <hi>European</hi> courſe of life. Captain <hi>Baron</hi> deſir'd to have as a counter-hoſtage one of Miſtreſs <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>'s Sons, who had been firſt wife to M. <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> and was then married to M. <hi>Auber:</hi> But M. <hi>Auber</hi> having repreſented to the Captain, that young <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> was of too ſoft a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to endure the hardſhip of a <hi>Caribbian</hi> life, prevail'd with him to accept by way of Hoſtage, inſtead of him, one of his Servants, who willingly proffer'd to follow him. That young man being of a ſtrong conſtitution, continu'd ſome moneths among the Savages, who treated him with much
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58704:106"/>
kindneſs; but whether the change of air, or nouriſhment caus'd ſome alteration in him, he fell ſick ſome time after: Which Captain <hi>Baron</hi> hearing of, and fearing he might dye among them, he brought him back to M. <hi>Auber,</hi> and requir'd not any other perſon in his ſtead, ſaying that he would have no other Hoſtage then the word of his Companion. True it is, he would have perſwaded his own Son to return along with him, but he could not prevail with him, the Youth tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that he thought himſelf in a better condition with M. <hi>Auber</hi> then with his Father.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Baron</hi> having left at <hi>Gardeloupe</hi> ſo precious an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, took occaſion to make frequent viſits to M. <hi>Auber,</hi> and by that means to ſee his Son: And finding himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely oblig'd to M. <hi>Auber</hi> for the many favours he receiv'd from him, eſpecially for the tender affection he bore his Son, he bethought himſelf to find out ſome occaſions whereby he might expreſs his acknowledgments thereof: He reſolv'd therefore to make a diſcovery to him, that during the Wars between thoſe of his Nation and the <hi>French,</hi> who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>l' Olive,</hi> he had taken a young <hi>French</hi>-man Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and had given him his life only upon this ſcore, that he had ſometime been a Servant to M. <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> his old Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And that it was neer three years that he had him, and gave him more then ordinary liberty, though it had been in his power to put him to death, becauſe he was taken in Arms, and in the heat of the Engagement: But that he had not us'd extremity, remembring the ancient friendſhip between him and M. <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> in whoſe attendance he had ſeen that <hi>French</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. M. <hi>Auber</hi> compaſſionating the young mans condition, entreated the Captain to deliver him up; which he promis'd, and not many days after was as good as his word; and he whoſe good fortune it was to be thus retriv'd, ſtaid a long time after at <hi>Gardeloupe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The generous Captain, not thinking it enough to have thus oblig'd M. <hi>Auber,</hi> and parted with his Priſoner, told him of another Captain of <hi>Dominico</hi> who alſo had a <hi>French</hi>-man in his houſe, a Priſoner at War, and proffer'd to ſollicite that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſet him at liberty. He prevail'd, and ſome days after brought over that other Priſoner, whoſe name was <hi>Jean Jardin.</hi> This being a ſubtle young fellow had gain'd the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions not only of the Captain, whoſe Priſoner he was, but alſo of all the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who had as much kindneſs for him as if he had been of their own Nation: And he had ſuch an excellent memory, that he had got their Language in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Auber</hi> deſirous to make ſome return of theſe good offices and expreſſions of affection, beſides the Preſents he daily made the Captain, would needs oblige his whole Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:58704:107"/>
It was when the Captain was engag'd for the War againſt the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> who inhabit <hi>Trinity</hi>-Iſland, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had made extraordinary preparations. For this nobly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Savage coming to take leave of M. <hi>Auber</hi> before he went upon that expedition, he beſtow'd on him, to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his party, one of his menial Servants, who was his Fowler, named <hi>Des Seriſſiers,</hi> who had a long time wiſh'd himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Engagements of thoſe Savages; and he furniſh'd him with good fire-arms, and all things requiſite to make uſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Baron</hi> was much aſtoniſh'd at that favour, and having joyfully accepted of it, made extraordinary declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof among thoſe of his own Nation. This Volunteer very cheerfully follow'd the Captain, and was at the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the <hi>Arouagues</hi> of <hi>Trinity</hi>-Iſland, to which there came a powerful Army of Savages from all the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands. The <hi>French</hi>-man did as much upon that occaſion as could be expected from a gallant Souldier; and being a good marks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he hurt and wounded ſo many of the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> who were not accuſtomed to feel the effect of fire-arms, that at laſt they took the rout, and retreated into the mountains, leaving the ſpoil to the victorious <hi>Caribbians.</hi> From that time <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſiers</hi> was ever look'd upon by thoſe of that Nation as a great Captain; and they could not ſufficiently admire the kindneſs of the <hi>French</hi> Governour, who voluntarily depriv'd himſelf of that young mans ſervice, and lent him to them. All the particulars of this relation we have from very good hands, eſpecially M. <hi>Auber</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>During all the time of M. <hi>Auber</hi>'s government of <hi>Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe,</hi> the peace made with the <hi>Caribbians</hi> was inviolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd on both ſides, to the great advantage of both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For the Savages by that agreement had the opportunity to treat with the <hi>French</hi> for wedges, hooks, knives, and ſeveral other inſtruments and commodities which they look upon as the moſt neceſſary: And the <hi>French</hi> receiv'd from them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, Swine, Lizards, Sea-Turtles or Tortoiſes, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of other fiſhes, and other refreſhments, whereof they made a good advantage. So that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> were as it were the Pourvoyers of the <hi>French,</hi> who in the mean time labour'd in their Plantations without any diſturbance.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Trading and Employments of the Forreign Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Country; and firſt, of the culture and ordering of Tobacco.</head>
               <p>IN the <hi>Caribbies</hi> Money is not us'd in order to the carrying on of ordinary Traffick, but this is perform'd by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of thoſe Commodities which are of the growth of the Country for ſuch as are brought out of <hi>Europe,</hi> whether they conſiſt in Cloaths, Linnen, Ammunition, or Proviſions, and other neceſſaries requiſite for the better conveniences and enjoyments of life. And this was the common courſe of all Nations before the uſe of Money, and is to this day practis'd in divers ſavage Countries, and particularly in <hi>Colchida,</hi> where every one brings to the Market what he hath ſuperfluous, to ſupply himſelf with what he wants.</p>
               <p>The Store-houſes and Magazines of theſe Iſlands are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly well furniſh'd with all ſorts of Commodities which are brought out of <hi>England, France, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> nay as plentifully as in any place in the world. The price of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Commodity is not left to the choice of the Merchants who keep the Store-houſes, but ſet upon it by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, with the advice of their Council. The Commodities which the Inhabitants bring in exchange for thoſe before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, are reducible to five ſpecies; to wit, Tobacco, Sugar, Ginger, Indico, and Cotton.</p>
               <p>At the beginning all the forreign Inhabitants of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbies</hi> apply'd themſelves wholly to the culture of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, whereby they made a ſhift to get a competent livelihood; but afterwards the abundance that was made bringing down the price of it, they have in ſeveral places employ'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the planting of Sugar-canes, Ginger, and Indico: And it hath pleas'd God ſo to proſper their deſigns, that it is almoſt a miracle to ſee with what improvement all theſe Commodities grow in moſt of the Iſlands. And foraſmuch as many who ſee them in <hi>Europe</hi> know not how they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, it will be a great ſatisfaction to their curioſity, to give a ſhort account of each of them; whereto we ſhall adde ſomewhat concerning Cotton.</p>
               <p>True it is, that divers Authors have already treated of them; but in regard our Hiſtory would be defective, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be ſaid concerning them, we are in the firſt place to aſſure the Reader, that the whole diſcourſe we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make thereof is not a Copy or Extract out of any other, but a true Original naturally taken with much care
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58704:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and fidelity: So that if we ſay the ſame things as others have done before us, thoſe who ſhall peruſe our work will not be much troubled to find here the confirmation of a truth which comes from ſo remote a part of the world, and whereof they cannot have too great an aſſurance: And if they find any thing that ſeems to claſh with ſome precedent relations, they are to look on it as a diſcovery of the falſhood of thoſe which are contrary thereto: Or at leaſt ours will make it apparent, that in all places the Planters do not ſo exactly follow the ſame method in the ordering of theſe Commodities, but that ſometimes ſome alteration may be obſerv'd therein. Beſides, we have this further hope, that ſome will find in the following deſcriptions a certain exactneſs and cleerneſs which they will think not unacceptable to them; nay they may haply meet with ſomething therein that is new, and ſuch as hath not been obſerv'd by any other Authors: But if there be any who ſhall think there is not any thing in this and the next Chapter which they know not already, that is, nothing which may either inſtruct or divert them, they are deſir'd not to blame our diligence, and imagine them written for others who may receive ſome inſtruction or divertiſement thereby, and acknowledge themſelves oblig'd to us for our care.</p>
               <p>For the getting of good and merchantable Tobacco, the firſt thing to be done, is, in the proper ſeaſon to prepare the beds in ſeveral places of the Gardens, ſuch as have good ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the winds; then they ſow in them the ſeed which had been gather'd from the ſtalks of the precedent year, which they ſuffer to grow and ripen for that purpoſe: They mix aſhes with the ſeed when it is ſown, that it may not fall too thick in ſome places: When it begins to appear above ground, it is carefully cover'd with the leaves of the prickly Palms, or with branches of Orange, or Citron-trees, to ſecure it from the exceſſive heat of the Sun, the coolneſs of the night, and the ſpoil which tame Fowl and Birds might make in it.</p>
               <p>While the Plant is growing up to a condition that it may be tranſplanted, the place into which it is to be remov'd is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. If the Plantation be but newly eſtabliſh'd, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that it ſhould have been cleer'd of wood ſome conſiderable time before, and that the branches ſhould be burnt upon the ground, and over the beds: And if after all that there be any thing remaining, whatever is not burnt muſt be convey'd quite away, that the place may be free. True it is, there's no need of digging the earth of turning it up, nor yet of delv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hut only of cleering it of all weeds, ſo as that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main not any wood, nor bark, nor leaf, nor ſo much as the leaſt graſs. To do that, they make uſe of a kind of broad and ſharp Hoes, which pare and take off the ſurface of the ground,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58704:108"/>
and if need be, carry along with them the roots of the weeds, whoſe after-growth they would prevent.</p>
               <p>The ground being thus prepar'd, it is divided into ſeveral ridges or beds diſtant one from the other two or three foot. To do this, they make uſe of long cords, which at the diſtance of every two foot, or thereabouts, are marked with a little piece of cloth, which is ſew'd thereto; and then they place little ſticks at all the places anſwerable to thoſe marks; to the end, that when the time of tranſplanting the young Tobacco is come, which is immediately after it hath pleas'd God to ſend a good ſhower of rain, they ſhould have nothing elſe to do but to plant, and not loſe time in making thoſe diviſions of the Garden or Plantation.</p>
               <p>The Tobacco-plant is ready for its removal out of the bed where it had been firſt ſown, when it hath four or five leaves ſtrong and thick enough, and about the bredth of a mans hand; for then, if it happen that the ground is ſoftned by a pleaſant ſhower of rain, all thoſe who are deſirous of having good Tobacco with the firſt ſeaſon matter not much the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of being wet, ſo they can but ſet a good quantity of it in the ground. At that time there is an emulation among the good huſbands, every one endeavouring to outvye the other in working: Some are employ'd in chuſing and taking off the Plants from the beds, and diſpoſing them into baſkets; others carry them to thoſe whoſe work it is to plant them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly at the places which had been before marked by the cord, as we ſaid elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are employ'd about the planting of them make a hole in the ground with a ſharp ſtick, into which they ſet the root of the Tobacco; then they thruſt the earth pretty hard about, yet ſo as that the upper part of the Plant be not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd: And thus they do all along every rank, and aſſoon as they have finiſh'd one they begin another. Having performed that exerciſe, at the next meeting of the Neighbours together their common diſcourſe is, to enquire one of another how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of Plants they have ſet in the ground, and thence calculate the hopes of the future harveſt.</p>
               <p>The Plant being thus ſet in the ground, which is commonly done in ſeveral intervalls, in regard it ſeldom happens that there is ſo plentiful a fall of rain as that it might be done at once, or haply becauſe the ground is not all prepar'd at the ſame time, or that there are not Plants enough, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon neglected; on the contrary, this is but the beginning of the pains and care which the ordering of it requires; for the Planters muſt be very careful to viſit it often, and aſſoon as they have perceiv'd that it hath taken root, there muſt be a ſpecial care taken that the Caterpillars and other miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Inſects, whereof there are abundance in thoſe Countries, do not gnaw it, and hinder its growth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:58704:109"/>The next work is, at leaſt once every month, to weed away whatever might endanger the ſmothering of it, diligently to grub up and rake the earth all about it, and to carry away the weeds to the extremities of the Plantation; for if they be left in the place where they are laid upon their being taken out of the ground, the leaſt rain would make them take root afreſh, and they would require a ſecond weeding. The moſt troubleſom herb of any, and that which cauſes moſt trouble to get out of the Plantations, is Purſlane, which in theſe parts of the world grows not without the pains and induſtry of Gardeners. This exerciſe is continu'd till ſuch time as the Tobacco-plant hath cover'd all the adjacent ground, and that the ſhade of it keeps down all other weeds.</p>
               <p>But though all this be done, yet are not the Planters at reſt, inaſmuch as anſwerably to the growth of the Plant in height and bredth, ſome muſt be continually employ'd in cutting off the ſuperfluous leaves, taking away thoſe that are dry'd up, rotten or decay'd, cleering it of all thoſe ſhoots and ſuckers which might hinder its coming to perfection, by diverting the ſap from the larger leaves: In fine, when the ſtalk is grown to a convenient height, it muſt be check'd, by cutting off the top of every Plant, thoſe only excepted which are reſerv'd for ſeed. After all this ordering, the Plant is to continue ſome weeks in the ground ere it comes to maturity, during which there is a little ceſſation of labour and attendance about it.</p>
               <p>But if the laborious Planter be exempted from the great pains he had beſtow'd about it, he ſhall not want work; for there muſt be a place prepar'd, where it is to be diſpos'd as ſoon as it is ripe. Care muſt be taken, that the Grange or Store-houſe, where it ought to be dry'd to a certain medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, be well cover'd and cloſe of all ſides; that it be furniſh'd with good ſtore of poles fit for it to be laid upon; that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be made of a certain thin bark taken from a tree called <hi>Mahot,</hi> to faſten every Plant to the poles; and that the place deſign'd for the making of it up into rolls or pricks ſhould have all things requiſite for that work.</p>
               <p>While all theſe preparations are made, if the Tobacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves loſe ever ſo little of their firſt verdure, and withal begin to bow down more then ordinary towards the ground, and if the ſcent of them grows ſtronger, it is a ſign that the Plant is come to maturity: And then, taking a very fair day, after the dew is fallen off, it is to be cut about an inch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ground, and left upon the place till the evening, turning it once or twice, that the Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> may take away ſomewhat of its moiſture: In the evening it is carry'd by armfuls into the houſe. It is faſten'd by the lower end of the ſtalk to the poles, ſo that the leaves hang downwards: It is alſo requiſite that they ſhould not be laid too cloſe one to the other, leſt they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58704:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be corrupted, or be not dry enough, for want of air.</p>
               <p>This firſt cutting down of the Tobacco being over, they often viſit the Plants which are hung up a drying, while the reſt which had been left growing comes to ripeneſs; and when they find the leaves fit to be made up into rolls, that is, when they are neither too dry (for in that caſe they would not be able to endure the wheel), nor yet too moiſt (for then they would corrupt in a ſhort time), they are taken off the poles, they are laid in heaps at the end of the Grange, and every ſtalk is ſtript of its leaves, after this manner.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, they lay aſide all the longeſt and all the broadeſt leaves, and they take away the great ſtalk which runs through the midſt of them; the leſſer leaves are alſo laid by themſelves, to be diſpos'd within the roll, and the greater ſerve for coverings and ſhrowds for them. Theſe leaves thus diſpos'd are ranked on planks or tables, cloſe by him who is to make them up into rolls, which he makes big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or ſmaller, as may be ſeen by thoſe brought over into theſe parts.</p>
               <p>There is a certain art in making up the rolls, and thoſe who can do it with expedition and dexterity are highly eſteem'd, and get much more then thoſe who are employ'd about order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground: They muſt have their hands and arms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſupple and nimble, to make the wheel turn with ſuch ſpeed, and ſtill to obſerve the ſame proportion, that ſo the roll may be equally big in all parts.</p>
               <p>There is a particular artifice, in the buſineſs of Tobacco, to diſpoſe and lay it after the winding ſo as that it may be the more eaſily put up on the ſticks, which are all to be of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bigneſs and length, to avoid deceit.</p>
               <p>When the Tobacco is thus made up, it is convey'd to the Store-houſe, and cover'd with <hi>Bananas</hi> or ſome other leaves, that it may not be prejudic'd by taking wind, and be of a good fair colour. That which cuts ſomewhat unctuouſly, is black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and ſhining, and hath a pleaſant and ſtrong ſcent, and burns eaſily in the Pipe, is accounted the beſt.</p>
               <p>We told you, that the Tobacco-plant was cut almoſt even with the ground, and not pluck'd up by the roots; and it is purpoſely ſo cut, that it may ſhoot forth new ſtalks: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it produces a ſecond Plant, but ſuch as is neither ſo ſtrong nor ſo fair as the former; nor is the Tobacco made thereof ſo much eſteem'd, nor will keep ſo well: It is call'd by ſome Shoot-Tobacco, or Sucker-Tobacco, or Tobacco of the ſecond cutting or growth: Nay ſome will have three ſhoots from the ſame ſtalk; and that humour hath brought the Tobacco which comes from ſome Iſlands into diſ-eſteem.</p>
               <p>Now ſince we have expreſs'd our ſelves ſo much at large concerning the manufacture of Tobacco, we ſhall not think
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58704:110"/>
it improper to inſert in this place what is practis'd by ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſons, whereby it is made more excellent then that which commonly goes under the name of <hi>Virinus-Tobacco,</hi> keeps well, and hath a ſcent which fortifies the brain. After they have ſet aſide the Plants of the firſt cutting, and while they are drying on the poles, they gather together all the caſt leaves, the ſmall ſhoots, as alſo the filaments which are taken out of the midſt of the leaves which have been already cleer'd; and after they have pounded them in a mortar, all is put into a bag, which is put into a preſs to force out the juice, which is afterwards boil'd over a ſoft fire till it be reduc'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of a Syrup: That done, there is put into that decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a little <hi>Copal,</hi> which is an aromatick gum, the virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to fortifie the brain. This gum diſtills from a tree of the ſame name, which is common in the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> and in the Iſlands about the gulf of <hi>Hondures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this drug is put into the compoſition aforeſaid, it muſt be well ſtirr'd, that its ſweet ſcent and other qualities may be communicated and diffus'd through the whole decoction: Then it muſt be taken off the fire, and when it is cold it is ſet in a veſſel neer the perſon who makes up the roll of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and as often as he takes a handful of the leaves to feed the roll, he muſt wet his hand in that liquor, and wipe it with the leaves. This ſecret hath an admirable effect to make the Tobacco keep well, and derives to it a virtue which extremely heightens its price.</p>
               <p>The Tobacco thus order'd is to be made up into a roll, at leaſt as big as a mans thumb, and be afterwards divided into little rolls not weighing above ten pound at the moſt, and then ſent in little veſſels or cloſe baſkets made for that purpoſe, to keep it the better. Some Inhabitants of the Iſlands having made tryal of this ſecret, have put off theirs for right <hi>Virinus</hi>-Tobacco, and ſold it at the ſame rate.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who imagine that Tobacco grows without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that rolls of it are, as they ſay, found growing on Trees in <hi>America,</hi> and that there is no more to be done but to ſhake them down; or haply are perſwaded that it requires no great trouble to bring them to perfection, will be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd when they come to read this relation of the culture and preparation of Tobacco; whereto we have only this to adde, that if they had themſelves ſeen the poor Servants and Slaves, who are employ'd about this painful work, expos'd the greateſt part of the day to the ſcorching heat of the Sun, and ſpending one half of the night in reducing it to that poſture wherein it is tranſported into <hi>Europe,</hi> no doubt they would have a greater eſteem for, and think much more precious that herb, which is procur'd with the ſweat and labours of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſerable creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:58704:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>We ſhall not need to inſert here what Phyſitians write of the miraculous effects of Tobacco, but leave the more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to conſult their Books, wherein they give a ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof: Only this we ſhall affirm, that the virtues of it muſt needs be very great, ſince it hath its courſe all over the world, and that in a manner all Nations upon Earth, as well thoſe that are civiliz'd as thoſe that ſtill continue in their Barbariſm, have afforded it a kind reception, and have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd the taking of it: And though ſome Princes have prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the uſe of it in their Territories, out of a fear that the money of their Subjects, which is rare and precious, ſhould be turn'd into ſmoak, and ſlip out of their hands for a thing which ſeems not to be ſo neceſſary to life; yet is there not any but will allow it a place among the drugs and remedies of Phyſick.</p>
               <p>The more delicate and curious among thoſe Nations who are diſpos'd into hot Countries, qualifie it with Sage, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, and certain Perfumes, which give it a very pleaſant ſcent; and having reduc'd it to powder, they take it in at the noſtril. Thoſe Nations who inhabit cold Countries, forbid not Perſons of Quality the uſe of it; nay it is a perfection and certain gallantry in the Ladies of thoſe Parts, gracefully to handle a Pipe, whereof the boal is of Coral or Amber, and the head of Silver or Gold, and to puff out the ſmoak of this herb without the leaſt wrinkle or wry face, and to let it out of the mouth after ſeveral little intervalls, which raiſing ſo many little vapours of a browniſh colour, ſeems a kind of foil to ſet off the cleerneſs of their complection. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition we have before deſcribed, which heightens the good ſcent of Tobacco, will no doubt be kindly receiv'd by thoſe perſons who place the ſmoking of a pipe of Tobacco among the pleaſures and enjoyments of this life.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the manner how Sugar is made; and of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ginger, Indico, and Cotton.</head>
               <p>WHen the great plenty of Tobacco made at S. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> and the other Iſlands had brought down the price of it ſo low, that it did not turn to accompt, it pleas'd God to put it into the heart of the <hi>French</hi> General <hi>de Poincy,</hi> to find out ſome other ways to facilitate the ſubſiſtence of the Inhabitants, and carry on ſome Trade: He thereupon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his Servants and Slaves about the culture of Sugar-Canes, Ginger, and Indico; and the deſign met with a ſucceſs beyond what was expected.</p>
               <p>Though it may be granted, that the Plant of the Sugar-Cane was known to the Ancients, yet is the invention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sugar but of late years: The Ancients knew no more of it then they did of <hi>Sena, Caſſia, Ambergreece, Musk, Civet,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin:</hi> They made no other uſe of this precious Reed, then in order to drink and Phyſick. And therefore we may well oppoſe all theſe things, with much advantage, as alſo our Clocks, the Sea-Compaſs, the Art of Navigation, Proſpective-glaſſes, Printing. Artillery, and ſeveral other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Inventions of the laſt Ages, againſt their right way of dying Purple, their malleable Glaſs, the ſubtle Machines of their <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and ſome ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Having in the precedent Book given a deſcription of the Sugar-Cane, our buſineſs here will only be to repreſent the manner how Sugar is gotten out of it.</p>
               <p>That work is performed by a Machine or Mill, which ſome call an <hi>Ingenio,</hi> whereby the juice within the Canes is ſqueez'd out. Theſe Mills are built of very ſolid and laſting wood, and are more convenient in theſe Iſlands then thoſe uſed to the ſame purpoſe at <hi>Madera</hi> and <hi>Braſil:</hi> Nor is it to be fear'd in the former, as many times in the latter, that the fire ſhould get to the boiling Coppers, and ſet all into a flame, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe who are employ'd about the work; for the Coppers in theſe Iſlands are ſeen to boil, yet the fire that cauſes it is made and kept in on the outſide by furnaces, which are ſo well cemented, that neither the flame nor the ſmoak does any way hinder thoſe who are at work, which they may follow without any fear of danger or inconvenience.</p>
               <p>The ordinary way of turning the Mills is by Horſes or Oxen; but the <hi>French</hi> Governour hath one which is turn'd by water, which falling on a wheel ſets the whole Machine going.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:58704:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>When the Sugar-Canes are ripe, they are cut ſomewhat neer the ground, above the firſt knot which is without any juice; and having cut off the tops, and taken away certain little, long, and very thin leaves, which encompaſs them; they are made up into bundles, and carry'd to the Mills to be there preſs'd and ſqueez'd between two rollers, turning one upon the other.</p>
               <p>The juice which is ſqueez'd out of them falls into a great Ciſtern, whence it is convey'd through long pipes or channels into the veſſels appointed for the boiling of it. In great Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-works there are at leaſt ſix Coppers, whereof three very large ones are of copper, about the bredth and depth of thoſe us'd by Dyers, and are to clarifie the juice, which is to be boil'd with a gentle fire, putting in ever and anon a ſmall quantity of a certain very ſtrong Lye, made of water and aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, commonly call'd <hi>Temper,</hi> which makes all the filth to boil up, which as it appears is taken off with a great braſs ſkim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. When the juice is well purify'd in theſe three Coppers, into which it had been convey'd alternately one after another, it is ſtrain'd through a cloth, and afterwards pour'd into three other Coppers of ſome other mettal, which are very thick, broad enough, and about a foot and a half deep. In theſe Coppers the Sugar receives its laſt boiling; for then there is a more violent fire made, and it is continually ſtirr'd, and when it bubbles up ſo as that it may be fear'd it ſhould boil over the Coppers, it is allay'd by the caſting in of a little ſallet-oil; and as it begins to grow thick, it is pour'd into the laſt of thoſe Coppers, from whence, as it inclines to a conſiſtency, it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd into veſſels of wood or earth, and ſo carry'd into the Curing-houſe, where it is whiten'd with a kind of fat earth mixt with water, which is ſpred upon it; then they open the little hole in the bottom of every veſſel or pot, that all the filth or dregs that is about the Sugar may fall into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther channel, which conveys it into a veſſel prepar'd for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſkimmings which had been taken off the great Coppers is laid aſide only for Cattle, but the other ſerves well enough to make a certain drink for the Servants and Slaves. The juice which is drawn from the Cane will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue good but one day, inſomuch that if within that time it be not boil'd, it grows ſharp and turns to vinegar. There muſt alſo be a very great care taken, that the Reſervatory into which the ſqueezed juice falls, and the pipes or channels whereby it is thence convey'd into other places, be often waſh'd; for if they contract ever ſo little ſharpneſs, the juice cannot be reduc'd to Sugar: The whole work would alſo miſcarry, if any butter or oil chance to be caſt into any of the three greater Coppers, which are to be waſh'd with Lye; or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58704:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in like manner, if ever ſo little Lye fall into the three leſſer ones, where the juice is form'd into a Syrup, and curdles by the violence of the fire, and the continual agitation and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it with a ſkimmer. But above all things there muſt be a great care taken, that there fall not any juice of Citron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coppers; for that would abſolutely hinder the coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sugar.</p>
               <p>Many of the Inhabitants who are not able to get ſo many Coppers, nor furniſh themſelves with thoſe great Engines whereby the Canes are ſqueez'd, have little Mills made like Preſſes, which are wrought by two or three men, or driven about by one horſe; and with one or two Coppers they purifie the juice gotten out of them, reduce it to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of Syrup, and make good Sugar without any further trouble.</p>
               <p>The greateſt ſecret in the buſineſs of making good Sugar conſiſts in the whitening of it: Thoſe who have it are very loth to communicate it. From what hath been ſaid, it may be eaſily inferr'd what extraordinary advantages accrue to the Inhabitants of that Iſland by means of this ſweet and precious Commodity, and what ſatisfaction it brings to their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents in other parts of the world, who have it at ſo eaſie rates.</p>
               <p>This plenty of Sugar hath put the Inhabitants upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of abundance of excellent fruits of the growth of the Iſland, as Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, and others, eſpecially Ginger, whereof we ſhall give an account anon, and the fruit call'd <hi>Ananas,</hi> and the flowers of Oranges and Citrons.</p>
               <p>As concerning the preparation of Ginger, when the root is come to maturity it is taken out of the ground; then it is dry'd in places well air'd, and it is often ſtirr'd to prevent corruption. Some make no more ado then to expoſe it to the Sun in order to the drying of it; but others think it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to caſt lime on it, the more to facilitate the drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the moiſture. This root, which is one of the moſt conſiderable among Spices, is tranſported all over the world; but it is moſt ſought after in cold Countries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> do ſometimes take it out of the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fully ripe, and preſerve it whole with ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that it becomes red, and tranſparent as glaſs. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd Ginger which is brought over from <hi>Brazil</hi> and the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> is commonly dry, full of filaments or little ſtrings, and too biting to be eaten with any delight; but that which is prepar'd at S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> hath no fibres or ſtrings at all, and it is ſo well order'd, that there remains nothing that is unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the tooth when it is eaten.</p>
               <p>It hath a ſingular property to fortifie the breaſt, when it is weakned by a confluence of cold humours; as alſo to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58704:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
clear the voice, to ſweeten the breath, to cauſe a good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the face, to take away the crudities of the ſtomach, to promote digeſtion, to ſharpen the appetite, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that wateriſhneſs and phlegm which puts the body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a languiſhing condition; nay it is affirm'd by ſome, that it preſerves and wonderfully fortifies the memory, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing the cold humours, or the phlegm of the Brain. This root may alſo be reduc'd into a paſte, of which there may be made a Conſerve, or cordial Electuary that hath the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>We come now to give a ſhort account of Indico. The Plant being cut is bound up into little bundles or fagots, and left to rot in ciſterns of ſtone or wood full of fair water, on which there is caſt a certain quantity of oil, which according to its nature covers all the ſurface of it: They lay ſtones upon the fagots, that they may the better keep under the water; and after three or four days that the water hath been boiling, which it does by the meer virtue of the Plant, without any aſſiſtance of fire, the leaf being rotted and diſſolv'd by that natural heat which is in the ſtalk, they take great ſtakes and ſtir the whole maſs that is within the ciſterns, ſo to get out all the ſubſtance of it; and after it is ſetled again, they take out of the ciſtern that part of the ſtalk which is not rotted: that done, they ſeveral times ſtir what is left in the ciſtern, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have left it to ſetle, they let out the water at a cock; and the lees or dregs which remains at the bottom of the ciſtern, is put into molds, or left to dry in the Sun. Theſe dregs is that which is ſo much eſteem'd by Dyers, and commonly known by the name of Indico.</p>
               <p>There are ſome make uſe of Preſſes, whereinto having put little bundles of the rotted Plant, they by that means get out all the juice of it: But in regard they are the leaves of the Plant that the foreſaid Commodity is made of, thoſe who are deſirous to have it of the higheſt price, think it enough to have the dregs which remains after the corruption of thoſe leaves, and is found, after ſo many ſtirrings, at the bottom of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> were there a long time ere they drove any trade in that Commodity, by reaſon that the Plant whereof it is made, being of it ſelf of a very ſtrong ſcent, exhales an inſupportable ſtink when it is rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But ſince Tobacco came to ſo low a rate, and that in ſome places the ground would not bring forth that which was good, as it had done ſome time before, they apply'd themſelves to the culture of Indico, whereof they now make a conſiderable advantage.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as concerning Cotton, the <hi>French</hi> make it not much their buſineſs to gather it, though they have many of the trees

that bear it in the hedges of their Plantations: But all put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether amounts but to little in compariſon of what is ſaid of a certain Quarter of the Province of <hi>China;</hi> for a certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour named <hi>Trigaut,</hi> in the xvii. chap. of the fifth Book of his Hiſtory, affirms, that there grows ſo much Cotton there as finds work enough for two hundred thouſand Weavers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> who are the Inhabitants of the <hi>Barbouthos</hi> drive a great trade in this Commodity, as alſo thoſe who liv'd formerly in the Iſland of <hi>Santa-cruce.</hi> There is no great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the making of Cotton fit for the market; for all to be done, is to get out of the half-open'd button that matter which in a manner forces its way out it ſelf: And whereas it is full of the ſeed of the tree that bears it, which are like little beans intangled within the Cotton, in the midſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had their production, there are a ſort of little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines made with ſuch artifice, that by the turning of a wheel, whereby they are put into motion, the Cotton falls on the one ſide, and the ſeed on the other: That done, the Cotton is thruſt up as cloſe as may be into bags, that ſo it may take up the leſs room.</p>
               <p>Thus have we given a brief account of the principal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments which keep up the Commerce of the Iſlands, and the Commodities wherein the Inhabitants do ordinarily trade.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the more honourable Employments of the <hi>European</hi> Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies;</hi> their Slaves; and their Government.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>European</hi> Colonies which have planted themſelves in the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> do not conſiſt only of a ſort of Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds and perſons of mean condition, as ſome fondly imagine, but there are alſo among them many of Quality, and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from noble Families: So that the Employments we menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the precedent Chapter, are deſign'd only for the moſt inconſiderable of the Inhabitants, and ſuch whoſe neceſſities have forc'd them to earn their bread with the labour of their hands, and the ſweat of their brows: But the others, who are able to hire people to overſee their Servants and Slaves, and to ſee that they do their work, lead pleaſant lives, and want not thoſe enjoyments thereof which are to be had in other Countries. Their employments and divertiſements, beſides the frequent viſits they make and receive with extraordinary expreſſions of civility, are Hunting, Fiſhing, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable

exerciſes; nay they endeavour to outvye one the other in their entertainments, wherein they are magnificent, there being a ſufficient plenty of Beef, Mutton, Pork, wild and tame Fowl of all kinds, Fiſh, Paſtry, and excellent Conſerves, all in as great abundance as at the beſt Tables in the <hi>European</hi> parts of the world. And theſe mutual demonſtrations of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are deriv'd from the Officers and thoſe of the better rank to the meaneſt Inhabitants, who think it a great want of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to diſmiſs any one from their houſes, before they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them with ſomewhat to eat and drink.</p>
               <p>Wine, Beer, Brandy, and <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and ſuch drinks, are ſeldom wanting in theſe Iſlands; and if there ſhould chance to be a ſcarcity of theſe, the Inhabitants have the art of making a delicious drink of that ſweet liquor which is got out of the Sugar-canes, and that being kept for certain days becomes as ſtrong as any Sack: Of the ſame liquor they alſo make an excellent kind of <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> not much unlike that which is brought thither out of <hi>France;</hi> only this inconvenience it hath, that they who drink exceſſively of it are apt to fall dangerouſly ſick. Moreover, they make ſeveral kinds of Beverage with the juice of <hi>Oranges, Figs, Bananas,</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> which are all very delicious and pleaſant to the taſte, and may be ranked among Wines: They alſo make a ſort of Beer of the <hi>Caſsava</hi> and the roots of <hi>Potatoes,</hi> which is as pleaſant, nouriſhing, and refreſhing as that which is brought out of the Low-Countries.</p>
               <p>As concerning thoſe Employments which are equally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and neceſſary in order to the welfare of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of theſe Iſlands, it is to be obſerv'd, that all are taught the uſe of Arms, and the Heads of Families ſeldom walk abroad without their Swords. Every Quarter is diſpos'd under the command of certain Captains and other Officers, who have the overſight thereof. They are all well-arm'd, and they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten muſter and are exercis'd even in the times of deepeſt peace; ſo that they are always in readineſs, at the firſt beat of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And whereas all perſons of Quality, whereof there is a conſiderable number in thoſe Iſlands, have Servants and Slaves who are employ'd about the works before-mentioned, and that in moſt parts of <hi>Europe</hi> they do not make uſe of Slaves, there being only the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Portuguez</hi> who go and buy them up at the places of their birth, ſuch as are <hi>Angola, Cap-vert,</hi> and <hi>Guinny,</hi> it will be but requiſite that we here give a ſhort account of them: But we ſhall in the firſt place ſpeak of thoſe who are hired Servants, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſuch only for a certain time.</p>

                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:58704:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>As for the <hi>French</hi> who are carried over out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> to ſerve there, they commonly deliver obligatory acts to their Maſters, which is done before publick Notaries; by which writings they oblige themſelves to ſerve them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpace of three years, conditionally to receive from them ſo many pounds of Tobacco, according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have made during that term. Theſe <hi>French</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, by reaſon of the three years ſervice they are engag'd to, are commonly called the <hi>Thirty-ſix-months-men,</hi> according to the Language of the Iſlands. There are ſome ſo ſimple as to imagine, that if they be not oblig'd to their Maſters in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before their departure out of <hi>France,</hi> they are ſo much the leſs oblig'd when they are brought into the Iſlands; but they are extremely miſtaken; for when they are brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Governour to complain that they were carried aboard againſt their wills, or to plead that they are not oblig'd by writing, they are condemn'd for the ſpace of three years to ſerve either him who hath paid for their paſſage, or ſuch other as it ſhall pleaſe the Maſter to appoint. If the Maſter hath promis'd his Servant no more then the ordinary recompence of the Iſlands, he is oblig'd to give him for his three years ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice but three hundred weight of Tobacco, which is no great matter to find himſelf in linnen and cloaths; for the Maſter is not engag'd to ſupply him with any thing but food: But he who before his departure out of <hi>France</hi> promiſes to give three hundred weight of Tobacco to him whom he receives into his ſervice, is oblig'd exactly to pay it, nay though he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him a thouſand: It is therefore the Servants beſt courſe to make his bargain ſure before he comes out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Slaves, and ſuch as are to be perpetual Servants, who are commonly employ'd in theſe Iſlands, they are originally <hi>Africans,</hi> and they are brought over thither from the Country about <hi>Cap-vert,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Angolae,</hi> and other Sea-ports which are on the Coaſts of that part of the world; where they are bought and ſold after the ſame manner as Cattle in other places.</p>
               <p>Of theſe, ſome are reduc'd to a neceſſity of ſelling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and entring into a perpetual ſlavery, they and their children, to avoid ſtarving; for in the years of ſterility, which happen very frequently, eſpecially when the Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers, which like clouds ſpread themſelves over the whole Country, have conſum'd all the fruits of the earth, they are brought to ſuch a remedileſs extremity, that they will ſubmit to the moſt rigorous conditions in the world, provided they may be kept from ſtarving. When they are reduc'd to thoſe exigencies, the Father makes no difficulty to ſell his children for bread; and the children forſake Father and Mother with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regret.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:58704:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>Another ſort of them are ſold after they have been taken Priſoners in War by ſome petty neighbouring Prince; for it is the cuſtom of the Princes of thoſe Parts to make frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions into the Territories of their Neighbours, purpoſely for the taking of Priſoners, whom they afterwards ſell to the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> and other Nations with whom they drive that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Trade: They receive in exchange for them Iron (which is as precious with them as Gold), Wine, <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> Brandy, or ſome poor Clothing: They make Slaves of the women as well as the men, and they are ſold one with another, at a higher or lower rate, according to their youth, age, ſtrength, or weakneſs, handſomneſs, or deformity of body. They who bring them over to the Iſlands make a ſecond ſale of them, at fifteen or ſixteen hundred weight of Tobacco every head, more or leſs, as the parties concern'd can agree.</p>
               <p>If theſe poor Slaves chance to fall into the hands of a good Maſter, one who will not treat them with too much ſeverity, they prefer their preſent ſlavery before their former liberty, the loſs whereof they never afterwards regret: And if they are permitted to marry, they multiply extremely in thoſe hot Countries.</p>
               <p>They are all Negroes, and thoſe who are of the brighteſt black are accounted the faireſt: Moſt of them are flat-nos'd, and have thick lips, which goes among them for beauty; nay there are ſome affirm, that in their Country the Midwives do purpoſely cruſh down their noſes, that they may be flat, aſſoon as they come into the world: The hair of their heads is all frizl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, ſo that they can hardly make uſe of Combs; but to prevent the breeding of vermine, they rub their heads with the oil of that ſhrub which is called <hi>Palma-Christi:</hi> They are very ſtrong and hardy, but withal ſo fearful and unwieldy in the handling of Arms, that they are eaſily reduc'd under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>They are naturally ſuſceptible of all impreſſions, and the firſt that are deriv'd into them among the Chriſtians, after they have renounc'd their Superſtitions and Idolatry, they pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly adhere unto; wherein they differ much from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> who are as unconſtant as Cameleons. Among the <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> there are ſome Negroes who punctually obſerve abſtinence all the time of Lent, and all the other Faſting-days appointed by the Church, without any remiſſion of their ordinary and continual labour.</p>
               <p>They are commonly proud and inſolent; and whereas the <hi>Indians</hi> are deſirous to be gently treated, and are apt to dye out of pure grief, if they be put to more then ordinary hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, theſe on the contrary are to be kept in awe by threats and blows; for if a man grow too familiar with them, they are preſently apt to make their advantages of it, and to abuſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58704:115"/>
that familiarity; but if they be chaſtiz'd with moderation when they have done amiſs, they become better, more ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and more compliant, nay will commend and think the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Maſters: But on the other ſide, if they be treated with exceſſive ſeverity, they will run away, and get into the Mountains and Foreſts, where they live like ſo many Beaſts; then they are call'd <hi>Marons,</hi> that is to ſay, Savages: or haply they will grow ſo deſperate as to be their own Executioners. It is therefore requiſite, that in the conduct of them there ſhould be a mean obſerv'd between extream ſeverity and too much indulgence, by thoſe who would keep them in awe, and make the beſt advantage of them.</p>
               <p>They are paſſionate Lovers one of another; and though they are born in different Countries, and ſometimes, when at home, Enemies one to another, yet when occaſion requires they mutually ſupport and aſſiſt one another, as if they were all Brethren: And when their Maſters give them the liberty to recreate themſelves, they reciprocally viſit one the other, and paſs away whole nights in playing, dancing, and other paſtimes and divertiſments; nay, ſometimes they have ſome little Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, every one ſparing what he can to contribute to the common repaſt.</p>
               <p>They are great Lovers of Muſick, and much pleas'd with ſuch Inſtruments as make a certain delightful noiſe, and a kind of harmony, which they accompany with their voices. They had heretofore in the Iſland of S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> a certain Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz in the midſt of the Woods, where they met on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days and Holidays after Divine Service, to give ſome relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their wearied bodies: There they ſometimes ſpent the remainder of that day, and the night following, in dancing and pleaſant diſcourſes, without any prejudice to the ordinary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours impos'd upon them by their Maſters: nay, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerv'd, that after they had ſo diverted themſelves, they went through their work with greater courage and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without expreſſing any wearineſs, and did all things bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than if they had reſted all night long in their huts. But it being found, that the better to enjoy themſelves in theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meetings, they many times ſtole the Poultry and Fruits of their Neighbours, and ſometimes thoſe of their Maſters, the <hi>French</hi> General thought fit to forbid theſe nocturnal aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: So that now if they are deſirous to divert themſelves, they are enjoyn'd to do it within their own Neighbourhoods, with the permiſſion of their Maſters, who are willing enough to allow them convenient liberty.</p>
               <p>As to the Advantages accrewing from the labours of theſe Slaves, he who is Maſter of a dozen of them may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a rich man: For beſides that theſe are the People who cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the ground in order to its production of all neceſſary

proviſions for the ſubſiſtence of their Maſters and themſelves; being well order'd and carefully look'd after, they promote the making of ſeveral other Commodities, as Tobacco, Sugar, Ginger, Indico, and others, which bring in great profit. Add to this, that their ſervice being perpetual, their number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes from time to time by the Children that are born of them, which have no other Inheritance than that of the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſubjection of their Parents.</p>
               <p>All the Forreign Inhabitants who have planted themſelves in thoſe Iſlands are govern'd according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of their own Countries.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants of S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> Juſtice is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by a Council conſiſting of the principal Officers who have the overſight of the Militia of the Iſland, of which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil the General is Preſident: And though there are certain places appointed for that Adminiſtration, yet is the Council many times aſſembled as the General thinks fit, and occaſion requires, under a kind of great Fig-tree, which is about the bigneſs of a large Elm, neer the Court of Guard of the <hi>Baſse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre,</hi> not far from the Haven.</p>
               <p>In this Council, abating all the Formalities which have been invented to make Suits immortal, all differences that happen between the Inhabitants are amicably compos'd, and decided moſt commonly at the firſt ſitting, without any charge to the Parties, ſave only that he which is found guilty of the wrong is to make ſatisfaction according to the Cuſtom, whereof part goes to the relief of the Poor, and maintenance of the Church, and the reſt for the ſatisfaction of the party concern'd. This Council doth alſo paſs ſentence of death, without appeal to any other Power.</p>
               <p>The Governours of the other Iſlands do alſo adminiſter Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice every one in his Government: So that no man ſhould be guilty of ſo great a weakneſs as to imagine that people live in thoſe Countries without any order or rule, as many do: Nay, it is rather to be look'd on as a kind of Miracle, that (the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of thoſe Countries being a confluence of people from ſo many ſeveral Countries, and conſequently of different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and conſtitutions) diſorders ſhould not creep in, and that all are kept in awe and ſubjection to the Laws eſtabliſhed.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Origine of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> the natural Inhabitants of the Country.</head>
               <p>THe Method we had propos'd to our ſelves for the profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Hiſtory requires that henceforth we treat of the <hi>Indians,</hi> the natural Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies.</hi> And here we conceive it not to be our buſineſs to bring upon the Stage that great and difficult Queſtion, to wit, How the race of Men came to ſpread it ſelf into <hi>America,</hi> and whence they came into that new World? There are ſome eminent Perſons have treated of this matter with ſo much ſufficiency, exactneſs, and ſolidity, that it were a tedious and ſuperfluous Work at the preſent to trouble the Reader with any thing concerning it. Beſides, the Hiſtory of the Originals of our Savage Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> requires not that we ſhould deſcend ſo low to find them.</p>
               <p>The ancient and natural Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> are thoſe who have been called by ſome Authors <hi>Cannibals, Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophagi,</hi> or <hi>Eaters of Men;</hi> but moſt others who have written of them, commonly call them <hi>Caribbians</hi> or <hi>Caribes:</hi> But their primitive and originary Name, and that which is pronounc'd with moſt gravity is, as the <hi>French</hi> Writers would have it, that of <hi>Caraïbes:</hi> Nay, if we may credit theſe laſt mentioned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, not only the <hi>Caribbians</hi> themſelves of the Iſlands do ſo pronounce their name, but alſo thoſe of their Nation who live in the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> both the Septentrional and Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional: So that that being the moſt common appellation of them among the <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants of the Iſlands, we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have occaſion to uſe it ſometimes in the ſequel of this Hiſtory, in regard the preſent Work is render'd out of that Language.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that this word <hi>Caraibes</hi> (or <hi>Caribbians</hi>) is not natural to the ſavage Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> but that it was impos'd upon them by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they had given the ſame denomination to many Savages of the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Continent, who are known thereby; as alſo that of <hi>Calibis,</hi> or <hi>Calibites,</hi> to their allies the Inhabitants of the ſame Continent.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who maintain this opinion affirm, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might well give to thoſe People that name of <hi>Caraibes,</hi> in regard they over-ran all the Quarters of the Southerly part of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> and that having made the firſt Maps thereof, they ſet down thoſe Nations under that Name, which hath ſtuck to them ever ſince. To prove this they alledge, that they are never call'd <hi>Caraibes</hi> or <hi>Caribbians</hi> among themſelves, but only when they are drunk, and that having their heads full of Wine they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58704:116"/>
leap up and down and rejoyce, ſaying in their corrupt Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Moy bonne Caraibe, I am an honeſt Caribbian:</hi> That otherwiſe they only make uſe of that word when they are amongſt Strangers, and that in their trading and their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with them, to make a certain diſcovery of themſelves, as being ſenſible that the ſaid name is known to them: But that when they are among themſelves, not only they, but alſo thoſe of their Nation Inhabiting the Continent, and the <hi>Calibites,</hi> call themſelves by the name of <hi>Calinago,</hi> which is the name of the Men, and <hi>Calliponan,</hi> which is that of the Women. And they further affirm, that they are called <hi>Oubao-bonon,</hi> that is, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Iſlands,</hi> or <hi>Iſlanders;</hi> as the call thoſe of the Continent <hi>Batoüe-bonon,</hi> that is, <hi>Inhabitants of the Firm Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all this preſuppos'd as probable, there is but little likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that the word <hi>Caribbians</hi> ſhould have been impos'd upon them by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that our Iſlands ſhould not have had it before they were known by them. The firſt reaſon we give of this aſſertion is, that before either the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi> had found a paſſage into <hi>Brazil,</hi> there were in thoſe Parts certain men more ſubtle and ingenious then the reſt, whom the <hi>Braſilians</hi> call'd <hi>Caraibes,</hi> or <hi>Caribbians,</hi> as <hi>Johannes de Lery</hi> hath obſerv'd in his Hiſtory. Secondly, it is a thing out of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie that there are certain Savages who bear the name of <hi>Caribbians</hi> in ſome Quarters of the Southerly part of <hi>America,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never had any Commerce: For not only thoſe of the ſame Nation with our Iſlanders, who inhabit along thoſe Coaſts of the Meridional <hi>America,</hi> and are neer Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonies of <hi>Cayenna</hi> and <hi>Berbica,</hi> but thoſe alſo who live far within that Meridional Continent, beyond the ſources of the moſt remarkable Rivers, call themſelves <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Moreover, we ſhall find in the ſequel of this Chapter, that there is in the Septentrional Continent a powerful Nation conſiſting for the moſt part of certain Families, who at this preſent take a great pride in being called <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and ſtand upon it, that they had receiv'd that name long before <hi>America</hi> was diſcover'd. Add to this, that though it were granted that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have impos'd that name on all thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how can it be prov'd that they were as willing to accept of it from People unknown and Enemies to them? Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that not only all thoſe people do call themſelves <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but alſo that they withal think it a glory, and derive an advantage from that name, as Monſieur <hi>du Montel</hi> hath heard it from their own mouths: How then is it to be imagin'd that they ſhould triumph in a name which they had receiv'd from their Enemies? Nay if it be urg'd further, as we ſhall ſee anon, that the Anceſtors of our Savage Inhabitants of the Iſlands receiv'd from the <hi>Apalachites</hi> the name of <hi>Caribbians,</hi> inſtead of that of <hi>Cofachites,</hi> under which they went before; it may be replyed,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58704:117"/>
That they took it from ſuch as were their friends and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and that as an Elogy of honour. In fine, we alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it is not only in their drunkenneſs and debauches, that our <hi>Indian</hi> Inhabitants of the Iſlands call themſelves <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> but they do it alſo when they are ſober and in cold blood; And as to their calling themſelves <hi>Calinago,</hi> it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they may have many different names, whence it does not ever the more follow, that they had received any of them from the <hi>Europaeans.</hi> For the denomination of <hi>Oubao-bonon;</hi> the ſignification of the word ſufficiently ſhews, that it is not particular to them, and that it may be generally applyed to any Inhabitants of Iſlands. And whereas they make uſe of the name of <hi>Caribbians</hi> rather than of any other, when they ſpeak to ſtrangers, it is becauſe they are apprehenſive enough that that name is beſt known to them: but it is not to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thence, that they received it from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nay it might be more probably affirmed that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves having learnt it of them, ſhould afterwards have communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to other <hi>Europaeans.</hi> But as to our deſign, it matters not much whether opinion be embrac'd, and every one may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low which ſentiment liketh him beſt; only we have taken the liberty to propoſe what we conceived moſt probable.</p>
               <p>As to the originals of the inſulary <hi>Caribbians,</hi> thoſe who have hitherto given any account of them, have had ſo little light to guide themſelves by in that obſcure piece of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they may be ſaid to have grop'd all their way: ſome imagine that they are deſcended from the <hi>Jews,</hi> grounding their conjecture, among other things, on this, that the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> are obliged to marry thoſe Kinſwomen of theirs that are next of kin to them, and that ſome among them eat no ſwines fleſh nor Tortoiſes: But this is to fetch a thing too far off, and to ground an imagination on too weak conjectures. There are others who would have them to come over from the Haven of <hi>Caribana,</hi> and pretend that they were tranſported thence: But this opinion is grounded only on the clinching of the words <hi>Caribana</hi> and <hi>Caribbians,</hi> without any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
               <p>There are yet others who affirm, and that upon a ſimple conjecture, that theſe Savages are the originary Inhabitants of the greater Iſlands, and that it is not long ſince they came into thoſe now called the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> where they took refuge as the remainders of the horrid Maſſacres committed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when they poſſeſs'd themſelves of St. <hi>Domingo, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Jamaica,</hi> and <hi>Porto-Rico:</hi> But this is confuted by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Hiſtory, which aſſures us, that at the firſt beginning of the diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Caribbies</hi> were poſſeſſed and inhabited by the <hi>Caribbians;</hi> that at firſt they were ſurprized and ill-entreated by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but that afterwards theſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58704:117"/>
laſt being beaten off with diſadvantage, and meeting with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniences in the proſecution of that war, made a kind of agreement with ſome among them, as we ſhall ſee more particularly hereafter in the Chapter of their Wars. Add to this, that the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Coraſſao,</hi> who, without all diſpute, are ſome of thoſe perſons who eſcaped the Maſſacres, and who have among them ſome yet living, who lived in the Port called at the preſent, the Port of the <hi>Kow-Iſland,</hi> or as the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Le port de l' Iſle à vache,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> when the firſt <hi>Spaniards</hi> landed there, have not a word of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbian</hi> Language in theirs, nor any thing of Carriage; whence it may be deduc'd, that there never was any communication or correſpondence between them and the <hi>Caribbians.</hi> Beſides, thoſe of the greater Iſlands who might have fled to avoid the tyranny of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> would have had greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to retreat into the Territories which were below them, and whereto the regular winds lay more fit to carry them, than to direct their courſe againſt the wind, and ſo retarding their flight, expoſe themſelves to a thouſand hazards by Sea, and engage themſelves in a voyage twenty times as long: For it is almoſt a miracle, that ſuch Veſſels as theirs are can advance a league in a day againſt the wind; nay it many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that very great veſſels are in their aſcent forc'd back more in three hours than they had advanc'd in ſix daies: For we have it from very skilful Pilots, that they have been three months getting up from the <hi>Cul-de-Sac</hi> of St. <hi>Domingo</hi> to St. <hi>Chriſtophers;</hi> whereas to fall down from St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> to St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> there needs commonly not above four or five days at moſt.</p>
               <p>As concerning the opinion the <hi>Caribbians</hi> themſelves have of their origine, we find, that, being as ignorant of all Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity, as free from all curioſity of enquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things to come, they believe for the moſt part, that they are deſcended from the <hi>Calibites</hi> or <hi>Calibis,</hi> their Allyes and great friends, the Inhabitants of the Meridional part of <hi>America,</hi> &amp; the neighbouring people of the <hi>Arouagues</hi> or <hi>Alouagues,</hi> in that Country or Province which is commonly called <hi>Guyana,</hi> or the <hi>Savage-Coaſt.</hi> And thoſe who adhere to this opinion, ground their perſwaſion on the conformity of Language, Religion and Manners, obſervable between the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Inhabitants of the Iſlands, and the <hi>Calibites;</hi> though it may as well be preſum'd that the ſaid reſemblance might partly proceed from the allyance and particular friendſhip there was between them; partly from the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Meridional Continent and thoſe <hi>Calibites;</hi> and partly from ſome other cauſes, whereof we ſhall give an account here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But theſe poor Savages of the Iſlands agree not among
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58704:118"/>
themſelves in the particular relation they make of their Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the occaſion that brought them into thoſe Iſlands; nor can they give any account of the time of their coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We ſhall here ſet down what thoſe of S. <hi>Vincent</hi> and ſome others have related to Monſieur <hi>du Montel</hi> concerning themſelves, which we have taken out of his curious Collections.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Caribbians</hi> were heretofore ſubject to the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> and obey'd their Prince; but ſome among them not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that yoke, broke out into a Rebellion: And that they might the better live undiſturb'd, and at a diſtance from their Enemies, they retreated to the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands, which were not at that time inhabited; and their firſt landing was in the Iſland of <hi>Tabago,</hi> which is one of the neereſt to the Continent: Afterwards the other <hi>Calibites</hi> ſhook of the Domination of the <hi>Arouagues;</hi> but finding themſelves ſtrong enough, or not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame inclination with the former, they continu'd in their Country; and what they had at the time of their revolt they have kept ever ſince, and live free in the Country, but Enemies to the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> having a Captain-General of their own Nation, by whom they are commanded. They have alſo continu'd to this preſent Friends and Confederates to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Relation it is that ſome ground the explication they make of the word <hi>Caribbians,</hi> as if it ſignified <hi>Rebells;</hi> whether it was impos'd upon them by the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> or that thoſe people aſſum'd it of themſelves by way of triumph, as deriving a certain glory from their noble Inſurrection, and the generous Rebellion which eſtabliſh'd them in peace and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But there needs no more to ſhew that the word <hi>Caribbian</hi> does not ſignifie <hi>Rebel,</hi> as among others a certain Journal of a Dutch-man, than that there are many Colonies in ſeveral parts of the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> both the Septentrional and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridional, which no body pretends or can pretend were ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> which yet are known by the name of <hi>Caribbians.</hi> And as to the being among them any that have rebell'd againſt other Sovereigns, only this may be inferr'd thence, That being ſince reconcil'd to them, and living to this day in the midſt of them, under the ſaid name of <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> as we ſhall ſee more particularly anon, there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood that it ſhould ſignifie <hi>Rebels,</hi> ſince it were a blaſting of their Reputation, and a mark of Infamy to them.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who have convers'd a long time together among the Savages of <hi>Dominico</hi> relate, that the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Inhabitants of that Iſland are of opinion, that their Anceſtors came out of the Continent, from among the <hi>Calibites,</hi> to make a War againſt a Nation of the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> which inhabited the Iſlands, which Nation they utterly deſtroy'd, excepting only the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom they took to themſelves, and by that means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58704:118"/>
the Iſlands: Whence it comes that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Wives of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbian</hi> Inhabitants of the Iſlands have a language different from that of the Men in many things, and in ſome conſonant to that of the <hi>Arouagues</hi> of the Continent. He who was the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief in that Enterpriſe beſtow'd the conquer'd Iſlands on his Confidents; and he to whoſe lot the Iſland of <hi>Dominico</hi> fell was called <hi>Ouboutou-timani,</hi> that is to ſay, King, and cauſed himſelf to be carried on the ſhoulders of thoſe whom the Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders call <hi>Labouyou,</hi> that is, Servants.</p>
               <p>There is ſo little certainty and ſo much variety in all theſe Relations, and others of the like nature, which theſe poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people make upon this occaſion, that the moſt prudent ſort of people conceive there cannot any judgment be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereon: And indeed theſe Savages themſelves ſpeak not thereof but at adventure, and as people tell ſtories of what they had ſeen in their dreams; ſo careleſs have they been in preſerving the tradition of their Origine; and they palpably contradict and confute one the other by the difference of their Relations: However, we ſhall find at the end of this Chapter what ſeems moſt probable to have given occaſion to moſt to believe that they are deſcended from the <hi>Calibites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all the ſeveral ſentiments whereof we have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, either out of the Writings or Diſcourſes of divers others, there is this that's commendable, That thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them, proceed conſequently to the diſcoveries they had made, and that they do all that lies in their power to unravel and diſengage ancient and unknown Truths. But if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we are about to give of the Origine of the <hi>Caribbian</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Iſlands, be the moſt ample, the moſt particular, the moſt full of Curioſities, and the beſt circumſtanc'd of any that hath hitherto appear'd, it is but juſt we ſhould think it accordingly the trueſt and moſt certain; yet with this caution, that we ſtill leave the judicious Reader at liberty to follow that ſentiment which ſhall ſeem moſt rational to him. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we ought to render every one the commendation he juſtly deſerves, we are to acquaint the Publick, that it is oblig'd for theſe Particularities and Diſcoveries to the obliging Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation we have receiv'd thereof from one Maſter <hi>Brigſtock</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, one of the moſt curious and inquiſitive Perſons in the World, who, among his other great and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar accompliſhments, hath attained the perfection of the <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and <hi>Floridian</hi> Languages, as having in his noble Travels ſeen all the Iſlands, and a great part of the Septentrional <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica:</hi> By that means it was that he came exactly to underſtand, upon the very place whereof we ſhall make mention, and from ſuch intelligent Perſons as could give him an account thereof with ſome certainty, the enſuing Hiſtory of the Origine of our Savages, the truth whereof he will make good whenever occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall require.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:58704:119"/>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> were originary Inhabitants of the Septentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal part of <hi>America,</hi> of that Country which is now called <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida:</hi> They came to Inhabit the Iſlands after they had departed from amidſt the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> among whom they lived a long time; and they left there ſome of their people, who to this day go under the name of <hi>Caribbians:</hi> But their firſt origine is from the <hi>Cofachites,</hi> who only chang'd their denomination, and were called <hi>Caribbians</hi> in the Country of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apalachites</hi> are a powerful and generous Nation, which continues to this preſent planted in the ſame Country of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida:</hi> They are the Inhabitants of a gallant and ſpacious Country called <hi>Apalacha,</hi> from which they have received their name, and which begins at the altitude of thirty three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and twenty five minutes, North of the Equinoctial Line, and reaches to the thirty ſeventh degree. This people have a communication with the Sea of the great Gulf of <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>New Spain,</hi> by the means of a River, which taking its ſource out of the <hi>Apalachaean</hi> Mountains, at the foot whereof they inhabit, after it hath wandred through many rich Campagnes, diſembogues it ſelf at laſt into the Sea neer the Iſlands of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobago:</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have called this River <hi>Riu del Spirito Santo;</hi> but the <hi>Apalachites</hi> call it ſtill by its ancient name of <hi>Hitanachi,</hi> which in their Language ſignifies fair and pleaſant. On the Eaſt-ſide they are divided from all other Nations by high and far-ſpreading Mountains, whoſe tops are cover'd with ſnow moſt part of the year, and which ſeparate them from <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia:</hi> on the other ſides they abjoin to ſeveral inconſiderable Nations, which are all their friends and confederates.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Apalachites</hi> make it their boaſt, that they had propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated certain Colonies a great way into <hi>Mexico:</hi> And they ſhow to this day a great Road by land, by which they affirm that their Forces march'd into thoſe parts. The Inhabitants of the Country, upon their arrival gave them the name of <hi>Tlatuici,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Mountaineers</hi> or <hi>High-Landers,</hi> for they were more hardy and more generous than they. They planted themſelves in a quarter like that from which they came, ſcituate at the foot of the Mountains, in a fertile ſoil, where they built a City, as neer as they could like that which they had left behind them, whereof they are poſſeſs'd to this day. They are ſo united there by inter-marriages and other bonds of peace, that they make up but one people with them; nor indeed could they well be diſcern'd one from the other, if they had not retain'd ſeveral words of their originary language, which is the only obſervable difference between them.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Apalachites</hi> had planted this Colony, the <hi>Cofachites,</hi> who liv'd more towards the north of <hi>America,</hi> in a fenny and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58704:119"/>
ſomewhat barren Country, and who had continu'd till then in good correſpondence with them, knowing that they were then far from their beſt and moſt valiant men, took an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous opportunity to fall upon their Neighbours the <hi>Apala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,</hi> and to force them out of their habitations, or at leaſt to participate with them of the land where they had ſetled themſelves, after they ſhould become Maſters thereof. This deſign having been carried on very cunningly among the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the <hi>Cofachites,</hi> they afterwards publiſh'd it in all their Villages, and got it approv'd by all the heads of Families, who inſtead of minding the buſineſs of Husbandry and ſetting things in order for the ſowing of Corn at the beginning of the Spring, as they were wont to do other years, prepar'd their Bows, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and Clubs; and having ſet their habitations on fire, and furniſh'd themſelves with ſome little proviſions out of what was left of the precedent Winter, they took the field, with their wives and children, and all the little baggage they had, with a reſolution either to conquer or dye, ſince they had cut off all hopes of returning to a place which they had deſtroy'd and deſpoil'd of all manner of conveniences.</p>
               <p>In this equipage they in a ſhort time got to the frontiers of their Neighbours: The <hi>Apalachites</hi> who thought of nothing leſs than having an enemy ſo neer them, were then very buſie about the planting of their <hi>Mais,</hi> and the roots from which they derive their ordinary ſuſtenance: Thoſe who liv'd about the great Lake at the foot of the Mountains, which they call in their Language <hi>Theomi,</hi> having perceiv'd this powerful Army ready to fall on them, immediately made their retreat into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mountains, and left their villages and cattel to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal of the enemy; thence they took their march through the woods; to carry intelligence of this erruption to the Cities which are in the vallies among the firſt mountains, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided the <hi>Paracouſſis,</hi> who is the King of the Country, with all the conſiderable forces thereof. Upon this ſo unexpected news, the ſaid Prince, while he was making his preparations to go againſt the Enemy, poſted thoſe who were moſt in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for the expedition in the Avenues of the mountains, and placed Ambuſcadoes in ſeveral parts of the great Foreſts, which lye between the great Lake and the Mountains, and through which there was a neceſſity of paſſing to get into that pleaſant and ſpacious valley, which is above ſixty leagues in length, and about ten in bredth; where are the habitations of the chiefeſt Inhabitants of the Country, and the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Cities in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>While the <hi>Cofachites</hi> were buſie about the plundering and pillaging the houſes they had found neer the great Lake, the <hi>Apalachites</hi> had the opportunity to prepare themſelves for the reception of them: But the former, inſtead of taking the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58704:120"/>
Roads and ways which led to the flat Country, which, as we ſaid, lie between the Mountains, having left their Wives and Children neer the great Lake, under the guard of ſome Forces they had drawn off from the main Body, and being guided by ſome of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> whom they had ſurprized fiſhing in the great Lake, croſs'd through the woods, and made their way over mountains and precipices, over and through which the Camels could hardly have paſs'd, and by that means got into the heart and centre of the Country, and found themſelves of a ſudden in a Province, called that of the <hi>Amanites:</hi> They without any reſiſtance ſurpriz'd the chiefeſt places of it, wherein they found to guard them only Women, Children, and ſome old men, ſuch as were not able to follow their King, who with his people lay expecting the Enemy at the ordinary deſcents which led into the Country.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cofachites</hi> perceiving that their deſign had prov'd ſo ſucceſsful, and that there was a great likelihood that in a ſhort time they ſhould become Maſters of the whole Country, ſince they had met with ſo good fortune immediately upon their firſt appearance, proſecuted their conqueſts further, and having Cities for their retreat, where they had left good ſtrong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, they marched towards the King of <hi>Apalacha,</hi> with a reſolution either to fight him, or at leaſt oblige him to allow them the quiet poſſeſſion of ſome part of the Country. The <hi>Apalachite</hi> was extreamly ſurpriz'd, when he underſtood that the Enemy, whom he had all this while expected on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and at the known avenues of the Country, had already poſſeſs'd himſelf of a Province that lay in the centre of his Dominions, and that he had left Garriſons in the Cities and moſt conſiderable places thereof: However, being a magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and gallant Prince, he would try whether the chance of Arms would prove as favourable to him, as he thought his cauſe good and juſt; he thereupon came down with his people out of the Mountains, where he had encamped himſelf; and having encourag'd thoſe that were about him to do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, he confidently ſet upon the van-guard of the <hi>Cofachites,</hi> which was come out to obſerve his motion: having on both ſides ſpent all their arrows, they came to a cloſe fight, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken their Clubs, there was a great ſlaughter in both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, till that night having ſeparated them, the <hi>Cofachites</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that they had loſt a great number of theirs in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and found that they had to do with a people that behav'd themſelves more valiantly than they had imagined to themſelves they would have done; and conſequently that their beſt courſe would be to enter into a friendly treaty with them, rather than venture another hazard of their Forces in a ſtrange Country.</p>
               <p>Upon this they reſolv'd, that the next morning they would
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58704:120"/>
ſend Embaſſadours to the King of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> with certain Overtures of Peace, and in caſe of a refuſal (diſſembling the loſs they had receiv'd in the former Engagement) to declare open War, and to challenge him to be immediately ready to receive their Charge, which ſhould be much more violent then what they had met withal the day before; and that then all their Forces were come together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Paracouſſes</hi> of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> having given audience to theſe Embaſſadours, deſir'd that days time to conſider of the Propoſitions which had been made to him; and thereupon having requir'd of them the Articles and Conditions under which they would Treat with him, in caſe he might be inclin'd to Peace, they told him, That they had left their own Country with a reſolution to plant themſelves either by friendſhip or by force in that good and fat Country whereof he was poſſeſs'd; and that if he would condeſcend to the former of thoſe means, they deſired to become one People with the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> to dwell in their Country, and to cultivate it, and ſo to ſupply the empty places of thoſe who not long before had gone from among them to plant a new Colony in ſome remote parts of the World.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apalachite</hi> aſſembled his Council upon theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and having acquainted them therewith, he repreſented, That the Army of the <hi>Cofachites</hi> hindred the coming in of the Aſſiſtances which they might receive from the other Provinces that had not been ready to come in to them at the beginning of the War; That by the ſame means the paſſage of Proviſions was abſolutely obſtructed; That the Enemy was Maſter of the Field, and that without any reſiſtance he had got into one of the beſt Provinces of the whole Country, where he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo poſſeſs'd himſelf of places of Importance; and, That though in the precedent Engagement he had taken particular notice of the incomparable fidelity and gallantry of his People, in ſetting upon and fighting againſt the Enemies, over whom they had very conſiderable Advantages, yet had that good Succeſs been bought with the loſs of his moſt valiant Captains, and the beſt of his Souldiers; and conſequently it concern'd them to bethink themſelves of ſome means to preſerve the reſt of the Kingdom, by ſparing what was then left of the choiceſt Men: And ſince the Enemies were the firſt Propoſers of the Conditions of Peace, it would be the ſafeſt way to hearken thereto, if it might be done without any derogation from their Glory, and the great Reputation they had acquir'd before; inaſmuch as there was waſte grounds enough in ſeveral places, and that the Country, by reaſon of the tranſplantation of ſome part of their Inhabitants, was ſpacious and fertile enough to ſuſtain them all.</p>
               <p>All the chief Commanders of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> having heard
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58704:121"/>
what had been propos'd by their King, and concluding it was not fear that oblig'd him to hearken to an Accommodation with the <hi>Cofachites,</hi> ſince that the day before he had ventur'd his Perſon among the moſt forward; but that it proceeded purely from the deſire he had that they might not be raſhly expos'd to further danger, and his care of preſerving his People, which was already at the mercy of the Enemy, who had poſſeſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of one of the richeſt Provinces; and having alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſome Spies who were come into the Kings Army by ſome ſecret ways, and made their eſcape out of the Cities where the <hi>Cofachites</hi> had their Gariſons, that they treated with great mildneſs and reſpect the women and old men whom they had found there; having, I ſay, taken all theſe things into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they unanimouſly ſubſcribed to the ſentiments of their Prince, and made anſwer, That there was a neceſſity of condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to an Accommodation, and making ſome Agreement upon the moſt advantageous Conditions they could, according to the preſent poſture of their Affairs: And after they had confirm'd this reſolution by their <hi>Ha Ha,</hi> which is the ſign of the applauſe and ratification wherewith they are wont to conclude their Deliberations, they ſignified the ſame to the Embaſſadors of the <hi>Cofachites,</hi> who expected it with impatience.</p>
               <p>This news being carried over to the Camp of the <hi>Cofachites,</hi> was receiv'd with great joy, as being conſonant to the end they had propos'd to themſelves when they firſt undertook the War and left their Country: They thereupon immediately deputed ſome of the chiefeſt among them to agree with the <hi>Apalachites</hi> about the abſolute concluſion of that Peace, and to ſign the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treaty. Theſe Deputies being come to the place where the Prince of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> expected them, attended by the moſt conſiderable Perſons about his Court, ſitting on a Seat ſomwhat higher then any of the reſt, and cover'd with a rich Fur, were very kindly receiv'd; and having taken their Seats, the King drank to them of a certain Beverage call'd <hi>Caſſina,</hi> out of a Bowl of which he firſt taſted himſelf: All that were preſent at the Council drank afterwards in order; which done, they fell upon the buſineſs of the Treaty, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon theſe Conditions;</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Cofachites</hi> ſhould inhabit promiſcuouſly in the Cities and Towns of the <hi>Apalachites;</hi> That in all reſpects they ſhould be eſteem'd and accounted as the natural Inhabitants of the Country; That they ſhould abſolutely enjoy the ſame Priviledges; That they ſhould be ſubject to the King, as the others were; That they ſhould embrace the Religion, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Cuſtoms of the Country: Or if they would rather, the <hi>Apalachites</hi> would reſign up to them the rich and great Province of <hi>Amana,</hi> to be enjoy'd only by them, according to the limits which ſhould be agreed upon: Provided nevertheleſs,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58704:121"/>
That they ſhould acknowledge the King of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> for their Sovereign, and that from thence forward they ſhould render him reaſonable homage.</p>
               <p>This Agreement being thus reciprocally concluded, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with mutual acclamations: Not long after, the Deputies of the <hi>Cofachites</hi> having given an account of their negotiation to their Commander in chief and his Councel, and repreſented to them the choice which had been left them either of living promiſcuouſly among the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> or being ſole poſſeſſors of the Province into which they were entered; they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly accepted of the latter, and ſo became abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that Province of <hi>Amana,</hi> whereof the King of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palachites</hi> put them himſelf into quiet poſſeſſion: The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Children, and Old men, who had been left behind, when all ſ as were able to bear arms had follow'd their Prince, were tranſported into ſome of the other Provinces, where the King appointed a ſetled habitation for them, and all the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant men of that Province who had ventur'd their lives againſt the Enemy, and for the preſervation of their Country.</p>
               <p>All things being thus ſetled, both parties laid down their arms, and the <hi>Cofachites</hi> went to fetch their Wives, Children, Cattel, Baggage, and the Souldiers they had left neer the great Lake of <hi>Theomi;</hi> and being ſafely return'd, they diſpos'd themſelves into the Cities appointed them, congratulating their good fortune in the conqueſt of ſo noble a Country, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to their expectation at the firſt undertaking of the War.</p>
               <p>From that time the <hi>Apalachites</hi> gave the name of <hi>Caribbians,</hi> or as the <hi>French</hi> would have it, <hi>Caraibes,</hi> to thoſe new comers, who of a ſudden, and contrary to their expectation, forc'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon them, to repair the breach which had been made by the tranſplantation of ſome of their people into another Country of <hi>America:</hi> ſo that this word <hi>Caraibes</hi> ſignifies, in their language, a ſort of <hi>people added,</hi> or <hi>ſuddenly and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly coming in, ſtrangers,</hi> or <hi>ſtout and valiant men;</hi> as if they would expreſs, that a generous people, whom they expected not, were come upon them, and had been added to them: and this denomination continu'd to theſe new comers inſtead of that of <hi>Cofachites,</hi> which hath been kept up only in ſome weak and wretched Families which liv'd more towards the north of <hi>Florida,</hi> and after the departure of the true <hi>Cofachites,</hi> poſſeſs'd themſelves of their habitations, and would alſo have paſs'd under the name of thoſe who had preceded them in the poſſeſſion of that Country: Whereas on the other ſide, theſe true <hi>Cofachites</hi> were known by the name of <hi>Caribbians</hi> in the Province of <hi>Amana;</hi> and therefore henceforward we ſhall ſpeak of them, and the Colonies which they have ſince ſent abroad, only under that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:58704:122"/>Theſe two Nations being thus united by the determination of their differences, and the period they put to a cruel war which might have ruin'd them both, liv'd afterwards in good correſpondence for many years. But in proceſs of time, the <hi>Caribbians</hi> finding themſelves multiply'd in the Country which they had conquer'd by their arms, would not embrace the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> who ador'd the Sun, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter, nor be preſent at their Ceremonies in the Temple they had in the Province of <hi>Bemarin,</hi> where the Court was; nor in fine render the King the homages that were due to him for the Province they were poſſeſs'd of, according to their promiſe, and the Articles of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>This breach of promiſe on the part of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and that unjuſtiafiable act, prov'd the occaſion of many bloudy Wars which happen'd afterwards between the two Nations: the <hi>Caribbians</hi> were ſurrounded of all ſides by their adverſaries, who kept them in ſo, that they could not any way enlarge their quarters; and on the other ſide the <hi>Apalachites</hi> had in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of their Country a cruel and irreconcileable enemy, who kept them perpetually in alarms, and oblig'd them to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in arms; during which, both the one and the other, ſometimes victorious, ſometimes beaten, as the uncertain chance of war was pleas'd to carry it, liv'd a very ſad life; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that, many times, either for want of cultivating the ground, or by reaſon of the waſte committed in the fields of one another, a little before the Harveſt, they were reduc'd to ſuch an extreme Famine, as deſtroy'd more people than the Sword.</p>
               <p>Above an age was ſpent in theſe conteſts, during which the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who had for their Commander in chief and King of their Nation, one of their moſt valiant Captains, whom they called <hi>Ragazim,</hi> added to their former acqueſts another Province, which lay next to them on the South ſide, and is called <hi>Matica,</hi> which reaching through the Mountains by an interval that receives a torrent deſcending from the ſame Mountains, afterwards extends towards the Weſt, as far as the River, which taking its ſource at the great Lake, after it hath made ſeveral Iſlands, and flown through divers Provinces, falls at laſst into the Ocean: This is the famous River which the <hi>French</hi> have called the River of <hi>May;</hi> but the <hi>Apalachites</hi> name it <hi>Baſainim,</hi> which ſignifies in their language, <hi>the delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous River,</hi> or <hi>abounding</hi> in fiſh. The <hi>Caribbians</hi> having thus dilated their territories, and forc'd their Enemies to retreat, made for ſome years a truce with the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> who being wearied out with the Wars, and diſcourag'd by the loſs of a conſiderable Province, willingly hearkned to that ceſſation of arms, and all acts of hoſtility.</p>
               <p>But theſe <hi>Apalachites</hi> being exaſperated to ſee their Country
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58704:122"/>
grown leſs by one of the beſt Provinces belonging to it, taking the advantage of the opportunity of that Truce, ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted ſeveral times among themſelves how they might carry on their deſigns more ſucceſsfully againſt the <hi>Caribbians</hi> then they had done before; and having found by ſad experience, that they had not advanc'd their affairs much by aſſaulting their Enemies openly, and by ſetled Engagements, they reſolv'd to ſupplant them by ſubtlety, and to that end to think of all ways imaginable to make a diviſion among them, and inſenſibly to engage them in a Civil War within their own Country. This advice being receiv'd and generally approv'd of all their Prieſts, who are in very great eſteem among them, and have Voices in their moſt important Aſſemblies, immediately fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd them with expedients, and ſuggeſted to them the means, which were to this effect.</p>
               <p>They had obſerv'd that thoſe people who came in ſo ſlily and ſurpriz'd them in their own Country, were without Religion, and made no acknowledgment of any Divinity, whereto they conceiv'd themſelves oblig'd to render any publick Service, and that they ſtood in fear only of a certain evil Spirit which they called <hi>Mabouya,</hi> becauſe he ſometimes tormented them; yet ſo as that in the mean time they did not do him any homage: Thence it came that for ſome years after their arrival, during which they had liv'd in good correſpondence with them, they endeavour'd to induce them by their example to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Sun to be the ſovereign Governour of the World, and to adore him as God. Theſe Exhortations and Inſtructions had a great influence over the Spirits of the chiefeſt among the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and had made ſtrong impreſſions in them; ſo that having receiv'd the firſt Principles of that Religion while the time of their mutual correſpondence continu'd, many left the Province of <hi>Amana</hi> wherein they had their habitations, and went into that of <hi>Bemarin,</hi> the principal Province of the <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachites,</hi> whence they aſcended into the Mountain of <hi>Olaimi,</hi> upon which the <hi>Apalachites</hi> made their ſolemn Offerings; and upon their invitation the <hi>Caribbians</hi> had participated of thoſe Cermonies and that Service: Theſe Prieſts, whom the <hi>Apala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites</hi> call <hi>Jaouas,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Men of God,</hi> knew that the ſeeds of Religion are not ſo eaſily ſmother'd in the hearts of men; and that, though the long Wars they had had with the <hi>Caribbians</hi> had hinder'd the exerciſe thereof, yet would it be no hard matter for them to blow up, as we may ſay, thoſe ſparks in them which lay hid under the aſhes.</p>
               <p>The Truce and Ceſſation of all acts of Hoſtility, which had been concluded between the two Nations, preſented the <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachites</hi> with a favourable opportunity to proſecute their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; whereupon the Prieſts of the Sun advis'd, with the Kings Conſent, that there ſhould be a publication made among the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58704:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Caribbians,</hi> that at the beginning of the Month of <hi>March,</hi> which they call <hi>Naarim</hi> in their language, they would render a ſolemn Service in honour of the Sun, on the high Mountain; and that the ſaid Service ſhould be attended with Divertiſements, Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Preſents, which they ſhould liberally give to ſuch as were preſent thereat. This Ceremony was no new thing among the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> could not ſuſpect any circumvention, nor fear any ſurpriſe; for it was a very ancient cuſtom among them to make extraordinary Prayers to the Sun at the beginning of the Month of <hi>Naarim,</hi> which is preciſely the time that they have done ſowing their <hi>Mais.</hi> That which they deſire in this Service is, That the Sun would be pleas'd to cauſe that which they had recommended to his care, to ſpring, grow, and come to maturity. They have alſo the ſame ſolemnity in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> at which time they have got in their firſt Harveſt, to render him thanks for the fruits they conceive that they have receiv'd from his hands. Beſides, the <hi>Caribbians</hi> knew well enough, that during theſe Feſtivals the <hi>Apalachites</hi> hung up their Bows and Arrows; that it was accounted a hainous crime among them to go arm'd into their Temple, and to raiſe the leaſt diſpute there; and that during thoſe days of Selemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the greateſt Enemies were commonly reconcil'd, and laid aſide all enmity. In fine, they made not the leaſt doubt but that the Publick Faith, and the promiſe ſolemnly made, would be inviolably obſerv'd.</p>
               <p>Upon this aſſurance they diſpoſe themſelves to paſs over into the Province of <hi>Bemarin</hi> at the time appointed; and that they might be thought to contribute ſomwhat on their part to the publick Solemnity, they dreſs themſelves with all the brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and magnificence they could; and though that even then they were wont to go very lightly clad, and expoſe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies almoſt naked, yet the more to accommodate themſelves to the humours of their Neighbours, whom they were going to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, they cauſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the Furs, ſpotted Skins, and Stuffs that they had, to be made into Cloaths: They forgot not alſo to cauſe their faces, their hands, and all thoſe places of their bodies which lay expos'd to be ſeen, to be painted with a bright red; and they crown themſelves with their richeſt Garland, interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the different plumage of ſeveral rare Birds of the Country. The Women for their parts, deſirous to participate of this Solemnity, leave nothing undone that might contribute any thing to the adorning of themſelves; the Chains of Shells of ſeveral colours, the Pendants, and the high Coifs enrich'd with the precious and glittering Stones which the Torrents bring down along with them out of the high Mountains, made them appear with extraordinary luſtre. In this equipage the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> partly out of curioſity, partly out of the vanity to ſhew themſelves, and ſome out of certain motives of Religon,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58704:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
undertake that Pilgrimage: And that they might not raiſe any jealouſie in thoſe who had ſo kindly invited them, they leave their Bows, Arrows, and Clubs at the laſt Village within their Juriſdiction, and enter into the Province of <hi>Bemarin</hi> only with a walking ſtick, ſinging and dancing, as they are all of a merry and divertive diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Apalachites</hi> expected them with great devotion, and anſwerably to the Orders they had to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe receiv'd from their King, whoſe name was <hi>Teltlabin,</hi> and whoſe race commands at preſent among that people; they kindly entertain'd all thoſe who came to the Sacrifice; nay, from the firſt entrance of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> into their Province, they treated them at all places as cordially as if they had been their Brethren, and that there had never been any difference between them: They feaſted them all along the way, and conducted them up to the Royal City, which to this day they call <hi>Melilot,</hi> that is, the <hi>City of Councel,</hi> inaſmuch as it is the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the King and his Court: The chiefeſt of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> were magnificently entertain'd at the Palace-Royal, and thoſe of the common ſort were receiv'd and treated by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the City, who ſpar'd no coſt to heighten the ſatisfaction of their Gueſts.</p>
               <p>The day dedicated to the ſacrifice of the Sun being come, the King of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> with his Court, which was very much encreaſed by the arrival of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and a great number of the Inhabitants of the other Provinces, who were come up to the Feaſt, went up very betimes in the morning to the top of the Mountain of <hi>Olaimi,</hi> which is not a full league diſtant from the City: This Prince, according to the cuſtome of the Country, was carried in a chair, on the ſhoulders of four tall men, attended by four others of the ſame height, who were to relieve the former when they were weary: There marched before him ſeveral perſons playing on Flutes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſical Inſtruments; with this pomp he came to the place appointed for the Aſſembly; and when the Ceremony was over, he made a great diſtribution of Cloaths and Furs, more than he had been accuſtomed to do upon ſuch occaſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But above all, his liberality was remarkable towards the moſt conſiderable perſons among the <hi>Caribbians;</hi> and in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Prince, the wealthieſt of his people made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents in like manner to thoſe of that Nation who had vouchſafed their ſolemn Sacrifice with their preſence; ſo that moſt of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> return'd home well ſatisfy'd, and in better Liveries than they had brought thence with them: After they were come down from the Mountain, they were again treated and entertain'd with the greateſt expreſſions of good will, in all the houſes of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> through whoſe habitations they were to return into their quarters: In fine, to encourage them
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58704:124"/>
to a ſecond viſit, there were ſolemn proteſtations made to them from the King and his Officers, that they ſhould be at all other times receiv'd with the like demonſtrations of affection, if they were deſirous to accompany them four times in the year to the celebration of the ſame Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> being return'd into their Province could not make ſufficient acknowledgments of the kind entertainment they had receiv'd: Thoſe who had ſtay'd at home being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd to ſee the rich preſents which their Country-men had brought home, immediately reſolv'd to undertake the ſame pilgrimage at the next enſuing Feaſt: And the day on which it was to be drawing neer, there was ſo great a conteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them who ſhould go, that if their <hi>Cacick,</hi> or chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, had not taken ſome courſe therein, the Province would have been deſtitute of Inhabitants: The <hi>Apalachites</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide continu'd their entertainments and liberalities; and there was a certain emulation among them who ſhould be moſt kind to the <hi>Caribbians:</hi> Their Prieſts, who knew what would be the iſſue of all this impoſture, recommended nothing ſo much to them, as the continuation of thoſe good Offices, which they ſaid were very acceptable to the Sun.</p>
               <p>Three years ſlipp'd away in theſe viſits; at the end whereof the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> who had exhauſted themſelves in liberalities towards their Neighbours, perceiving they had gain'd extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their affections, and that the greateſt part of them were grown ſo zealous for the ſervice of the Sun, that nothing would be able to force out of their apprehenſions the deep ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents they had conceiv'd of his Divinity; reſolv'd, upon the inſtigation of their Prieſts, for whoſe advice the King and all the people had great reſpects and ſubmiſſions, to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from the expiration of the Truce to renew the war againſt the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and to forbid them acceſs to their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, if they would not, as they did, make a publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of believing the Sun to be God, and perform the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe they had ſometime made of acknowledging the King of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> for their Sovereign, and do homage to him for the Province of <hi>Amana,</hi> upon which account they had been admitted to be the Inhabitants thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> were divided about theſe propoſals: For all thoſe who were inclin'd to the adoration of the Sun, were of opinion, that ſatisfaction ſhould be given to the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> affirming, that, though they were not oblig'd thereto by their promiſe, yet would there be an engagement to do it, though it were only to prevent their being depriv'd of the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, and debar'd their preſence at the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices made to the Sun, which they could not abandon without much regret: The <hi>Cacick</hi> or chief Commander, and a great number of the moſt conſiderable among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> alledged
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58704:124"/>
on the contrary, that they would not blaſt their reputation, and the glory of all their precedent Victories, by ſo ſhameful a peace, which, under pretence of Religion, would make them ſubject to the <hi>Apalachites;</hi> That they were free-born, and that, as ſuch, they had left the place of their birth, and tranſplanted themſelves into a better Country than their own, by force of Arms; That their greateſt concernment was to endeavour the continuance of that precious liberty, and to cement it with their own blood, if occaſion requir'd; That they were the ſame men who had ſometime forc'd the <hi>Apalachites</hi> to reſign upto them the moſt conſiderable of their Provinces, ſuch a one as was the centre, and as it were the eye of their Country; That they had not remitted any thing of that generoſity, and that that valour was ſo far from being extinguiſh'd, that on the contrary they had enlarg'd their juriſdiction by the acqueſt of a noble and ſpacious Country, which gave them paſſage beyond the Mountains, whereby they were ſurrounded before; That having thus remov'd out of the way whatever might obſtruct their deſigns, it would be thought an inſupportable cowardice in them, only under pretence of Religion, and out of pure curioſity of being preſent at Sacrifices, to quit the poſſeſſion of what they had reduc'd under their power with ſo much trouble and bloodſhed: In fine, that if any were deſirous to adore the Sun, they needed not to go out of their own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to do it, ſince he ſhined as favourably in their Provinces as thoſe of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> and look'd on them every day as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly as on any other part of the world; and if there were any neceſſity of conſecrating a Mountain to him, or a Grot, they might find among thoſe which ſeparated their Country from the great Lake, ſome that were as high and as fit for thoſe myſteries as that of <hi>Olaimi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who maintained the ſervice of the Sun, and were againſt engaging in a new war, which muſt be the ſequel of refuſing conditions which were as advantageous to them as to the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> made anſwer; that ſince they had for ſome years enjoy'd the ſweetneſs of peace, and experienc'd upon ſo many occaſions the kind entertainments and generoſity of their Neighbours, it would be the greateſt imprudence in the world to run themſelves into new troubles, which they might avoid upon ſuch eaſie terms, and that without any loſs of the reputation they had acquir'd; That the acknowledgments which the <hi>Apalachites</hi> requir'd for the Province they were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, might be ſuch, and of ſo little importance, that it would not be any diminution of their Honour, or prejudice to their Authority; That as to what concern'd the Service and Sacrifices of the Sun, they were not furniſh'd with ſuch Prieſts as were inſtructed in that Science, and acquainted with the Ceremonies thereof; That it was much to be fear'd that if they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58704:125"/>
ſhould undertake to imitate the <hi>Jaoüas</hi> of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> they would, by the miſcarriages likely to be committed therein, draw upon themſelves the indignation of the Divinity which they would ſerve, inſtead of gaining its favour; That they had found upon enquiry, that there was not any Mountain in the whole Country ſo kindly look'd upon by the Sun, and ſo pleaſant as that of <hi>Olaimi:</hi> Nor was there any other that had a Temple naturally made in the Rock, after ſo miraculous a manner, which was ſuch, that all the art and induſtry of man could never bring to that perfection, and that it could be no other than the work of the beams of that Divinity which was there ador'd; That though it were ſuppos'd they might find out a Mountain and a Cave that came ſomewhat neer the other, which yet they thought impoſſible, it was queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whether thoſe Birds who were the Sun's Meſſengers would make their habitation there; And that the Fountain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated in honour of him, which wrought admirable effects, and unheard of cures, would be found there; And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that they ſhould expoſe themſelves to the deriſion of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> who would ſtill have occaſion to make their brags of an infinite number of prerogatives peculiar to their ancient Temple and Service, which the new one they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to build would never have. From all which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Religious party concluded, that their beſt courſe was to make a firm peace, that ſo they might have the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of participating of the ſame Ceremonies for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they had frequented during the Truce.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who were reſolv'd on the contrary ſide were ſo obſtinate, that all thoſe remonſtrances prevail'd nothing upon them, nor could in the leaſt divert them from the reſolution they had taken never to acknowledge the <hi>Apalachites</hi> for their Sovereigns, nor loſe their liberty under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and way of Worſhip, which their fore-fathers had been ignorant of: So that, in fine, this contrariety of ſentiments made an abſolute rupture among the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> ſo as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them into two factions, as the Prieſts of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> had foreſeen; whereupon being divided alſo in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, they could not return an unanimous anſwer to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of peace or war which had been made to them by the <hi>Apalachites:</hi> But either party growing ſtronger and ſtronger daily, that which voted for an allyance with the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> and ſtood for the adoration of the Sun, became ſo powerful as to be in a condition to oblige the other either to embrace their opinion, or quit the Province.</p>
               <p>It would be too tedious a Relation to ſet down here all the miſchiefs and miſeries which that Civil War brought among the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who mutually deſtroy'd one the other, till at laſt, after many fights, the <hi>Apalachites</hi> joyning with that party
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58704:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which carried on their Intereſt, the other was forced to quit the Provinces of <hi>Amana</hi> and <hi>Matica,</hi> and to find out a more ſetled habitation elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The victorious <hi>Caribbians</hi> having, by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> rid themſelves of thoſe who were the diſturbers of their Peace, fortified their Frontiers, and placed up and down on the avenues the moſt valiant and moſt generous of their Forces, to deprive the Baniſh'd of all hope of ever returning: That done, they contracted a moſt ſtrict Alliance with the <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachites,</hi> ſubmitting themſelves to their Laws, embracing their Religion, and ſo making themſelves one people with them; and that incorporation continues to this day; yet not ſo, but that thoſe <hi>Caribbians</hi> do ſtill retain their ancient name, as we have already obſerv'd in the beginning of this Chapter; as alſo many words which are common between them and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Caribbies:</hi> Of this kind are, among an infinite number of others, the terms of <hi>Cakonnes,</hi> to expreſs the little curioſities which are preſerv'd for their rarity; that of <hi>Bouttou,</hi> to ſignifie a Club of a weighty kind of wood; that of <hi>Taumali,</hi> to expreſs a certain picquancy or delightfulneſs of taſte; that of <hi>Banaré,</hi> to ſignifie a familiar Friend; that of <hi>Etoutou,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note an Enemy: They alſo call a Bow, <hi>Allouba;</hi> Arrows, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louani;</hi> a great Pond, <hi>Taonaba;</hi> the evil Spirit, <hi>Mabouya;</hi> and the Soul of a Man, <hi>Akamboué;</hi> which are the proper terms which the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Inhabitants of the Iſlands make uſe of at the preſent to ſignifie the ſame things.</p>
               <p>As concerning the <hi>Caribbians</hi> forc'd out of their Country by thoſe of their own Nation, and driven out of the limits of their ancient Habitation, and all the places they had Conquer'd; having ſtraggled up and down a while neer the River which derives its ſource from the great Lake, and endeavour'd to no purpoſe to enter into ſome Accommodation with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of either ſide of it, they at laſt reſolv'd to make their way through their Country, either by fair means or foul, and ſo to get into ſome place where they might perpetuate themſelves, and make a ſecure eſtabliſhment of what was left of them: With this reſolution they made a ſhift to get to the Sea-ſide, where having met with a people which took compaſſion on their miſery, they winter'd among them, and paſs'd over that diſconſolate Seaſon in much want: And while they ſpent their time in continual regrets, for their loſs of a Country ſo pleaſant and fertile as that which they had liv'd in, and conſidered that they ſhould never enjoy themſelves in that whereto their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune had caſt them as Exiles, there arrived where they were, at the beginning of the Spring, two little Veſſels, which came from the Iſlands called the <hi>Lucayos,</hi> and had been driven by the Winds into the Road neer which our <hi>Caribbians</hi> had paſs'd over the Winter: There were in thoſe two Veſſels, which they call
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58704:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Canows</hi> or <hi>Piragos,</hi> about thirteen or fourteen perſons, Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Cigateo,</hi> one of the <hi>Lucayan</hi> Iſlands, who being got aſhore, related to the natural Inhabitants of the Country how they had been forc'd thither by a Tempeſt; and among other things, they told wonders of the Iſlands where they liv'd, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that there were yet divers others beyond them, towards the Aequator, which lay deſart, and were not inhabited, and thoſe ſuch as were accounted better then the others whereof they had given them an account: That for their parts, all they deſired of the Inhabitants of the Country was only ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and a little freſh Water, to enable them to get home to their own Country, from which they conceiv'd themſelves to be diſtant not above four or five days Sailing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who were ſtudying where to find out ſome new habitation, and extreamly troubled that they had no ſetled place, where they might no longer be expos'd to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of a wandring kind of life, having heard ſo much of theſe Iſlands, and that they were not far from the <hi>Lucayas,</hi> reſolv'd to make their advantage of the opportunity of thoſe Guides, whom they had met with by ſo extraordinary a good fortune, to follow them, when they ſhould depart thence, and after their arrival at home, to plant themſelves in ſome of thoſe deſart Iſlands whereof they had given ſo advantagious an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>They doubted not but that the execution of this enterprize would put a period to all their miſeries: But there was yet a great obſtacle lay in their way, which at firſst they knew not how to overcome, to wit, the want of Veſſels to croſs the Sea, and bring them to the places whereof they deſir'd to poſſeſs themſelves: The firſt Propoſals were to fell down Trees, and to make them hollow with fire, as other Nations did, nay that among whom they then were: But that expedient requir'd a long time to compaſs it, while in the interim, thoſe whom they hoped to have for their Conductors would be gone: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they thought it the ſureſt way to find out Veſſels ready made: To that end they reſolv'd in the night time to ſeize on all thoſe which the Nations of the neighbouring Creeks, and and ſuch as liv'd neer the Rivers which fall thereabouts into the Sea, had ready in their Ports, and in condition fit for the Sea. The day being come for the departure of the <hi>Lucayans,</hi> who were to be their Guides, our <hi>Caribbians</hi> who had furniſh'd themſelves before-hand with all neceſſary proviſions, met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moſt ſecretly they could, along the River-ſides and neer the Ports, and having poſſeſs'd themſelves of all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows</hi> or Veſſels they met with, joyn'd with the <hi>Lucayans,</hi> with whom, without taking any leave of their Hoſts, they ſet Sail for the <hi>Lucayas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Wind having prov'd favourable to theſe Fugitives, they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58704:126"/>
got in a few days to <hi>Cigateo,</hi> where they were very civilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by the Inhabitants, who, having ſupply'd them with all neceſſary refreſhments, conducted them to the moſt remote of their Iſlands, and thence gave them a Convoy to bring them to the next of the deſart Iſlands whereof they had given them a relation, which they call'd <hi>Ayay,</hi> but it is now call'd <hi>Santa Cruz:</hi> In their paſſage they ſail'd by the Iſland of <hi>Boriquen,</hi> now call'd <hi>Porto-Rico,</hi> which was inhabited by a very powerful Nation.</p>
               <p>It was then in the ſaid Iſland of <hi>Ayay</hi> that our <hi>Caribbians</hi> laid the firſt foundations of their Colony, and where enjoying an undiſturbed Peace, which made them forget all precedent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, they multipli'd ſo, that within a few years they were forc'd to ſpread themſelves into all the other Iſlands now known by the name of the <hi>Caribbbies:</hi> And ſome Ages after, having poſſeſs'd themſelves of all the inhabitable Iſlands, they tranſported themſelves into the Continent of the Meridional part of <hi>America,</hi> where they have at this day many great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Colonies, wherein they are ſo well ſetled, that though the <hi>Yaos,</hi> the <hi>Sappayos,</hi> the <hi>Paragotis,</hi> the <hi>Arouacas</hi> or <hi>Arouagues,</hi> who are their Neighbours in the Iſland of <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Orinoca,</hi> have often attempted to force them out of their habitations, and engag'd againſt them with all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet do they ſtill continue in them in a flouriſhing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and entertain ſo good a correſpondence and ſo perfect a friendſhip with our <hi>Caribbians,</hi> the Inhabitants of the Iſlands, that theſe latter march out once or twice a year to their relief, joyning all together with the <hi>Calibites,</hi> their Friends and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, againſt the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> and other Nations, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies.</p>
               <p>There is yet another Story concerning the origine of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulary <hi>Caribbians,</hi> which is, That they are deſcended from their Confederates the <hi>Calibites;</hi> and we are apt to believe ſomwhat of it may be true, as being the only account which moſt of them can give of themſelves: For theſe <hi>Caribbians</hi> being leſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful then the <hi>Calibites,</hi> when they firſt came among them into the Continent, and having afterwards enter'd into Alliance with them by Marriages and common concernments, they made up together but one people, and ſo there enſu'd a mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Language and particular Cuſtoms: And thence it comes that a great part of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> having forgot their firſt origine, would have it believ'd that they are deſcended from the <hi>Calibites:</hi> And it is to be preſum'd, that it being out of all memory of man, when their Predeceſſors came from the Northern parts into theſe Iſlands, they have not any knowledg of their Native Country, which having caſt them out of her boſom, and treated them as Rebels, was not ſo far regretted by thoſe poor Fugitives, as that they ſhould be over-careful
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58704:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to preſerve the memory of it. On the contrary, it is credible, that the ſooner to forget the miſeries they had ſuffer'd, they ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd the ſad ideas therof as much as they could, and were glad of any other Origine: It may be alſo, that when the <hi>Caribbians</hi> firſt enter'd the Iſlands, upon their coming from the North, they were not ſo deſtitute of Inhabitants, but that there were here and there ſome Families which might have paſs'd over thither from the Iſlands of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> or <hi>Porto-Rico,</hi> which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, reſerving only the Women, whom they might make uſe of for the propagation of their Colony: And of this there is yet a greater probability, in that theſe <hi>Caribbians</hi> being baniſh'd from among the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> and by War forc'd to leave the Country to the victorious Party, many of their Wives ſtaid behind among the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> and the reſt of their own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who had joyn'd with them: And thence poſſibly may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the difference there is between the Language of the Men and that of the Women amongſt the <hi>Caribbians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to give a more particular account of thoſe Colonies of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> which are in the Meridional Continent of <hi>America,</hi> in the firſt place, the Relations of thoſe who have entred into the famous River of <hi>Orenoca,</hi> diſtant from the Line, Northward, eight degrees and fifty minutes, affirm, that at a great diſtance within the Country, there live certain <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> who might eaſily have paſs'd over thither from the Iſland of <hi>Tabago,</hi> which, of all the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> is the neereſt to that Continent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Relations acquaint us, that, advancing yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards the Aequator, there lies, at ſeven degrees from that Line, the great and famous River of <hi>Eſſequeba,</hi> neer which are planted firſt the <hi>Aroüagues,</hi> and next to them the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who are continually in war with them, and have their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions above the falls of that River, which deſcend with great violence from the Mountains; and thence theſe <hi>Caribbians</hi> reach to the ſource of the ſame River, and are very numerous, and poſſeſs'd of a vaſt territory.</p>
               <p>The ſame Travellers relate, that within ſix degrees of the Line lies the River <hi>Sarname,</hi> or <hi>Suriname,</hi> into which falls ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther River named <hi>Ikouteca,</hi> all along which there are many Villages inhabited by <hi>Caribbians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is beſides a numerous people of the ſame Nation, Inhabitants of a Country which reaches a great way into the Continent, the coaſts whereof extend to the fifth and ſixth degree North of the Aequator, ſcituate along a fair and great River named <hi>Marouyne,</hi> about eighteen Leagues diſtant from that of <hi>Sarname,</hi> which from its ſource croſſes up and down above two hundred leagues of Country, in which there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Villages inhabited by <hi>Caribbians;</hi> who, obſerving the ſame cuſtome with the Iſlanders, make choice of the moſt valiant
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58704:127"/>
among them for their <hi>Cacicks,</hi> or Commanders in chief, and are ſomewhat of a higher ſtature than thoſe Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> yet not differing much from them, ſave only that ſome of them cover their privy parts with a piece of cloth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ornament, than out of any conſideration of ſhame or modeſty: Thoſe therefore who have travell'd into thoſe Countries affirm, that, from the mouth of the River <hi>Marouyne,</hi> which lies at five degrees and forty five minutes of the Line to the North, to the ſource of it, there are twenty days ſail, and that all along it the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have their Villages like thoſe of our Iſlanders.</p>
               <p>We obſerve further out of the Voyages of ſome <hi>Dutch,</hi> that the Inhabitants of that Continent, through which the River of <hi>Cayenna</hi> makes its paſſage into the Ocean, are naturally <hi>Caribbians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, it is not impoſſible but that theſe <hi>Caribbians</hi> might croſs thoſe Countries as far as <hi>Braſil;</hi> for thoſe who have made voyages thither, affirm, that among the Provinces, which lie along the coaſts of the South-Sea, there are ſome people, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by the name of <hi>Caribbians;</hi> and that being of a more hardy and daring conſtitution, as alſo more apprehenſive and ſubtle than the other <hi>Indians,</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Braſil,</hi> they are ſo highly eſteemed among them, that they conceive them to be endu'd with a more excellent kind of knowledge than the others; whence it comes that they have a great ſubmiſſion for their Counſels, and deſire them to preſide at all their Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals and rejoicings, which they ſeldom celebrate without the preſence of ſome one of theſe <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count take their progreſs up and down the Villages, where they are receiv'd with acclamations, entertainments and great kindneſs, as <hi>John de Lery</hi> hath obſerv'd.</p>
               <p>Were it neceſſary to produce any further confirmation to prove that theſe <hi>Caribbians,</hi> ſcattered into ſo many places of the Continent of the Meridional part of <hi>America,</hi> are of the ſame Nation with the <hi>Iſlanders,</hi> we might alledge what is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly affirm'd by the two <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonies planted in thoſe coaſts, to wit, thoſe of <hi>Cayenna</hi> and <hi>Berbica,</hi> both neighbours to the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Continent, to ſhew the conformity and reſemblance there is in many things, as conſtitution, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, cuſtoms, &amp;c. between them and the <hi>Indian</hi> Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> of whom we ſhall give an account hereafter: But it is time we conclude this chapter, which is already grown to a great length; yet could it not be divided, by reaſon of the uniformity and connexion of the matter.</p>
               <p>Yet have we a word further to add, in anſwer to a queſtion, which the curioſity of ſome perſon might haply take occaſion to ſtart, which is, How long it may be ſince the <hi>Caribbians</hi> came out of <hi>Florida</hi> into theſe Iſlands? We muſt acknowledge
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58704:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there can no certain account be given of it, inaſmuch as theſe Nations have commonly no other Annals than their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories: But in regard thoſe people ordinarily live two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, it is not to be thought ſtrange that the occurrences happening among them, ſhould be tranſmitted to poſterity to three or four Generations. And to confirm this, we may aver that there are many men and women among them who can give an exact account of the firſt arrival of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> as if it had happened but yeſterday: So that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the departure of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> out of <hi>Florida,</hi> and the wars they have had there, being yet freſh among the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> thoſe who have heard them diſcourſe, conjecture that it may be about five hundred years ſince thoſe things came to paſs. But if it be further queſtion'd, why they did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make their way back again into <hi>Florida,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> and thoſe of their own Nation, who had forc'd them thence, eſpecially after they had multiply'd and recruited themſelves ſo powerfully in the Iſlands? it may be anſwered, That the difficulty of Navigation, which is very eaſie from the <hi>Caribbies</hi> to <hi>Florida,</hi> but very dangerous from <hi>Florida</hi> to the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> the winds being commonly contrary, chill'd the earneſtneſs they might have to make any ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. In the next place it is to be noted, that the air of the Iſlands being warmer, and the ſoil as good, and in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance more ſuitable to their conſtitution than that of <hi>Florida,</hi> they apprehended, that thoſe who had forc'd them thence, had, contrary to their intentions, procur'd them a greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than they could have deſir'd, and, thinking to make them miſerable, had made them fortunate in their exile.</p>

               <p>SInce we have had occaſion to ſpeak ſo much concerning the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> and that above one half of the ancient <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> after the expulſion of thoſe among them who would not adore the Sun, have to this preſent made up one people and one Common-wealth with thoſe <hi>Apalachites,</hi> it will be conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to our deſign, eſpecially ſince the ſubject thereof is rare and little known, if we give ſome account of the nature of their Country, and the moſt remarkable things that are in it; as alſo of the manners of the Inhabitants, the Religion they
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58704:128"/>
have had heretofore, and that which they profeſs at this day, as we have the particulars thereof from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have traded among them, and have not long ſince laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Colony in the midſt of the nobleſt, and beſt known of their Provinces.</p>
               <p>The Territories of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> conſiſt of ſix Provinces, whereof three are comprehended within that noble and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vale which is encompaſs'd by the Mountains of the <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> at the foot whereof theſe people inhabit: The moſt conſiderable of thoſe Provinces, and which lies towards the Eaſt, wherein the King keeps his Court; is called <hi>Bemarin:</hi> That which is in the midſt, and as it were in the centre of the three, is called <hi>Amani</hi> or <hi>Amana:</hi> And the third of thoſe which are within that Vale, is known by the name of <hi>Matica.</hi> True it is, that this laſt, which begins in the Vale, reaches a great way into the Mountains, nay goes yet much beyond, even to the South-ſide of the great Lake, which they call <hi>Theomi:</hi> The other Provinces are <hi>Schama</hi> and <hi>Meraco,</hi> which are in the <hi>Apalatean</hi> Mountains; and <hi>Achalaques,</hi> which is partly in the Mountains, and partly in the Plain, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the Marſhes and Fenny places, confining on the great Lake <hi>Theomi,</hi> on the North-ſide.</p>
               <p>The Country under the King of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> being thus divided into ſix Provinces, there are in it ſome Mountains of a vaſt extent and prodigious height, which are for the moſt part inhabited by a people living only upon what they get by hunting, there being great ſtore of wild beaſts in thoſe Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes: Beſides which, there are alſo certain Vales, which are peopled by a Nation that is leſs barbarous, ſuch as addicts it ſelf to the cultivation of the earth, and is ſuſtain'd by the fruits it produces: And laſtly, there are abundance of Marſhes and Fenny places, and a great Lake, whereof the Inhabitants are very numerous, maintaining themſelves by fiſhing, and what the little good ground they have furniſhes them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>The three Provinces which are within the Vale, which, as we ſaid in the precedent Chapter, is ſixty leagues in length, and about ten more in bredth, lie as it were in a Champion Country, ſave only, that in ſome places there are certain ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and eminences, on which the Towns and Villages are commonly built; many little Rivers, which deſcend from the Mountains, and abound in Fiſh, croſs it up and down in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places: That part of it which is not reduc'd to culture is well furniſh'd with fair trees of an exceſſive height: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there are <hi>Cedars, Cypreſs, Pines, Oaks, Panamas,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Saxafras,</hi> and an infinite variety of others which have no proper names among us.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Fruit-trees of this Country, beſides Cheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58704:129"/>
and Walnut-Trees, which grow naturally there, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> who have planted themſelves in thoſe parts, as we ſhall relate more at large towards the end of this Chapter, have planted Orange-trees, ſweet and ſharp Citrons, Lemons, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Apples and Pears, and divers Stones, as of Plumbs, Cherries, and Apricocks, which have thriv'd and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſo, that in ſome places of this Country there are more <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> fruits then in any other part of <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is alſo good ſtore of thoſe leſſer ſort of Trees which bear leaves or flowers of ſweet ſcent, ſuch as Laurel, Jeſſemine, Roſes, Roſemary, and all thoſe others that are ſo ornamental in the Garden: Nor is there any want of Pinks, Carnations, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips, Violets, Lillies, and all the other Flowers which adorn Knots and Borders.</p>
               <p>Pot-herbs alſo, and all ſorts of Pulſe and Roots, thrive very well there: Citruls, Cucumbers, and Melons are common all Summer long, and as well taſted as thoſe which grow in any part of the <hi>Caribbies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Strawberries and Raſpberries grow in the Woods without any culture: They have alſo Small-nuts, Gooſeberries, and an infinite variety of other ſmall Fruits, which in their degree contribute to the delight and refreſhment of the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The Wheat, Barly, Rie, and Oats which ſome ſow'd there at ſeveral Seaſons, and in different Soils, hath grown only to the blade; but in requital, there grows every where ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſmall Millet, Lentils, Chick-peaſe, Fetches, and Mais, or Turkiſh Wheat, which are ſown and harveſted twice a year, that the Inhabitants of the Plain Country have enough to ſupply thoſe who live towards the Mountains, who bring them in exchange ſeveral ſorts of Furs. The Lands that are ſown with Turkiſh Wheat are enclos'd with Quick-ſet Hedges, planted on both ſides with Fruit-trees, moſt whereof are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with wild Vines, which grow at the foot of the Trees.</p>
               <p>As to the Volatiles of this Country, there are Turkeys, Pintadoes, Parrots, Woodquiſts, Turtles, Birds of prey, Eagles, Geeſe, Ducks, Herons, white Sparrows, <hi>Tonatzuli,</hi> a kind of bird that ſings as ſweetly as the Nightingal, and is of an excellent plumage; and abundance of other Birds commonly ſeen neer Rivers and in the Foreſts, quite different from thoſe that are ſeen in other parts of the World.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apalachites</hi> have no knowledge at all of Sea-fiſh, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at too great a diſtance from the Coaſts; but they take abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the Rivers and Lakes, which are extreamly nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of an excellent taſte, and much about the bigneſs and in figure ſomwhat like our Pikes, Carps, Perches, and Barbels: They alſo take Caſtors and Bevers neer the great Rivers, Lakes, and Pools; they eat the fleſh of them, and make Furs of the Skins, for Winter-caps and other uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:58704:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>There is no venemous creature nor any wild beaſt in the lower part of the Country; for the Inhabitants of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who are expert Huntſmen, drive them into the Foreſts, where they find them continual work and ſport: So that the flocks of ſheep, and herds of cattel and ſwine graze up and down the skirts of the Mountains without any body to look after them. But within the woods, and in the deſarts, which are not much frequented by men, there are divers Monſtrous and dangerous Reptiles, as alſo Bears, Tygers, Lions, Wolves, and ſome other kinds of cruel Beaſts, which live by prey, and are particular to thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>The men in theſe Countries are for the moſt part of high ſtature, of an Olive-colour, and well proportion'd, their hair black and long: Both men and women are very neat and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in keeping their hair clean and handſomely order'd: The women tie up theirs about the crown of the head after the form of a Garland; and the men diſpoſe theirs behind the ears: But upon days of publick rejoicing, all have their hair looſe, diſhevel'd, and dangling over their ſhoulders; a faſhion becomes them well. The Inhabitants of thoſe Provinces that lie towards and among the Mountains, cut off all the hair on the left ſide of the head, that ſo they may the more eaſily draw their Bows, and they order that which grows on the other ſide, ſo as to make a creſt ſtanding over the right ear: Moſt of them wear neither Caps nor any thing inſtead of Shoes, but they cover the body with the skins of Bears or Tygers, neatly ſown together, and cut after the faſhion of cloſe coats, which reach down to their knees, and the ſleeves are ſo ſhort that they come not over the elbow.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of the other Provinces which are ſeated in the Vales and Plains, went heretofore naked from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel upwards, in the Summer-time, and in Winter, they wore garments of Furrs; but now both men and women are clad all the year long: In the hotteſt ſeaſons, they have light cloaths, made of cotton, wooll, or a certain herb, of which they make a thred as ſtrong as that of Flax: The women have the art of ſpinning all theſe materials; and weaving them into ſeveral kinds of ſtuffs, which are laſting; and delightful to the eie. But in the winter, which many times is hard enough, they are all clad in ſeveral kinds of skins, which they have the skill to dreſs well enough: They leave the hair on ſome, and ſo make uſe of them as Furs: They have alſo the art of tanning Ox-hides, and other skins, and making Shoes and Boots of them.</p>
               <p>The men wear Caps made of Otter-skins, which are perfectly black and glittering, pointed before, and ſet out behind with ſome rich feathers, which hanging down over their ſhoulders make them look very gracefully: but the women have no
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58704:130"/>
other ornament about the head, but what is deriv'd from the ſeveral dreſſes of their hair: They make holes in their ears, and wear pendants of Chryſtal, or made of a certain ſmooth ſtone they have, which is of as bright a green as that of an Emrald: Of the ſame materials they alſo make great Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, which they wear when they would appear in ſtate: They make great account of Corral, Chryſtal, and yellow Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which are brought to them by Strangers; and they are only the Wives of the principal Officers that have Bracelets and Necklaces made of them: Though there be ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families among them, yet have they not alter'd any thing either as to their Cloaths or courſe of Life.</p>
               <p>The ordinary ſort of people wear only a cloſe coat without ſleeves, over a thin garment of Goat-skins, which ſerves them for ſhirts: The Coat which comes down to the calf of the leg, is ty'd about the waſt with a leathern girdle, which is ſet out with ſome little embroidery: But the Officers and Heads of Families wear over that a kind of ſhort Cloak, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers only the back and the arms, though behind it falls down to the ground: This Cloak is faſten'd with ſtrong leathern points, which make it faſt under the neck, and lye cloſe to the ſhoulders: The womens garments are of the ſame faſhion with thoſe of the men, ſave that thoſe of the former come down to the ankles, and the Cloak hath two open places on the ſides, through which they put forth their arms.</p>
               <p>To keep themſelves clear of Vermine, they often waſh their bodies with the juice of a certain root, which is of as ſweet a ſcent as the <hi>Flower-de-luce</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and hath this further vertue, that it makes the nerves more ſupple, and fortifies and cauſes a ſmoothneſs all over the body, and communicates an extraordinary delightful ſcent thereto.</p>
               <p>The Cities of the three Provinces that are in the ſpacious Plain, which is at the foot of the Mountains, are encompaſſed on the outſide by a large and deep Moat, which on the inſide, inſtead of wals, is all planted with great poſts pointed at the top, thruſt a good depth into the ground; or ſometimes with quick-ſet hedges intermixt with very ſharp thorns; they are commonly about five or ſix foot in bredth: The Gates are ſmall and narrow, and are made faſt with little pieces of wood, which lie croſs between ſmall ramperts of earth that are on both ſides, and which command the avenues: There are commonly but two Gates to every City; to enter in at them, a man muſt paſs over a bridge ſo narrow, that two men cannot well march on a front upon it: The Bridge is built upon piles, which ſuſtain certain planks, which they draw up in the night when they fear the leaſt trouble.</p>
               <p>It is ſeldom ſeen that there is above one City in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; nay there are ſome that have not above eight hundred
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58704:130"/>
houſes in them: The Metropolis of the Country, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Melilot,</hi> hath above two thouſand; they are all built of pieces of wood planted into the ground and joined one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The covering is for the moſt part of the leaves of reeds, graſs, or ruſhes: Thoſe of the Captains are done over with a certain Maſtick, which keeps off the rain, and preſerves the thatch from decaying in many years: The floors of all the houſes is of the ſame material, whereto they add a certain gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſand which they get out of the neighbouring Mountains, and which gives ſuch a luſtre as if they were ſown with little ſpangles of Gold.</p>
               <p>The Rooms of the ordinary ſort of people are hung only with a kind of Mat, made of Plantane-leaves and ruſhes, which they have the art of dying into ſeveral colours; thoſe of perſons conſiderable among them, are hung with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Furs, or Deer-skins painted with divers figures, or with a kind of Tapiſtry made of Birds-feathers, which they ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly intermingle, that it ſeems to be embroidered: Their Beds are about a foot and a half from the ground, and are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with skins that are dreſs'd, and as ſoft as can be wiſh'd: Theſe skins are commonly painted with Flowers, Fruits, and a hundred ſuch inventions, and their colours are ſo well ſet on and ſo lively, that at a diſtance one would take them for rich Tapiſtry: The wealtheir ſort in the winter time have their beds covered with the skins of Martins, Beavers, or white Foxes, which are ſo well dreſs'd, and perfum'd with ſuch artifice, that they never admit any thing of ordure: The Officers and all the moſt conſiderable Inhabitants lie on Mattreſſes fill'd with a certain down that grows on a little plant, and is as ſoft as ſilk; but the common people take their reſt on dry'd ſern, which hath the property of taking away the wearineſs of the body, and retriving the forces exhauſted by hunting, gardening, and all the other painful exerciſes conſequent to their courſe of life.</p>
               <p>The Veſſels they uſe in their houſes are either of wood or earth, enamel'd with divers colours, and very delightfully painted: They ſharpen upon ſtones the teeth of ſeveral wild beaſts, and therewith arm their Arrows and Lances: Before ſtrangers came among them and traded in their Country, they knew not there was ſuch a thing as Iron; but they made uſe of extraordinary hard and ſharp ſtones inſtead of wedges, and certain ſmooth and cutting bones, inſtead of knives.</p>
               <p>They all live very amicably together under the conduct of a King, who keeps his Court at <hi>Melilot,</hi> the Metropolis of the Kingdome: In every City there is a Governour, and other ſubordinate Officers, who are appointed by him, and chang'd at his pleaſure, as he thinks moſt convenient: The Villages alſo have Captains and heads of Families, by whom they are
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58704:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
governed. All immoveable goods are common among theſe people, and excepting only their houſes, and the little gardens belonging to them, they have no propriety in any thing: they carry on the buſineſs of Agriculture in common, and they ſhare the fruits of the earth among themſelves: At ſowing-time the Governors and their Officers overſee the work; and at that time all thoſe who are of age to do any thing abroad, go out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning to their work, and continue there till the evening, at which time they return to their Towns and Villages to take their reſt: While they are at work, it is the buſineſs of their Chiefs to provide them ſomewhat extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in meat and drink: They diſpoſe their Harveſt into the publick Granaries, which are in the midſt of their Towns and Villages; and at every full Moon, and at every new Moon, thoſe who are entruſted with the diſtribution thereof, ſupply every Family, according to the number of perſons whereof it conſiſts, with as much as will ſuffice.</p>
               <p>They are a temperate people, and hate all kind of voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and whatever tends to effeminacy: And though Vines grow naturally in their Country, yet do they not make any wine but what is requiſite for the divine ſervice: Fair water is their ordinary drink, but at great entertainments, they make uſe of a pleaſant kind of Beer, which is made of <hi>Turkey</hi> wheat: They alſo have the art of making an excellent kind of Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, or Mead, which they keep in great earthen veſſels: The great abundance of honey which they find among the Rocks, and in the clefts of hollow trees, ſupplies them with that whereof they make that delicious drink, which is ſuch as may well paſs for Sack, eſpecially after it hath been kept a long time.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the ſame Family live ſo lovingly together, that there are among them ſome houſes where an old man hath his children, and his children's children, to the third, nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the fourth generation, all living under the ſame roof, to the number of a hundred perſons, and ſometimes more. Moſt of the other Nations of the Septentrional part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> who inhabit along the Sea-coaſt, are ſo ſlothful, that in the winter time they are in great want, becauſe they had not ſown any thing when the time ſerved, or had conſumed the fruits of the precedent harveſt in extraordinary entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and debauches: But the <hi>Apalachites</hi> hate nothing ſo much as idleneſs, and they are ſo addicted to pains-taking, that the fruits of the earth, being anſwerable to their labour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtributed with prudence and moderation, maintain them plentifully, nay ſo that they can, in caſe of neceſſity, aſſiſt their Neighbours the Inhabitants of the Mountains: Both men and women are perpetually employ'd, after ſeed-time and harveſt, in ſpinning of Cotton, Wooll, and a certain Herb, which is ſoft
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58704:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſtrong, for the making of cloth, and ſeveral ordinary ſorts of ſtuffs, wherewith they cover themſelves: Some among them employ themſelves in making of earthen ware; others in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Tapiſtry of the plumage of Birds; others, in making of Baskets, Panniers, and other little pieces of houſhold-ſtuff, which they do with a ſtrange induſtry.</p>
               <p>They are of a very loving and obliging diſpoſition: And whereas their diſtance from the Sea exempts them from being ſubject to receive any diſpleaſure from Strangers, they are in like manner ignorant what entertainments to make them, when they chance to viſit them, and are never weary of expreſſing all manner of friendſhip towards them: They are docible and ſuſceptible of all ſorts of good diſciplines; but they have this diſcommendable in them, that they are very obſtinate in their opinions, eaſily angred, and much addicted to revenge, when they are convinc'd that they have been injur'd: They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly apt to give credit to their dreams, and they have ſome old dotards among them, who openly make it their buſineſs to interpret them, and foretell what things ſhall happen after them.</p>
               <p>They have had a long continuance of peace; however they think it prudence to ſtand always upon their guard, and they have always Sentinels at the avenues of their Cities, to prevent the incurſions of a certain ſavage and extreamly cruel people, which hath no ſetled habitation, but wander up and down the Provinces with an incredible ſwiftneſs, making havock where-ever they come, eſpecially where they find no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>The Arms of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> are, the Bow, the Club, the Sling, and a kind of great Javelin, which they dart out of their hands, when they have ſpent all their Arrows: And whereas thoſe that inhabit towards the woods and in the Mountains, live only by hunting, continual exerciſe makes them ſo expert in ſhooting with the Bow, that the King, who alwaies hath a Company of them about his perſon, hath no greater diverſion than to ſee them ſhoot at a mark for ſome prize, which he gives him who in feweſt ſhots came to the place aſſign'd, or hath ſhot down a Crown ſet up upon the top of a Tree.</p>
               <p>They are paſſionate lovers of Muſick, and all inſtruments that make any kind of harmony, inſomuch that there's very few among them but can play on the Flute, and a kind of Hawboy, which being of ſeveral bigneſs, make a paſſably good harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and render a ſound that is very melodious: They are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily given to dancing, capering, and making a thouſand poſtures, whereby they are of opinion they disburthen themſelves of all their bad humours, and that they acquire a great activity and ſuppleneſs of body, and a wonderful ſwiftneſs in running. They heretofore celebrated ſolemn dances at the end of every
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58704:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
harveſt, and after they had made their Offerings to the Sun upon the Mountain of <hi>Olaimi;</hi> but now they have no ſet and appointed time for theſe divertiſements.</p>
               <p>Their voice is naturally good, mild, flexible, and pleaſant; whence it comes that many among them make it their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to imitate the ſinging and chirping of Birds; wherein they are for the moſt part ſo fortunate, that like ſo many <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi>'s they entice out of the woods to follow them, thoſe Birds which think they hear only thoſe of their own ſpecies: They do alſo by ſinging alleviate the hard labour they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted unto, and yet what they do, ſeems to be done rather out of divertiſement, and to avoid idleneſs, than out of any conſideration of advantage that they make thereof.</p>
               <p>Their Language is very ſmooth, and very plentiful in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons: That ſpoken by the Captains and all perſons of quality, is more elegant and fuller of flouriſhes than that of the common ſort of people: Their expreſſions are very preciſe, and their periods ſhort enough: While they are yet children, they learn ſeveral ſongs, made by the <hi>Jaouas</hi> in honour and commendation of the Sun; they are alſo acquainted with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other little pieces of Poetry, wherein they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the moſt memorable exploits of their Kings, out of a deſign to perpetuate the memory thereof among them, and the more eaſily tranſmit it to their poſterity.</p>
               <p>All the Provinces which acknowledge the King of <hi>Apala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> for their Sovereign, underſtand the language commonly ſpoken in his Court; yet does not this hinder but that each of them hath a particular dialect of its own, whence it comes that the language of ſome, is in ſome things different from that of others of the Inhabitants: The Provinces of <hi>Amana</hi> and <hi>Matica,</hi> in which there are to this day many <hi>Caribbian</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, have retained to this preſent many words of the ancient idiome of theſe people, which confirms what we have laid down for a certain aſſertion, to wit, that being known by the ſame name, and having many expreſſions common to them with the Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands, thoſe Families have alſo the ſame origine with them, as we have repreſented in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent chapter.</p>
               <p>They heretofore adored the Sun, and had their Prieſts, whom they called <hi>Jaouas,</hi> who were very ſuperſtitious in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to him the ſervice which they had invented in honour of him: their perſwaſion was, that the raies of the Sun gave life to all things; that they dried up the earth; and that once the Sun having continued four and twenty hours under an eclipſe, the earth had been overflown; and that the great Lake which they call <hi>Theomi,</hi> was rais'd as high as the tops of the higheſt Mountains that encompaſs it; but that the Sun having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the eclipſe, had, by his preſence, forc'd the waters to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58704:132"/>
return into their abyſſes; that only the Mountain dedicated to his honour, and wherein his Temple was, was preſerv'd from that deluge; and that their Predeceſſors, and all the beaſts which are at preſent in the woods and upon the earth, having retir'd to the ſaid Mountain, were preſerv'd for the repopulation and recruit of the whole earth: So that they conceive themſelves to be the moſt ancient people of the world; And they affirm, that from that time they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the Sun for their God.</p>
               <p>They were of opinion, that thé Sun had built himſelf the Temple which is in the Mountain of <hi>Olaimi,</hi> the aſcent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is diſtant from the City of <hi>Melilot</hi> ſomewhat leſs than a league; and that the <hi>Tonatzuli</hi> (which are certain little birds about the bigneſs of a Quail, and whoſe bellies and wings are of a bright yellow, the back of a sky-colour, and the head of a plumage, partly red, and partly white) are the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and children of the Sun, which alwaies celebrate his praiſes.</p>
               <p>The ſervice they rendred the Sun conſiſted in ſaluting him at his riſing, and ſinging hymns in honour of him: They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame Ceremonies alſo in the evening, entreating him to return, and to bring the day along with him: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this daily ſervice which every one performed at the door of his houſe, they had alſo another publick and ſolemn ſervice, which conſiſted in ſacrifices and offerings, and was perform'd by the <hi>Jaouas,</hi> four times in the year, to wit, at the two ſeed-times, and after the two harveſts, upon the Mountain of <hi>Olaimi,</hi> with great pomp, and a general concourſe of all the Inhabitants of the ſix Provinces.</p>
               <p>This Mountain of <hi>Olaimi</hi> is ſeated, as we ſaid before, in the Province of <hi>Bemarin,</hi> about a league diſtant from the Royal City of <hi>Melilot;</hi> but there is about another league of aſcent and winding from the foot of it, ere a man can get to the top of it: It is certainly one of the moſt pleaſant and moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Mountains in the world: Its figure is perfectly round, and the natural deſcent extream ſteepy; but to facilitate the acceſs thereof to ſuch as are to go up, they have cut a good broad way all about it, and there are here and there ſeveral reſting places gain'd out of the Rock, like ſo many neeches: All the circumference of it, from the foot to within two hundred paces of the top, is naturally planted with goodly trees of <hi>Saxafras, Cedar,</hi> and <hi>Cypreſs,</hi> and ſeveral others from which there iſſue <hi>Roſins,</hi> and <hi>Aromatick gums,</hi> of a very delightful ſcent: On the top of it there is a ſpacious plain, ſmooth and eaven all over, and ſomewhat better than a league in compaſs; it is covered with a delightful green livery of a ſhort and ſmall graſs, which is intermixt with Thyme, Marjoram, and other ſweet ſmelling herbs: And it was upon the top of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58704:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and upon this pleaſant verdure that the people ſtood, while the Prieſts of the Sun performed the divine ſervice.</p>
               <p>The place which ſerv'd them for a Temple, is a large and ſpacious Grott, or Cave, which is naturally cut in the Rock, on the Eaſt-ſide of the Mountain: It hath a vaſt and large mouth, as the entrance of a magnificent Temple: As ſoon as the Sun is riſen, he darts his rays on that entrance, which hath before it a fair and ſpacious ſquare place, which a man would ſay were made by art in the Rock: And there it is that the <hi>Jaouas,</hi> the Prieſts of the Sun, ſtay expecting his riſing to begin their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Ceremonies on Feſtival days. This Cave within is oval, two hundred foot in length, and proportionably broad: The Vault, which is naturally cut in the Rock, riſes up circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from the ground to about a hundred foot high: There is juſt in the midſt of it a great hole, or Lanthorn, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens it from the top of the Mountain: This Lanthorn is encompaſs'd with great ſtones, laid cloſe together to prevent peoples falling in: The Vault on the inſide is perfectly white, and the ſurface cover'd with a certain <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> which a man might take for white Coral diverfy'd into ſeveral different figures; the whole compaſs of it is of the ſame luſtre: The floor of it is alſo extreamly eaven and ſmooth, as if it were all of one piece of marble. In fine, the greateſt ornament of this Temple conſiſts in its perfect whiteneſs: At the bottom of it there is a great Baſin or Ciſtern, juſt over againſt the entrance, which is full of a very clear water, which perpetually diſtilling out of the Rock, is receiv'd into that place. Juſt in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of this Temple, directly under the Lanthorn which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens it, there is a great Altar all of one ſtone, of a round figure, three foot in height from the floor, and ſuſtain'd by a ſhort pillar, which Altar and the Pedeſtal ſeem to have been cut out of the place where it ſtands, that being in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity a piece of a Rock which jutted out upon the floor of that miraculous Cave.</p>
               <p>The Sacrifices which the <hi>Jaouas</hi> offered to the Sun, conſiſted not in the effuſion of mans blood, or that of ſome certain beaſts; for they were of a perſwaſion, that the Sun, giving life to all things, would not be pleas'd with a ſervice that ſhould deprive thoſe creatures of the life which he had beſtow'd on them; but the Sacrifice conſiſted only in Songs, which they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in honour of him, as alſo in the perfumes of certain aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical drugs, which they appointed to be burnt on his Altar, and in the offerings of garments, which the rich preſented by the hands of the Prieſts, to be afterwards diſtributed among the poorer ſort of people.</p>
               <p>All this Ceremony, which was performed four times a year, laſted from Sun-riſing till noon, at which time the Aſſembly was diſmiſs'd: The Prieſts went up to the Mountain on the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58704:133"/>
Eve of every Feſtival, to prepare themſelves for that ſolemn Action; and the people, which came thither from all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, were there preſent ſome time before Sun-riſing. The way which led up to the Mountain was enlightned by great Fires, which were kept in all that Night, for the convenience of thoſe who went thither to adore. All the people remain'd without upon the Mountain, and none but the Prieſts durſt come neer the Grot, which ſerv'd them for a Temple. Thoſe who brought any Garments to be diſtributed to the poor, preſented them to the Prieſts who ſtood at the entrance, and they hung them on the Poles which were on both ſides of the Portal, where they remained till after the Service, and then they were diſtributed among the poor, as were alſo the other preſents which the rich offered, and which were in like manner kept till the ſame time: Thoſe alſo who brought Perfumes to burn on the Altar, deliver'd their preſents to the Prieſts.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Sun began to appear, the Prieſts who ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Temple began their Songs and Hymns, adoring him ſeveral times on their knees; then they went one after another to caſt the Incenſe and Perfume which they had in their hands upon the Fire, which they had before kindled on the Altar, as alſo upon a great Stone which ſtood before the entrance of the Grot: This Ceremony being ended, the chiefeſt of the Prieſts powr'd ſome Honey into a hollow Stone, made ſomwhat like thoſe Stones wherein the Holy-water ſtands in ſome places, which Stone ſtood alſo before this Temple; and into another, which was of the ſame figure and the ſame matter, he put ſome corns of <hi>Turkey</hi>-wheat a little bruis'd, and deſtitute of their outward Shell, as alſo ſome other ſmall grains, which the Birds conſecrated to the Sun, called the <hi>Tonatzuli,</hi> do greedily feed upon: Theſe Birds, whereof there are great numbers in the Woods which lie round about this Mountain, were ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to find theſe. Treatments which were prepar'd for them in that place, that they fail'd not to come there in great companies as ſoon as the Aſſembly was retir'd.</p>
               <p>While the Prieſts continu'd burning the perfume, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the praiſes of the Sun, the People who were upon the Mountain having made ſeveral bowings at the riſing of the Sun, entertain'd themſelves afterwards in ſome kinds of recreation, dances, and ſongs, which they ſung in honour of him; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſitting down on the graſs, every one fell to what he had brought along with him for his <hi>Viaticum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they continu'd there till noon; but when it came neer that time, the Prieſts, quitting the gate of the Temple, went into the body of it, and diſpoſing themſelves about the Altar, which ſtood in the midſt, they began to ſing afreſh: Then as ſoon as the Sun began to caſt his golden beams on the border of the opening or Lanthorn, under which the Altar was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58704:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they put Incenſe and other perfumes upon the fire which they had kindled the night before, and very carefully kept in upon that Altar: Having ended their Songs, and conſum'd all their Perfumes, they all retir'd to the entrance of the Temple, before the Gate, excepting only ſix, who remain'd neer the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; and while thoſe who ſtood at the entrance lift up their Voices more then ordinary, the others who remain'd at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar let go out of their hands, at the ſame time, every one ſix of the <hi>Tonatzuli,</hi> which they had brought thither, and kept in Cages for that purpoſe: Theſe Birds having flown about the Temple, and finding the entrance poſſeſſed by the Prieſts, who were at the Gate with Boughs in their hands, and frighted them with their Voices, took their flight out at the open place in the midſt of the Temple; and after they had flown about a while, the Aſſembly which was upon the Mountain entertain'd them with loud cries of rejoycing, as accounting them to have put a period to the Ceremony, and looking on them as the Children and Meſſengers of the Sun, they immediately got into the Woods.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as theſe Birds were gone the people march'd down in order from the Mountain, and paſſing neer the Temple, the Prieſts, who were ſtill in their Office, caus'd them to enter into it; and after they had waſhed their hands and their faces in the Fountain, they order'd them to go out at the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, which was divided by a ſmall partition, purpoſely made there to prevent confuſion and diſorder: Then at their coming out they took another way, which led them into the Road that conducted to the Mountain, and was the ſame by which they had aſcended; and ſo every one made towards his own home.</p>
               <p>The poor, whereof the Prieſts had a Catalogue, ſtaid till all the reſt were gone, and receiv'd from their hands the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all the other Preſents which the rich had made to the Sun, to be diſtributed among them; which done, all left the Mountain, and there was an end of the Ceremony.</p>
               <p>But now, ſince the greateſt and moſt conſiderable part of the people who are Inhabitants of the Provinces of <hi>Bemarin</hi> and <hi>Matica,</hi> and particularly the King and City of <hi>Melilot,</hi> have embraced the Chriſtian Religion, this Mountain and its Temple are not much frequented, unleſs it be out of curioſity: Nor does the King permit his Subjects of the other Provinces, who have not receiv'd Baptiſm, to go up thither to perform their Sacrifices and all their ancient Superſtitions.</p>
               <p>They believ'd the immortality of the Soul; but they had ſo diſguis'd this Truth with Fables, that it was in a manner ſmother'd thereby. They embalm'd the bodies of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Relations with ſeveral ſorts of Gums and Aromatical Drugs, which had the virtue of preſerving them from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58704:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and after they had kept them ſometimes above a year in their houſes, they buried them in their Gardens, or in the neighbouring Foreſts, with great lamentations and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. They ſhew to this day at the foot of the pleaſant Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Olaimi,</hi> the Sepulchres of ſeveral of their Kings, which are cut in the Rock; there is planted before every one of them a fair Cedar, for the better obſervation of the place, and more exact continuance of their memories.</p>
               <p>To make a greater expreſſion of their mourning, and to ſhew how much they bewail'd the death of their Friends and Kinred, they cut off ſome part of their hair; But when any King died they ſhav'd the whole head, and ſuffer'd not their hair to grow again, till they had bewail'd him for the ſpace of fifteen months.</p>
               <p>The Knowledge which the <hi>Apalachites</hi> have of God, they have attain'd to by ſeveral degrees: For, to go to the bottom of the buſineſs, it is about an Age ſince that the firſt Seeds of Chriſtian Religion were ſown in that part of <hi>Florida,</hi> by a <hi>French</hi> Colony conſiſting of ſeveral Perſons of Quality, which was brought thither and eſtabliſh'd there by one Captain <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauld</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth King of <hi>France:</hi> The firſt thing he did was to build a Fort, which he named <hi>Carolina,</hi> in honour of His Chriſtian Majeſty: He impos'd alſo on the Capes, Ports, and Rivers of that Country, the names they are at the preſent known by; ſo that along the Coaſt a man finds a place called the <hi>Port Royal,</hi> the <hi>French Cape,</hi> the Rivers of <hi>Seine, Loyre, Charante, Garonne, Daufins, May, Somme,</hi> and ſeveral other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which have abſolute <hi>French</hi> names, and conſequently are a manifeſt argument that the ſaid Nation have heretofore had ſome command there.</p>
               <p>But what is more worthy obſervation, and conduces more to our purpoſe, is, that at this firſt Expedition for <hi>Florida,</hi> there went along with the Adventurers two Learned and Religious Perſons, who immediately upon their arrival in the Country made it their buſineſs, by all ſorts of good offices, to inſinuate themſelves into the affections of the Inhabitants, and to learn their Language, that ſo they might give them ſome knowledge of God, and the ſacred myſteries of his Goſpel. The Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials which Captain <hi>Ribauld</hi> left behind him as to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſhew how that the King <hi>Saturiova,</hi> who govern'd the Quarter where the <hi>French</hi> had eſtabliſh'd themſelves, and who had for Vaſſals to him ſeveral little Kings and Princes who were his Neighbours, receiv'd thoſe Preachers very kindly, and recommended it to all his Subjects, that they ſhould have a ſingular eſteem for them; ſo that the affection thoſe poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bore them, and the fidelity and zeal the others expreſs'd for the advancement of their Converſion, rais'd even then very great hopes that the work of the Lord would proſper in their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58704:135"/>
hands, and that that little portion of his Vineyard being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dreſs'd, would in time bring forth many good and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fruits, to the praiſe of his grace.</p>
               <p>Theſe happy beginnings and firſt-fruits of the Goſpel of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus,</hi> were afterwards augmented and advanc'd by the cares of Monſieur the Admiral <hi>de Coligny,</hi> who gave a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to one <hi>de Laudoniere,</hi> to carry over thither a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſupply of Soldiers and all ſorts of Tradeſmen, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in the year One thouſand five hundred ſixty and four: But theſe laſt Adventurers had hardly taken the air in the Country after their arrival thither, ere the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines that all <hi>America</hi> belongs to him, and who hath ever been jealous of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, made his advantage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which were then in that Country, to traverſe the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſigns of the Directors of that hopeful Colony, and ſmother it as 'twere in the Cradle: To that purpoſe he ſent thither <hi>Peter Melandez</hi> with ſix great ſhips full of men and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, who fell upon it on the nineteenth of <hi>September,</hi> M D LXV.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Laudoniere</hi> and Captain <hi>Ribauld,</hi> who had not long before brought the Colony a ſmall recruit of men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it would be madneſs to think to oppoſe ſuch a powerful force, reſolv'd, with the advice of moſt of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to capitulate and deliver up the place to the ſtronger party, upon ſuch honourable conditions as people beſieg'd are wont to demand. <hi>Peter Melandez</hi> granted them moſt of the Articles they had propos'd; but aſſoon as he was got into the Fort, and had ſecur'd the Guards, he broke the promiſe he had made them, and violating the Law of Nations, he cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly maſſacred not only the Soldiery, but alſo all the women and children, whom he found within the place, and who could not make their eſcape by flight.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Ribauld</hi> fell in the Maſſacre; but <hi>de Laudoniere</hi> made a ſhift to eſcape, through the Fenns, to the ſhips newly come from <hi>France,</hi> which by good fortune were ſtill in the Road: Some others of the Inhabitants, who, upon the firſt arrival of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had foreſeen the danger likely to fall upon them, got in time into the woods, and in the night time came to the Village of their good friend <hi>Saturiova,</hi> who, hating the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> gave them protection, and ſupply'd them with proviſions for a competent ſubſiſtance, till the year M D LXVII. when Captain <hi>de Gorgues,</hi> coming to <hi>Florida</hi> with three ſtout ſhips full of reſolute men and all ſorts of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, ſeverely puniſhed the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and being aſſiſted by <hi>Saturiova,</hi> and all his Neighbours and Allies, he reveng'd the publick injuries of the <hi>French,</hi> putting to the ſword all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> he met with, not only in the Fort of <hi>Carolina,</hi> which they had repair'd and fortified after their uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58704:135"/>
of it, but alſo thoſe he found in two other Forts which they had built along the Coaſt, which he burnt and demoliſh'd, as may be ſeen in the xii. Chapter of the fourth Book of the Deſcription of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> writ by <hi>John de Laet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Memorials which Captain <hi>de Gorgues</hi> cauſed to be printed, giving an account of his Expedition into <hi>Florida,</hi> tell us of a certain <hi>French-man</hi> named <hi>Peter du Bre,</hi> who having made his eſcape to King <hi>Saturiova,</hi> to avoid the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> related to him, that there eſcaped of that Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre but ten men, of which number he was one; that they all met with a ſafe retreat in the territories of the ſaid Prince, who liv'd not far from their deſolated Colony; that three of the eſcaped perſons dy'd there ſome months after that defeat; that of the ſeven remaining, there were ſix were ſo charm'd with the advantageous relation which the ſubjects of <hi>Saturiova</hi> made to them daily of the Treaſures of King <hi>Mayra,</hi> of the powerfulneſs of another whoſe name was <hi>Ollaca,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded forty Princes, and of the generoſity and prudent conduct of the King of <hi>Apalacha,</hi> who govern'd many fair and large Provinces ſeated at the foot of the Mountains, and reaching into ſeveral delightful Vales which they encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd; that they importun'd <hi>Saturiova,</hi> who had entertain'd them ſo kindly, that he would be pleas'd to allow them guides, to conduct them to the Frontiers of the Kingdom of the laſt named, of whom they had heard ſo many miracles, and had particularly this recommendation, that he was a lover of Strangers, and that his Subjects were the moſt civilly govern'd of all the Septentrional part of <hi>America;</hi> that <hi>Saturiova,</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to add that favour to all thoſe they had receiv'd from him before, gave them a good convoy, conſiſting of the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of his ſubjects, to conduct them with all ſafety to all his Allies, and to the Dominions of the King of <hi>Apalacha,</hi> if they were deſirous to viſit him.</p>
               <p>The relation of the ſucceſs of this Progreſs, which theſe few <hi>French-men</hi> undertook to ſatisfie their curioſity, and to make the beſt uſe they could of this interval of their misfortune, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that after they had viſited <hi>Athorus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riova,</hi> and moſt of his Allies, who had their Villages all along a delightful River which in their Language they call <hi>Seloy,</hi> to avoid meeting any of the ſubjects of <hi>Timagoa,</hi> who was then engag'd in a War againſt <hi>Saturiova,</hi> there was a neceſſity they ſhould croſs Rivers upon boughs of trees faſten'd together, climb up Mountains, and make their way through Fens and thick Foreſts, where they met with ſeveral cruel beaſts; that before they came within the Dominions of the King of <hi>Apala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> they were many times ſet upon by Troops of Savages, who ſcout up and down among thoſe vaſt deſarts; that two of their Guides were kill'd in thoſe encounters, and moſt of the reſt
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58704:136"/>
dangerouſly wounded; that the ſubjects of King <hi>Timagoa,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerv'd their march, had follow'd them for ſeveral days, and not being able to overtake them, they laid ambuſhes for them, thinking to have met with them in their return; that after they had run through abundance of dangers, and many times endur'd much hunger and thirſt, they got at laſt to the Province of <hi>Matica,</hi> which is under the juriſdiction of the King of <hi>Apalacha;</hi> that the Governor of the City of <hi>Akoveka,</hi> which is the Metroprolis of that Country, caus'd them to be brought to the King, who was then gone to viſit the Province of <hi>Amana;</hi> that that Prince entertain'd them with ſo much kindneſs, and expreſs'd ſo much friendſhip towards them, that they reſolv'd to ſend back their Guides into their Country, and to ſetle themſelves amongſt the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> ſince they found them anſwerable to the account they had received of them.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of the dangers they had run through ere they could get into the Province of <hi>Matica;</hi> the lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion they had of the difficulties which were unavoidable in their return; the little hope there was that the <hi>French</hi> would ever undertake the re-eſtabliſhment of their Colony; the pleaſantneſs and fertility of the Country into which divine Providence had brought them; and the good natures of the Inhabitants, beſides ſeveral other conſiderations, prevail'd with them to reſolve on that ſetlement. But the Guides whom <hi>Saturiova</hi> had given them, obſtructed their reſolution ſo much, and ſo earneſtly remonſtrated to them, that they durſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves before their Lord without them, that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the difference, and prevent the reproach they were afraid of at their return into their own Country, they prevail'd ſo far, that two of thoſe Travellers ſhould come back along with them to <hi>Saturiova,</hi> to teſtifie their care and fidelity in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Commiſſion he had given them.</p>
               <p>The ſame Relation adds further, that thoſe four <hi>French-men</hi> who voluntarily ſtay'd among the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the ways of God, left them ſome knowledge of his Sovereign Majeſty: And the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have ſome years ſince found the way into thoſe Provinces, write, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Province of <hi>Bemarin</hi> do ſtill talk of thoſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and it is from them that they have learnt ſeveral words of the <hi>French</hi> Language, ſuch as are among others thoſe that ſignifie God, Heaven, Earth, Friend, the Sun, the Moon, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, Hell, Yea, No. Beſides which there are many other words common among thoſe people, and are us'd by them to expreſs the ſame thing which they ſignifie in <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the death of all theſe <hi>French-men,</hi> who were very much lamented by all the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> excepting only the Prieſts of the Sun, who bore them an irreconcileable hatred, becauſe they turned the People from Idolatry, and inclined
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58704:136"/>
them to the knowledge of the true God who created the Sun, whom they adored as God, the Provinces which are ſeated in the Vales of the <hi>Apalachaean</hi> Mountains, and had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned but by a very weak ray of coeleſtial light, would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have returned to the darkneſs of their ancient ſuperſtition, if God, by a remarkable diſpoſal of his Providence, had not ſent to them ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, which at their arrival thither blew up that little ſpark, which lay hid under the embers, into a weak flame.</p>
               <p>Theſe Families came out of <hi>Virginia</hi> in the year M DC XXI. with an intention to go to <hi>New-England,</hi> to avoid the frequent incurſions and maſſacres committed there by the Savages; but the wind proving contrary to their deſign, they were caſt on the Coaſts of <hi>Florida,</hi> whence they paſs'd into the Province of <hi>Matica,</hi> and thence into thoſe of <hi>Amana</hi> and <hi>Bemarin,</hi> and in the laſt they ſetled themſelves, and have drawn thither a conſiderable number of Eccleſiaſticks and perſons of quality, who have there laid the foundations of a ſmall Colony. Moſt of thoſe who are retir'd into thoſe places ſo remote from all commerce in the world, undertook that generous deſign, in the midſt of the great revolutions which happen'd in <hi>England</hi> during the late troubles, and the main buſineſs they propos'd to themſelves at that time, was only to make their advantage of ſo ſeaſonable a retreat, that they might the more ſeriouſly, and with leſs diſtraction, mind the attainment of their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and dilate the limits of Chriſtianity among thoſe poor people, if God gave them the means.</p>
               <p>We underſtand alſo by the laſt papers that have been ſent us from <hi>America,</hi> that, God bleſſing the endeavours of the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this ſmall Colony, they have within theſe twelve or thirteen years baptiz'd moſt of the Officers and the moſt conſiderable Heads of Families in the Provinces of <hi>Bemarin</hi> and <hi>Amana;</hi> That at the preſent, they have a Biſhop and many learned and zealous Eccleſiaſticks among them, who carry on the work of the Lord; and the more to advance it, they have built Colledges in all thoſe places where there are Churches, that the Children of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> may be inſtructed in the myſteries of Chriſtian Religion and true piety.</p>
               <p>The ſame Papers add further, that though the King of <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacha</hi> hath received Baptiſm, and ſeems to have much affection for theſe Strangers, who have procur'd him that happineſs; yet hath he of late entertain'd ſome jealouſie of them, out of an apprehenſion, as it was repreſented to him by ſome of his Councel, that if he ſuffer'd them to grow more numerous, they might in time become Maſters of the Country: He thereupon in the firſt place diſpers'd them into ſeveral Cities, that they might not be able to make any conſiderable body, or foment any factions; and afterwards, there was an order paſs'd, that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58704:137"/>
all thoſe who have at the preſent any ſetlement in the boſom of his Country, might peaceably continue in their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and participate of the ſame priviledges with the Natives, provided they held no correſpondence with any abroad, to the prejudice of the publick tranquillity; but that hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward no other ſtrangers ſhall be permitted to make any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtabliſhments there.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with the Nature of the Country, affirm, that the King of the <hi>Apalachites</hi> hath no juſt cauſe to fear that either the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or any other ſtrangers ſhould be guilty of any deſign againſt him, as to the maſtering of his Country: For, beſides the neceſſity there is of having a very powerful Army, ere any ſuch enterpriſe can be undertaken, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who are eſtabliſh'd there, are no more amongſt that great Nation, than a handful of ſand on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; this Country being ſo remote from all the reſt of the world, and deſtitute of Gold, Silver, precious Stones, and in a manner all rich Commodities, whereby Commerce is kept up and continu'd; it is moſt certain, that it will never be much ſought after or envy'd by any <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations, which ſend out Colonies only to thoſe places, where there is hope of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome conſiderable advantage by way of Trade. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to may be added this further conſideration, that, though theſe Provinces were poſſeſs'd of as great Treaſures and Rarities, as they are deſtitute thereof; yet lying at a great diſtance from Sea-Ports, and having no navigable Rivers falling into it, by means whereof there might in time be ſome correſpondence between them and other parts, there is no likelihood that there ſhould be many perſons either in <hi>England</hi> or any where elſe, who would be perſwaded to croſs over ſo many Seas, to go and end their days in a Country which is deſtitute of all thoſe conveniences, and cannot receive thoſe refreſhments which are brought out of <hi>Europe,</hi> and contribute much to the comfortable ſubſiſtance of all the other Colonies of <hi>America;</hi> and in a word, a Country, which can give its Inhabitants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but clothing and nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Some time after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had eſtabliſh'd themſelves in this Country, as we have repreſented before, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who as it were keep the keys of one part of <hi>Florida,</hi> by means of the Forts they have built near the moſt eminent Havens, and along the moſt conſiderable Rivers) brought in there a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of religious men of the Order of the <hi>Minimes,</hi> whom Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the eighth had ſent into the Septentrional <hi>America,</hi> in the quality of <hi>Apoſtolical Miſſionaries,</hi> and endow'd with moſt ample priviledges, for their better encouragement in the carrying on of that work: They arriv'd in thoſe Provinces in the year, One thouſand ſix hundred forty and three; and ſince that time they have taken their progreſs through moſt of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58704:137"/>
the Villages that lie about the great Lake, and upon the deſcent of the Mountains which look towards the Country of the <hi>Cofachites:</hi> It is reported, that they have baptized with great pomp the <hi>Paracouſſis</hi> of the Province of <hi>Achalaca,</hi> and a great number of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>When theſe religious men return from their Miſſions, they live in a ſolitary, yet delightful place, which lies upon the deſcent of a high Mountain, not above a quarter of a league diſtant from the great Lake, and about as much from the greateſt Village of the Province of <hi>Achalaca.</hi> Before a man comes to their habitation, he muſt croſs through ſeveral fair Gardens, in the midſt whereof there is a pleaſant walk, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trees on both ſides, which reaches to the skirt of the Mountain: And though they have ſeated themſelves on an eminent place, yet they have many ſprings, which, falling down from the upper part of the Mountains, are receiv'd into great Ciſterns and great Ponds, where they have abundance of good Fiſh: The Lord of the Country viſits them often, and hath a great reſpect for them; for the moſt part, he hath ſome one of them about his perſon, who ſerves him as a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.</p>
               <p>In the year One thouſand ſix hundred fifty and three, in which Mr. <hi>Brigstock,</hi> that moſt inquiſitive <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, from whom we have receiv'd all the account we have given of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> arriv'd in that Province of <hi>Achalaca,</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Religious men entertain'd him very kindly, and did him all the good offices lay in their power: From them it was, that, during his aboad in the Country, he learnt all the particulars we are now going to deſcribe, and which he hath liberally communicated to us.</p>
               <p>They ſhow'd him an admirable Flower, which grows abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in the Mountains of thoſe parts: The figure of this Flower is much like that of a Bell, and there are as many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours obſervable in it as in the Rain-bow; the under leaves, which being fully blown, are much larger than thoſe of our greateſt Roſes, are charged with a great many other leaves, which appear ſtill leſs and leſs to the lower part or bottom of the Bell: Out of the midſt of them there riſes a little button, like a heart, which is of a very delicious taſte: The Plant hath a little buſhineſs at the top, much like Sage: The leaves and the flower ſmell like a Violet: It is alſo a kind of ſenſitive Plant, for it cannot be touch'd, either in its leaves or flower, but it immediately withers.</p>
               <p>Theſe Religious men carryed the ſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman to a Village of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who inhabit in the Mountains, where there is a miraculous Grott or Cave, wherein the waters have faſhion'd all the moſt delightful rarities, that a man can deſire from a divertiſment of that kind: They ſhew'd him particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58704:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one place in the ſaid Grott, where the waters falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bare ſtone, and diſtilling drop after drop, of a different bigneſs, make ſo exact a muſick, that there is no harmony can well be preferr'd before it.</p>
               <p>There is found in the Mountains, on the Eaſt-ſide of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Achalaca,</hi> ſome Rock-Chriſtal, and certain red and bright ſtones, which have ſuch a luſtre as that they might paſs for right Rubies: 'Tis poſſible there may be ſome Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in thoſe parts; but they are not yet diſcovered, only what confirms this opinion is, that they find a kind of golden ſand there, which is waſh'd down by the torrents, and hath a wonderful luſtre: Mr. <hi>Brigſtock</hi> having given of it to ſome Goldſmiths to make a teſt thereof, it was in a manner quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd by the fire, and the little that remained in the Crucible might well paſs for very fine Copper.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſame Religious men ſhew'd the ſaid Gentleman, as they paſs'd through the woods, ſeveral ſorts of trees which yielded Gums of excellent ſcent, as alſo many other Rarities, a particular account whereof would require a conſiderable Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: But above all, they ſhow'd him the tree, whereof the <hi>Floridians</hi> make that excellent drink which they call <hi>Caſina,</hi> the deſcription whereof may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of <hi>de Laet.</hi> It is abſolutely conformable to the Relation of Mr. <hi>Brigſtock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the Inhabitants of <hi>Achalacha</hi> were converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, they took ſeveral Wives; but now their Marriages are regulated, and they content themſelves only with one: They interr'd their Lords as the <hi>Apalachites</hi> do, in the Caves that are at the foot of the Mountains: then they made up the entrance thereof with a ſtone-wall: they hung before the Cave the moſt conſiderable Veſſels which thoſe Princes had made uſe of at their Tables: And all the Captains faſten'd all about the place, their Bows, Arrows, and Clubs, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſeveral days at the Sepulchre: They worſhipped the Sun, and held the immortality of the Soul as well as their Neighbours: They believ'd alſo that ſuch as had liv'd well, and ſerv'd the Sun as they ought, and made many preſents to the poor, in honour of him, were hapyy, and that after death they were chang'd into Stars: But on the contrary, that thoſe who had led a wicked life, were carried into the precipices of the high Mountains, whereby they were ſurrounded, and there endur'd extream want and miſery, amongſt the Lions, Tygers, and other beaſts of prey, which hunt after their ſuſtenance therein.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of this Country are all long-liv'd, inſomuch that there are many among them, both men and women, who are neer two hundred years of age.</p>
               <p>This curious digreſſion we receiv'd from the forementioned <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Brigstock,</hi> and we have inſerted it
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58704:138"/>
here, out of a preſumption that it will not be undelightful to thoſe, who ſhall make it their divertiſement to read this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; at leaſt while we are yet in expectation that that excellent perſon will give us a perfect accompt of the ſtate of the <hi>Apala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,</hi> and ſome others of the Neighbouring Nations, as he puts us in hope that he will.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Bodies of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and their Ornaments.</head>
               <p>WE are now to re-aſſume our former diſcourſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Florida</hi> to the <hi>Caribby-Iſlands,</hi> to conſider there, with all the exactneſs imaginable, what concerns thoſe Inhabitants thereof on whom we intend to beſtow the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of this Hiſtory, and particularly what relates to their Bodies, Minds, Diſpoſitions, Manners, Religion, Cuſtoms, and other remarkable occurrences concerning the ſavage <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> or <hi>Cannibals,</hi> of whoſe origine we have already given ſo large an account.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> who inhabit in the ſame Iſlands wherein the <hi>French</hi> and other <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations have planted <hi>Colonies,</hi> or at leaſt come often among them, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves in many things to their manner of life, and that they may be the more kindly received by them, they quit many of their old Cuſtoms; thoſe who are deſirous to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ancient manners of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> are not to learn them of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> who live in <hi>Martinico,</hi> or thoſe who converſe moſt with the <hi>Europaeans;</hi> but from thoſe of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> who of all others have held leaſt correſpondence with any Forreigners: It is accordingly from them that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd what we ſhall hereafter relate concerning the <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> But before we enter into the relation, we ſhall make ſome general obſervations, to prevent the aſtoniſhment which the Reader might conceive at the difference there is between the account we give of them, and what he may receive from others, either by word of mouth or writing.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, it is to be acknowledged a thing almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that the Relations of Countries and Cuſtoms at ſo great a diſtance from us, ſhould agree in all things, eſpecially ſince we find that thoſe of neighbouring Countries are for the moſt part differing among themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is to be obſerved, that ſince the <hi>Caribbians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came familiar, and have converſed with forreign Nations, they have remitted much of their ancient Cuſtoms, and quited many
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58704:139"/>
things which they practis'd before with an inviolable ſtrictneſs: So that there may be ſeen in them now a remarkable change from what they were heretofore: That the caſe ſtands thus with them now, is to be attributed partly to the converſation of the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> who in ſome things have oblig'd them to abate ſomewhat of their originary ſimplicity, and in others have made them worſe than they were, as to our own ſhame we cannot but acknowledge: Hence it comes that Monſieur <hi>du Montel</hi> tells us in his Relations, that two ancient <hi>Caribbians,</hi> conſidering that degeneration of their Country-men, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to entertain him with a diſcourſe to this purpoſe: <q>Our people are become in a manner like yours, ſince they came to be acquainted with you; and we find it ſome difficulty to know our ſelves, ſo different are we grown from what we have been heretofore: It is to this alteration that our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple attribute the more frequent happening of <hi>Hurricanes</hi> than they were obſerv'd to be in the days of old; and conclude thence, that <hi>Maboya</hi> (that is to ſay, the evil ſpirit) hath reduc'd us under the power of the <hi>French, Engliſh, Spaniards</hi> and others, who have driven us out of the beſt part of our Country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is poſſible they may have different Cuſtoms, according to the diverſity of the Iſlands, though they all make up but one people; as may be obſerved in the diverſity of the Cuſtoms of one and the ſame Kingdom, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Quarters and Provinces of it: Whence it may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, for example, that thoſe that have converſed moſt at <hi>Dominico</hi> will give an account of the Opinions, Cuſtoms, and Ceremonies of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> much different from what ſhall be related thereof by thoſe perſons who ſhall have frequented other places; and yet the Relations of either ſide ſhall be true.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as in the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who inhabit a good way within the Country, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeldom ſee any forreigners, retain much more of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cuſtoms, and their old courſe of life, than thoſe who living neer the <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonies of <hi>Cayenna</hi> and <hi>Berbica,</hi> drive on an ordinary trade with the Chriſtians; ſo among our <hi>Caribbians,</hi> the Inhabitants of the Iſlands, thoſe who converſe leaſt with the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> ſuch as are thoſe of St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s, are more ſtrict obſervers of their ancient courſe of life, than are, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thoſe of <hi>Martinico</hi> or <hi>Dominico,</hi> who are oftner ſeen among them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, thence it proceeds that thoſe perſons who have ſeen them only in theſe laſt mentioned places, or have heard of them only from ſuch as have been acquainted with them only in thoſe places, will haply find many things in the proſecution of our Hiſtory, which may claſh with the Relations they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them from others; which if they do, they are not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58704:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereat, ſince moſt of our Obſervations relate to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> of St. <hi>Vincents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, we deſire our Readers to take this further adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, that it is our deſign to give a deſcription of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Manners and Cuſtoms of theſe <hi>Caribbians,</hi> to the end that no body may think it ſtrange, if their preſent demeanour be not in all things anſwerable thereto: Theſe advertiſements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus premis'd, we proceed to give the Reader ſatisfaction conſequently to the title of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Moſt of thoſe people whom we call <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Savages,</hi> have ſome thing hideous and deformed or defective, either in their Countenances or ſome other part of the body, as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians affirm of the <hi>Maldiveſes,</hi> the Inhabitants about the <hi>Magellane ſtreights,</hi> and ſeveral others which we need not name here.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Caribbians</hi> are a handſome well-ſhap'd people, well proportion'd in all parts of their bodies, gracefull enough, of a ſmiling countenance, middle ſtature, having broad ſhoulders, and large buttocks, and they are moſt of them in good plight, and ſtronger than the <hi>French:</hi> Their mouths are not over large, and their teeth are perfectly white and cloſe: True it is their complexion is naturally of an Olive-colour, and that colour ſpreads even into the whites of their Eyes, which are black, ſomewhat little like thoſe of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> but very piercing: Their foreheads and noſes are flat, not naturally, but by artifice: For their mothers cruſh them down at their birth, as alſo continually during the time they ſuckle them, imagining it a kind of beauty and perfection; for were it not for that, their noſes would be well ſhap'd, and they would have high foreheads as well as we: They have large and thick feet, becauſe they go barefoot, but they are withall ſo hard, that they defie Woods and Rocks.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe of the Country a man cannot meet with any wanting either one or both eyes, lame, crook-back'd, or bald, or having any other deformity naturally; as is in like manner affirmed of the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> the <hi>Floridians,</hi> and moſt Nations of<note place="margin">De Lery c. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>America;</hi> whereas thoſe who have walked through <hi>Grand</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Voyage de Breves.</note> 
                  <hi>Cairo</hi> relate, That in the Streets they have met with many one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed, and many ſtark blind people; thoſe infirmities being ſo frequent and ſo popular in that Country, that of ten perſons five or ſix are ſubject thereto: But if any among the <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are thus deformed, or have loſt, or are maimed in any limb, it hapned in ſome Engagement againſt their Enemies; and ſo thoſe ſcars or deformities being ſo many demonſtrations of their Valour, they glory in them; ſo far are they from being in any danger of miſchief, or being caſt into a furnace by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, as thoſe poor Children were among the people of <hi>Guyana,</hi> and among the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in the time of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:58704:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who came out of their Mothers wombs imperfect and deformed. Nay, there are ſome handſom Maids and Women amongſt the Savage <hi>Caribbians,</hi> witneſs <hi>Madamoiſelle de Roſselan,</hi> wife to the Governour of <hi>Saintalouſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the <hi>Caribbians</hi> are black-hair'd, as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are, who<note place="margin">Trigaut. Hiſt. Chin. l. 1. c. 8.</note> for that reaſon are ſometimes call'd the <hi>Black-hair'd</hi> People: The hair of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> is not curl'd or frizzled, as that of the <hi>Moors,</hi> but ſtreight and long, as thoſe of the <hi>Maldiveſes:</hi> And the Women attribute the higheſt perfection of Beauty to this black colour, as to what concerns the hair. It is reported<note place="margin">Garcilaſſo, l. 8. c. 13.</note> alſo, That the <hi>Indian</hi> Women of <hi>Peru</hi> are ſo enamour'd of black hair, that to make their own of that colour by artifice, when Nature does it not, they are willing to endure incredible pains and torments: On the contrary, in <hi>Spain</hi> many Ladies, to make their hair ſeem to be of a golden yellow colour, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume it with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> ſteep it in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and expoſe it to the Sun in the heat of the day, nay in the very Dog-days: And in <hi>Italy</hi> the ſame colour is much affected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> are very careful in combing themſelves, and they think it commendable ſo to do: They anoint their hair with Oil, and have certain Receipts to advance the growth thereof: The Women commonly comb their Husbands and their Children: Both Men and Women tie up their hair to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hinder part of the head, winding it about ſo as that it ſtands up like a horn on the Crown; on both ſides they leave locks hanging down like ſo many Muſtachioes, according to natural liberty. The Women part their hair ſo as that it falls down on both ſides of their heads; but the men part theirs the quite contrary way, ſo as that one half falls down behind, the other before, which obliges them to cut off the fore-part of it, otherwiſe it would fall down over their eyes: This they did heretofore with certain ſharp Herbs, before they had the uſe of Sciſſers; not to mention, that they were alſo accuſtomed to cut off their hair when they were in mourning; whereas on the contrary, in <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> the Men never cut off their hair, but the Women ſhave it clear off; a cuſtom contrary to that of thoſe people among whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> liv'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> ſeem not to have any Beards at all, but as ſoon as they grow they pluck them off by the roots, as the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Carpin in Bergeron.</note> the <hi>Cumaneſes,</hi> and certain Nations ſubject to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Tartars</hi> do, who have always an iron inſtrument in their hands, wherewith they pluck out the hair of their Beards as ſoon as they come out: But the <hi>Caribbians</hi> are ſeldom ſeen to put themſelves to that trouble, inſomuch that it is conceiv'd they have a ſecret to prevent the growth of hair when it is once gotten off; an invention which would have been of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to the ancient <hi>Romans:</hi> For it is affirm'd, that they would not ſuffer their Beards to grow till after the time of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58704:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> who firſt ſuffer'd his to grow; before that time it was thought among them ſo honourable a thing to wear no beard, that there was a prohibition made that Slaves ſhould not ſhave theirs: The ſame prohibition extended alſo to all perſons charg'd with any Crime, as it were to ſet a mark of infamy on them, till ſuch time as they were clear'd, as <hi>Aul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <note place="margin">L. 3. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Gellius</hi> affirms; which proceeding was contrary to what is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Territories, who cauſes the Beard to be ſhaven, as a mark of ignominy: In the year One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred fifty two, that hapned to the <hi>French</hi> Conſul at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being charg'd with having done ſome unhandſom things in his Employment; his Beard had ſuch a natural graceful curl, and was of ſo fair a flaxen colour, that ſome Turks would have given him a conſiderable ſum of money for it, and kept it for a Rarity; but he choſe rather to bring it along with him into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> wonder very much to ſee our <hi>Europeans</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Beards to grow ſo long, and think it a great defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to wear any, as they account it a perfection in themſelves to have none; but they are not the only Savages who are fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick in matter of gracefulneſs and beauty: All barbarous Nations, nay ſome that are civiliz'd, are wedded to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſentiments, as to that point: For inſtance, among the<note place="margin">This is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be cited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Maldiveſes</hi> it is accounted an accompliſhment of Beauty to have the body all over hairy, which among us would be thought more becoming a Bear then a Man: Among the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> to have a little narrow forehead, and that full of hair: Among the <hi>Japoneſes,</hi> not to have any hair at all; whence it comes, that they are ever employ'd in the plucking of it off, leaving only a little tuft on the crown of the head: Among the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Women it is thought a piece of Beauty to be flat-nos'd, but to heighten the attractions of their noſes, they rub them with a very black unguent: Among the Inhabitants of <hi>Guinny</hi> they make the ſame account of great nails and flat noſes; and thence it comes that aſſoon as the children are come into the world, they cruſh down their noſes with their thumbs, as do alſo the <hi>Braſilians:</hi> Among thoſe of the Province of <hi>Cuſco</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and ſome oriental Inhabitants of the <hi>Indies,</hi> as alſo among the <hi>Calecutians,</hi> and the <hi>Malabars,</hi> it is thought very graceful to have extraordinary large ears, hanging down over their ſhoulders; inſomuch that ſome among them uſe divers artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make them ſuch: Among the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> great lips and a skin black as Jet, are thought beautiful: The Negroes of <hi>Mosambico</hi> are extreamly pleas'd to have their teeth very ſharp, ſo that ſome uſe Files to make them ſuch: Among the <hi>Maldiveſes</hi> they are no leſs deſirous to have them red, and to that end, they are continually chewing of <hi>Petel:</hi> Among the <hi>Japoneſes</hi> and the <hi>Cumaneſes,</hi> they are induſtrious to have
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58704:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them black, and they purpoſely make them ſuch: And among the latter, it is accounted beauty to have a long face, lean cheeks, and exceſſively big legs: And hence it is that they ſqueeze the heads of their children between two cuſhions as ſoon as they are born, and that after the example of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants about the River of <hi>Eſſequebe,</hi> they bind the legs very hard a little below the knee, and a little above the ankle, that ſo the calf may ſwell: Among ſome <hi>Peruvians,</hi> to have the face cut and chequer'd, as it were with Lancets, and to have flat and broad heads, huge foreheads, and the head very narrow from the forehead to the nape of the neck, is accounted beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful: And to reduce it to this comely ſhape, they kept their childrens heads preſs'd between two thin boards, from the time of their birth till they were four or five year old. To be ſhort, among ſome oriental Nations, and ſome <hi>Africans,</hi> it is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great perfection in the Women, to have their breaſts hanging down over their ſhoulders; and among the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> it is the principal part of beauty to have the foot extreamly little and thin; and the better to have it ſo, while they are yet children they bind their feet ſo hard, that they are in a manner lam'd, and it is with much ado that they are able to ſtand: It were a hard matter to make a deſcription of beauty, according to the different opinions of all theſe nations: But to return to the <hi>Caribbians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They go ſtark-naked, both men and women, as many other Nations do: And if any one among them ſhould endeavour to hide the privy parts, all the reſt would laugh at it: Though the Chriſtians have converſed very much among them, yet have all the perſwaſions that have hitherto been uſed to induce them to cover themſelves been to no purpoſe: And whereas ſometimes, when they come to viſit the Chriſtians, or to treat with them, they have comply'd ſo far with them, as to cover themſelves, by putting on a ſhirt, drawers, a hat, and ſuch cloaths as had been given them, yet aſſoon as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to their own habitations, they ſtrip themſelves, and put up all in their Cloſets, till ſome ſuch other occaſion ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to put them on again: To requite this compliance of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> ſome among the <hi>French,</hi> having occaſion to go among them, made no difficulty to ſtrip themſelves after their example: This defiance of cloaths reigns in all places under the Torrid Zone, as every one knows.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Braſilians</hi> are reproach'd with their nakedneſs,<note place="margin">Vin. Le Blanc. par. 3. c. 16.</note> they reply, that we came naked into the world, and that it were a mad thing for us to hide the bodies beſtowed on us by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Inhabitants of the Kingdom of <hi>Benin</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dutch Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> are to be commended, that they cover themſelves when they are to be married, and would do it ſooner if their King would permit it: The women of the <hi>Lucayan</hi> Iſlands ought alſo to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58704:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
participate of that commendation, for they were wont to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves when they came to be marriageable, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized that action with great rejoicing: But now that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is abrogated, for that poor Nation hath been utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or carryed away and made ſlaves to work in the Mines, and there are not in any of the Iſlands known under that name, any of the natural Inhabitants, but only ſome few <hi>Engliſh</hi> who were tranſported thither out of the Iſland of <hi>Bermudez.</hi> But come we to the Ornaments of our Savages.</p>
               <p>They change their natural colour by dying their bodies with ſome compoſition which makes them red all over: For living neer Rivers and Springs, the firſt thing they do every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to go and waſh themſelves all over: And this was the<note place="margin">Lib. de mor. German.</note> practice of the ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirms. Aſſoon as the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have waſh'd themſelves, they return to their houſes, and drie themſelves by a little fire; being dry'd, the Wife, or ſome one of the houſhold takes a gourd full of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain red compoſition which they call <hi>Roucou,</hi> from the name of the tree which produces it, and whereof we have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in its proper place in the precedent Book: With this colour mixt with oil, they rub the whole body and the face; the better to apply this paint, they make uſe of a ſpunge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Pencil; and to appear more gallant, they many times make black circles about the eyes, with the juice of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipa</hi> Apples.</p>
               <p>This red painting ſerves them both for Ornament and for a Covering; for beſides the Beauty they imagine to themſelves therein, they affirm that it makes them more ſupple and active; which may be the more likely to be true, for that the ancient Wreſtlers were wont to rub themſelves with oil for the ſame end: They affirm further, That by rubbing themſelves thus with <hi>Roucou,</hi> they ſecure themſelves againſt the coldneſs of the night and rains, the ſtinging of the <hi>Meſquitos</hi> and the <hi>Marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goins,</hi> and the heat of the Sun, which otherwiſe would cauſe riſings and ulcers in the skin. This Unction hardens their skins, and withal gives it an extraordinary luſtre and ſmoothneſs, as all know who have ſeen and felt them.</p>
               <p>Moſt Savages do thus paint and trick up themſelves after a ſtrange manner; but they do not all uſe the ſame colours, nor obſerve the ſame faſhion: For there are ſome who paint their Bodies all red, as our Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> do; as for<note place="margin">This is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> inſtance, thoſe of the <hi>Cape de Lopes Gonſalvez;</hi> but others make uſe of other colours, as Black, White, Cheſtnut, Gingioline, Blew; Yellow, and the like. Some uſe only one particular co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; others paint themſelves with ſeveral colours, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent divers figures on their bodies: Some others, without apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any colour, rub themſelves all over with the oil of Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees:
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58704:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Some anoint themſelves with the oil of Balm, and then caſt on it a ſmall powder, which ſeems as if it were the filings of Gold. In fine, there are ſome who anoint their bodies with a glewy oil, and blow on that the downe or ſmalleſt Feathers of divers Birds; or haply they cover themſelves with a kind of gummy paſte, which is of a very ſweet ſcent, and faſten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt delightful Flowers growing in their Country. There is ſufficient choice of all theſe modes; and it were a pleaſant ſight to ſee a company of theſe Morris-dancers dancing together. We might add thereto, to make the divertiſement the more compleat, thoſe <hi>Turkiſh Pilgrims</hi> who commonly go in long Garments made of thouſands of pieces of all ſorts of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>But this is to be noted, That the painting of the body is a very ancient kind of Ornament; and among other Monuments of this piece of Antiquity, <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Herodian</hi> affirm, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">Lib. 22. c. 1. In the life of Severus.</note> people of <hi>Great Brittany,</hi> not uſing any kind of cloathing, painted their bodies with divers colours, and repreſented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the figures of certain living Creatures, whence they were called <hi>Picti,</hi> that is, Painted people. But among all the Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges who at this day paint themſelves, the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have this advantage, that they adorn themſelves with a colour which the Ancients honour'd moſt of any; for it is reported, that the <hi>Goths</hi> made uſe of Vermilion to make their faces red; and the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms, painted their bodies with<note place="margin">Lib 33. c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Minium</hi> upon the day of their Triumph; and he particularly tells us that <hi>Camillus</hi> did ſo: and he further adds, that upon Feſtival days they ſo painted the face of the Statue of their <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and that heretofore the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> made ſo great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Vermilion colour, that their principal Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd it all over their bodies, and that their Gods wore it in their Images.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Caribbians</hi> do for the moſt part content themſelves with this ordinary dreſs of red painting, which ſerves them inſtead of Shirts, Cloths, Cloaks and Coats: But on ſolemn days and times of publick rejoicing, they add to the red divers other colours, ſpreading them fantaſticallly over the face and the whole body.</p>
               <p>But this kind of painting is not the only ornament in uſe among them; they adorn the crown of the head with a little Hat made of birds feathers, of different colours, or with a Plume of <hi>Herons</hi> feathers, or thoſe of ſome other Bird: They alſo ſometimes wear a crown of feathers, which covers their heads, ſo that there may be ſeen among them a great many crowned heads, though there be no Kings: And yet they may be better look'd upon as Kings with their feather Crowns, than the Lord of the Gulf of <hi>Antongil</hi> be taken for a Sovereign Prince, when he hath for his Scepter and the badge of his

Royal dignity, but a great Gardiner's Pruning-hook, which he always carries about him.</p>
               <p>The women among the <hi>Maldeveſes,</hi> make about a dozen holes in each ear, at which they faſten little gilt nails, and ſometimes Pearls and Precious Stones: The Ladies of <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar</hi> and <hi>Braſil</hi> make a hole as big as that a man may thruſt his thumb through it in the lower part of the ear, at which they hang pendants of wood and bone: And the <hi>Peruvians,</hi> under the reign of their Kings the <hi>Yncas,</hi> were accuſtomed to make in their ears a hole of an incredible bigneſs, at which they faſtened chains of a quarter of an Ell in length, with Pendants of Gold at the bottom, of an extraordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But our <hi>Caribbians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> are content with a ſmall hole, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>European</hi> mode, in the ſofteſt part of the ear, through which they put the bones of certain Fiſhes very ſmooth, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that kind of <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> ſhells which they call <hi>Carets;</hi> and ſince the Chriſtians came among them, Buckles of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Latten, at which they hang very fair Pendants: They know how to diſtinguiſh between thoſe that are right and the counterfeit, but they are moſt taken with ſuch as are made of Chryſtal, Amber, Coral, or ſome other rich material, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the buckle, and all the other workmanſhip be of Gold: Some have endeavoured to put upon them ſuch as were only Copper gilt, and would have perſwaded them they were Gold; but they refuſed them, ſaying that they intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and that it was but <hi>Kettle-gold:</hi> and to make a tryal thereof, they were wont to put them into their mouths: So great is their experience in theſe things beyond thoſe of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> who when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> coming thither in the year MDC XLV. offered them a Silver-ſpoon, put it between their teeth, and finding it was hard refus'd it, deſiring one of Tin: Whence it may eaſily be imagined what account they made of Tin, ſince they gave a young maid in exchange for a Spoon of that mettal. <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirms that heretofore among the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> Copper was in better eſteem than Gold, the uſe whereof was ſo vile, that they bound Malefactors with chains of Gold.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> do ſometimes alſo make holes through their lips, and put through them a kind of little Bodkin, which is made of the bone of ſome beaſt or fiſh: Nay they bore through the ſpace between the Noſtrils, that they may hang there ſome Ring, a grain of Chryſtal, or ſome ſuch toy: The necks and arms of our <hi>Caribbians</hi> have alſo their reſpective ornaments; for they have their Neck-laces and Bracelets of Amber, Coral, or ſome other glittering material: The men wear Bracelets on the brawny part of the arm, neer the ſhoulder; but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wear theirs about the wriſts: They adorn alſo their legs with Chains of <hi>Raſſada,</hi> inſtead of Garters: Thoſe among
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58704:143"/>
them who have no acquaintance with the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> commonly wear about their necks Whiſtles made of the bones of their enemies, and great chains made of the teeth of <hi>Agoutys,</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, wild Cats, or little ſhells bor'd through and faſten'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a thread of fine Cotton of a red or violet colour. And when they would make the greateſt ſhow they can, they add to all this a kind of Caps, certain Bracelets, which they faſten under their armpits, Scarfs, and Girdles of Feathers ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry induſtriouſly diſpos'd together by a delightful intermixture, which they ſuffer to hang down over their ſhoulders, or from the navel to the middle of the thigh.</p>
               <p>But the moſt conſiderable of all their Ornaments, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain large Medals of fine Copper extreamly well poliſhed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any graving on them, which are made after the figure of a creſcent, and enchac'd in ſome kind of ſolid and precious wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe in their own language they call <hi>Caracolis:</hi> They are of different largeneſs, for there are ſome ſo ſmall that they hang them at their ears like Pendants, and others about the bigneſs of the palm of a mans hand, which they have hanging about their necks, beating on their breaſts: They have a great eſteem for theſe <hi>Caracolis,</hi> aſwell by reaſon the material whereof they are made, which never contracts any ruſt, gliſters like Gold, as that it is the rareſt and moſt precious booty they get in the incurſions they make every year into the Country of the <hi>Arou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agues</hi> their Enemies; and that it is the livery or badge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Captains and their Children are diſtinguiſh'd from the ordinary ſort of people: Accordingly thoſe who have any of theſe jewels make ſo great account of them, that when they die, they have no other inheritance to leave their Children and intimate Friends: Nay there are ſome among them who have of theſe <hi>Caracolis</hi> which had been their Grandfathers, wherewith they do not adorn themſelves but on extraordinary occaſions.</p>
               <p>The women paint the whole body, and adorn themſelves much after the ſame manner as the men do, excepting only thoſe differences we have mentioned before, and that they wear no Crowns on their heads: There is this alſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſervable in them, that they wear a kind of buskins, which fall no lower than the ankle: This kind of ornament is very neatly wrought, and edg'd above and below with a certain intertexture of ruſhes and cotton, which lying ſtreight on the calf of the leg makes it ſeem more full.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Certain Remarks upon the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Language.</head>
               <p>IT is our intention at the end of this Hiſtory, for the ſatisfaction of the more curious Reader, to add a large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulary of the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Language; and therefore, in this Chapter, we ſhall only make ſome principal remarks upon it, ſuch as may in ſome meaſure diſcover the grace, the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the proprieties thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Caribbians</hi> have an ancient and natural Language, ſuch as is wholly peculiar to them, as every Nation hath that which is proper to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But beſides that ancient Language, they have fram'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baſtard-ſpeech, which is intermixt with ſeveral words taken out of forreign Languages, by the commerce they have had with the <hi>Europaeans:</hi> But above all they have borrowed many words of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for they were the firſt Chriſtians that came among them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Among themſelves, they alwaies make uſe of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and natural Language.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But when they have occaſion to converſe or negotiate with the Chriſtians, they always make uſe of their corrupt Language.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſides that, they have alſo a very pleaſant intermixture of words and expreſſions when they would undertake to ſpeak in ſome forreign Language: As for example, when they uſe this expreſſion to the <hi>French,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Compere Governeur,</hi> that is, Goſſip Governour, uſing the word <hi>Compere</hi> generally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all thoſe who are their Friends or Allies: In like manner they would ſay, without any more ceremony, <hi>Compere Roy,</hi> that is, Goſſip, or Friend King, if there were any occaſion to do it: It is alſo one of their ordinary complements to the <hi>French,</hi> when they ſay with ſmiling countenance, <hi>Ah ſi toy bon pour Caraibe, moy bon pour France, If thou art good for the</hi> Caribbian, <hi>I am good for</hi> France: And when they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and expreſs how much they are ſatisfy'd with thoſe of the ſame Nation, they ſay, <hi>Mouche bon France pour Caraibe,</hi> France <hi>is very good for the</hi> Caribbian; they ſay alſo, <hi>Maboya mouche fache contre Caraibe,</hi> Maboya <hi>doth much againſt the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbian, when it thunders, or in a Hurricane; and, <hi>Moy mouche Lunes, I have lived many Moons,</hi> to ſignifie that they are very ancient: They have alſo theſe words often in their mouths, when they find that the <hi>French</hi> would abuſe their ſimplicity, <hi>Compere, toy trompe Caraibe, Friend thou deceiveſt the</hi> Caribbian:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58704:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And they are often heard to ſay when they are in a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <hi>Moy bonne Caraibe, I am an honeſt</hi> Caribbian.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet is it to be obſerv'd, that though the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of all the Iſlands do generally nnderſtand one another, yet is there in ſeveral of them ſome dialect different from that of the others.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is no great uſe made of the letter <hi>P.</hi> in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but that only excepted, there is no want of letters, as there is in the Language of <hi>Japan, Braſeel</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> which want the letters <hi>F. L. R.</hi> Or in that of <hi>Peru,</hi> wherein <hi>B. D. F. G. J.</hi> conſonant and <hi>X</hi> are wanting, as Hiſtorians affirm.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Language of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> is extreamly ſmooth, and for the moſt part pronounced with the lips, ſome few words with the teeth, and in a manner nothing at all from the throat. For though the words we ſhall ſet down hereafter, ſeem to be rough, as they are written, yet when they pronounce them, they make eliſions of certain letters, and give ſuch an air thereto as renders their diſcourſe very delightful to the ear: Whence it came, that <hi>Monſieur du Montel</hi> hath given this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of them: <q>I took great pleaſure, ſaid he, in hearkning unto them when I was among them, and I could not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire the grace, the fluency, and the ſweetneſs of their pronunciation, which they commonly accompany with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſmiling, ſuch as takes very much with thoſe who converſe with them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The <hi>Caribbians</hi> who are Inhabitants of the Iſlands have a ſweeter pronunciation than thoſe of the Continent: but otherwiſe they differ only in a dialect.</p>
               <p n="10">10. By the ſame word, according as it is diverſly pronounced they ſignifie ſeveral things: For example, the word <hi>Anhan</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, 1. <hi>Yes,</hi> 2. <hi>I know not,</hi> 3. <hi>Thine,</hi> or <hi>take it,</hi> according to the pronunciation that is given it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The <hi>Europaeans</hi> cannot pronounce the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with the grace and fluency natural thereto, unleſs they have learnt it very young.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They hear one another very patiently, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt one the other in their diſcourſe: But they are wont to give a little hem at the end of every three or four periods, to expreſs the ſatisfaction they have to hear what is ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="13">13. What advantage ſoever the <hi>Europaeans</hi> may imagine they have over the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> either as to the natural faculties of the mind, or the eaſineſs of pronunciation of their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, in order to the more eaſie attainment of theirs, yet hath it been found by experience, that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> do ſooner learn ours than we do theirs.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Some among the <hi>French</hi> have obſerv'd, that the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> have a kind of averſion for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, nay ſo far, that ſome affirm they cannot endure to hear it ſpoken
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58704:144"/>
where they are, becauſe they look on them as their Enemies. And whereas there are in their corrupt Language many words taken out of the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> a people whom they alſo account their Enemies, it proceeds hence, that they learn'd them during the time they held a fair correſpondence with that Nation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they began to treat them as they afterwards did.</p>
               <p n="15">15. They are very ſhie in communicating their Language, out of a fear the ſecrets of their Wars might be diſcovered; nay, thoſe among them who have embrac'd the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, would not be perſwaded to reveal the grounds of their Language, out of a belief it might prejudice their Nation.</p>
               <p n="16">16. We ſhall here ſet down ſome of the moſt particular proprieties of their Language: In the firſt place, the men have many expreſſions proper only to themſelves, which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men underſtand well enough, but never pronounce: And the women have alſo their words and phraſes, which if the men ſhould uſe they would be laugh'd at; whence it comes, that in this Diſcourſe one would think the women ſpoke a Language dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of the men, as will be ſeen in our Vocabulary, by the difference of expreſſions which the men and women make uſe of to ſignifie the ſame thing: The Savages of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico</hi> affirm, that it proceeds hence, that when the <hi>Caribbians</hi> came to inhabit theſe Iſlands, they were poſſeſs'd by a Nation of the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> whom they abſolutely deſtroy'd, ſave only the Women, whom they married for the re-peopling of the Country; ſo that thoſe Women having retain'd their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, taught it their Daughters, and brought them to ſpeak as they did; which being practis'd to the preſent by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers towards their Daughters, their Language came to be different from that of the Men in many things: But the male Children, though they underſtand the ſpeech of their Mothers and Siſters, do nevertheleſs imitate their Fathers and Brethren, and accuſtom themſelves to their Language when they are five or ſix years old. To confirm what we have ſaid concerning the cauſe of this difference of Language, it is alledg'd, That there is ſome conformity between the Language of the <hi>Aroua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> who live in the Continent, and that of the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: But it is to be obſerv'd, That the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, as well Men as Women, ſpeak the ſame Language, as having not corrupted it by inter-marriages with ſtrange Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The old men have alſo ſome terms particular to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and certain affected expreſſions, not at all us'd by the younger ſort of people.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The <hi>Caribbians</hi> have alſo a certain Language which they make uſe of only among themſelves, when they entertain any warlike Reſolutions; it is a very hard kind of fuſtian-language: The Women and Maids know nothing of that myſterious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58704:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor yet the young Men, till they have given ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of their generoſity, and the zeal they have for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Quarrel of their Nation againſt their Enemies: This is to prevent the diſcovery of their deſigns before the appointed time.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For the variation of their Caſes, Perſons, Moods, and Genders, they have no diſtinct particles as we have, but they lengthen their words by certain ſyllables or letters at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or end of the word, and ſometimes by the change of the letters: Thus they ſay in the Imperative, <hi>Bayoubaka, Go;</hi> but in the Indicative, <hi>Nayoubakayem,</hi> I go: In like manner, <hi>Babinaka,</hi> dance; <hi>Nabinakayem,</hi> I dance; much like the formation of the Hebrew Verbs.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Indefinite and abſolute Nouns are not much in uſe among them, eſpecially the names of the parts of the body; but they are always in a manner reſtrain'd to a firſt, ſecond, or third perſon.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The firſt perſon is commonly expreſs'd by the Letter N; at the beginning of a word, as <hi>Nichic, my Head;</hi> the ſecond by a B, as <hi>Bichic, thy Head;</hi> and the third by an L, as <hi>Lichic, his Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. The neuter and abſolute Gender is expreſs'd by a T, as <hi>Tichic, the Head;</hi> but this is not much in uſe.</p>
               <p n="23">23. They have different names in ſpeaking to perſons when they are preſent, and others when they ſpeak of them; thus they ſay <hi>Baba,</hi> Father, ſpeaking to him, and <hi>Youmaan,</hi> ſpeaking of him; <hi>Bibi,</hi> Mother, ſpeaking to her, and <hi>Ichanum,</hi> ſpeaking of her; which, with the difference there is between the Language of the Men and the Women, the young and the old, their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Diſcourſe, and that us'd by them when they are engag'd in Military Deliberations, muſt needs cauſe a great multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of words in their Language.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Their proper Names are many times deriv'd from certain Accidents, as we ſhall ſee more particularly in the Chapter of the Birth and Education of their Children.</p>
               <p n="25">25. They never name any one when the party is preſent; or at leaſt, out of reſpect, they do but half name him.</p>
               <p n="26">26. They never pronounce the whole Name of either Man or Woman; but they do thoſe of Children; ſo that they will ſay, the Father or Mother of ſuch a one; or elſe they ſay half the Name; as for inſtance, <hi>Mala,</hi> inſteed of ſaying <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaali,</hi> and <hi>Hiba</hi> for <hi>Hibalomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. The Uncles and Aunts, as many as are of the collateral Line, are called Fathers and Mothers by their Nephews; ſo that the Uncle is called <hi>Baba,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Father:</hi> But when they would expreſly ſignifie the true and proper Father, they many times add another word, ſaying, <hi>Baba tinnaca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. Conſequently to the precedent appellation, all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Couſins
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58704:145"/>
are alſo called Brothers, and all the She-Couſins, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p n="29">29. But between He-Couſin and She-Couſin, the former calls the latter <hi>Youëilleri,</hi> that is to ſay properly, <hi>My Female,</hi> or my betrothed; for naturally among them the She-Couſins become Wiyes to the He-Couſins.</p>
               <p n="30">30. The Months they call <hi>Lunes,</hi> that is, <hi>Moons;</hi> and the Years <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ouſſinieres,</hi> that is, the <hi>Seven Stars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31. We ſhall now give a taſte of the naturalneſs and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of their Language, ſetting down the ſignification of their words, without expreſſing the words themſelves, ſo to avoid the ſetting of them down twice, as reſerving that for our Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulary.</p>
               <p n="32">32. To ſignifie, that a thing is <hi>lost</hi> or <hi>broken,</hi> they commonly ſay it is <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">33. They call a <hi>Capuchin</hi> Friar, Father <hi>Aïoupa;</hi> and the word <hi>Aïoupa</hi> ſignifies in their Language a <hi>Covering</hi> or a <hi>Penthouſe;</hi> as if they ſaid, It is a man by whom one may be cover'd, by reaſon of his great <hi>Capouche:</hi> By the ſame name they alſo ironically call an Ape or Monkey, by reaſon of his long Beard.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Diſpoſitions of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and their Manners.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Caribbians</hi> are naturally of a penſive and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temperament, fiſhing, ſloth, and the temperature of the air contributing much to the continuance of that humour: but having found by experience, that that uncomfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was prejudicial to their health, and that the mind ore-preſs'd dries up the bones, they for the moſt part do ſo great violence to their natural inclination, that they appear chearful, pleaſant, and divertive in their converſation, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they have got a little wine in their heads: Nay they have brought themſelves to ſuch a paſs, that, as the <hi>Braſilians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Lery c. 12</note> they can hardly endure the company of ſuch as are melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and thoſe who have converſed much with them have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies found them very facetious, and loth to let ſlip any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of laughing, without making their advantage of it: nay ſometimes they have burſt out into laughter, at what the moſt inclin'd thereto among us would hardly have ſmil'd.</p>
               <p>Their diſcourſes among themſelves are commonly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hunting, their fiſhing, their gardening, or ſome other innocent ſubjects; and when they are in ſtrange company, they are never troubled if any body laugh in their preſence, ſo far are they from thinking it done as any affront to them: And yet, they are ſo far from the ſimplicity of a certain Nation of <hi>New-France,</hi> who acknowledge themſelves to be <hi>Savages,</hi> not knowing what that denomination ſignifies, that they think themſelves highly injur'd when any one gives them that name:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:58704:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for they underſtand what the word means, and ſay that term belongs only to the wild beaſts, the Inhabitants of the woods: Nor do they take it well to be called <hi>Cannibals,</hi> though they eat the fleſh of their Enemies, which they ſay they do to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their indignation and revenge, and not out of any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy they find in it more than in any thing elſe whereby they are ſuſtain'd: But they are extreamly pleas'd when any one calls them <hi>Caribbians,</hi> becauſe it is a name they pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much in, as being a certain acknowledgment of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and courage: For they are not only the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> from amongſt whom they came, who by that word ſignifie a <hi>Warlike and valiant man,</hi> endu'd with force and a particular dexterity in military affairs; but even the <hi>Aronagnes</hi> themſelves their irreconcileable Enemies, having often experienc'd their valour, underſtand thereby the ſame thing, though by the ſame word they would alſo denote a <hi>Cruel perſon,</hi> by reaſon of the miſeries the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have occaſioned them. But howere it be, this is certain, that our Savages of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> are ſo much pleaſed with that name, that ſpeaking to the <hi>French</hi> they have this perpetually in their mouths, <hi>Toy Francois, moy Caraibe, Thou art a</hi> French-man, <hi>I am a</hi> Caribbian.</p>
               <p>In all other things they are of a good and tractable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they are ſo great Enemies to ſeverity, that if the <hi>Europaean</hi> or other Nations who have any of them ſlaves (as among others the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſome, cunningly trapan'd and carryed away by them from the places of their birth) treat them with any rigour, they many times die out of pure grief: But by fair means they will do any thing, contrary to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> who muſt be roughly dealt with, otherwiſe they grow inſolent, ſlothful, and perfidious.</p>
               <p>They commonly reproach the <hi>Europaeans</hi> with their avarice, and their immoderate induſtry in getting of wealth together for themſelves and their Children, ſince the earth is able to find ſufficient ſuſtenance for all men, if ſo be they wil take ever ſo little pains to cultivate it: as for themſelves, they ſay they are not perplex'd with caring for thoſe things whereby their lives are preſerv'd; and indeed it muſt be acknowledged, that they are incomparably fatter, and have their health better than thoſe that fare deliciouſly: Moſt certain it is, that they live without ambition, without vexation, without diſquiet, having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of acquiring honours or wealth, ſlighting Gold and Silver, as the ancient <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and the <hi>Peruvians,</hi> and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with what Nature had made them, and what the earth ſupplies them withall for their ſuſtenance: And when they go a hunting, or a fiſhing, or root up trees for ground to make a little Garden, or to build houſes, which are innocent employments, and ſuitable to the nature of man, they do all without eagerneſs, and as it were by way of divertiſement and recreation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:58704:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>But it raiſes a particular aſtoniſhment in them when they ſee how much we eſteem Gold, conſidering we are ſo well furniſh'd with Glaſs and Chryſtal, which in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are more beautiful, and conſequently ought to be more highly prized: To this purpoſe, <hi>Benzoni</hi> a <hi>Milaneſe</hi> Hiſtorian, relates a ſtrange ſtory of the New-world, how that the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> deteſting the inſatiable avarice of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd them, took a piece of Gold in their hands, and ſaid, <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the God of the Chriſtians; for this they come from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteel</hi> into our Country; for this they have made us ſlaves, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd us out of our habitations, and committed horrid things againſt us; for this they are engag'd in wars amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for this they kill one the other; for this they are alwaies in diſquiet, they quarrel, rob, curſe and blaſpheme: In fine, there is no villany, no miſchief but they will commit for this.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, our <hi>Caribbians,</hi> when they ſee the Chriſtians ſad and perplext at any thing, are wont to give them this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reprehenſion: ``<hi>Compere</hi> (a word they have learnt of the <hi>French,</hi> and commonly uſe to expreſs their affection, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do alſo call our <hi>Europaeans Commeres,</hi> as a mark of their friendſhip; both words ſignifying in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goſſip, or familiar friend) <q>how miſerable art thou, thus to expoſe thy perſon to ſuch tedious and dangerous Voyages, and to ſuffer thy ſelf to be orepreſs'd with cares and fears! The inordinate deſire of acquiring wealth puts thee to all this trouble, and all theſe inconveniences; and yet thou art in no leſs diſquiet for the Goods thou haſt already gotten, than for thoſe thou art deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to get: Thou art in continual fear leſt ſome body ſhould rob thee either in thy own Country or upon the Seas, or that thy Commodities ſhould be loſt by ſhipwrack, and devour'd by the waters: Thus thou groweſt old in a ſhort time, thy hair turns gray, thy forehead is wrinkled, a thouſand incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences attend thy body, a thouſand afflictions ſurround thy heart, and thou makeſt all the haſte thou canſt to the grave: Why art thou not content with what thy own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try produces?</q> Why doſt not thou contemn riches as we do?<note place="margin">Part. 3. c. 16.</note> And to this purpoſe, the great Traveller <hi>Vincent le Blanc</hi> hath a remarkable diſcourſe of ſome <hi>Braſilians:</hi> 
                  <q>That wealth which you Chriſtians purſue with ſo much earneſtneſs, do they any way promote your advancement in the grace of God? Do they prevent your dying? Do you carry them along with you to the grave?</q> To the ſame purpoſe was their diſcourſe to <hi>J. de Lery,</hi> as he relates in his Hiſtory.<note place="margin">Ch. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> have this further reproach to make to the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> to wit, that of their uſurpation of their Country, and they ſtick not to do it as a manifeſt injuſtice: <q>Thou haſt driven me, <hi>ſays this poor people,</hi> out of St. <hi>Chriſtophers, Mevis, Montſerrat, St. Martins, Antego, Gardeloupe, Barbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos,</hi>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:58704:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>St. Euſtace's, &amp;c.</hi> neither of which places belonged to thee, and whereto thou couldeſt not make any lawful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: And thou threatneſt me every day to take away that little which is left me: What ſhall become of the poor miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Caribbian?</hi> Muſt he go and live in the Sea with the fiſhes? Thy Country muſt needs be a wretched one, ſince thou leaveſt it to come and take away mine: Or thou muſt needs be full of malice, thus to perſecute me out of a frolick.</q> This complaint may well exempt them from the opprobrious denomination of Savages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycurgus</hi> would not permit his Citizens to travel, out of a fear they might learn the manners of forreign Countries: But our Savages ſtand in need of much travel to unbarbarize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if we may uſe ſuch an expreſſion: And yet they are not only free from that inſatiable covetouſneſs, which makes the Chriſtians undertake ſo great and ſo dangerous voyages, but alſo from the curioſity of ſeeing any other Country in the world, as being enamoured of their own more than any other. And thence it comes, that, imagining we ſhould not be more curious than they are, nor leſs lovers of our Countries, they are aſtoniſh'd at our Voyages; wherein they have the honour to be like <hi>Socrates,</hi> of whom <hi>Plato</hi> gives this teſtimony, that he had no more deſign to leave <hi>Athens,</hi> with any intention to travel, than the lame and the blind; and that he deſired not to ſee other Cities, nor to live under other Laws; being, as to this particular, as far as our <hi>Caribbians,</hi> from the opinion of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> among whom it is come into a Proverb, that he who hath not travell'd the world may be compared to a Bear.</p>
               <p>But we are to note further, that our <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Iſlands have not only an averſion from travelling into any other parts of the world, but they would not alſo willingly ſuffer any of theirs to be carried away into a ſtrange Country, without an abſolute promiſe within a ſhort time to bring them back again: But if it happens through ſome misfortune that any one of them dies by the way, there is no thinking of any return among them, for there is no hope of reconciliation.</p>
               <p>But if they have no curioſity for things at a great diſtance from them, they have much for thoſe that are neerer hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that if a man open a cheſt in their preſence, he muſt ſhew them all that is in it, otherwiſe they will think themſelves diſ-obliged: And if they like any thing of what they ſee therein, though it be of ever ſo little value, they will give the moſt precious thing they have for it, that ſo they may ſatisfie their inclination.</p>
               <p>As concerning Traffick, true it is, that having treated about ſomething, they will fall off from what they have promiſed: But the ſecret to make them ſtand to their bargain, is to tell
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58704:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, that a Merchant ought to be as good as his word: For when they are preſs'd upon in point of honour, and reproached with inconſtancy as if they were children, they are aſhamed of their lightneſs.</p>
               <p>Theft is accounted a great crime amongſt them; wherein it muſt be acknowledged they ſhew themſelves more rational<note place="margin">Pluta. in his Life.</note> than <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who allowed that vice in the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> children, as a very commendable employment, provided they did their buſineſs cleaverly, and Hocus-pocus-like: But the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have ſo natural and ſo great an averſion for that ſin, that there is no ſuch thing found among them, which is very rare among <hi>Savages:</hi> For moſt of them are Theeves; and<note place="margin">Iſlands of Robbers.</note> thence it is that ſome of their Iſlands have their name thence.</p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> as they are are not of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any way inclined to thieving, ſo they live without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt one of another: So that their Houſes and Plantations are left without any body to look to them, though they have neither doors nor incloſures, after the ſame manner as ſome Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians relate of the <hi>Tartars:</hi> But if the leaſt thing in the<note place="margin">Carpins Travels into Tartary.</note> world be taken from them, ſuch as may be a little knife, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they do ſtrange things in Joyner's work, they ſo highly prize what is uſeful to them, that ſuch a loſs is enough to ſet them a weeping, and grieving for the ſpace of eight days after it, nay will engage them in combinations with their friends to get reparations, and to be reveng'd on the perſon whom they ſuſpect guilty of the theft: Accordingly in thoſe Iſlands where they have their habitations neer thoſe of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they have often revenged themſelves of thoſe who had, as they ſaid, taken away any of their little houſhould-ſtuff: And in thoſe places when they find ſomething wanting in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they preſently ſay, <hi>Some Chriſtian hath been here:</hi> And among the grievances and complaints which they make to the Governours of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, this comes alwaies in the front, <hi>Compere Governour, thy Mariners</hi> (ſo they call all the forreign Inhabitants) <hi>have taken away a knife out of my Cot,</hi> or ſome other piece of houſhold-ſtuff of that kind. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Guinny</hi> would not make any ſuch complaints: For if they chance to loſe ſomething, they are of a perſwaſion that ſome of their deceaſed Relations, having occaſion for it in the other world, came and took it away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> are a people as it were aſſociated in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt, and they are of all people the moſt loving one to another; being in that particular far from the humour of thoſe <hi>Aſtaticks</hi> of <hi>Java,</hi> who ſpeak not to their own Brothers without a dagger in their hands, ſo diſtruſtful are they one of another: From this affection which our Savages mutually bear one another, does it proceed that there are few quarrels and animoſities among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:58704:149"/>But if they are once injur'd, either by a Stranger or one of their own Countrymen, they never forgive, but contrive all the waies they can to be revenged: Thus when any of thoſe Impoſters, whom they call <hi>Bogez,</hi> makes them believe that one of thoſe whom they account Sorcerers is author of the miſchief that hath happened to them, they endeavour all they can to kill him, ſaying, <hi>Yaraliatana, he hath bewitched me; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banebouibatina, I will be revenged of him:</hi> And this furious paſſion and deſire to be revenged, is that which makes them ſo brutiſh, as we ſaid before, as to eat the very fleſh of their Enemies, whereof we ſhall give the particulars in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place: This implacable animoſity is the vice generally reigning among them; and it exerciſes the ſame Tyranny, without any exception, over all the Savages of <hi>America:</hi> The revenge of the Inhabitants of <hi>Canada</hi> is ſometimes very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; for they eat their own lice, becauſe they have bitten them: If the <hi>Braſilians</hi> hurt themſelves againſt a ſtone, to be<note place="margin">De Lery c. 11. &amp; 14.</note> revenged they bite it as hard as they can; It is obſerved alſo that they bite the Arrows which light upon them in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Without any obligation to <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or his Laws, the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> by a ſecret law of nature, bear a great reſpect to anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent people, and hear them ſpeak with much attention, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by their geſture, and a little tone of the voice, how much they are pleas'd with their diſcourſes: And in all things the younger ſort comply with the ſentiments of the ancient, and<note place="margin">Linſcot &amp; Semedo.</note> ſubmit to their wills: It is reported they do the ſame in <hi>Braſil</hi> and <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Young men among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have no converſation either with the Maids or married Women: And it hath been obſerved, that the men are leſs amorous in this Country than the women, as they are in ſeveral other places under the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Zone: Both the men and women among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> are naturally chaſt, a quality very rare among Savages: And when thoſe of other Nations look over-earneſtly upon them, and laugh at their nakedneſs, they are wont to ſay to them, <hi>Friends, you are to look on us only between both the eyes;</hi> a vertue worthy admiration in a people that go naked, and are as barbarous as theſe.</p>
               <p>It is related of Captain <hi>Baron,</hi> that in one of the incurſions made by him and his party into the Iſland of <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> then poſſeſt by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he made great waſte in the Plantations that lay neereſt to the Sea, ſo that he carried a great booty, and that among the Priſoners there being a young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Wife to one of the Officers of the Iſland, he cauſed her to be brought to one of his houſes in <hi>Dominico:</hi> this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman being big with child when ſhe was carried away, was very carefully attended during the time of her lying in, by
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58704:149"/>
the Savage women of the ſame Iſland: And though ſhe liv'd there a good while after among them, neither Captain <hi>Baron</hi> nor any other ever touched her; a great example of reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuch people.</p>
               <p>Yet muſt it be acknowledged, that ſome of them have ſince degenerated from that chaſtity, and many other vertues of their Anceſtors: But we muſt withall make this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the <hi>Europaeans</hi> by their pernicious examples, and the unchriſtian-like treatment they have us'd towards them, baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceiving them, perfidiouſly upon all occaſions breaking their promiſes with them, unmercifully rifling and burning their houſes and villages, and raviſhing and debauching their Wives and Daughters, have taught them (to the perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of the Chriſtian name) diſſimulation, lying, treachery, perfidiouſneſs, luxury, and ſeveral other vices, which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in thoſe parts, before they had any Commerce with them.</p>
               <p>But as to other concerns, theſe Savages are remarkable for their civility and courteſie, beyond what can be imagined in Savages: Not but that there are ſome <hi>Caribbians</hi> very brutiſh and unreaſonable; but for the greater part of them their judgment and docility is obſervable upon many occaſions, and thoſe who have converſed long with them, have found ſeveral experiences of their fair dealing, gratitude, friendſhip and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity: But of this we ſhall ſpeak more particularly in the Chapter where we ſhall treat of their <hi>Reception of ſuch Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as come to viſit them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are alſo great lovers of cleanlineſs (a thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary among Savages) and have ſuch an averſion for all naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that if one ſhould eaſe himſelf in their Gardens where their <hi>Caſſava</hi> and <hi>Potatoes</hi> are planted, they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forſake them, and not make uſe of any thing growing therein: Of this their neatneſs in this and other things, we ſhall have occaſion to ſay more in the Chapter <hi>Of their Habitations, and their Repaſts.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>ADmiration being the Daughter of Ignorance, we are not to think it ſtrange that the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who have ſo little knowledge of thoſe excellent things which ſtudy and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have made familiar amongſt civiliz'd Nations, ſhould be
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:58704:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo much aſtoniſh'd when they meet with any thing whereof the cauſe is unknown to them, and that they ſhould be brought up in ſo great ſimplicity, that it might be taken in moſt of theſe poor people for a brutiſh ſtupidity.</p>
               <p>This ſimplicity is remarkable, among other things, in the extraordinary fear they conceive at the ſight of Firearms, which they look on with a ſtrange admiration; but their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greateſt at Fire-locks, much beyond what they have for great Guns and Muskets, becauſe they ſee Fire put to them; but for Fire-locks, they are not able to conceive how it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould take Fire; and ſo they believe it is the evil Spirit <hi>Maboya</hi> who does that Office: But this fear and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is common to them with divers other Savages, who have not found any thing ſo ſtrange in their encounters with the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> as thoſe Arms which ſpit Fire, and at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance wound and kill thoſe whom they meet with: This was<note place="margin">Garcilaſſo's Commentary Royal, l. 3. c. 8 Des Hayes Travels into the Levant.</note> it, together with the Prodigy of ſeeing Men fighting on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, which principally made the <hi>Peruvians</hi> think the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be Gods, and occaſioned their ſubmiſſion to them with leſs reſiſtance. It is reported alſo that the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who make Incurſions along the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and ſhould be more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to War, are not free from this fear and aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>Among the ſeveral diſcoveries of the ſimplicity of our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians,</hi> we ſhall here ſet down two very conſiderable ones. When there happens an Eclipſe of the Moon, they believe that <hi>Maboya</hi> eats her, and they dance all night, making a noiſe with Gourds, wherein there are many ſmall Pebbles: And when they ſmell any thing of ill ſcent, they are wont to ſay, <hi>Maboya cayeu eu,</hi> that is, <hi>The Devil is here; Caima Loary, Let us be gone becauſe of him,</hi> or <hi>for fear of him:</hi> Nay they attribute the name of <hi>Maboya,</hi> or Devil, to certain Plants of ill ſcent, ſuch as may be Muſhrooms, and to whatever is apt to put them into any fright.</p>
               <p>Some years ſince, the greateſt part of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> were perſwaded that Gun-powder was the Seed of ſome Herb; nay, there were thoſe who deſir'd ſome of it to ſow in their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; nay, ſome were ſo obſtinate, that, though diſſwaded from it, they put it into the ground, out of a perſwaſion that it would bring forth ſomwhat, as well as other Seeds: Yet was not this Imagination ſo groſs as thoſe of certain Brutes of <hi>Guinny,</hi> who, the firſt time they ſaw <hi>Europaeans,</hi> thought the Commodities they brought them, ſuch as Linnen, Cloathes, Knives, and Fire-arms, grew on the Earth ſo prepar'd, as the Fruits did on Trees, and that there was no more to be done than to gather them: That certainly is not ſo pardonable a piece of ſimplicity as that of the <hi>Caribbians:</hi> And we may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alledg, to excuſe that ſimplicity, or at leaſt to render it the<note place="margin">Garcilaſſo, l. 9. c. 16.</note> more ſupportable, the ſtupidity of thoſe Inhabitants of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:58704:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who, upon the firſt Diſcovery of the <hi>New-World,</hi> imagin'd that the Horſe and the Rider made up one Creature, like the imaginary Centaurs of the Poets: And that of thoſe others, who<note place="margin">Montagne's Eſſays, l. 1. c. 8.</note> after they were ſubdu'd, coming to deſire peace and pardon of the Men, and to bring them Gold and Proviſions, went and made the ſame Preſents to the Horſes, with a Speech much like that which they had made to the Men, interpreting the neighing of thoſe Creatures for a Language of compoſition and truce: And to conclude theſe inſtances, we ſhall add only the childiſh ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Lery, c.</hi> 16 <hi>Garcilaſſo, l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 29.</note> of thoſe ſame <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> who roundly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that the Letters which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent one to another were certain Meſſengers and Spies, ſpeaking, and ſeeing, and diſcovering the moſt ſecret actions; and upon this perſwaſion, fearing one day the eye and tongue of one of theſe Letters, they hid it under a ſtone, that they might freely eat ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of their Maſters. In fine, there will be no cauſe to think it ſo ſtrange that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> ſhould take Gun-powder, a thing abſolutely unknown to them, for ſome ſeed that might be ſown, when there were ſome people living in <hi>France,</hi> whoſe habitations being at a great diſtance from the places where Salt was made, thought out of a like imagination that it was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd in Gardens. It hapned alſo, not many years ſince, that a Woman, an Inhabitant of <hi>Martinico,</hi> having ſent ſeveral pounds of <hi>Caret</hi>-ſhells and Tobacco to a She-Merchant of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caret is a kind of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe-ſhell.</note> when this latter had put off the Commodity, ſhe gave an account thereof to her Correſpondent at <hi>Martinico,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to plant <hi>Carets</hi> in her Garden rather then Tobacco, for that the former was much dearer in <hi>France,</hi> and that there was no danger of its rotting in the Ship, as there was of Tobacco. But let us conſider what there is yet to be ſaid concerning the natural ſimplicity of our Savages of the <hi>Caribbies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a pleaſant thing to conſider that theſe poor people ſhould be ſo ſimple, as that though they have many places fit for the making of Salt, yet dare they not make uſe of it, as accounting Salt extreamly prejudicial to health, and the preſervation of life; thence it proceeds that they never either eat of it, or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon their meat therewith; and when at any time they ſee our people make uſe of it, they ſay to them, out of a compaſſion worthy compaſſion, <hi>Compere, thou haſteneſt thy own death:</hi> But inſtead of Salt, they ſeaſon all their meſſes with <hi>Pyman,</hi> or Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Pepper.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any Swines-fleſh eaten among them, which they call <hi>Coincoin,</hi> and <hi>Bouïrokou;</hi> nor yet Tortoiſe, (or as ſome call them Turtles) which they call <hi>Catallou,</hi> though there be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thoſe Creatures in their Country: Of this their abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence they give the ſimpleſt reaſons imaginable: For as to the Swine, they are afraid to taſte of it, leſt they ſhould have ſmall eyes like thoſe of that Beaſt; now in their judgment it is the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:58704:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greateſt of all deformities to have ſmall eyes, and yet there are few among them but have them ſuch. As for the Tortoiſe, the reaſon of their abſtinence from that is no leſs ridiculous; they will not feed on that, ſay they, out of a fear leſt if they did, they ſhould participate of the lazineſs and ſtupidity of that Creature.</p>
               <p>Moſt of thoſe people who are known by the name of Savages are alſo full of ſtrange and fantaſtical imaginations concerning the matter and manner of eating: For example, the <hi>Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. Junius in his Relations of New-Fra.</note> abſtain from Muſcles, only out of a pure fancy; but they are ſuch Beaſts that they cannot give any reaſon for that abſtinence: They will not caſt the Beavers bones to the Dogs, leſt the ſoul of that Beaſt ſhould go and tell the other Beavers, and ſo oblige them to leave the Country: It is reported alſo, That they do not eat the marrow of the back-bone of any Creature, for fear of having any pain in the back. The <hi>Braſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> eat no hens egges, out of an opinion they are poiſon: They<note place="margin">De Lery, c. 11</note> abſtain alſo from the fleſh of Ducks, and that of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that goes ſlowly, as alſo from Fiſhes that do not ſwim ſwiftly, for fear of participating of the ſlowneſs of thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The <hi>Maldiveſes</hi> forbear the meat of Tortoiſes, as the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pirard of the Animals of the Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, c.</hi> 2. <hi>Vin. le Blanc. Garcilaſſo, l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Caribbians</hi> do; but it is becauſe of the conformity there is, in their judgment, between them and Man. The <hi>Calecutians,</hi> and ſome others who live more towards the Eaſt, never taſte of the fleſh of wild Oxen, Cows, and Bulls, out of a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that mens Souls, when they depart out of their Bodies, go and animate thoſe of the ſaid Beaſts. In fine, certain <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvians</hi> of the Province of <hi>Pastu</hi> abſtain from all kinds of fleſh whatſoever; and if they are intreated to taſte thereof, their anſwer is, <hi>That they are not Dogs.</hi> All theſe Inſtances are brought upon the Stage, to ſhew that the averſion of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> to eat Salt, Swines-fleſh, and Tortoiſes, ſhould not cauſe them to be accounted the moſt ſelf-will'd and moſt extravagant of all the Savages.</p>
               <p>Beſides the diſcoveries we have already made of their ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs and ſimplicity, there is this yet to be added, That they are ſo ſtupid, that they cannot count a number exceeding that of the Fingers of their Hands and the Toes of their Feet, which they ſhew to expreſs the ſaid number, what exceeds it ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them all Arithmetick; ſo that they would be very unfit for Bankiers; an humour contrary to that of the <hi>Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Voyage to the Eaſt Indies, 1630.</note> who are ſuch excellent Accomptants, that in a moment they caſt up ſuch Sums as it would trouble us much to do, and that with greater certainty.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have the priviledge not to be the only Nation in the World which may be reproach'd with this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for it is as great among the people of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> and <hi>Guinny,</hi> to cite no more; nay, ſome ancient Hiſtorians affirm,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:58704:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That there were ſome people who could not count above five, and others who could not exceed four.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Guinny</hi> having counted to Ten, were wont to ſet a mark, and then begin again. Certain Savages of the Septentrional part of <hi>America,</hi> to expreſs a great number, which it was impoſſible for them to name, make uſe of an eaſie kind of demonſtration, taking their hair or ſome ſand in their hands; a ſort of compariſons which are frequent in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands have alſo their invention to ſupply the defect of Arithmetick; for when they are to go to the Wars, and are to be ready at their general Rendezvouz on a certain day, they take each of them one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another an equal number of Peaſe, in their ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; as for inſtance, thrice or four times Ten, and ſome certain number under Ten, if need be, according as they are reſolv'd to advance their Enterpriſe; they put up theſe Peaſe in a little Gourd, and every morning they take out one, and caſt it away, till there are none left, and then the appointed time for their departure is come, and the next day they are to be upon their march: Another way they have is this, every one of them makes ſo many knots on a little Cord, and every day they unty one, and when they are come to the laſt they make ready for the Rendezvouz: Somtimes alſo they take little pieces of Wood, upon which they make ſo many notches as they intend to ſpend days in their preparation; every day they cut off one of the notches, and when they come to the laſt, they take their march towards the place appointed.</p>
               <p>The Captains, the <hi>Boyez,</hi> and the moſt ancient among them, have more underſtanding than the common ſort, and by long experience, join'd to what they had receiv'd by tradition from their Anceſtors, they have acquir'd a groſs knowledge of divers Stars; whence it comes that they count the Months by Moons, and the Years by the Seven Stars, taking particular notice of that Conſtellation: Thus ſome <hi>Peruvians</hi> regulated their Years by their Harveſts: Thoſe Inhabitants of <hi>Canada</hi> who live in the Mountains obſerve the number of the Nights and Winters; and the <hi>Soriqueſes</hi> count by Suns. But though the more judicions among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> diſcern the Months, and the Years, and obſerve the different Seaſons, yet have they not any Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity, and cannot tell how long it is ſince the firſt of their Nation left the Continent, and ſetled themſelves in the Iſlands; but all the account they are able to give of it is, That neither themſelves, nor their Fathers, nor their Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers could remember any thing of it; nor can they tell what age they are of, nor give any preciſe account of the time when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came into their Country, nor of ſeveral other things of that nature; for they take no notice of ought of this kind, and make no account of knowing what is done in the World.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere is no Nation ſo ſavage, no People ſo barbarous, but they have ſome opinion and perſwaſion of a Divinity, ſaid <hi>Cicero;</hi> nay, Nature her ſelf ſeems to have been ſo indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent<note place="margin">Tuſc. Quoeſt.</note> to Mankind, as to make ſome impreſſion of a Divinity in the minds of Men; for what Nation, what kind of Men are there, but have, without any previous learning it from others, a natural ſentiment of the Divinity? We may with juſt reaſon admire theſe noble Illuminations proceeding out of the mouth of a man groping in the darkneſs of Paganiſm: But things are come to that paſs now, that it will be a hard matter to make good the famous words of that incomparable Orator and Prince of Roman Eloquence: For the poor Savages of the ancient People of the <hi>Antes</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and of the two Provinces of the <hi>Chirrhuanes</hi> or <hi>Cheriganes,</hi> thoſe of moſt of the Countries of <hi>New-France, New-Mexico, New-Holland, Braſil, New-Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Terra del Fuego,</hi> the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> the Inhabitants about the River <hi>Cayenna,</hi> the <hi>Iſlands of Robbers,</hi> and ſome others, if we may credit Hiſtorians, have not any kind of Religion, and do not adore any Sovereign Power.</p>
               <p>Thoſe alſo who have convers'd among the Originary Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands, are forc'd to acknowledge, That they have, by the violence of their brutiſh paſſions, ſmother'd all the apprehenſions Nature had beſtow'd on them of a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that they have rejected all the Directions and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which might guide them to the knowledge thereof; and conſequently, that by the juſt judgment of God they are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſo dreadful a night, that there is not to be ſeen among them either Invocation, or Ceremonies, or Sacrifices, or, in fine, any Exerciſe or Aſſembly whatſoever in order to Devotion: nay, they are ſo far from having any of theſe things, that they have not ſo much as a name to expreſs the Divinity, ſo far are they from ſerving it; ſo that when any one would ſpeak to them concerning God, he muſt uſe theſe circumlocutions; <hi>He who hath created the World, who hath made all things, who gives life and ſuſtenance to all living Creatures,</hi> or ſomthing of that kind: They are accordingly ſo blinded and brutiſh, that they do not make any acknowledgment of the Lord of Nature, in that admirable work of the Univerſe; wherein he hath been pleas'd to repreſent himſelf in a thouſand immortal colours, and make his adorable Omnipotency as it were viſible to the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58704:152"/>
eye: Thence comes it that they are deaf to the voices of an infinite number of creatures which continually preach unto them the preſence of their Creator: And ſo they daily uſe the benefits of their Sovereign Maſter, without ever reflecting that he is the Author thereof, and making any acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his goodneſs, who hath ſo liberally ſupplyed them therewith.</p>
               <p>They ſay that the Earth is the indulgent Mother, who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them with all things neceſſary to life: But their terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial minds are not raiſed to any apprehenſion of that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and all-merciful Father who fram'd the Earth, and by the continual influence of his Divinity impregnates it with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of producing all things for the nouriſhment of man: If any one ſpeak to them concerning that Divine Eſſence, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe with them of the myſteries of Faith, they will hearken to all that is ſaid with much patience: But when the diſcourſe is at an end, they anſwer as it were in jeſt, <hi>Friend thou art very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, thou art very ſubtle, I would I could talk as well thou doſt:</hi> Nay ſometimes they ſay as the <hi>Braſilians</hi> do, that if they ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded by ſuch diſcourſes, their Neighbours would laugh at them.</p>
               <p>A certain <hi>Caribbian</hi> being at work on a Sunday, Monſieur <hi>du Montel</hi> relates how that he ſaid to him, <q>Friend, he who hath made Heaven and Earth will be angry with thee for working on this day; for he hath appointed this day for his ſervice: And I, <hi>reply'd very bluntly the Savage,</hi> am already very angry with him; for thou ſayeſt he is the Maſter of the world and of the ſeaſons: He it is therefore who hath forborn to ſend rain in due time, and by reaſon of the great drought hath cauſed my <hi>Manioc</hi> and my <hi>Potatoes</hi> to rot in the ground: ſince he hath treated me ſo ill, I will work on every Sunday, though 'twere purpoſely to vex him.</q> See here a pregnant example of the brutality of this wretched people. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe is much like that of thoſe ſenceleſs people among the <hi>Topinambous,</hi> who, when it was told them that God was the Author of the Thunder, argued, that it followed he was not good, ſince he took ſuch pleaſure in frighting them after that manner. But to return to the <hi>Caribbians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe of the ſame Nation who live in the Meridional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of <hi>America,</hi> have no more Religion than the Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbies:</hi> Some among them have a certain reſpect for the Sun and the Moon, and imagine that they are animated; yet do they not adore them, nor offer, nor ſacrifice any thing to them: It is probable they have retain'd that veneration for thoſe two great Luminaries from the remembrance of the <hi>Apalachites,</hi> among whom their Predeceſſors had ſometimes ſojourned. Our Iſlanders have not preſerved any thing of that Tradition; but we ſhall here ſet down all that may be called
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58704:153"/>
Religion among them, and what bears a groſs repreſentation thereof.</p>
               <p>They have a natural ſentiment of ſome Divinity, or ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and obliging power, which hath its reſidence in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; They ſay, <q>That the ſaid power is content quietly to enjoy the delights of its own felicity, without being offended at the ill actions of men, and that it is endued with ſo great goodneſs, that it does not take any revenge even of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</q> whence it comes that they render it neither honour nor adoration, and that they interpret thoſe Treaſures of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, whereof it is ſo liberal towards them, and that long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering whereby it bears with them, either to weakneſs or the indifference it hath for the conduct of mankind.</p>
               <p>Their perſwaſion therefore is, that there are two kinds of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>They believe that there is a great number of theſe good Spirits, or Gods, and every one imagines that there is one of them particularly deſign'd for his conduct: They ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that theſe Gods have their abode in Heaven, but they know not what they do there, and of themſelves they never propoſe to themſelves the making of any acknowledgment of them as Creators of the world, and the things contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: But only when it is ſaid to them, that the God we adore is he who hath made Heaven and Earth, and that it is he who cauſeth the Earth to bring forth things for our nouriſhment; they anſwer; <hi>True, thy God hath made the Heaven and the Earth of</hi> France (<hi>or ſome other Country, which they name</hi>) <hi>and cauſes thy Wheat to grow there: But our Gods have made our Country, and cauſe our Manioc to grow.</hi>

               <p>They have neither Temples nor Altars particularly dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theſe pretended Divinities which they acknowledge, and ſo they do not ſacrifice to them any thing that hath had life; but they only make them offerings of <hi>Caſſava,</hi> and of the firſt of their Fruits; and when they think they have been healed by them of ſome diſeaſe, they make a kind of wine or a feaſt in honour of them, and by way of acknowledgment, and as it were to expreſs their gratitude, they offer them ſome <hi>Caſſava,</hi> and <hi>Ouïcou;</hi> all theſe offerings are called by them <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri.</hi> Their Houſes being made after on oval figure, and the roof reaching to the ground, they ſet at one end of the Hut their Offerings in Veſſels according to the nature of the thing, upon one or more <hi>Matoutous,</hi> or little Tables made of Bull-ruſhes and the leaves of the tree called the <hi>Latanier:</hi> Every one may make his Offerings to his God in his own Houſe, or Cot; but when it is done in order to invocation, there muſt be one of the <hi>Boyez</hi> preſent: All theſe Offerings are not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd with any adoration, or Prayers, and they conſiſt only in the bare preſentation of thoſe gifts.</p>
               <p>They alſo invocate their falſe Gods when they deſire their preſence; but that is to be done by the interpoſition of the <hi>Boyez,</hi> that is to ſay, their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or to ſay better, their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians;</hi> and this they do eſpecially upon four occaſions.</p>

               <p>Every <hi>Boyé</hi> hath his particular God, or rather his familiar Devil, which he invocates by the ſinging of certain words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the ſmoke of Tobacco, which they cauſe to be burnt before that Devil, as a perfume which is very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and the ſcent whereof is able to make him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Boyez</hi> invocate their familiar Devil, it is alwaies done in the night-time, and great care muſt be taken that there be no light neer, nor any fire in the place where they exerciſe their abominations; for theſe ſpirits of darkneſs perfectly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor all light: And when ſeveral <hi>Boyez</hi> invocate their Gods at the ſame time, as they ſpeak, thoſe Gods, or rather Devils, rail one at another, and quarrel, attributing to one another the cauſes of every ones evil, and they ſeem to fight.</p>
               <p>Theſe Demons ſhelter themſelves ſometimes in the bones of dead men taken out of their graves and wrapt in Cotton, and thereby give Oracles, ſaying it is the ſoul of the deceaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: They make uſe of them to bewitch their Enemies, and to that end the Sorcerers wrap up thoſe bones together with ſomething that belongs to their Enemy. Theſe Devils do alſo ſometimes enter into the bodies of Women, and ſpeak by them: When the <hi>Boyé</hi> or Magician hath by his Charms obliged his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar Spirit to appear, he bids him appear under different ſhapes, and thoſe who are about the place where he exerciſes his damnable ſuperſtitions, ſay, that he clearly anſwers the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions made to him, that he foretels the event of a war or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and after the <hi>Boyé</hi> is retired, that the Devil ſtirs the Veſſels, and makes a noiſe with his jaws, as if he were eating and drinking the preſents prepared for him: but the next day they find he hath not meddled with any thing: Theſe profane offerings which have been defiled by theſe unhappy Spirits, are accounted ſo holy by the Magicians and the poor people whom they have abuſed, that only the moſt ancient and moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable perſons among them, have the liberty to taſte of them; nay they durſt not do that, unleſs they have that cleanneſs of body which they ſay is requiſite in all thoſe that are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited thereto.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as theſe poor Savages are troubled with any ſickneſs or pain, they believe that they are ſent upon them by the Gods of ſome of their Enemies; and then they make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the <hi>Boyé,</hi> who conſulting his Daemon, tells them it is the God of ſuch a one, or ſuch a one, who hath caus'd choſe miſchiefs to them: And this raiſes in thoſe who conſult, enmity and a deſire to be revenged of thoſe whoſe Gods have treated them in that manner.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> are ſubject to ſome other miſchiefs, which they ſay proceed from <hi>Maboya,</hi> and they often complain that he beats them: True it is, that ſome perſons of worth, who have converſed a certain time among this poor people, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they are neither moleſted, nor effectually beaten by the Devil; and that all the complaints and dreadful relations they make as to that, are grounded only on this, that being of a very melancholick conſtitution, and having for the moſt part their ſpleens ſwell'd and inflam'd, they are many times ſubject to terrible dreams, wherein they imagine the Devil appears to them, and beats them: whereupon they ſtart up frighted out of their wits, and when they are fully awake, they ſay that <hi>Maboya</hi> hath beaten them; and having the imagination thus hurt, they are perſwaded that they feel the pain.</p>

               <p>But theſe are not the only people whom that implacable Enemy of Mankind treats as his ſlaves: There are ſeveral other barbarous Nations who can alwaies ſhow on their bodies the bloudy marks of his cruelties: For it is reported, that the <hi>Braſilians</hi> ſhake and ſweat with horrour at the remembrance of his apparitions, and many times out of the pure apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they have of the cruel treatment they are wont to receive from him: Thence it proceeds that ſome of thoſe Nations flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that old Dragon, and by adorations, offerings, and ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, endeavour to abate his rage and appeaſe his fury; as among others, not to mention the people of the Eaſtern part of the World, ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>Canada:</hi> For that is the only reaſon they can give for the ſervice they do him: Nay it is affirmed that the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore inclin'd to make offerings to that Devil, to be delivered out of his temptations and ſnares: And one of their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors cites this Proverb as uſed among them; <hi>Make a preſent to</hi>

               <p>But how great ſoever the apprehenſions which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have of their <hi>Maboya</hi> may be, and how ill ſoever they may be treated by him, yet do they not honour him with any offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, prayers, adorations, or ſacrifices: All the remedy they uſe againſt his cruel vexations, is, the beſt they can, to make little Images of wood, or ſome other ſolid matter, in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſhape under which that wicked ſpirit hath appeared to them: Theſe Images they hang about their necks, and ſay they find eaſe thereby, and that <hi>Maboya</hi> does not torment them ſo much when they have thoſe about them: Sometimes alſo in imitation of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Continent, they make uſe of the mediation of the <hi>Boyez</hi> to appeaſe him, and they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon conſult their Gods, as, upon the like occaſions thoſe of the Continent have recourſe to their Sorcerers, who are highly eſteemed among them.</p>
               <p>For though the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of thoſe parts are all generally ſubtle enough, yet have they among them a ſort of crafty companions, who to gain greater authority and reputation among the reſt, make them believe that they hold a ſecret correſpondence with the evil Spirits whom they call <hi>Maboya,</hi> as our Iſlanders do, whereby they are tormented, and that they learn of them things abſolutely unknown to others: Theſe Impoſtors are looked upon among this poor people that have no knowledge of God, as Oracles, and they conſult them in

all things, and ſuperſtitiouſly give credit to their Anſwers: This occaſions irreconcileable Enmities among them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times Murthers; for when any one dies, his Friends and Relations are wont to conſult the Sorcerer how he came to his death; if the Sorcerer anſwers, that ſuch or ſuch a one was the cauſe of it, they will never reſt till they have diſpatch'd him whom the <hi>Piais</hi> (ſo they call the Sorcerer in their Language) hath nam'd to them. The <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Iſlands do alſo in this follow the cuſtom of their Country men of the Continent, as we have repreſented before.</p>
               <p>But this is moſt certain, and a thing which all the Savages daily acknowledg themselves by experience, That the wicked one hath no power to do them any hurt in the company of any <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> hence it comes, that in thoſe Iſlands where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> live jointly with the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> thoſe wretched peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being perſecuted by the Adverſary, make all the haſte they can to the next houſes of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> where they find a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain refuge againſt the violent aſſaults of that furious Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a manifeſt truth, confirm'd by daily experience all over <hi>America,</hi> That the holy Sacrament of Baptiſm being conferr'd on theſe Savages, the Divel never beats nor tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments them afterwards as long as they live.</p>
               <p>A man would think, that this ſeriouſly conſider'd, theſe people ſhould earneſtly deſire to embrace the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that ſo they might be deliver'd out of the jaws of that roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion.

               <p>WE have ſeen in the precedent Chapter how the Spirits of darkneſs take occaſion in the night-time, by hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparitions and dreadful repreſentations, to frighten the miſerable <hi>Caribbians;</hi> and how to continue them in their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,

and a ſervile fear of their pretended power, they puniſh them if they be not ſo forward as they would have them to comply with their wicked ſuggeſtions; and how they charm their Senſes by Illuſions and ſtrange Imaginations, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Authority of revealing to them things to come, healing them of their Diſeaſes, revenging them of their Enemies, and delivering them out of all the dangers whereto they ſhall be expos'd: All this well conſider'd, is it to be admir'd that theſe Barbarians, who knew not, nor in the leaſt reflected on the honour which God had done them, in making a diſcovery of himself to them in the many delightful Creatures he hath ſet before their eyes, to conduct them to the light of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, ſhould be deliver'd up to a reprobate ſenſe, and that at this preſent they ſhould be deſtitute of all underſtanding to perceive the true way of Life, and without hope, and without God in the World?</p>
               <p>We have alſo repreſented, That what indeavours ſoever they might uſe to ſmother all the ſentiments of Divine Juſtice and its Juriſdiction in their Conſciences, yet hath there ſtill remain'd in them ſome ſpark of that Knowledge, which awakens them, and raiſes in them from time to time divers fears and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of that Vengeance which their Crimes might bring upon them: But inſtead of lifting up their eyes to heaven, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the aſſiſtance thereof, and by confidence and amendment of life to appeaſe the Sovereign Majeſty of the true God, whom they had offended, they deſcend to the abyſſes of Hell, to invocate the Devil by the ſacrilegious Superſtitions of their Magicians, who after they have render'd them thoſe fatal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, involve them, by thoſe infamous Contracts, in the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſlavery of thoſe cruel Tyrants.</p>
               <p>Theſe poor Barbarians are ſo tranſported and beſotted by thoſe furious paſſions, that to obtain ſome favour from thoſe enemies to all goodneſs, and to appeaſe thoſe Tygers, they render them ſeveral ſmall Services; for they not only conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to them the firſt of their fruits, but they alſo devote to them the moſt ſumptuous Tables of their Feaſts; they cover them with the moſt delicate of their Meats, and the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious of their Drinks; they conſult them in their affairs of greateſt importance, and are govern'd by their wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; they expect, in their Sickneſs, the Sentence of their Life or Death from thoſe deteſtable Oracles, which they receive by the means of thoſe Puppets of Cotton, wherein they wrap up the worm-eaten Bones of ſome wretched Carcaſs taken out of the Grave; and to free themſelves from the weight of their blows, and divert their rage, they burn in honour of them the leaves of Tobacco; and ſomtimes they paint their ugly ſhapes in the moſt conſiderable place of their Veſſels which they call <hi>Piragas,</hi> or they wear hanging about their necks a little Image

repreſenting ſome one of thoſe curſed Spirits, in the moſt hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous poſture in which they had ſometime appear'd unto them, as we have hinted in the precedent Chapter.</p>
               <p>It is alſo conceiv'd, That it is out of the ſame deſign of inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating themſelves into the favour of thoſe Monſters, that many times they macerate their Bodies by many bloody inciſions and ſuperſtitious abſtinences, and that they have ſo great a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Magicians, who are the infamous Miniſters of theſe infernal Furies, and the Executioners of their enraged Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Yet have not theſe abus'd wretches any Laws determining the preciſe time of all theſe damnable Ceremonies; but the ſame wicked Spirit which inclines them thereto, finds them occaſions enough to exerciſe them, either by the ill treatment they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him, or their own curioſity to know the event of ſome military Enterpriſe, or the ſucceſs of ſome Diſeaſe, or laſtly to find out the means of revenging themſelves of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>But ſince thoſe who have liv'd many years in the midſt of that Nation unanimouſly affirm, That in their greateſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they never ſaw them invocate any of thoſe Spirits, we are perſwaded, that all thoſe little Services, which fear forces from them rather then reverence or love, ought not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a true Worſhip, or acts of Religion; and that we ſhall give thoſe fooleries their right denomination, if we call them Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, Enchantments, Sorceries, and ſhameful productions of that Art which is as black as are thoſe Spirits of darkneſs whom their <hi>Boyez</hi> conſult: And we may conclude alſo, that the meat and drink which they preſent to thoſe counterfeit Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities, cannot be properly called Sacrifices, but expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts between the Divels and the Magicians, obliging them to appear when they call for them.</p>
               <p>So that it is not to be thought ſtrange, that in all theſe weak ſentiments which moſt of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have of whatever hath any appearance of Religion, they ſhould among themſelves laugh at the Ceremonies of the Chriſtians, and think the worſe of thoſe of their Nation who expreſs any inclination to be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed: The ſureſt way therefore for thoſe whoſe hearts God ſhould open to believe the holy Goſpel, would be to leave their Country and Friends, and to go into ſome of thoſe Iſlands which are inhabited only by Chriſtians: For though they are not ſo ſuperſtitious as the people of the Kingdom of <hi>Calecut,</hi> who think it a horror only to touch a perſon of a contrary perſwaſion to theirs, as if they were thereby defil'd; nor yet ſo rigorous as they are in the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> where when a man embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Chriſtian Religion, the wife celebrates his Funeral as if he were dead, and erects a Tomb, at which having made her Lamentations, ſhe is at liberty to marry again, as if ſhe were effectually a Widow; yet he among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> who ſhould
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58704:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
embrace Chriſtianity, would expoſe himſelf to thouſands of reproaches and affronts, if he continu'd his aboad among them.</p>
               <p>When they ſee the Aſſemblies and Service of the Chriſtians, they are wont to ſay, is is pretty and divertive, but it is not the faſhion of their Country; not expreſſing in their preſence either hatred or averſion to the Ceremonies, as did the poor Savages who liv'd in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and the neighbouring Iſlands, who would not be preſent at the Service of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> much leſs embrace their Religion, becauſe, as they ſaid, they could not be perſwaded that perſons ſo wicked and ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, whoſe unmerciful barbariſm they had ſo much experienc'd, could have any good belief.</p>
               <p>Some Prieſts and Religious men, who had been heretofore in that Country, having been over-forward in the baptizing of ſome before they had inſtructed them in that Myſtery, have been the cauſe that that Sacrament is not in ſuch reputation among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> as otherwiſe it might have been: And whereas their Godfathers and Godmothers gave them new Cloathes, and made them ſome other little Preſents on the day of their Baptiſm, and treated them very ſumptuouſly, within eight days after they had received that Sacrament they deſired to receive it again, that they might have other Preſents and good cheer.</p>
               <p>Not many years ſince, ſome of thoſe Gentlemen took into their charge a young <hi>Caribbian,</hi> their <hi>Catechumen,</hi> born in <hi>Dominico,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Ya Marabouy,</hi> a Son of that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whom the <hi>French</hi> call the <hi>Baron,</hi> and the Indians <hi>Orachora Caramiana,</hi> out of a deſign to ſhew him one of the greateſt and moſt magnificent Cities in the World, which was <hi>Paris;</hi> they brought him over-Sea, and after they had ſhewn him all the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of that great City, he was baptiz'd there with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, in the preſence of many Perſons of Honour, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Lewis:</hi> Having ſojourn'd a while in thoſe Parts, he was ſent back into his own Country, loaden indeed with Preſents, but as much a Chriſtian as when he came out of it, becauſe he had not been fully inſtructed in the Myſteries of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: As ſoon as he had ſet foot in his own Iſland he laugh'd at all he had ſeen, as if it had been but a May-game, and ſaying the Chriſtians were an extravagant ſort of people, he return'd into the Company of the other Savages, put off his Cloathes, and painted his Body over with <hi>Roucou,</hi> as he had done before.</p>
               <p>To ſhew the inconſtancy and lightneſs of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> in the Chriſtian Religion, when they have once embrac'd it, there is a Story, how that while M. <hi>Auber</hi> was Governour of <hi>Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe</hi> he was often viſited by a Savage of <hi>Dominico,</hi> who had liv'd a long time at <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had been baptiz'd; but being return'd into his Iſland, though he made as many Signs of the Croſs as one would deſire, and wore a great pair
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58704:157"/>
of Beads about his Neck, yet he liv'd like a Savage, went na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked among his own people, and retain'd nothing of what he had ſeen and been taught at <hi>Sevil,</hi> ſave that he put on an old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Habit, the more to ingratiate himſelf when he came to viſit the Governour.</p>
               <p>They have a very ancient Tradition among them, which ſhews that their Anceſtors had ſome knowledg of a Superior Power which took a care of their Perſons, and whoſe favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable aſſiſtance they were ſenſible of; but this Light their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Children have ſuffer'd to be extinguiſh'd, and through their ignorance never reflected on it: They ſay then, That their Anceſtors were poor Savages, living like Beaſts in the midſt of the Woods, without Houſes or places where they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, living on the Herbs and Fruits which the Earth produc'd of it ſelf without manuring; whilſt they were in this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, an old man among them, extreamly weary of that brutiſh kind of life, wept moſt bitterly, and, orewhelm'd with deſpair, deplor'd his wretched condition; whereupon a Man all in white appear'd to him deſcending from Heaven, and coming neer, he comforted the diſconſolate old man, telling him, That he was come to aſſiſt him and his Countrymen, and to ſhew them the way to lead a more pleaſant life for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; That if any one of them had ſooner made his complaints to Heaven, they had been ſooner relieved; That on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore there was abundance of ſharp Stones, wherewith they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The old man did what had been enjoin'd him, and at the end of nine

Moons (as they ſay) being extreamly deſirous to know the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Revelation, he went to ſee the pieces he had plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ground, and he found that each of them had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced many fair and great roots, which he diſpoſed of as he had been commanded: Thoſe of <hi>Dominico</hi> who tell this ſtory, ſay further, that if the old man had viſited the pieces at the end of three days, inſtead of nine months, he would have found the roots grown to the ſame bigneſs, and that they had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in that time: But in regard he went not to look what became of them, till after the expiration of ſo long a time, the <hi>Manioc</hi> continues to this preſent all that time in the ground, before it be fit to make <hi>Caſſava</hi> of.</p>
               <p>This is all we could get from the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Tradition, and we conceiv'd it might well be ſet here at length, ſince it is the only one that is related among this ignorant people, who trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves not to know the Name and Quality of that kind and heavenly Benefactor who hath obliged them ſo much, nor to render him any acknowledgment or honour: The Pagans were much more grateful in honouring <hi>Ceres,</hi> from whom they ſaid they received Corn, and the invention of making bread: And the <hi>Peruvians,</hi> though they knew not the great <hi>Pachaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac,</hi> that is, him whom they held to be the ſoul of the Univerſe, and the Sovereign Author of their lives and all they had, yet did they adore him in their hearts with much reſpect and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and rendring him externally by their geſtures and words great expreſſions of their ſubmiſſion and humility, as to the unknown God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> believe they have every one of them ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls as they feel beatings of Arteries in their bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of the heart: Now of all theſe ſouls the principal, as they ſay, is in the heart, and after death it goes to Heaven with its <hi>Icheiri,</hi> or its <hi>Chemiin,</hi> that is, with its God, who carries it thither to live there in the company of the other Gods: And they imagine that it lives the ſame kind of life as man lives here below: Thence it comes that to this day they kill ſlaves on the Tomb of the dead, if they can meet with any that had been in the ſervice of the deceaſed, to go and wait upon him in the other world: For it is to be obſerved, that they do not think the Soul to be ſo far immaterial as to be inviſible; but they affirm it to be ſubtile, and of thin ſubſtance as a purified body; and they have but the ſame word to ſignifie heart and ſoul.</p>
               <p>As for the other ſouls, which are not in the heart, they believe ſome go after death and live on the Sea-ſide, and that they cauſe Veſſels to turn: They call them <hi>Oumekou;</hi> the others, as they conceive, go and live in the Woods and Foreſts, and they call them <hi>Maboyas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though moſt of this poor people believe the immortality
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58704:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the ſoul, as we have repreſented it, yet they ſpeak ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, and with ſo much uncertainty of the ſtate of the ſoul ſeparated from the body, that we ſhould ſooner have done to ſay they were abſolutely ignorant thereof, than ſet down their extravagant Relations. Some affirm, that the moſt valiant of their Nation are carried after their death into certain <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſlands,</hi> where they have all things at their wiſh, and that the <hi>Arouagues</hi> are there their ſlaves; that they ſwim unwearied in great Rivers; that they live deliciouſly, and ſpend the time in dancing, playing, and feaſting, in a land which produces in abundance all ſorts of excellent fruits without any cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: On the contrary they hold, that thoſe who were cowardly &amp; afraid to go to the wars againſt their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Enemies, do after death ſerve the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> who inhabite barren and deſart Countries beyond the Mountains: But others who are more brutiſh ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trouble themſelves about their condition after death, nor ever think or ſpeak of it: And if any queſtion be put to them concerning it, they know not what anſwer to make.</p>
               <p>Yet they have all had heretofore a certain belief of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, but after a very groſs manner, as may be deduc'd from the Ceremonies of their Interrments, and the prayers they make to the dead, that they would return to life, as we ſhall repreſent more at large in the laſt Chapter of this Hiſtory; as alſo from this, that the moſt polite among them are at preſent of that perſwaſion, that after death they ſhall go to Heaven, to which place they ſay their Anceſtors are gone before them; but they never enquire after the way they are to take to attain that happy abode. Accordingly, when their <hi>Boyez,</hi> who alſo act the part of Phyſitians, deſpair of curing their diſeaſes, and that the Devils have foretold by their mouths that there is no further hopes of life, they give them this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that their Gods will conduct them to Heaven, where they ſhall live at eaſe without any fear of ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>The belief of the <hi>Calecutians</hi> as to this Article is worſe than<note place="margin">Pirard'<hi>s Travels part</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> that of our <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and their tranſmigration is an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant kind of immortality: For they believe that their ſouls at the departure out of their bodies are lodg'd in thoſe of wild Oxen, or ſome other beaſt. The <hi>Braſilians</hi> are in this point more rational; for they conceive that the ſouls of the wicked go after death to the Devil, who beats and torments them, but that the ſouls of the juſt are entertain'd with dancing and good cheer in delightful plains beyond the Mountains: And it is<note place="margin">De Lery, c. 16</note> pleaſant to think that moſt of the Savages of <hi>America</hi> place the ſovereign felicity of the other life in dancing.</p>
               <p>The Reſurrection of the body is by the <hi>Caribbians</hi> account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pure foolery; their Theology is too obſcure to receive ſo<note place="margin">Garcilaſſo, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58704:159"/>
a point wherein the ancient Pagans ſaw as little as our <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> There is alſo a ſmall ſpark of it among the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi> as moſt Authors affirm.</p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have ſo little knowledge and fear of God, as we have repreſented, yet are they extreamly afraid of his voice, that is Thunder; that dreadful voice which makes ſuch a ſtir in the clouds, which is attended by ſuch flames of fire, which ſhakes the foundations of the Mountains, and makes the <hi>Neroes</hi> and <hi>Caligulaes</hi> of this world to tremble: Our Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therefore aſſoon as they perceive the approaches of the Tempeſt, which commonly comes along with that voice, make all the haſte they can to their little houſes, and ſit down on low ſtools about the fire, covering their faces and reſting their heads on their hands and knees; and in that poſture they fall a weeping, and ſay in their Gibberiſh, <hi>Maboya mouche fache contre Caraibe,</hi> that is, <hi>Maboya is very angry with them:</hi> and they ſay the ſame when there happens a Hurricane: They give not over that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting exerciſe, till the Hurricane is quite over; and they are extreamly aſtoniſh'd, that the Chriſtians ſhould expreſs ſo ſo little affliction and fear upon thoſe occaſions. Thus the Grand <hi>Tartars</hi> are mightily afraid of Thunder, and when they<note place="margin">Rubriques <hi>in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels into</hi> Tartary.</note> hear it, they drive all ſtrangers out of their houſes, and wrap themſelves up in Garments of coarſe cloth, which they put not off till the noiſe be over: And divers other barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are no leſs frighted than the <hi>Caribbians</hi> upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Nay it is reported that the <hi>Peruvians,</hi> the <hi>Cumaneſes,</hi> the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and the <hi>Moluckeſes</hi> imitate them in lamentations and frights, when there happens an Eclipſe.</p>
               <p>Yet is it true, that ſince the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have converſed fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with the Chriſtians, ſome of them are grown ſo reſolute as not to be afraid of the Thunder: for ſome have been ſeen to laugh when it thundred moſt, and others counterfeited the noiſe, pronouncing a word which is not eaſily written, and whereof the ſound comes ſomewhat neer theſe letters, <hi>Trtrque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenni:</hi> But it is very certain withall, that they do their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination a great violence when they pretend that they are not afraid of the Thunder, and it is pure vanity which eggs them on to perſonate that confidence, to perſwade thoſe who ſee them, that upon thoſe emergencies their generoſity is as great as that of the Chriſtians: For ſome of the <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Martinico</hi> who have ſurpriz'd them in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters when it thundred and lightned, affirm that they found the moſt reſolute among them ſhivering with fear in their poor Huts.</p>
               <p>Now this trouble and theſe diſturbances which they diſcover at the hearing of that coeleſtial voice, are they not a viſible effect of the ſentiment they have of an infinite and ſovereign Power, imprinted by Nature on the minds of all men, and a pregnant
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58704:159"/>
proof, that though theſe wretches endeavour all they can to ſmother the ſtings of their Conſciences, yet can they not do it ſo fully but that they prick and torment them, though againſt their wills? And is not this enough to make good the ſaying of <hi>Cicero,</hi> at the begining of the precedent Chapter? For though all men do not in words acknowledge that Divinity, yet are they convinc'd in themſelves, by a ſecret but irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand, which writes this firſt of all Truths in their hearts with the point of a Diamond: So that to conclude, we ſhall ſay with that great man, whoſe words will put an excellent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to this diſcourſe, as they have begun it, That it is innate,<note place="margin">

               <p>HIſtorians relate, that heretofore ſome of the ancient Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants<note place="margin">Garcil. <hi>Com.

               <p>Their Habitations are ſomewhat neer one to another, and diſpos'd at certain diſtances, after the manner of a Village; and for the moſt part they plant themſelves upon ſome little aſcent, that ſo they may have better air, and ſecure themſelves againſt thoſe peſtilent Flies which we have elſewhere called <hi>Meſquitos</hi> and <hi>Maringoins,</hi> which are extreamly troubleſome, and whereof the ſtinging is dangerous in thoſe parts where there is but little wind ſtirring: The ſame reaſon it is that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges the <hi>Floridians,</hi> beyond the Bay of <hi>Carlos</hi> and <hi>Tortugues,</hi> to lodge themſelves for the moſt part at the entrance of the Sea, in Huts built on Piles or Pillars: The Inhabitants of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbies</hi> are alſo deſirous to be ſomewhat neer Springs, Brooks, and Rivers, becauſe of their waſhing of themſelves every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before they put the red paint on their bodies.</p>
               <p>Among us, and ſeveral other Nations of this part of the world, the Architects break their brains in ſtudying to make
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58704:160"/>
ſuch ſtrong and ſumptuous Edifices, as if they would have their duration to be equal with that of the world: The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> at the late coming of the Chriſtians among them, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">Trigaut'<hi>s Hiſtory of</hi> China, <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> a certain aſtoniſhment thereat, and charged us with Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For their parts they meaſure the continuance of their Houſes by that of their ſhort lives: But our Savages of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbies</hi> are willing to abate much of that term, and order their ſtructures ſo as that they are oblig'd to build often in their lives: Their little Huts are made in an oval form, of pieces of wood planted in the ground, over which they put a Roof of Plantane-leaves or Sugar-canes, or ſome herbs which they can ſo diſpoſe and intermix one among another, that under that covering which reaches to the ground, they are ſecured againſt rain and all injuries of the weather: And this Roof, as weak as it ſeems to be, makes a ſhift to laſt three or four years, without being much the worſe, unleſs there happens to be a Hurricane: <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms, that ſome Northerly people made uſe of Reeds<note place="margin">L. 16. c. 38.</note> for the covering of their houſes; and they are uſed to this day in the Low-Countries, <hi>France,</hi> and other parts: The <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> do alſo make uſe of ſmall Reeds faſten'd acroſs for the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſadoes,</hi> which are inſtead of walls to their Habitations; under every covering they have as many partitions made as they would have Rooms: A ſimple piece of Mat does among them the office of our doors, bolts, and locks: There's nothing above their heads but the roof it ſelf, and under their feet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the bare earth; but they are ſo careful in keeping of it clean, that they ſweep it as often as they ſee the leaſt filth upon it: This they obſerve in their private houſes; for commonly their <hi>Carbet,</hi> or publick houſe, where they meet upon ſome rejoicing account, is not kept over-clean, inſomuch that many times the place is full of <hi>Chegoes.</hi>

               <p>Beſides the little room where they take their reſt, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their friends, every conſiderable family hath two other little rooms: One ſerves for a Kitchin, and the other for a kind of Store-houſe, where they put up their Bows, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and their <hi>Boutous,</hi> which are Clubs of a heavy and ſmooth wood, which they uſe in their wars inſtead of ſwords, when they have ſpent all their Arrows: There they alſo put up their Baskets, their ſupernumerary beds, with all the toys and ornaments they make uſe of at publick meetings and upon days of Triumph: All that trumpery they call by the name of <hi>Caconnes.</hi>

Cotton-beds, make uſe of another kind of Bed, which is called <hi>Cabane;</hi> and this is made of ſeveral ſmall ſticks laid acroſs, on which they put a good quantity of <hi>Banana</hi>-leaves; this <hi>Cabane</hi> is hung up and ſuſtain'd by the four corners with great cords of <hi>Mahot:</hi> They have alſo little Stools or Chairs made all of a piece, of a red or yellow Wood, and as ſmooth as Marble: There are alſo ſome among them who have little Tables, which have four wooden Pillars, and thoſe cover'd with the leaves of that kind of Palm which is called the <hi>Latanier.</hi>

               <p>They have alſo about their habitations good ſtore of Orange-Trees, Citron-Trees, Guavas, Fig-Trees, Bananas, and other Fruit-Trees; many of thoſe little Trees which bear the <hi>Pyman,</hi> and the Shrubs and Simples whereof they have any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to be us'd when they have any need of them; and with theſe their little Gardens are bordered; but within they are full of Manioc, Potatoes, and ſeveral ſorts of Pulſe, as Peaſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds, Beans, Mais, ſmall Millet, and ſome others: They have alſo Melons of all ſorts, excellent Citruls, and a kind of Cabbage called the <hi>Caribbian</hi>-Cabbage, which are of a very delicious taſte: But they beſtow their greateſt pains about the culture of the <hi>Ananas,</hi> which they prefer before all other Fruits.</p>
               <p>But though they have no Villages, nor movable Houſes, ſuch as may be remov'd from one place to another, as is reported of the <hi>Bedovins</hi> a poor people of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> certain Moors inhabitants on the South-ſide of <hi>Tunis</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and certain Nations of Great-<hi>Tartary;</hi> yet do they often change their Habitations, as the humour takes them; for as ſoon as they take the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt to their Habitations, they immediately tranſplant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome other place; and this is done of a ſudden, and without deſiring any permiſſion of the <hi>Cacick,</hi> as the ancient <hi>Peruvians</hi> were oblig'd to do of their King upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>Among the occaſions of this change of habitation among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Iſlands, one is a perſwaſion that they ſhall have their health better in ſome other place; the ſame cauſe occaſions many times a removal of houſe-keeping among the <hi>Braſilians:</hi> Sometimes it is caus'd by ſome naſtineſs done in their Habitations, for which they conceive a certain horrour; and ſomtimes the death of one of the houſe, which cauſing in them an apprehenſion of going the ſame way, obliges them to take up their Quarters in ſome other place, as if death could not as eaſily meet with them there; but this fooliſh apprehenſion is much more prevalent with the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Continent, who upon ſuch occaſions will be ſure to burn their habitations, and march to ſome other place: This pleaſant Superſtition is obſervable alſo among the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Iſland of <hi>Coraſſao,</hi> though thoſe poor people have receiv'd Baptiſm; for Monſ. <hi>du Montel</hi> relates, That being in the great Village of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> named the <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and having obſerved in two or three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſome houſes without any Inhabitants, though they were not

deficient in ought, and others quite ruined, he asked how thoſe houſes came to be ſo; whereto the <hi>Cacick,</hi> or Captain, made anſwer, That it was becauſe ſome perſons had dy'd in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The ancient <hi>Peruvians</hi> put themſelves to the trouble of ſuch a removal, if their habitations receiv'd any prejudice by Thunder; for then they conceiv'd ſuch an abomination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, that they made up the doors thereof with ſtones and dirt, that no body might ever enter there any more.</p>
               <p>It is reported, That heretofore the men of the Province of <hi>Quito</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi> thought it no ſhame to employ themſelves in all things relating to houſe-keeping, while their Wives went abroad walking at their pleaſures: And the ancient <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did the like, if we may credit <hi>Herodotus:</hi> And we are to acknowledg,<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> that the employment of dreſſing Meat in the Kitchen was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted honourable in ancient <hi>Greece;</hi> for honeſt <hi>Homer</hi> in<note place="margin">Lib. 9.</note> his Iliad repreſents <hi>Achilles</hi> making a <hi>Haſh,</hi> and ſpitting the Meat, and all his Courtiers buſie in the Kitchen for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Embaſſadors of <hi>Agamemnon:</hi> And as to Fiſh, it hath always had this priviledge, that Perſons of Quality have thought it no diſparagement to have a finger in the ordering of it.</p>
               <p>But among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> the men think all theſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments below and unbefitting them; they for the moſt part ſpend the time abroad, but their Wives keep at home, and do all that is requiſite about the houſe: True it is, the men fell down Timber for the building of their Houſes, and when they are built it is their buſineſs to keep them in repair; but the women take care for all things neceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: The men go a hunting and a fiſhing, as we ſhall declare more at large elſwhere; but the women fetch home the Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the place where it was kill'd, and the Fiſh from the Water-ſide: It is the womens work, in fine, to get in <hi>Manioc,</hi> to prepare the <hi>Caſsava,</hi> and the <hi>Ouïcou,</hi> which is their ordinary Drink, to dreſs all the Meat, to ſet the Gardens, and to keep the houſe clean, and all the houſhold-ſtuff in good order; not not to mention the pains they take in painting their Husbands with <hi>Roucou,</hi> and ſpinning Cotton for the uſe of the Family: ſo that they are continually employ'd, and their work is never at an end, while their Husbands divert themſelves abroad; and ſo they are rather to be accounted Slaves then Companions.</p>
               <p>In the Iſlands of S. <hi>Vincent</hi> and <hi>Dominico</hi> there are ſome <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> who have many <hi>Negroes</hi> to their Slaves, as the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and ſome other Nations have; ſome of them they got from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, and ſome from <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore caſt away on their Coaſts; and they call them <hi>Tamons,</hi> that is, <hi>Slaves:</hi> They are ſo well ordered, that they ſerve them in all things about which they are employ'd with as much obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, readineſs, and reſpect, as if they were the moſt civiliz'd people in the World.</p>

                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:58704:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now that we are treating of the Houſes and Houſekeeping of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> ſome might take occaſion to ask, Whether, as we have the uſe of Lamps, Candles, and Torches, they do not alſo make uſe of ſome light, and ſome artifice in the night-time, to ſupply the want of the days light? True it is, they have learnt of the Chriſtians to make uſe of the Oil of Fiſhes, and to put Cotton into Lamps, to light them in the night-time; but moſt of them have no other light in the night than a kind of wood very apt to take fire, which they have ready in the houſe for that purpoſe, whence we call it <hi>Candle-wood;</hi> it is full of an unctuous Gum, which makes it burn like a Candle, and being once lighted, it gives a ſweet ſcent: In like manner the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> inſtead of Candles and Torches, in the night time make uſe of certain Gums which eaſily take fire, and they put them into earthen Creuſets, where they make a delightful and ſweet ſmelling Fire: And if the Fire chance to go out among the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> they have the ſecret of ſupplying that want by rubbing two pieces of <hi>Mahot</hi> one againſt the other, and by that colliſion they take fire, and in a ſhort time burn into a clear flame: Thus the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> inſteed of a Steel and<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> Stone, the uſe whereof they have not, make uſe of two ſeveral kinds of Wood, whereof one is almoſt as tender as if it were half rotten, and the other, on the contrary, very hard; and by that friction and agitation the fire takes in the former: The ſame thing is affirm'd of ſome ſorts of Canes, which may be ſeen in the Cabinets of the Curious.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have ſail'd to the mouth of the River of the <hi>Amazones</hi> relate, that they there ſaw ſome <hi>Indians</hi> ſtrike fire with two ſticks, but after a manner different from that of our <hi>Caribbians;</hi> for in that part of the World they have alſo two pieces of Wood, one ſoft, which they make flat and even like a Buſk, and the other very hard, like a ſtick ſharpened at the end, which they thruſt into the ſoft, which they keep cloſe to the ground under their feet; and they turn the other with both hands ſo ſwiftly, that at laſt the fire takes in that below, and ſets it of a flame: And whereas it many times happens one perſon may be weary of that exerciſe, another immediately takes the ſtick in hand, and turns it with the ſame ſwiftneſs, till they have got fire. Some may imagine, that theſe ways of lighting fire are modern; but there are ſome marks thereof in Antiquity, as may be ſeen in <hi>Theophraſtus.</hi>

               <p>MOſt of thoſe people who have the denomination of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> are gluttonous and beaſtly in their Repaſts: The <hi>Braſilians</hi> eat and drink exceſſively, naſtily, and<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> at all hours, nay they riſe many times in the night to that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: The <hi>Canadians</hi> are ſuch gluttons, that they eat till<note place="margin">Relation of New-France.</note> they are ready to burſt; nay they are ſo ravenous, that they will not loſe ſo much as the skimmings of the Pot: They are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen either to waſh their hands, or the meat they eat: They have no other napkins than the hair of their own heads, or that of their dogs, or the firſt thing they meet with: The <hi>Grand-Tartars</hi> do the like: They never waſh their Diſhes or Kettles,<note place="margin">Rubriques &amp; Carpin.</note> but with the pottage made in them, and are ſo naſty that what they do is not be related: The other <hi>Tartars</hi> come not much<note place="margin">Busbequius, Des Hayes, &amp; Bergeron</note> ſhort of them in naſtineſs and gluttony, uſing their hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſpoons to take up their pottage, and eating the fleſh of dead horſes, without any other dreſſing than ſetting of it an hour or two between their ſaddles and horſes-backs. In like<note place="margin">Vin. leBlanc. &amp; Garci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſo.</note> manner (to make an end of theſe ſlovenly inſtances) the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Guinny,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> and certain other Savages eat raw and ſtinking fleſh, together with the hair and feathers, guts and garbage, like ſo many dogs: But we are to give our <hi>Caribbians</hi> this commendation, that they are temperate and cleanly in their ordinary Repaſts, as well as thoſe of the Continent, though ſome among them deſerve not this elogy, as there is no rule ſo general but may have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Monſieur <hi>du Montel,</hi> a worthy and faithful witneſs, gives this teſtimony of ſobriety and cleanlineſs to thoſe whom he had ſeen at St. <hi>Vincents</hi> and elſewhere: But as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they are not all ſuch; for thoſe who have ſeen them at <hi>Dominico</hi> give them not the ſame Character.</p>
               <p>This people eat many times together in a publick houſe, as we ſhall ſee more particularly hereafter, either upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of divertiſement and to be more than ordinarily merry, or to diſcourſe concerning their wars and common affairs, as the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were heretofore wont to do: The women, according to the cuſtome of ſome other barbarous Countries, eat not till their husbands have done, and they have no ſet time for their Repaſts: Their ſtomacks are their Clocks and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers: They ſo patiently endure hunger, that after they are returned from fiſhing they will have the patience to broil their fiſh over a ſoft fire on a wooden frame made like a
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58704:163"/>
Gridiron, about two foot high, under which they kindle ſo ſmall a fire, that ſometimes it requires a whole day to make ready their fiſh as they would have it: Some of the <hi>French</hi> affirm, that have eaten ſome of their dreſſing, they have lik'd it very well: It is obſervable generally in all their meat, that they dreſs all with a very gentle fire.</p>
               <p>They commonly eat ſitting on low ſtools, and every one hath his little table by himſelf, which they call <hi>Matoutou,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirms, that it was practiſed among the ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> and as it is reported at this day to be done in <hi>Japan:</hi> Sometimes alſo they eat their meat on the ground, kneeling round one by another: For Table-cloths, they have no linnen, as we have, nor skins, as the <hi>Canadians;</hi> nor Mats as the <hi>Maldiveſes,</hi> nor Carpets as the <hi>Turks</hi> and ſome other Nations, but fair and large <hi>Banana</hi>-leaves newly gathered, which are very fit for Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths, being ſo large as we have repreſented elſewhere: the ſame ſerve alſo for Napkins, and they wipe their hands there with: They are alwaies very careful to waſh their hands before meals: And when they are about the dreſſing of any meat, they never touch any thing that is to be eaten, ere they make their hands clean: In fine, in all their ordinary Repaſts, their ſobriety and cleanlineſs is ſo obſervable as can hardly be imagined among Savages.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid elſewhere that their ordinary bread is a thin Cake which they call <hi>Caſſava,</hi> made of the <hi>Manioc</hi>-root: Other Writers have ſet down the manner how it is made; yet that our Hiſtory may not be thought imperfect, we ſhall here give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the compoſition thereof: The root, though it be ſometimes about the bigneſs of a mans thigh, is eaſily got out of the ground: Aſſoon as it is taken out it is ſcraped with a knife to take off a little hard skin which covers it, and then it is ſcraped or filed with with a Raſp or flat File of Iron or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, of a good bigneſs; and they preſs the meal which comes from it in a linnen bag, or in a long kind of pokes, which they call in the Iſlands, <hi>Snakes,</hi> neatly woven of Ruſhes or <hi>Latanier</hi> leaves by the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> that the juice may be ſqueezed out of it: The Savages before they knew the uſe of thoſe Raſps, made uſe inſtead thereof, of certain hard and ſharp ſtones which are to be found on the ſea-ſhore: They are ſomewhat like our Pumice-ſtones: When the moiſture of the <hi>Manioc</hi> is got out, the meal is ſifted through a coarſe cloth, and without mixing it with any liquor, it is put upon an Iron Plate, or Plank, and ſometimes on a broad ſtone, under which there is fire; when it is baked on one ſide, they turn it on the other; and when it is fully baked, it is expoſed to the Sun to make it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it may keep the better: It is commonly made no thicker than a mans little finger, and ſometimes thinner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fancy of the Inhabitants: It will keep many
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58704:163"/>
months; but it eats beſt after a day or two making; there are ſome who would rather eat of it than of our ordinary bread: And the greateſt miracle is, that of a root ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of it ſelf people ſhould by artifice get ſo excellent nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: Thus the <hi>Moors</hi> drying a kind of poiſonous Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks which grow in their Country, in the Sun, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards boiling them over a fire, make a certain drink thereof, which is pleaſant and may be drunk without any danger.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Caſſava</hi> which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> make is very delicate; for they have ſo much patience to go through with any thing they undertake, that they do better than the <hi>French,</hi> who are ſo haſty, that they would make an end of any thing aſſoon as they have begun it: But the <hi>Caribbians</hi> go leaſurely to work, and never conſider the time ſpent, ſo the buſineſs be done to their minds.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome <hi>Europaeans</hi> who have uſed <hi>Caſſava,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that it is no good nouriſhment, that it injures the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, corrupts the blood, changes the colour, weakens the nerves, and dries the body; it is to be conſidered, that as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is a ſecond nature, ſo that many things, though bad in themſelves, do not prejudice health when one is accuſtomed thereto; ſo on the contrary, thoſe which are good and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, nay the beſt of their own nature, if a man be not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed thereto, are many times prejudicial and hurtful: To confirm this truth, it is to be attributed to want of cuſtom, what is related by ſome Hiſtorians of certain <hi>Braſilians,</hi> who being ſhut up with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Fort, could not brook the bread and other proviſions diſtributed to them as Soldiers, and on which it was neceſſary they ſhould ſubſiſt, and complained that they made them ſick, and were the occaſions of their death: To this purpoſe there is a remarkable paſſage in the Travels of Monſieur <hi>des Hayes</hi> into the <hi>Levant;</hi> to wit that the ſaid perſon entertaining ſome <hi>Tartars</hi> at his Table, who knew not what bread was, cauſed them to eat ſome; for within two hours after, they thought they ſhould have dyed when the bread they had eaten began to ſwell, and to cauſe them great pains.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of bread among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> made of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wheat which they call <hi>Mais:</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the <hi>Barmouthos</hi> uſe no other: There are ſome alſo who inſtead of bread eat the root called Potatoe, whereof we have given a deſcription elſewhere.</p>
               <p>As concerning the other proviſions uſed by the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> their moſt ordinary diſhes, and which are uſed alſo by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> of the Continent, are Lizards, Fiſh of all ſorts, Tortoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes only excepted; and Pulſe, as Peaſe, Beans, &amp;c. but their ordinary food (contrary to the Inhabitants of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> who have a horrour for that kind of ſuſtenance) is Crabs, got very
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58704:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
clean out of their ſhells, and fryed with their own fat, juice of Citron, and Pyman, which they are great lovers of, and which they put abundantly into all their ſawces: And yet when they entertain the <hi>French,</hi> or other <hi>Europaeans,</hi> they are not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal thereof, and then they accomodate themſelves to their palates, out of a compliance and diſcretion, which argues them to be ſomewhat better than Savages. They call the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the Crab <hi>Taumaly;</hi> and of that it is they make their ordinary Ragouſt with water, the fine flower of <hi>Manioc,</hi> and good ſtore of <hi>Pyman.</hi> In the laſt courſe they bring in fruits as we do; and ordinarily they content themſelves with Figs, Bananas, or Ananas: If they eat fleſh or any thing that is ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is only out of compliance with ſtrangers, to avoid being troubleſome to thoſe who entertain them, and ſo they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves to their humours who come to viſit them; for then they order moſt of their meat to pleaſe them: And to this muſt be referred what we have ſaid concerning their not eating of ſalt, Swines-fleſh, Tortoiſes, and <hi>Lamantin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is, there are among this people certain men extreamly ſlothful and melancholy, who lead a wretched kind of life: For they live only upon <hi>Burgaus, Shell-fiſh, Crabbes, Soldier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and ſuch like Inſects: They never eat any Pottage, nor Fleſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be that of certain birds which they broil on the coals with their Feathers about them, and their Guts within them; and all the Sawce they uſe conſiſts of the water of <hi>Manioc</hi> (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boiled loſes its venemous quality) fine flower of the ſame <hi>Manioc,</hi> and good ſtore of <hi>Pyman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes they have a deteſtable kind of ſeaſoning for their meats, and that is the fat of the <hi>Arouagues</hi> their irreconcileable Enemies: But this hath no place in their ordinary Repaſts, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed only on ſolemn days of debauches and rejoicing.</p>
               <p>As to their drink, as they do in ſeveral parts of <hi>America,</hi> the ſame grains of <hi>Mais</hi> which ſerve to make bread, are uſed for the compoſition of a Drink which is accounted as good as Wine; and as among us the Wheat which makes Bread will alſo make Beer; ſo in theſe Iſlands, of the Roots of <hi>Potatoes</hi> and <hi>Manioc,</hi> which ſerve to make Bread, there are made two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of Drinks, which are ordinary in the Country: The former and moſt common, which is made of <hi>Potatoes</hi> boiled with water, is called <hi>Maby:</hi> It is excellent good to refreſh and quench thirſt, and it hath alſo an appetitive vertue, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes an evacuation of the ſandineſs, and all the viſcoſities of the lower parts: Whence it comes, that thoſe who make uſe of that Drink, never complain of the Stone or Gravel: The other Drink is called <hi>Ouïcon</hi> (from a name coming neer the <hi>Caouin</hi> of the <hi>Braſilians</hi>) and is made of the <hi>Caſſava</hi> it ſelf, boiled in like manner with water: It is ſtrained through a coarſe cloth, which the Savages call <hi>Hibichet:</hi> This Drink is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two ſorts of Drinks which are the moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> there are alſo made in divers places ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of delicious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wines: The <hi>Negroes,</hi> who are ſlaves in theſe Iſlands, make inciſions in the prickly Palms, out of which there diſtils a certain liquor like White-wine, which they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſeveral little Gourds faſten'd to the overtures of thoſe trees, whereof each will yield two pints every day, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more: The moſt ancient Authors aſſure us, that among the <hi>Eaſt-Indians,</hi> the Wine of Palms was very much in uſe, as indeed it is at this day: It is alſo uſed in ſome parts of <hi>Africk,</hi> as at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomotapa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover there is in the <hi>Caribbies</hi> another kind of Drink made of <hi>Bananas,</hi> which is alſo in other parts, and by ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Couſcou:</hi> But in regard this ſort of Wine, though very pleaſant and ſtrong, cauſes great ventoſities, it is not much uſed.</p>
               <p>To conclude, there is made in theſe Iſlands an excellent kind of Wine of thoſe precious Reeds out of which the Sugar is gotten: And this is the moſt eſteemed Drink of any made in the <hi>Caribbies:</hi> It is called by ſome <hi>Cane-wine,</hi> and there is a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58704:165"/>
particular ſecret in the making of it: There is more made at S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> then any where elſe, by reaſon of the abundance of Canes planted there: The juice of theſe Canes is got out by a Mill made purpoſely for that uſe; afterwards it is purified by fire in great Caldrons: It may be kept a long time in its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and it hath a ſweetneſs, and withal a certain picquancy, which might make it paſs for Sack. Of the ſame Canes there is alſo made a certain <hi>Aquavitae</hi> called <hi>Cane-Aquavitae,</hi> which keeps better then the Wine of thoſe ſame Reeds.</p>
               <p>There is not any thing in the ſubſtance of theſe ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts of our <hi>Caribbians,</hi> which ſeem to ſavour of the Savage, unleſs it be haply the Lizards; But why may not they be as good Meat as the Frogs and Snails eaten in ſome parts of <hi>France?</hi> And who knows not that in <hi>Spain</hi> they eat abundance of young Aſſes? Nay, compare the ſuſtenance of our <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with that of the <hi>Canadians,</hi> who, beſides the skimmings of the Pot, which we ſaid they eat, do commonly drink filthy and naſty greaſe, and prefer the fleſh of Bears before any other; with that of the Inhabitants of the Iſland of <hi>Good-fortune,</hi> one of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> who eat abundance of Suet; with that of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> the <hi>Huancas,</hi> a Nation of <hi>Peru,</hi> of the Negroes of <hi>Angola,</hi> who commonly live on the fleſh of Horſes, Cammels, Mules, Wolves, Foxes, Aſſes, Dogs, and drink the Blood of thoſe Creatures; with that of the <hi>Eaſt-Indians,</hi> who think the Fleſh of Bats and Mice as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious as that of Partridges; with that of the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> who feed on Toads, Rats, and Worms; or, laſtly, with that of the <hi>Tapuyes,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who eat hair minc'd very ſmall, and mix'd with wild honey, and ſeaſon all their Meat with the aſhes of the burnt Bodies of their deceas'd Relations, and mix them with the meal they bake, which cauſes horrour only to repreſent, much more to do: Let there be, I ſay, a compariſon made between all theſe infamous Ragouts, and thoſe of the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Nation, and it will be found, that in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commons there is nothing barbarous: Yet are we not to diſſemble what ſome of the <hi>French</hi> relate, to wit, That they have ſeen the <hi>Caribbians</hi> eating the Lice and <hi>Chegoes</hi> they had taken; as it is reported of the <hi>Mexicans</hi> and <hi>Cumaneſes:</hi> but they do not make their Ordinary out of them, and it is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular only to ſome among them; beſides that they do it not out of any delicacy they find in thoſe Vermine, but only to be revenged of them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the horrour which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> conceiv'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore at the eating of Swines-fleſh, Tortoiſes, and Lamantin, for the pleaſant reaſons before alledged, was ſo great, that if any of the <hi>Europaeans</hi> had got them to eat any of them by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and they came afterwards to know it, they would be reveng'd of them one time or other; witneſs what happened to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58704:165"/>
a perſon of ſome note among the <hi>French:</hi> This perſon receiving a Viſit from the <hi>Cacick</hi> or Captain of the Savages of the Iſland where he liv'd, entertain'd him in jeſt with <hi>Lamantin,</hi> diſguis'd in the faſhion of a Haſh; the <hi>Cacick</hi> miſtruſting what indeed afterwards happened to him, intreated the Gentleman not to deceive him; and upon the aſſurance given him thereof, he made no difficulty to eat: after Dinner the Gentleman diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the abuſe to the <hi>Cacick</hi> and his Company, that he might have the pleaſure of their Diſcourſes thereupon, and ſee what faces they would make after ſuch a Treatment; but they had at that time ſo much power over themſelves as to ſmother their indignation, and the <hi>Cacick</hi> only ſaid to him ſmiling, <hi>Well Friend we ſhall not dye of it:</hi> Some time after the Gentleman went to return him his Viſit; he receiv'd him with great civility, and made him extraordinary cheer; but he had given his people order to put into all the Sauces ſome fat of the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> whereof the principal <hi>Indians</hi> are always well provided: After this infamous Repaſte was ended, the <hi>Cacick,</hi> glad in his heart, ask'd the Gentleman and his Company how they lik'd his Treatment; whereupon they commending it very much, and giving him thanks for it, he acquainted them with the trick he had put upon them; moſt of them were ſo troubled at the thought of it, and had ſuch an inclination to caſt up all they had eaten, that they grew very ſick; but the <hi>Indian</hi> laughing at the ſpectacle, told them that he was then reveng'd.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have lately been among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico</hi> and <hi>Martinico</hi> affirm, That now moſt of them make no difficulty to eat <hi>Lamantin,</hi> Tortoiſes, and Swines-fleſh, nay, all other Meats in uſe among the <hi>Europaeans;</hi> and that they laugh at the ſimplicity which oblig'd them to abſtain from them, for fear of participating of the nature and qualities of thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
               <p>They have alſo remitted much of that ſeverity which they uſed towards their Wives; for now they are ſeldom ſeen to fetch home the Fiſh their Husbands had taken: And when they have been a fiſhing, the Husband and Wife eat together: The Women go alſo oftener to the <hi>Carbet,</hi> to participate of the Feaſt and the publick rejoycing there made, then they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Husbands became ſo familiarly acquainted with Strangers.</p>

               <p>But our <hi>Caribbians</hi> are not like theſe laſt; for they are found taking pains and their pleaſure in ſeveral ſorts of exerciſes: The chiefeſt, and thoſe which are moſt ordinary among them are Hunting and Fiſhing, wherein they beſtow the greateſt part of their time, but eſpecially in Fiſhing: They are ſeldom ſeen to go out of their Houſes without their Bows and Arrows; and they are wonderfully expert in the uſe of them, being accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to that exerciſe from their Infancy, as the <hi>Turks</hi> alſo are; whence it comes, that in time they come to be ſo excellent at the Bow, that within a hundred paces they will hardly ever fail ſtriking a half-Crown piece; nay, as they are making their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat they can do execution on their Enemies, as the <hi>Parthians</hi> were ſomtimes wont to do: How much therefore are we the more to wonder at thoſe <hi>left-handed</hi> Benjamites, <hi>who could</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 20. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>ſling ſtones at an hairs-breadth, and not miſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Caribbians</hi> go abroad a hunting or a fiſhing, they do not take their Wives along with them, as ſome <hi>Braſilians</hi> do, who cauſe theirs to walk before them, ſo great is their jealouſie; but when they have taken any thing, they leave it upon the place, and the Women were heretofore oblig'd to go and bring it home, as we have already hinted: It is reported that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadians</hi> do the ſame.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Iſlands there is no diſtinction of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:58704:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
quality as to Hunting; but the exerciſe of it is as free to the meaneſt as to the greateſt among them: The caſe is the ſame among all the other <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in their private Repaſts they never uſe no kind of Fleſh, if they have not Strangers to entertain, ſo ordinarily their hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is only for Lizards; and if they engage themſelves in any other kind of hunting, it is upon ſome extraordinary occaſions, when they would treat ſome of their Friends among the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paeans,</hi> or when they intend to viſit them, and would get ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them in exchange for what they had taken.</p>
               <p>They are extreamly expert in fiſhing with the Hook, and in taking of Fiſh with the Dart; and a man cannot ſufficiently admire their patience in that Exerciſe; for they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to continue half a day in the ſame place, without betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any wearineſs: And when, after they have waited a long time for the Fiſh, they come at length to perceive ſome great one to their mind, and within their reach, they caſt the Dart at it, as the <hi>Braſilians</hi> do; which having faſtned, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately leap into the water after the Dart, to ſeize their prey: But beſides the Hook and Dart wherewith they take Fiſh, they are alſo very excellent in diving neer the Rocks, and forcing them out of the holes where they ſhelter themſelves; as being in that particular equally expert with the <hi>Floridians,</hi> who, not<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 12. Acoſta, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 15. Fr. Pirard, <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> expecting that the Fiſh ſhould come and ſhew themſelves, go and find them out in the bottom of the water, and there kill them with their Clubs; ſo that they are ſeen coming up again with the Fiſh in one hand, and the Club in the other. 'Tis a common thing among the Savages to be excellent Swimmers and Divers; and it is particularly affirm'd of the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> the <hi>Maldiveſes,</hi> ſome <hi>Peruvians,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the Iſlands of <hi>Robbers,</hi> that they may paſs for a kind of amphibious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>But if the other inventions for fiſhing ſhould fail our <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> they have their recourſe to a certain wood, which they bruiſe after they have cut it into little pieces; which done, they caſt it into Ponds, or thoſe places where the Sea is quiet and calm; and this is as it were a Sovereign Mummy, wherewith they take as much Fiſh as they pleaſe; but they are ſo prudent as not to make uſe of this laſt expedient but only in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, for fear of making too great a waſte among the Fiſh.</p>
               <p>After Hunting and Fiſhing, they apply themſelves to ſeveral kinds of Works, as to make Beds of Cotton, very neatly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which they call <hi>Amaes:</hi> The Women ſpin the Cotton on the knee, and commonly they make uſe of neither Diſtaff nor Spindle; but ſome of them in the Iſland of <hi>Martinico</hi> have learn'd the uſe thereof of the <hi>French:</hi> They have alſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Art of twiſting it; but in ſome Iſlands the Men weave the Beds: Beſides this, they make Baskets of Bull-ruſhes, and Graſs,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:58704:167"/>
of divers colours; wooden chairs all of one piece; little Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which they call <hi>Matoutou,</hi> weav'd of the leaves of the <hi>Latanier</hi>-tree; the ſtraining-cloths called <hi>Hibichets;</hi> the <hi>Cato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> which are a kind of great baſkets to carry things on the back; ſeveral ſorts of Veſſels fit for eating and drinking, which are poliſh'd, painted, and adorn'd with abundance of pretty figures delightful to the eye: They make alſo ſome other little ornaments, as Girdles, Hats, and Crowns of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wherewith they ſet out themſelves on ſolemn days: And the women make for themſelves a kind of Buſkins, or half-ſtockings of Cotton. But above all they take abundance of pains in ordering and poliſhing their Arms, that is, their Bows, their Arrows, and their <hi>Boutous</hi> or Clubs, which are of a hard and ſmooth wood, and neatly wrought about the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with wood and bones of divers colours.</p>
               <p>They take no leſs pains about their <hi>Piragas,</hi> or Veſſels wherein they go to Sea, and whatever belongs to Peace or War. Theſe Veſſels are made of one great Tree, which they make hollow, ſmooth, and poliſh with an unimaginable dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: The greater ſort of <hi>Piragas</hi> are many times rais'd higher all about, eſpecially towards the poop, with ſome planks: Sometimes they paint in them their <hi>Maboya;</hi> ſometimes they repreſent Savages, or ſome other fantaſtick figures. Theſe Shallops are ſo large as many times to carry fifty men with all their Arms. Before they had any acquaintance with the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> who furniſh'd them with all ſorts of Wedges, and other Carpenters and Joyners tools, they were put to a great deal of trouble to make their Veſſels; for they were oblig'd, as the <hi>Virginians,</hi> and ſome other Savages were, to ſet fire at the foot<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> of the Trees, and to compaſs them about a little above the foot with wet moſs, to keep the fire from aſcending; and ſo they undermin'd the Tree by little and little: Afterwards to pierce the wood they us'd certain hard ſtones ſharpened at one end, wherewith they cut and made their <hi>Piragas</hi> hollow, but with ſo great trouble and expence of time, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how much they are oblig'd to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who have taught them eaſier ways to do it, by the iron-inſtruments wherewith they have ſupply'd them. Thence it came that the <hi>Peruvians</hi> thought it ſo great a happineſs to have the tools<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Comment. Royal,</hi> l. 1. c. 11.</note> which were brought them by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> that the uſe of Sciſſers being introduc'd into <hi>Peru</hi> by the means of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> of Quality admiring the invention, ſaid to one of them, That though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not furniſh them with any thing but Raſors, Sciſſers, Combs and Looking-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it ſufficiently oblig'd them liberally to beſtow on them all the gold and ſilver they had.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> employ themſelves alſo in making earthen Pots of all ſorts, which they bake in furnaces, as our Potters
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58704:167"/>
do: And of the ſame material they alſo make thoſe Plates or Planks on which they bake the <hi>Caſſava.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The dexterity they expreſs in theſe little Exerciſes, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diſcovery that they would eaſily learn other Trades, if they were taught them. They delight very much in handling the tools of Carpenters and Joyners; and though they have not been taught how they are to be us'd, yet are they able to do many things ſince the <hi>Europeans</hi> have ſupply'd them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: So that it is to be preſum'd, that if they had good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they would do well at thoſe Trades.</p>
               <p>They are great Lovers of divertiſements and recreation; and thence it comes they ſeek after whatever may keep them in a good humour, and divert melancholy: To that purpoſe they take a pleaſure in keeping and teaching a great number of Parrots and Paraquitos.</p>
               <p>To divert themſelves they alſo make ſeveral Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if they may be ſo called, on which they make a kind of harmony: Among others they have certain Tabours or Drums made of hollow Trees, over which they put a ſkin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at one end: To this may be added a kind of Organ which they make of Gourds, upon which they place a cord made of the ſtring of a reed which they call <hi>Pite;</hi> and this cord being touch'd makes a ſound which they think delightful. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certs of divers other Savages are no better then theirs, and no leſs immuſical to their ears who underſtand Muſick. In the morning, as ſoon as they are up, they commonly play on the Flute or Pipe; of which Inſtrument they have ſeveral ſorts, as well poliſh'd and as handſom as ours, and ſome of thoſe made of the bones of their Enemies: And many among them can play with as much grace as can well be imagin'd for Savages. While they are playing on the Flute, the Wives are buſie in making ready their breakfaſt.</p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo they paſs away the time in ſinging certain Airs, the burthens whereof are pleaſant enough; and in that Exerciſe they ſometimes ſpend half a day together, ſitting on their low ſtools, and looking on their fiſh while it is broiling. They alſo put peaſe or ſmall pebble-ſtones, as the <hi>Virginians</hi> do, into gourds, through the midſt whereof they put a ſtick which ſerves for a handle, and then ſhaking them they make a noiſe: This is the invention the women have to quiet their children. Moſt of the <hi>Caribbian</hi> Songs conſiſt of bitter raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries againſt their Enemies; ſome they have alſo on Birds, and Fiſhes, and Women, commonly intermixt with ſome bawdery; and many of them have neither rhime nor reaſon.</p>
               <p>Many times alſo the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Iſlands joyn Dancing to their Muſick, but that Dancing is regulated according to their Muſick. There are ſome Barbarians exceſſively addicted to that Exerciſe, as for inſtance the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> who, as <hi>de Lery</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:58704:168"/>
affirms, ſpend day and night in dancing: And we have ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that there are many Savages who make their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry felicity of the other life to conſiſt in dancing.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Caribbians</hi> uſe Dancing particularly at their ſolemn Entertainments in their <hi>Carbet,</hi> or publick houſe. Theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments are ordered after this manner: Some days before the meeting the Captain gives notice to every houſe, that all may appear at the <hi>Carbet</hi> at the day appointed: In the mean time the Women make a kind of ſtrong drink of bak'd <hi>Caſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and better prepar'd then that which they ordinarily drink; and as they adde to the doſe of the Ingredients, ſo is the drink the ſtronger, and more apt to intoxicate: The men go a fiſhing, or catching of Lizards; for as to other meat they ſeldom prepare any for their own Tables, unleſs they have Strangers to entertain: On the day appointed both men and women paint their bodies with divers colours and figures, and adorn themſelves with their Crowns of Feathers, their richeſt Chains, Pendants, Bracelets, and other Ornaments: Thoſe among them who would appear moſt gallant rub their bodies with a certain Gum, and blow the Down of diverſe Birds upon it. In fine, they all put on their beſt faces, and endeavour to make the greateſt ſhew they can at this ſolemnity, priding it in their Plumes, and all their other gallantry: The women bring thither the Drink and Meſſes they have prepared, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly careful that nothing be wanting, which may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the ſolemn entertainment: Our <hi>Caribbians</hi> ſpend all that day and the beſt part of the night in eating and drinking, dancing, diſcourſing and laughing: And in this Debauch they drink much more than ordinary, that is, they make a ſhift to get drunk; and the women will not be much behind them, eſpecially when they can get any Wine, or <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the work: So that what we have ſaid of their ordinary ſobriety holds not at theſe Meetings; no more than it does at their going to their Wars, and at their return thence: and yet take them at the worſt, their exceſſes come much ſhort of thoſe of the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> who in their Debauches drink three or four days without ceaſing, and in their drunkenneſs engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all kind of Vices.</p>
               <p>Their drunkennneſs and their debauches are frequent, as hapning upon theſe ſeveral occaſions: 1. When there is any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel held concerning their Wars: 2. When they return from their Expeditions, whether they have prov'd ſucceſsful or not: 3. Upon the birth of their firſt Male Children: 4. When they cut their Childrens hair: 5. When they are at age to go to the Wars: 6. When they cut down trees, in order to the making of a Garden and building of a Houſe: 7. When they launch a new Veſſel: And laſtly when they are recovered of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: They call theſe aſſemblies <hi>Ouïcou,</hi> and ſince they have converſed with the <hi>French, Vin,</hi> that is, <hi>Wine.</hi>

                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:58704:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>But on the contrary they have alſo their Faſts, wherein they betray the ridiculouſneſs of their humour: For, 1. they faſt when they enter into adoleſcency: 2. When they are made Captains: 3. At the death of their Fathers or Mothers: 4. At the death of the Husband or Wife: 5. When they have killed one of their Enemies the <hi>Arouagues;</hi> this laſt occaſion of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they glory very much in.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Entertainment which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> make thoſe who come to viſit them.</head>
               <p>HEre it is that our <hi>Caribbians</hi> triumph over all other Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in point of civility: For they receive ſtrangers, who come to their Iſlands to viſit them, with all manner of kindneſs and teſtimonies of affection.</p>
               <p>They have ſentinels all along the Sea-ſide in moſt of thoſe Iſlands whereof they are ſolely poſſeſſed: Theſe ſentinels are placed on the Mountains, or ſuch eminent places whence they may ſee a good way into the Sea; and they are ſo diſpos'd, that they overlook thoſe places where there is good anchorage for Ships, and an eaſie deſcent for men to land: Aſſoon as ever theſe perceive a Ship or Shallop coming towards them, they give notice thereof to ſuch of their people as are next to them: Whereupon of a ſudden there come out together ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows or Veſſels, in each whereof there are not above three men at moſt, who are ſent out to diſcover what they are, and call to them at a diſtance to declare themſelves; for they truſt not the Flagg, as having been often deceived thereby: and they know by their voices whether they be <hi>French, Spaniards, Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch.</hi> Some affirm, that the <hi>Braſilians</hi> and the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvians</hi> are ſo exact in their ſmelling, that they will diſcern a <hi>French-man</hi> from a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by the ſcent.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Caribbians</hi> are not well-aſſured who they are who come towards them, and perceive that they intend them ſome miſchief, they put themſelves into a poſture of defence, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of the narroweſt avenues of their Country, place ambuſhes in the Woods, and without being perceiv'd keep an eye on their Enemies, retreating through obſcure waies till they have found their advantage, and joined all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together; and then they let flie a ſhower of Arrows on their Enemies: That done, they ſurround them, cloſe with them, and cut them all off with their Clubs: In ſome Iſlands they make
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58704:169"/>
up a body of fifteen hundred men and more, as may be gueſs'd by their appearance; for their number cannot be certainly known, inaſmuch as they themſelves not knowing how to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot tell what numbers they are: But if they are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Enemies, they get into the Woods, or climb up Rocks that are inacceſſible to all others; or if they are neer the Sea, they leap in and dive, and riſe up again at a hundred, nay ſometimes two hundred paces from the place where they had been ſeen: And afterwards they rally together, at certain Rendezvouſes known to themſelves, and charge afreſh when it is leaſt expected, and when they were thought to be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly routed.</p>
               <p>But when they find thoſe coming to them to be friends who come only to viſit them, after they have cry'd to them that they are welcome, ſome caſt themſelves into the water and ſwim to them, enter into their Veſſel, and when they come neer land proffer to carry them aſhore on their backs, as an aſſurance of their affection: In the mean time the Captain himſelf, or his Lieutenant, expects them on the ſhore, and receives them in the name of the whole Iſland: Thence they are conducted by a conſiderable number of them to the <hi>Carbet,</hi> which is as it were the Town-Houſe, where the Inhabitants of the Iſland, every one according to the age and ſex of the New-comers, bid them welcome: The old Man complements and makes much of the old Man; the young Man and Maid do the like towards thoſe of their age; and a man may read in their countenances how much they are ſatisfied with the viſit.</p>
               <p>But the firſt diſcourſe they make to the Stranger is to ask him his name, and then to tell him theirs: And for an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of great affection and inviolable friendship, they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the names of thoſe whom they entertain: But to crown the Ceremony, they will have the perſon whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in like manner to aſſume their name: Thus they make an exchange of names; and they have ſuch excellent memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ten years after ſuch a meeting they will remember the names of their friends, and relate ſome circumſtance of what had paſſed at the former interview: And if they were preſented with any thing, they will be ſure to call it to mind; and if the thing be ſtill in being, they will ſhew it to him who had beſtowed it on them.</p>
               <p>After all theſe complements which are paſſed at the firſt meeting, the next is to preſent their Gueſts with thoſe penſile Beds which they call <hi>Amais,</hi> very clean and white, whereof they have ſtore againſt ſuch occaſions: They deſire them to reſt themſelves thereon, and then they bring in Fruits; and while ſome are buſie preparing ſome treatment, others entertain them with diſcourſe, obſerving ſtill the conformity of age and ſex.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:58704:169"/>This kind of entertainment may well be accounted more rational than that of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Southerly part of Continent, who receive their Gueſts after a very odd faſhion, not much unlike what is practiſed by the <hi>Canadians:</hi> For the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cick</hi> of thoſe <hi>Caribbians</hi> conducts him who comes to ſee them to the Publick-houſe, without ſpeaking at all to him: then he is preſented with a ſtool and ſome Tobacco, and ſo they leave him for a time, without ſpeaking a word to him, till he hath reſted himſelf and taken his Tobacco: Then the <hi>Cacick</hi> comes and asks him, whether he be come? The other anſwering yes, he ſits down by him and falls into diſcourſe: Afterwards thoſe of the common ſort come asking him after the ſame manner, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be come? And having thereupon brought him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat, they alſo fall into diſcourſe with him: True it is indeed, that our Inſulary <hi>Caribbians,</hi> in the reception of their Gueſts, towards thoſe of their own Nation, who are ſtrangers in their Iſlands, practiſe the ſame thing as the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Continent: But when they entertain <hi>French</hi> and other <hi>Europ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who would be loth to keep ſilence ſo long, they ſpeak to them, and fall immediately into diſcourſe, as we ſaid before, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating themſelves to their humour, and, to comply with them, croſſing the rules of their own Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>But the Banquet they intend them was prepared before hand, let us now ſee how it is ordered, and how they demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein: They give every one his little Table, and his<note place="margin">Trigaut, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> Meſſes apart, as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do: Somebring in broil'd Lizards; others, fry'd Crabs; ſome, Pulſe; and others, Fruits, and ſo of the reſt: During the Repaſt, they diſcourſe with them, and wait on them with the greateſt care imaginable: They think it the greateſt kindneſs can be done them to eat and drink hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and all their buſineſs is to fill the Cups, and ſee that every Table be furniſhed: When a man drinks he muſt take all off, otherwiſe they are diſobliged; and if one cannot eat all the <hi>Caſſava</hi> that is given him, he muſt put up the reſt and carry it<note place="margin">Rusbequius, <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</note> along with him, otherwiſe they will take it unkindly: Thus the <hi>Turks</hi> when they are at a friends Table, are wont to fill their Handkerchers, and ſometimes the ſleeves of their Garments with fragments of meat and bread, which they carry away with them. And among the <hi>Grand-Tartars,</hi> when a Gueſt cannot eat all<note place="margin">Rubriques <hi>in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels into</hi> Tartary.</note> that is preſented to him, he muſt give the remainders to his Servant to lay up for him, or carry it away himſelf in his bag or pouch, wherein he puts up alſo the bones, if he hath not pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them clean enough, that he may afterwards do it at his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But among the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> when the Gueſt goes home, the Servants of the perſon who invited him, carries along with him the diſhes that were left.</p>
               <p>After the Repaſt, the <hi>Caribbians</hi> conduct you to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſes, and into their Gardens, ſhew you their Arms,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58704:170"/>
their curioſities and their trinkets, and preſent you with Fruits, or ſome little pieces of their own workmanſhip.</p>
               <p>If any one be deſirous to continue a while among them, they take it for a great favour, and are extreamly glad of it, and find the ſame treatment as at firſt: But if they are willing to be gone from them, they are troubled, and ask whether you diſlike your entertainment, that you ſhould be gone ſo ſoon. With that ſad countenance they all re-conduct you to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, nay will carry you into your Shallops, if you will ſuffer it: And at that final parting they again preſent you with fruits, which they force you to accept, ſaying to thoſe who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them, <hi>Friend, if thou hast no need of it thy ſelf, thou mayſt give it to thy Marriners;</hi> ſo they call all the Servants and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of thoſe to whom they ſpeak. The <hi>Braſilians</hi> and the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> as ſome affirm, do alſo make preſents upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: And <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates, that the ancient <hi>Germans</hi> made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the Strangers who came to viſit them; but they reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally demanded ſomething of them: In this point the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> ſhew themſelves more generous, for they give, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing back in lieu of it.</p>
               <p>But it would be an incivility to go and viſit theſe good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and to receive their kindneſſes, and not to preſent them with ſomething: Whence it comes that the Strangers, who go to ſee them, never go without ſome grains of Chryſtal, Fiſhing-hooks, Needles, Pins, or little Knives, or ſome ſuch toies: And aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they have done eating, they ſet on the little Table, on which they have eaten, ſome of thoſe things: Thoſe who have prepared the Banquet think themſelves requited a hundred-fold, and make extraordinary acknowledgments thereof.</p>
               <p>We have hitherto repreſented what treatment the <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have heretofore made to ſome of their friends, <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who took occaſion to viſit them: But they uſe other Ceremonies at the reception of Strangers of their own Nation, or their Confederates, who chance to come into their Iſlands: There is in every <hi>Carbet</hi> a Savage, who hath a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to receive Paſſengers, and is called <hi>Niouakaiti:</hi> If they are of the common ſort, he preſents them with Seats, and what is fit for them to eat, eſpecially a <hi>Caſsava</hi>-cake folded double, which ſignifies that they may eat as much as they can, and leave the reſt behind them.</p>
               <p>If thoſe who come to ſee them, or paſs by occaſionally are conſiderable to them upon any other account, as being ſome way related to them, or Captains, they comb their hair both at their coming and their going away, they hang up Beds, and invite them to reſt themſelves, ſaying, <hi>En Bouekra,</hi> behold thy Bed: They alſo preſent them with <hi>Matoutous,</hi> which are little Tables made of Ruſhes, or the leaves of Palms or <hi>Lataniers,</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:58704:170"/>
as we ſaid elſewhere, on which they ſet the meat and the <hi>Caſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> not folded, but as they come off the Plank: The women ſet them at their feet, and the men ſtanding about, ſhew that which was brought, ſaying, <hi>En Yerebaili, behold thy meat:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the women bring in Gourds full of <hi>Ouïcou,</hi> and make them drink: Then having ſet them on the ground before them, the Husband who ſtands behind the women, ſays, <hi>En batoni, behold thy drink:</hi> And the other makes anſwer to theſe two complements, <hi>Yao,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>very well,</hi> or <hi>I thank you.</hi> The <hi>Caſſava</hi> unfolded ſignifies, eat thy fill and carry away the reſt; which they fail not to do: When they have dined well without being interrupted by any one, they all come to ſalute them one after another, ſaying to him, <hi>Halea-tibou,</hi> that is, <hi>be welcome:</hi> But the women are not much concerned in this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. As for the Viſitants when they would depart, they go and take leave of every one in particular; which they expreſs by the word <hi>Huichan</hi> in their language.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of what may be accounted Polity amongſt the <hi>Caribbians.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are in every Iſland of the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> ſeveral ſorts of Captains: 1. The Captain of the <hi>Carbet,</hi> or of a Village, whom they name <hi>Tiouboutouli hauthe:</hi> This is when a man hath a numerous Family and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires with it at a certain diſtance from others, and builds Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Huts for to lodge it in, and a <hi>Carbet,</hi> where all of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily meet to be merry, or to treat of the affairs which concern it in common; thence it is that he is named a Captain of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or of Houſes.</p>
               <p>2. A Captain of a <hi>Piraga,</hi> that is, either he to whom the Veſſel belongs, or he who hath the command of it when they go to the Wars; and theſe are named <hi>Tiouboutouli Canaoa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Amongſt thoſe who have every one the command of a Veſſel in particular, they have alſo an Admiral or General at Sea, who commands the whole Fleet: Him they call <hi>Nhalenè.</hi> In fine, they have the grand Captain, or Commander in chief, whom they call <hi>Ouboutou,</hi> and in the plural number, <hi>Ouboutou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> This is the ſame whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Cacique</hi> (and we in this Hiſtory call <hi>Cacick</hi>) as ſome other <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo our Savages do in imitation of them: He is during his life, from his firſt election to that charge, the General of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58704:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Armies, and he is always highly reſpected among them: He appoints the meetings of the <hi>Carbet,</hi> either for merry-making or deliberations in order to a War: And he alwaies goes abroad attended by all of his own houſe, and ſome others who do him the honour to wait on him: Thoſe who have the greateſt retinue are the moſt highly honoured: If any one gives him not the reſpect due to him upon the account of his charge, it is in his power to ſtrike him: Of theſe there are but two at the moſt in an Iſland, as at <hi>Dominico:</hi> They are alſo commonly the Admirals when a Fleet goes out: Or haply that charge is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on ſome young man, who is deſirous to ſignalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon that occaſion.</p>
               <p>This charge is obtain'd by election: and commonly he who is advanced thereto muſt have killed divers of the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> or at leaſt one of the moſt conſiderable perſons among them. The Sons do not ſucceed their Fathers in that charge, if they be not worthy thereof. When the chief Captain ſpeaks all others are ſilent: and when he enters into the <hi>Carbet,</hi> every one makes him way; he hath alſo the firſt and beſt part of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Lieutenant to this Captain is called in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Ouboutou maliarici,</hi> that is to ſay properly, the <hi>Track of the Captain,</hi> or <hi>that which appears after him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None of theſe Chiefs hath any command over the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor any ſuperiority over the other Captains: But when the <hi>Caribbians</hi> go to the Wars, among all the Captains they make choice of one to be General of the Army, who makes the firſt aſſault: and when the expedition is over, he hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but only in his own Iſland: True it is, that if he hath behav'd himſelf gallantly in his enterpriſes, he is ever after highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in all the Iſlands: But heretofore, before the commerce between the <hi>Caribbians</hi> and forreign Nations had alter'd the greateſt part of their ancient Politie, there were many condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requiſite to obtain that degree of honour.</p>
               <p>It was in the firſt place requiſite that he whom they advanc'd to that dignity, had been ſeveral times in the Wars, and that to the knowledge of the whole Iſland whereof he was to be choſen Captain, he had behaved himſelf couragiouſly and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly: Next to this it was neceſſary, that he ſhould be ſo active and ſwift in running, as to ſurpaſs all competitors in that exerciſe: Thirdly, he who ſtood for the Generalſhip of an Iſland, ſhould excell all others in ſwimming and diving: A fourth condition was, that he ſhould carry a burthen of ſuch weight as his fellow-pretenders ſhould not be able to ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Laſtly, he was obliged to give great demonſtrations of his conſtancy: for they cruelly cut and mangled his ſhoulders and breaſts with the tooth of an <hi>Agouty;</hi> nay his beſt friends made deep inciſions in divers parts of his body: And the wretched perſon who expected that charge was to endure all this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58704:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
betraying the leaſt ſign of reſentment and pain; nay, on the contrary, it was requiſite that he receiv'd all with a ſmiling countenance, as if he were the moſt ſatisfied man in the World: We ſhall not wonder ſo much that theſe Barbarians ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch Torments, in order to the acquiſition of ſome Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when it ſhall be conſidered, that the <hi>Turks</hi> do not ſhew themſelves ſomtimes leſs cruel towards themſelves, upon the account of pure gallantry, and as it were by way of divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments witneſs what is related by <hi>Busbequius</hi> in the fourth Book of his <hi>Embaſſies,</hi> which were too tedious to ſet down in this place.</p>
               <p>To return to the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Iſlands: This ancient ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, which they obſerved in the election of their chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, will no doubt be thought ſtrange and ſavage; but there is ſomthing of the ſame kind obſervable in other Nations: For in the Kingdom of <hi>Chili</hi> they chuſe for the Sovereign Captain him who is able longeſt to bear a great Tree upon his ſhoulders: In the Country of <hi>Wiapoco,</hi> towards the great River of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> to be advanc'd to the dignity of Captain, he muſt endure, without the leaſt ſtirring of the Body, nine extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſtrokes with a Holly-wand from every Captain, and that three ſeveral times; but that is not all; he muſt alſo be put into a Bed of Cotton, over a Fire of green Leaves, the thick Smoke whereof aſcending upwards, muſt needs be very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom to the wretch who is ſo mad as to expoſe himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and he is oblig'd to continue there till he be in a manner half dead; this ſpeaks a ſtrange deſire to be Captain: Nay, heretofore among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> thoſe who were deſirous to be admitted into the Fraternity of the Sun, were requir'd to give proofs of their Conſtancy in fourſcore ſeveral ſorts of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: The <hi>Braſilians,</hi> without any other ceremony, make choice of him for their General who hath taken and kill'd moſt Enemies: And now alſo in ſome of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> the <hi>Caribbians</hi> themſelves laugh at their ancient Ceremonies at the election of their Captain; for having obſerv'd that their Neighbours think that kind of proceeding ridiculous, they now make choice of him for their Chief, who having behav'd himſelf valiantly in the Wars againſt their Enemies, hath acquir'd the reputation of a brave and gallant perſon.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Cacick</hi> is receiv'd into his Charge, he is highly reſpected by all, inſomuch that no man ſpeaks if he do not ask or command him to do it; and if any one cannot forbear ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he ought, all the reſt immediately cry out, <hi>Cala la bocca,</hi> which they have learn'd from the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> But it ſuffices not to be ſilent in the preſence of their Chief, but they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very attentive to his Diſcourſe, look upon him when he ſpeaks; and to ſhew that they approve of what he ſays, they are wont to ſmile, and that ſmile is accompanied by a certain <hi>Hun-Hun.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>From what hath been ſaid it may be deduc'd, That this Worlds Honour, whatever it may be, Virtue excepted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in Opinion and Cuſtom, which differ, and ſomtimes claſh, according to the diverſity of Mens humours.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Captain of our <hi>Caribbians;</hi> It is his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to take the Reſolutions of War, to make all Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in order thereto, and to go upon any Expedition in the head of his Forces: He alſo appoints the Aſſemblies of his Iſland, and takes care for the reparations of the <hi>Carbet,</hi> which is the Houſe where all Reſolutions that concern the Publick are taken: In fine, he it is who in the name of the whole Iſland, as occaſion ſerves, gives Anſwers, and appoints the days of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, as we mentioned before.</p>
               <p>The adminiſtration of Juſtice among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> is not exercis'd by the Captain, nor by any Magiſtrate; but, as it is among the <hi>Tapinambous,</hi> he who thinks himſelf injur'd gets
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58704:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch ſatisfaction of his adverſary as he thinks fit, according as his paſſion dictates to him, or his ſtrength permits him: The Publick does not concern it ſelf at all in the puniſhment of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals; and if any one among them ſuffers an injury or affront, without endeavouring to revenge himſelf, he is ſlighted by all the reſt, and accounted a Coward, and a Perſon of no eſteem; But, as we ſaid before, there happen few quarrels or fallings out among them.</p>
               <p>A Brother revenges his Brother and Siſter, a Husband his Wife, a Father his Children; ſo that when any one is kill'd, they think it juſtly done, becauſe it is done upon the account of revenge and retaliation: To prevent that, if a Savage of one Iſland hath kill'd another Savage, out of a fear of being kill'd by way of revenge by the Relations of the deceaſed, he gets into another Iſland and ſetles himſelf there. Thoſe whom they think Sorcerers do not exerciſe that profeſſion long among them, though for the moſt part they are rather imagin'd to be ſuch, than that they are really ſo.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Caribbians</hi> ſuſpect any one to have ſtollen ſomthing from them, they endeavour to lay hold on him, and to cut him over the Shoulders with a Knife or the Tooth of an <hi>Agouty,</hi> as a mark of his crime and their revenge: Theſe <hi>Agoutys</hi> Teeth among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> ſupply the want of our Raſors, and indeed they are in a manner as ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT is commonly at their publick Feaſts and Entertainments that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> take their Reſolutions of engaging upon any War; which humour is not particular to their Nation; for the <hi>Braſilians</hi> and the <hi>Canadians</hi> do the like: And that it may not be thought this is found only among Savages, <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

and <hi>Strabo</hi> affirm, That heretofore the <hi>Perſians</hi> conſulted<note place="margin">Lib. 15.</note> concerning their moſt important affairs at their great Feaſts, and when they had their heads well ſtor'd with Wine. And not only the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but alſo ſeveral <hi>Grecian</hi> Nations held their Councels of War at Table, if we may believe <hi>Plutarch.</hi>

               <p>But to return to the Councels of War of our <hi>Caribbians:</hi> When they begin to have their brains warm'd with their drink, an old Woman comes into the Aſſembly with a ſad countenance and deportment, and with tears in her eyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands audience; which being eaſily granted her, by reaſon of the reſpect and reverence they bear to her age, with a doleful voice, interrupted by ſighs, ſhe repreſents the injuries which the whole Nation hath receiv'd from the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and inveterate Enemies: And having reckon'd up the greateſt cruelties which they have heretofore exercis'd againſt the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> and the gallant men they have kill'd or taken in the Battels that were fought between them, ſhe comes to particularize in thoſe who were lately made Priſoners, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and eaten, in ſome later Engagements: And at laſt ſhe concludes, that it were a ſhameful and an inſupportable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to their Nation, if they ſhould not revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and generouſly imitate their Predeceſſors, thoſe brave <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who minded nothing ſo much as to gain ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the injuries they had receiv'd; and who after they had ſhaken off the yoke, which the Tyrants would have impos'd on them for the taking away of their ancient Liberty, have carried their victorious Arms into the Territories of their Enemies, whom they have purſu'd with darts and fire, and forc'd to make their retreats into their higheſt Mountains, the clefts of Rocks, and the dreadful receſſes of their thickeſt Foreſts; and this with ſo great ſucceſs, that at preſent they dare not appear at their own Sea-coaſts, and can find no habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſo remote where they think themſelves ſecure from the aſſaults of the <hi>Caribbians;</hi> fear and aſtoniſhment having been their conſtant attendants after ſuch ſignal Victories: That they are therefore couragiouſly to proſecute their advantages, and not to reſt till that peſtilent Enemy be utterly deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the old Woman hath made an end of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the Captain makes a Speech to the ſame purpoſe, to make a greater impreſſion in the minds of the Audience; which ended, the whole Aſſembly unanimouſly applauds the Propoſition, and make all demonſtrations imaginable of the juſtice of their Cauſe. From that time, being encourag'd by the words they had heard, they breathe nothing but blood and wounds. The Captain, concluding by the applauſe of the whole Aſſembly, and by their geſtures and countenances, that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58704:173"/>
they are reſolv'd for the War, though they do not ſay ſo much, immediately orders it, and appoints the time for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize by ſome of their ways of numbring, as we have hinted in the Chapter of their <hi>Natural Simplicity.</hi> In this place we are to make this particular Remark, That they take theſe bloody reſolutions when they are well loaden with drink, and after the Divel hath tormented them to egge them on thereto, as we have ſaid elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The next day after the Aſſembly, nothing is ſeen or heard in all parts of the Iſland but preparations for the War: Some poliſh their Bows; others order their Clubs; others prepare, ſharpen, and poiſon their Arrows; and others are employ'd to make ready the <hi>Piragas:</hi> The Women, for their parts, are buſie about diſpoſing and getting together the neceſſary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the Army: So that on the day appointed they all meet at the Sea-ſide with all things in a readineſs to embarque.</p>
               <p>They all furniſh themſelves with good Bows, and every one with a good ſheaf of Arrows, which are made of a ſmall ſmooth Reed, with a little piece of iron or ſome ſharp bone at the point: The Arrows us'd by the <hi>Braſilians</hi> are made after the ſame manner; but the <hi>Caribbians</hi> adde to theirs, to make them more dreadful, a mortal poiſon made of the juice of the <hi>Manchenillo</hi>-trees, and other poiſons; ſo that the leaſt ſcratch made by them becomes a mortal wound. It hath hitherto been a thing impoſſible to get out of them the Receipt of that compoſition. They have alſo every one of them that wooden ſword which they call <hi>Boutous,</hi> or to ſay better, that maſſy Club which they uſe inſtead of a ſword, and wherewith they do miracles in point of fencing. Theſe are all their Arms; for they have no Targets or Bucklers, as the <hi>Tapinambous,</hi> but<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> their bodies are naked.</p>
               <p>Next the care they take about their Arms, they alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves ſufficiently with belly-timber, and take along with them in their little veſſels good quantities of <hi>Caſſava,</hi> broil'd Fiſh, Fruits, and particularly <hi>Bananas,</hi> which keep a long time, and the meal of <hi>Manioc.</hi> The <hi>Icaqueſes</hi> in their Wars never trouble themſelves about any ſuch thing; and what they do in this particular is ſo peculiar to them, that it deſerves to be mentioned: for they are content with ſo little ſontheir ſuſtenance, and delight ſo much in living upon certain Plumbs which grow abundantly in their Parts, and from which they have their name, that when they go to the Wars they are never ſeen to carry any proviſions for the belly along with them.</p>
               <p>Our Savages of the <hi>Caribbies,</hi> as well as thoſe of <hi>Braſil,</hi> take<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> along with them to the Wars a certain number of Women, to dreſs their meat, and look to the <hi>Piragas</hi> when they are got aſhore. Their Arms and Proviſions are well faſten'd to theſe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58704:174"/>
                  <hi>Piragas;</hi> ſo that if the Veſſel comes to overturn, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens often, they ſet it right again without loſing any thing of what was in it: And upon thoſe occaſions, being ſo good<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> Swimmers as we have repreſented them, they are not troubled for their own perſons, ſo far that they have ſometimes laugh'd at the Chriſtians, who, being neer them upon thoſe occaſions, endeavour'd to relieve them. Thus the <hi>Tapinambous</hi> laugh'd at ſome <hi>French</hi> men upon the like accident, as <hi>De Lery</hi> relates.<note place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> The ſails of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> are made of Cotton, or a kind of Mat of Palm-leaves: They have an excellent faculty of row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with certain little Oars, which they move very faſt. They take along with them alſo ſome <hi>Canows,</hi> which are their leaſt kind of Veſſels, to attend their <hi>Piragas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their cuſtom is to go from Iſland to Iſland to refreſh themſelves, and to that end they have Gardens even in thoſe which are deſert, and not inhabited: They alſo touch at the Iſlands of their own Nation, to joyn their Forces, and take in as they go along all thoſe that are in a condition to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them; and ſo their Army increaſes, and with that equipage they get with little noiſe to the Frontiers.</p>
               <p>When they ſail along the Coaſts, and night comes upon them, they bring their Veſſels aſhore, and in half an hours time they make up their lodging-place under ſome Tree with <hi>Baliſier</hi> and <hi>Latanier</hi>-leaves, which they faſten together on poles or reeds, ſuſtain'd by forks planted in the ground, which ſerve for a foundation to this little ſtructure, and to hang their beds on: Theſe lodgings thus made in haſte they call <hi>Aioupa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Law-giver had forbidden, among other<note place="margin">Plut. <hi>in the Life of</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus.</note> things, that War ſhould be always wag'd againſt the ſame Enemies, for fear they might thereby grow more experienc'd in Military Affairs: But the <hi>Caribbians</hi> follow not thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, nor fear any ſuch inconvenience; for they always make War againſt the ſame Nation: Their ancient and irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enemies are the <hi>Arouacas, Arouaques</hi> or <hi>Arouagues,</hi> which is the name commonly given them in the Iſlands, though the <hi>Caribbians</hi> call them <hi>Alouagues,</hi> who live in that part of the Meridional <hi>America</hi> which is known in the Maps under the name of the Province of <hi>Guyana</hi> or <hi>Guayana,</hi> not far from the Rivers which fall down out of that Province into the Sea. The cauſe of this immortal enmity between our Inſulary <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> and thoſe people hath been already hinted in the Chapter of the Origine of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> to wit, that thoſe <hi>Arouagues</hi> have cruelly perſecuted the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, their Neighbours, the Relations of our Iſlanders, and of the ſame Nation with them; and that they have continually warr'd againſt them to exterminate them, or at leaſt, to drive them out of their habitations. Theſe <hi>Arouagnes</hi> then are the people whom our Iſlanders go and find out in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58704:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commonly once or twice a year, to be reveng'd of them as much as they can: And it is to be obſerv'd on the other ſide, that the <hi>Arouagues</hi> never make any attempts on the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> of the Iſlands, in the Iſlands where they live, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand on the defenſive; whereas they are ſure to have our Savages among them oftner then they wiſh, coaſting along, as they are wont to do, all the other Iſlands wherein they have Gardens or Colonies, though the furthermoſt of the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands, which is <hi>Santa-Cruce,</hi> is diſtant from the Country of the <hi>Arouagues</hi> about three hundred Leagues.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Alexanders</hi> generoſity made him uſe this expreſſion,<note place="margin">Q. Curt. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin. <hi>l.</hi> 9.</note> that a Victory was not to be ſtollen: but <hi>Philip</hi> of an humour different from his Son, thought there was no ſhame in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, howere it were obtain'd: Our <hi>Caribbians,</hi> with moſt of the old Inhabitants of <hi>America,</hi> are of the ſame opinion: For they carry on all their wars by ſurprize, and think it no diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to make their advantage of the night: Contrary to the <hi>Icaqueſes,</hi> who would think their reputation blaſted, if coming to the Territories of their Enemies, they did not ſend them notice of their arrival, and challenge them to come and receive them armed. The <hi>Arraucanes,</hi> next neighbour to the <hi>Chili,</hi> a warlike people, and whom the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath not been yet able to overcome, nay was ſometimes worſted by them, do much more: For when they are to engage againſt an Enemy, they have the War proclaim'd by Heraulds, and ſend this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to them; <hi>We ſhall meet thee within ſo many Moons, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Yncas,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Peru,</hi> never undertook any<note place="margin">Garcilaſ. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> war, till they had firſt advertis'd their Enemies thereof, and declar'd it two or three times: Whence it may be inferred by the way, that <hi>L' Eſcarbot</hi> is miſtaken in his Hiſtory of <hi>New-France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 25.</note> where he affirms, that all the <hi>Weſt-Indians</hi> generally wage their wars by ſurprize.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> have this imagination, that the War they ſhould begin openly would not proſper: So that having landed in the Country of the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> if they are diſcovered before they give the firſt ſhock, or that a dog, as one would ſay, did bark at them, thinking it ominous, they immediately return to their Veſſels, and ſo to their Iſlands, leaving the deſign to be proſecuted ſome other time.</p>
               <p>But if they are not diſcovered, they fall upon their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies even in their Houſes: If they cannot eaſily come at them, or find them well fortified in ſome Houſes that have good Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes, whence they play upon them with their Arrows with ſome advantage, they are wont to force them out by ſhooting fire to the Houſes with their Arrows, at the points whereof they faſten lighted Cotton: And theſe arrows being ſhot on the roofs, which conſiſt of Graſs or Palm-leaves, they preſently ſet them on fire: Thus the <hi>Arouagues</hi> are forced out of their
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:58704:175"/>
holes, and to fight in the open field, or run away: When our Savages have thus gotten them into the field, they preſently ſhoot away all their arrows, which being ſpent they take their <hi>Boutous,</hi> and do ſtrange things therewith; they are in perpetual motion all the time they are fighting, that the Enemy may have the leſs time to obſerve them: Fire-arms, eſpecially great Guns, which make ſo great noiſe, and do ſuch execution, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are loaden with Nails, Chains, and other pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of old Iron, have abated much of their courage when they have had to do with <hi>Europaeans,</hi> and makes them afraid to come neer their Ships and Forts: But though they do not take <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> to make them leſs ſenſible of danger, before they go to<note place="margin">

Thus did the warlike Savages of the Country of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> when they were aſſaulted by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for<note place="margin">Linſcot <hi>&amp;</hi> de Laet.</note> they fell in among them with ſuch fury, both men and women, that a young maid laid ſeveral <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon the place ere ſhe was killed her ſelf. They ſay alſo that the <hi>Mexicans</hi> and<note place="margin">Accoſta <hi>&amp;</hi> le Jeune</note> 
                  <hi>Canadians</hi> will rather be cut to pieces than taken in fight.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Caribbians</hi> can take any one of their Enemies alive, they bind him and bring him away captive into their Iſlands; but if any one of theirs fall dead or wounded in the field, it would be an eternal and inſupportable reproach to them to leave him in the power of the Enemy: That conſideration makes them break furiouſly into the midſt of the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and reſolutely make their way through whatever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them, to retrive the bodies of their Comrades; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten them by force from amongſt the Enemies, they carry them to their Veſſels.</p>
               <p>When the fight is over, our Savages make their retreat to the Sea-ſide, or into ſome neighbouring Iſland; and if they have received ſome conſiderable loſs by the death of ſome of their Chief Commanders, or their moſt valiant Soldiers, they fill the air with dreadful howling and crying before they get into their Veſſels; and intermixing their tears with the blood of the deceaſed, they mournfully diſpoſe them into their <hi>Piragas,</hi> and accompany them with their regrets and ſighs to ſome of their own Territories.</p>
               <p>But when they have had the Victory, they ſpend not the time in cutting off the heads of their ſlain Enemies, in carrying them in triumph, and in taking the skins of thoſe poor bodies, to make Standards in their Triumphs, as the <hi>Canadians</hi> do, and as heretofore was the cuſtom of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms;<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:58704:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nay, as was that of the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> if we believe <hi>Livy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 10.</note> The <hi>Caribbians</hi> think it enough to expreſs their joy by outcries over the bodies of the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> and afterwards all along their Coaſts, as it were to inſult over that hateful Country before they leave it: But after they have ſung in that ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſome of their triumphal ſongs, they make what haſte they can to their Veſſels, to carry away the reſt into the boſom of their native ſoil; and the poor <hi>Arouagues</hi> they have taken, they carry away chain'd, to be dealt with as ſhall be ſeen in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>The end they propoſe to themſelves in theſe Expeditions, is not to become Maſters of a new Country, or to load them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſpoils of their Enemies; but only the glory of ſubduing and triumphing over them, and the pleaſure of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating their Revenge for the injuries they have received from them.</p>
               <p>Next the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> the greateſt Enemies the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have are the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> this enmity took its riſe hence, that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> having under the Flags of other Nations got divers of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> aboard their Ships, where they had at firſt charmed them with kindneſs, and little preſents, eſpecially <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> which they extreamly love; when they ſaw their Veſſel full of theſe poor people, who never dreamed of any ſuch treachery, weighed anchor, and carried the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> men, women, and children into their Plantations, where they are ſtill kept as ſlaves: It is reported that they did the like in ſeveral of the Iſlands, wherein they followed the example of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> Whence it comes that they ſtill bear a grudge to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and can hardly endure to hear their Language ſpoken: Nay, their diſſatisfaction is ſo great, that if a <hi>French</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as ſome of that Nation affirm, chance to make uſe of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> expreſſions in his diſcourſe, he runs the hazard of their enmity: Accordingly, in their turns, by the law of retaliation, they have often made incurſions into the Iſlands of <hi>Montſerrat, Antego,</hi> and others which are in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and after they had ſet ſome houſes on fire, and taken ſome Goods, they carried away men, women, and children, whom they brought to <hi>Dominico</hi> and St. <hi>Vincents;</hi> but it was never heard that they did eat any of them, it ſeems they reſerve that cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the <hi>Arouagues:</hi> Nay before the <hi>Caribbians</hi> had any war with the Inhabitants or <hi>Martinico,</hi> when the Parents or Friends of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who had been carried away Priſoners of War by thoſe <hi>Caribbians,</hi> employed the mediation of the <hi>French,</hi> they were eaſily enlarged and put into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who gave the <hi>Caribbians</hi> in exchange for them, ſome of thoſe trifles which they highly value, or haply an Iron wedge, or ſome ſuch neceſſary tool: Nay, upon the preſenting them with ſome of thoſe things they have delivered up ſome of the <hi>Arou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agues</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:58704:176"/>
appointed to be eaten. They have at this preſent in the Iſland of St. <hi>Vineents</hi> ſome young Boys and Girls of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Nation, who being carried away very young, have clearly forgot their Parents, and would hardly return with them, ſo well are they pleaſed with the humour of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> who for their part treat them as mildly as if they were of their own Nation; they are now known only by the fairneſs and flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs of their Hair, whereas the <hi>Caribbians</hi> are generally black-hair'd.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at the firſt diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Caribbians</hi> who were then poſſeſs'd of all the <hi>Caribby</hi>-Iſlands, were cruelly treated by them; they perſecuted them with fire and ſword, and purſu'd them even into the woods, as wild beaſts, that they might carry them away Captives to work in the Mines: Which kind of procedure forc'd this people, which is valiant and generous, to oppoſe the violence, and to lay am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes for their Enemies, nay to aſſault them in their Ships which lay in their Roads, which they borded without any fear of fire-Arms, making their way through Swords and Pikes: In which attempts they were many times ſo fortunate, that they became Maſters of divers Ships richly loaden, diſpatching all that oppos'd them, carrying away all the booty, and then ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ships on fire: True it is, they pardoned the <hi>Negro-ſlaves</hi> they met with, and having brought them aſhore put them to work in their Habitations; thence came the <hi>Negroes</hi> which which they have at preſent in St. <hi>Vincents</hi> and ſome other Iſlands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ſenſible of theſe loſſes, and perceiving they had a ſtubborn Enemy to deal with, and that when they had ruin'd that Nation, they ſhould not advantage themſelves; and conſidering further, that the Iſlands they were poſſeſſed of lay convenient for their Ships in their long Voyages, to take in refreſhments of water, wood, and proviſions if need were, and to leave ſuch as were ſick in their Fleet, they reſolved to treat the <hi>Caribbians</hi> more kindly; and thereupon having ſet ſome of them at liberty whom they had Captives, and ſent them back into their Country with preſents, they made uſe of them to treat concerning a peace with that People, the conditions whereof being accepted by ſome of the Iſlands, they ſet aſhore therein ſome ſwine which they had brought out of <hi>Europe;</hi> and afterwards they left there behind them the ſick they had in their Ships, and took them in again recovered at their return. But the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of St. <hi>Vincents,</hi> and thoſe who lived at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minico</hi> would not conſent to that agreement, but ſtill perſiſt in the averſion they had for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the deſire they have to be revenged of them.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns their defenſive wars, they have learnt by their acquaintance with the Chriſtians, and the differences
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58704:176"/>
they have had with them upon ſeveral occaſions, to keep their ranks, and to encamp in advantagious places, and to make ſome kinds of fortifications in imitation of the others: The <hi>French</hi> found i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſo by experience, ſome years ſince, at the taking of <hi>Granada:</hi> They imagined that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> would not have made any reſiſtance; but they found them in a defenſive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, to prevent their landing, and conteſt their poſſeſſion of that place; for beſides the miſchief they did them by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſhower of Arrows, and the Barricadoes they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the avenues, they couragiouſly oppoſed their landing, and laid ſeveral ambuſhes for them; and when they ſaw that the <hi>French,</hi> notwithſtanding their reſiſtance, were reſolv'd to come, and forced them to make their retreat into the woods, they rallied on an eminent place which they had fortified: and whereas it was ſomewhat ſteepy on all ſides ſave only one, which had a ſpacious avenue, they had cut down certain trees, of the boals whereof they had made long Rollers, which being lightly faſten'd at the top of the Mountain, might be rolled down the deſcent, with a more than ordinary force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt the <hi>French,</hi> if they had attempted any aſſault: Out of this Fort they alſo made ſeveral ſallies upon the Enemy, who was building one where they might ſafely expect the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply which was to be ſent them from <hi>Martinico;</hi> there they kept them in as it were beſieged for certain days, during which they had made hollow places in the earth to ſecure themſelves from the Muskets; and thence ſhewing only their heads, they ſhot their Arrows at thoſe who had the confidence to come without the Trenches; nay, in the night time they made a ſhift to get a pot full of burning coals, on which they had caſt a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Pyman</hi>-ſeed, into the Hut which the <hi>French</hi> had ſet up at their firſt arrival in the Iſland, purpoſely to ſtifle them, if they could, by the dangerous fume, and the ſtupifying vapour of the <hi>Pyman:</hi> But their ſtratagem was diſcovered; and ſome time after the expected ſupply being come to the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Caribbians</hi> treated with them, and left them the abſolute poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Iſland; but the differences they have ſince had with the <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Martinico</hi> have occaſioned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther War which laſts ſtill.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the Treatment which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> make their Priſoners of War.</head>
               <p>WE are now going to dip our Pen in Blood, and to draw a Picture which muſt raiſe horrour in the beholder; in this there muſt appear nothing but Inhumanity, Barbariſm, and Rage; We ſhall find rational Creatures cruelly devouring thoſe of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> with them, and filling themſelves with their Fleſh and Blood, after they had caſt off Humane Nature, and put on that of the moſt bloody and furious Beaſts: A thing which the Pagans themſelves, in the midſt of their darkneſs, heretofore thought ſo full of execration, that they imagin'd the Sun withdrew himſelf, becauſe he would not ſhew his light at ſuch Repaſts.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Cannibals,</hi> or <hi>Anthropophagi,</hi> that is, <hi>Eaters of Men</hi> (for here it is that we are properly to call them by that Name, which is common to them with that of the <hi>Caribbians</hi>); when I ſay they bring home Priſoner of War from among the <hi>Arou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agues,</hi> he belongs of right to him who either ſeiz'd on him in the Fight, or took him running away; ſo that being come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Iſland, he keeps him in his houſe; and that he may not get away in the night, he ties him in an <hi>Amac,</hi> which he hangs up almoſt at the roof of his dwelling; and after he has kept him faſting four or five days, he produces him upon ſome day of ſolemn debauch, to ſerve for a publick Victim to the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hatred of his Country-men towards that Nation.</p>
               <p>If there be any of their Enemies dead upon the place, they there eat them ere they leave it: They deſign for ſlavery only the young Maids and Women taken in the War: They do not eat the Children of their She-priſoners, much leſs the Children they have by them themſelves: They have heretofore taſted of all the Nations that frequented them, and affirm, That the <hi>French</hi> are the moſt delicate, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of hardeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; but now they do not feed on any Chriſtians at all.</p>
               <p>They abſtain alſo from ſeveral cruelties which they were wont to uſe before they kill'd their Enemies; for whereas at preſent they think it enough to diſpatch them at a blow or two with the Club, and afterwards cut them into pieces, and having broyl'd them, to devour them; they heretofore put them to ſeveral torments, before they gave them the mortal blow: We ſhall not think it beſides our purpoſe to ſet down in this place ſome of the inhumanities which they exercis'd upon theſe ſad occaſions, as they themſelves have given an account thereof to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58704:177"/>
thoſe have had the curioſity to inform themſelves from their own mouths.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner of War who had been ſo unfortunate as to fall into their hands, and was not ignorant that he was deſign'd to receive the moſt cruel treatment which rage could ſuggeſt, arm'd himſelf with conſtancy, and, to expreſs how generous a people the <hi>Arouagues</hi> were, march'd very chearfully to the place of execution, not being either bound or drag'd thereto, and preſented himſelf with a ſmiling and ſteady countenance in the midſt of the Aſſembly, which he knew deſir'd nothing ſo much as his death.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he perceiv'd thoſe people who expreſs'd ſo great joy at the approach of him, who was to be the meſs of their abominable Entertainment, not expecting their diſcourſes and their bitter abuſes, he prevented them in theſe termes; <q>I know well enough upon what account you have brought me to this place; I doubt not but you are deſirous to fill your ſelves with my blood, and that you are impatient to exerciſe your teeth upon my body; but you have not ſo much reaſon to triumph to ſee me in this condition, nor I much to be troubled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: My Country-men have put your Predeceſſors to greater miſeries than you are now able to invent againſt me; and I have done my part with them in mangling, maſſacring, and devouring your people, your friends, and your fathers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that I have Relations who will not fail to revenge my quarrel with advantage upon you and upon your Children, for the moſt inhumane treatment you intend againſt me: What torments ſoever the moſt ingenious cruelty can dictate to you for the taking away of my life, is nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thoſe which my generous Nation prepares for you in exchange: therefore delay not the utmoſt of your cruelty any longer, and aſſure your ſelves I both ſlight and laugh at it.</q> Somwhat of this nature is that brave and bloody Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado which may be read of a <hi>Braſilian</hi> Priſoner, ready to be<note place="margin">Montagn'<hi>s Eſſays,</hi> l. 1. c. 30.</note> devour'd by his Enemies; <q>Come on boldly, <hi>ſaid be to them,</hi> and feaſt your ſelves upon me; for at the ſame time you will feed on your Fathers and Grandfathers, who ſerv'd for nouriſhment to my Body: Theſe Muſcles, this Fleſh, and theſe Veins are yours, blind Fools as you are; you do not obſerve, that the ſubſtance of the Members of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors are yet to be ſeen in them; taſte them well, and you will find the taſte of your own Fleſh.</q> But let us return to our <hi>Arouagues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſoul was not only in his lips, but ſhew'd it ſelf alſo in the effects which follow'd that Bravado; for after the Company had a while endur'd his menaces and arrogant defiances with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching him, one among them came and burnt his ſides with a flaming brand; another cut good deep pieces out of him,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58704:178"/>
and would have made them bigger, had it not been for the bones, in ſeveral parts of the body: Then they caſt into his ſmarting wounds that ſharp kind of Spice which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> call <hi>Pyman:</hi> Others diverted themſelves in ſhooting Arrows at the poor Patient; and every one took a pleaſure in tormenting him; but he ſuffer'd with the ſame countenance, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not the leaſt ſentiment of pain: After they had made ſport thus a long time with the poor wretch, at laſt growing weary of inſulting, and out-brav'd by his conſtancy, which ſeem'd ſtill the ſame, one of them came and at one blow diſpatch'd him with his Club. This is the Treatment which the <hi>Caribbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> made heretofore to their Priſoners of War; but now they think it enough to put them to a ſpeedy death, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready repreſented.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as this unfortunate perſon is thus laid dead upon the place, the young men take the body, and having waſh'd it cut it in pieces, and then boyl ſome part, and broil ſome upon wooden Frames, made for that purpoſe, like Gridirons: When this deteſtable Diſh is ready, and ſeaſon'd according to their palates, they divide it into ſo many parts as there are perſons preſent, and joyfully devour it, thinking that the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford any other repaſt equally delicious: The Women lick the very ſticks on which the fat of the <hi>Arouague</hi> dropp'd; which proceeds not ſo much from the deliciouſneſs they find in that kind of ſuſtenance, and that fat, as from the exceſſive pleaſure they conceive in being reveng'd in that manner of their chiefeſt Enemies.</p>
               <p>But as they would be extreamly troubled that the enraged hatred they bear the <hi>Arouagues</hi> ſhould ever end, ſo do they make it their main endeavour to foment and heighten it: thence it comes, that while this poor Carcaſs is a dreſſing, they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gather and ſave all the fat that comes from it; not to put into Medicines, as Chirurgeons ſometimes do; or to make wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire of it, to ſet their Enemies houſes on fire, as the <hi>Tartars</hi> do; but they gather together that fat to be afterwards diſtributed among the chiefeſt of them, who carefully keep it in little Gourds, to pour ſome few drops thereof into their Sauces at their ſolemn Entertainments, ſo to perpetuate, as much as lies in their power, the motive of their Revenge.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs acknowledge, the Sun would have more reaſon to withdraw himſelf from theſe Barbarians, than to be preſent at ſuch deteſtable Solemnities; but it would be requiſite that he withdrew himſelf at the ſame time from moſt of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>America,</hi> nay from ſome parts of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the like and worſe cruelties are daily exercis'd: For inſtance, the <hi>Tapinambous</hi> make in a manner the ſame treatment to their priſoners, as the <hi>Caribbians</hi> do to theirs; but they add thereto divers expreſſions of barbariſm, which are not to be ſeen in the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58704:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Caribbies:</hi> They rub the bodies of their Children with the<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>Ch.</hi> 8.</note> blood of thoſe miſerable Victims, to animate them to future Cruelties: He who had been the Executioner of the Captive caus'd himſelf to be mangled and flaſh'd, and cut in ſeveral parts of the body, as a Trophey of Valour, and a mark of Glory: And what is yet ſuperlatively ſtrange, is, That thoſe Barbarians beſtowing their Daughters for Wives on thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as ſoon as they fall into their hands, when they come to cut them in pieces, the Wife her ſelf eats firſt, if it be poſſible, of the fleſh of her Husband; and if it happen that ſhe hath any Children by him, they are ſerv'd in the like manner, kill'd, roſted, and eaten; ſomtimes as ſoon as they come into the World. The like Barbariſm hath ſomtimes been obſerv'd in<note place="margin">Garcilaſ. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> ſeveral Provinces of <hi>Peru.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers other barbarous Nations do alſo exceed the <hi>Caribbians</hi> in their inhumanity; but above all, the Inhabitants of the Country of <hi>Antis</hi> are more cruel then Tygers: If it happens<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that by right of War or otherwiſe, they make a Priſoner, and that they know him to be a perſon of ſmall account, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately quarter him, and beſtow the Members on their Friends or Servants, that they may eat them if they pleaſe, or ſell them in the Shambles; but if he be a perſon of quality, the chiefeſt among them meet together, with their Wives and Children, to be preſent at his death: Then theſe unmerciful people having ſtrip'd him, faſten him ſtark naked to a poſt, and cut and ſlaſh him all over the body with a ſort of Knives and Raſours made of a certain Stone, ſuch as may be Flint: In this cruel Execution they do not preſently diſmember him, but they only take the fleſh from the parts which have moſt, as the calf of the Leg, the Thighs, the Buttoeks, and the Arms; that done, they all pell-mell, Men, Women, and Children, dye themſelves with the blood of that wretched perſon; and not ſtaying for the roſting or boyling of the Fleſh they had taken away, they devour it like ſo many Cormorants, or rather ſwallow it down without any chewing: Thus the wretch ſees himſelf eaten alive, and buried in the bellies of his Enemies: The Women adding yet ſomwhat to the cruelty of the Men, though exceſſively barbarous and inhumane, rub the ends of their Breaſts with the blood of the Patient, that ſo their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may ſuck it in with their Milk. And if theſe inhumane Executioners have obſerv'd, that amidſt all the torments they put the miſerable deceas'd perſon to, he expreſs'd the leaſt ſence of pain, either in his countenance or other parts of his body; or that he ſo much as groan'd or ſigh'd, then they break his bones, after they have eaten the fleſh about them, and caſt them into ſome naſty place, or into a River, with an extream contempt.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo do ſeveral other Nations cruelly inſult over the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58704:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wretched remainders of their murthered Enemies, and exerciſe their inhumane revenge and barbarous animoſity on that which hath no feeling thereof: Thus ſome Inhabitants of <hi>Florida,</hi> to ſatiate their brutality, hang up in their houſes, and carry about<note place="margin">De Laet. <hi>hiſt. of</hi> America.</note> them, the skins and hair of their Enemies; the <hi>Uirginians</hi> wear about their necks a dry'd hand; ſome Savages of <hi>New-Spain</hi> hang about ſome part of their bodies, after the manner of a Medal, a piece of their fleſh whom they had maſſacred: The<note place="margin">Somedo <hi>hiſt. of</hi> China, <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> Lords of the Iſland by the <hi>French</hi> call'd <hi>Belle-Iſte</hi> neer <hi>China,</hi> wear a Crown made up of Deaths-heads, hideouſly diſpos'd, and interlac'd with ſilk ſtrings: The <hi>Chineſes</hi> make drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cups of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſkuls whom they have kill'd, as heretofore the <hi>Scythians</hi> were wont to do with their Enemies, as <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> affirms: The <hi>Canadians</hi> and the <hi>Mexicans</hi> dance on their Feſtival days, wearing about them the ſkins of thoſe whom they had fley'd and eaten: The <hi>Huancas,</hi> an ancient Nation of <hi>Peru,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Garcil. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> made Drums of ſuch ſkins, affirming, that when they were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they had a ſecret virtue to make thoſe who fought againſt them to run away.</p>
               <p>From all this Diſcourſe it may be deduced, to what degree of rage and fury Hatred and the deſire of Revenge may aſcend: And in theſe Examples there are are many circumſtances more bloody, and ſome more deteſtable diſcoveries of cruelty and barbariſm, then there are in the treatment which our <hi>Cannibals</hi> make to their Priſoners of War, the <hi>Arouagues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to make this treatment appear the leſs horrid, it were eaſie to bring on the Stage divers Nations, who beſides that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious animoſity, and that unquenchable thirſt of Revenge, do further diſcover a barbarous and inſatiable gluttony, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely brutiſh paſſion of feeding on Mans fleſh.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place, whereas our <hi>Cannibals</hi> ordinarily feed only upon the <hi>Arouagues,</hi> their irreconcileable Enemies, ſparing the Priſoners they take of any other Nation, ſome <hi>Floridians,</hi> who live neer the Streight of <hi>Bahama,</hi> cruelly devour all the Strangers they can get into their hands, what Nation ſoever they be of; ſo that if any people land in their Country, and that they chance to be the ſtronger party, they muſt infallibly expect to be their next days Commons: They think Mans fleſh extreamly delicate, from what part ſoever of the Body it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but they affirm, that the ſole of the foot is the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bit of any; thence it comes, that the ſaid part is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſerv'd up to their <hi>Carlin,</hi> who is their Lord, whereas anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the <hi>Tartars</hi> cut off the breaſts of young Maids, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">Bergeron's <hi>Treatiſe of the</hi> Tartars.</note> them for their chief Commanders, whoſe ordinary food they were.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the Marriages of the <hi>Caribbians.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are in <hi>America</hi> ſome Savages ſo ſavage and ſo bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, that they know not what Marriage is, but go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently together like beaſts. This, among others, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd of the ancient <hi>Peruvians,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the<note place="margin">Garcil. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> Iſlands of <hi>Robbers:</hi> But the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> with all their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, ſubject themſelves to the Laws of this ſtrict Alliance.</p>
               <p>They have no ſet time of the Year appointed for their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, as the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ordinarily marry in the Spring;<note place="margin">Strab. <hi>l.</hi> 11.</note> nor yet are they oblig'd to do it at any certain age, as ſeveral other Savages, whereof ſome marry commonly at <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>In the</hi> Eaſt-Indies.</note> nine years; others at <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>At</hi> Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar.</note> twelve; ſome at <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians.</note> four and twenty; and others on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> forty: Nor is it the cuſtom among the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> as in a manner among all other Nations, that the young Men ſhould ordinarily make choice of the Maids according to their own minds and inclinations; nor on the other ſide, do the young Maids make choice of their Huſbands, as thoſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Nicaragua</hi> do, at their publick Feaſts and Aſſemblies; and as it was done heretofore in <hi>Candia,</hi> as Hiſtorians affirm.</p>
               <p>But when our Savages are deſirous to marry, they have a priviledge to take all their Couſin-germans, and have no more to ſay, then that they take them to their Wives; for they are naturally reſerv'd for them, and they may carry them to their houſes without any other ceremony, and then they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their lawful Wives. They may all take as many Wives as they pleaſe; eſpecially, the Captains pride it much in having a great number of them: They build a particular Hut for every Wife: They continue what time they pleaſe with her whom they fancy moſt, yet ſo as that the others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no jealouſie thereat. She whom they moſt honour with their company, waits on them with the greateſt care and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion imaginable; ſhe prepares <hi>Caſſava</hi> for them, paints them; and goes along with them in all their Expeditions.</p>
               <p>Their Huſbands love them all very well; but this love is like a fire of ſtraw, ſince that many times they forſake them with as much eaſe as they take them; yet are they ſeldom ſeen to leave their firſt Wives, eſpecially if they have had children by them.</p>
               <p>If there chance to be among the She-priſoners of War any that they like, they make them their Wives; but though the children born of them are free, yet are the Mothers, for their parts, ſtill accounted Slaves. All the Wives ſpeak with whom they pleaſe; but the Huſband dares not diſcourſe with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:58704:180"/>
of his Wife, but upon extraordinary occaſions.</p>
               <p>When it happens that any one among them hath no Couſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germans, or that having ſtaid too long ere they took them to Wives, their friends have diſpos'd of them to others, they may now marry ſuch as are not of any kin to them: but it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that they demand them of their Fathers and Mothers, and as ſoon as the Father or Mother hath granted their requeſt, they are their Wives, and they carry them to their own habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>Before they had alter'd ſome part of their ancient Cuſtoms, by reaſon of the converſe they have had with the Chriſtians, they took none for their lawful Wives but their Couſins, who were theirs by natural right, as we ſaid before, or ſuch young Maids as their Fathers and Mothers willingly proffer'd them at their return from the Wars. This ancient Cuſtom of theirs hath many particular circumſtances worthy our remark; and therefore we ſhall give an account of it at large, as we have it from the moſt ancient of that Nation who have related it, to ſhew the great changes which have crept into their Manners and Cuſtoms, ſince they became acquainted with forreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Caribbians</hi> return'd with ſucceſs from their Wars, and that there was a ſolemn reception made for them in their Iſlands, and a great entertainment at their <hi>Carbet,</hi> after that Solemnity, which is ſtill in uſe among them, the Captain gave an account of the ſucceſs of their Expedition, and commended the generoſity and gallantry of thoſe who had behav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves valiantly: But his main deſign was to recommend the valour of the young men, the better to animate them to make future expreſſions of the ſame courage upon the like occaſions. It was ordinarily at the end of that diſcourſe that Fathers of families, who had Daughters marriageable, took occaſion to preſent them for Wives to thoſe among the young men whoſe performances they had heard ſo much celebrated, and whoſe courage and undauntedneſs in fighting had been ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: There was an emulation among them who ſhould get ſuch for their Sons-in-law: And he who had kill'd moſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, had much ado that day to ſcape with one Wife, ſo many would there be proffer'd to him: But Cowards and perſons of no worth met with no courtſhip to that purpoſe; ſo that, to be married among them, there was a neceſſity of being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious; for a Wife in that Nation then was the reward of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity. Thus among the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> the young men were not admitted to marry till they had kill'd ſome Enemy: And in a<note place="margin">Vin. le Blan. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 30.</note> City of <hi>Grand-Tartary,</hi> called <hi>Palimbrota,</hi> thoſe of higheſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity could have no Wives till they had brought proof that they had kill'd three Enemies of their Prince. It is reported alſo,<note place="margin">Alex. ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandro, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note> that heretofore in <hi>Carmania,</hi> if any one were deſirous to marry,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58704:181"/>
it was requiſite that he brought the King the head of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The ſame Cuſtom in a manner was obſerv'd among a certain people neer the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. And who knows not that King <hi>Saul</hi> demanded of <hi>David</hi> the lives of an hundred <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,</hi> for the dower of his Daughter, before he gave her him in Marriage?</p>
               <p>But happy did that Father think himſelf among our <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> who could firſt approach and ſeize about the body of ſome one of thoſe valorous Sons-in-Law whom the Captain had commended; for there was nothing to be expected for that time by him that came next; and the marriage was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as ſoon as the other had ſaid to the Young-man, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow my Daughter on thee for thy Wife;</hi> the like expreſſion from a Mother was as effectual: And the Young-man durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the Daughter when ſhe was thus preſented to him; but it was requiſite, that whether ſhe were handſome or unhandſome, he took her to Wife. Thus the <hi>Caribbians</hi> married not after previous courtſhips and Love-ſuits.</p>
               <p>And if the young <hi>Caribbians,</hi> after they were married, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſame gallantry in enſuing Wars, they had according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly other Wives beſtowed on them at their return: this Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy is ſtill in uſe among them, and it is indeed common among other Barbarians. The <hi>Chileſes,</hi> Inhabitants of the Iſland<note place="margin">De Laets <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Mocha,</hi> make no more ado, but as often as they are deſirous to have a new Wife, they buy one for an Ox, a Sheep, or ſome other Commodity: And there are ſome places where the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Wives belonging to the ſame Husband is prodigious, as in the Kingdom of <hi>Bennin,</hi> the King whereof hath ſometimes<note place="margin">The Dutch Relations.</note> ſeven hundred Wives and Concubines; and where the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubjects, as well as thoſe of <hi>Mexico,</hi> have each of them about a hundred, or a hundred and fifty Wives. On the other ſide there are ſome places where every Wife in like manner is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have many husbands, as among the <hi>Pelhuares,</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Braſil,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Calecut;</hi> and heretofore in ſome of the <hi>Canaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Young-men among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> do not to this day converſe with either Maids or Women till they are married; wherein certainly they are at a great diſtance from the humour<note place="margin">De Laet, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard, p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27. <hi>Conqueſt of the</hi> Canarys <hi>by</hi> Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court. Vin. le Blanc. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> of the <hi>Peguans,</hi> who are ſo paſſionately amorous, that to make it appear, that the violence of the ſecret fire which conſumes them, extinguiſhes in them the ſentiment of all other ardors, they ſear their own arms in the preſence of their Miſtreſſes with a flaming Torch, or ſuffer to die and be ſpent upon their fleſh, a piece of linnen cloth all of a flame, and dipped in Oil: And to ſhew that being wounded to death by Love, all other wounds muſt needs be ſlight, they cut and ſlaſh their bodies with Ponyards. The <hi>Turks</hi> do ſomewhat of the ſame kind, as <hi>Villamont</hi> affirms; for upon the like occaſions<note place="margin">Lib 3.</note>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:58704:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they give themſelves ſeveral cuts and great wounds with their knives, in divers parts of their bodies.</p>
               <p>The number of Wives among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> is not limited,<note place="margin">Pirard. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> as it is among the <hi>Maldiveſes,</hi> where a man may have but three at the ſame time: But as that number was heretofore propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to their courage and valour, (for as often as they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the wars with the commendation of gallant men, they might pretend to &amp; hope for a new Wife) ſo at the preſent, they have as many as they deſire and can obtain; ſo that among them, as well as among the <hi>Topinambous,</hi> he who hath moſt Wives<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> is accounted moſt valiant, and the moſt conſiderable perſon in the whole Iſland. And whereas in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> all<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiſtory of</hi> Lopez.</note> the wives lay in the ſame Room with their Husbands, the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> as we ſaid before, to prevent all differences and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, keep their wives, as the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> do theirs, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Habitations; nay, ſometimes they diſpoſe them into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Iſlands: Or haply another reaſon of their ordering ſuch a diſtance between the ſeveral aboads of their wives, is that they may the more conveniently apply themſelves to the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Gardens, which lie ſcattered up and down in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places: and it is upon the ſame account that ſome affirm the <hi>Caribbians</hi> of the Continent do the like, their wives having this commendation, that they are not troubled with jealouſie. Our Savages of the Iſlands, if they have no more wives than one, are very careful not to be far from them; and if they have many, they viſit them by turns one after another: But in this they obſerve the ſame Cuſtom with the <hi>Floridians,</hi> that they meddle not with thoſe who are with child.</p>
               <p>It is ſomewhat to be wondred at, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi>

                  </note> thoſe Lights of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſhould ſhew themſelves ſo blind and withal ſo diſhoneſt, as to open a gap for Adultry to get in among their Citizens; for there is hardly any Nation ſo Barbarous and Savage, but hath of it ſelf light enough to read this Law drawn by the hand of nature; that Adultery is a crime, and that a certain horrour ought to be had for it; nay there is not any but expreſſes a certain deteſtation of it, and ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes it. The puniſhment of Adultery is pleaſant enough among the Inhabitants of <hi>Guinny;</hi> for the Wife, if ſhe hath a<note place="margin">Dutch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
                  </note> mind to continue ſtill with her Husband, pays him by way of ſatisfaction, ſome ounces of Gold. But there is no jeſting with thoſe of <hi>Bengala,</hi> and the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> who cut off their wives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<note place="margin">Linſcot, <hi>c.</hi> 16.</note> and ears in that caſe: Divers other barbarous Nations pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh<note place="margin">V. le Blanc. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 32.</note> this crime with death; nay, the <hi>Peguans</hi> are ſo ſevere upon theſe occaſions, and have ſo great a horrour for this breach of conjugal love, that both men and women who are found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof are buried alive.</p>
               <p>Nor are the <hi>Caribbians</hi> the moſt indulgent, and the leaſt jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their honour in this caſe; heretofore they knew not
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:58704:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how to puniſh this Crime, becauſe it reigned not among them before their commerce with the Chriſtians: but now if the Husband ſurpriſes his Wife proſtituting her ſelf to ſome other, or have otherwiſe any certain knowledge of it, he does himſelf juſtice, and ſeldom pardons her, but diſpatches her, ſometimes with his Club, ſometimes by ripping up the upper part down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a Raſor or the tooth of an <hi>Agouty,</hi> which is neer as ſharp.</p>
               <p>This execution being done, the Husband goes to his Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, and tells him in cold blood, <hi>I have killed thy Daughter becauſe ſhe proved unfaithful to me:</hi> The Father thinks the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo juſt, that he is ſo far from being angry with him, that he commends him, and conceives himſelf oblig'd: <hi>Thou haſt done well,</hi> replies he, <hi>ſhe deſerved no leſs:</hi> And if he hath any more Daughters to diſpoſe of, he immediately proffers him one of them, and promiſes to beſtow her on him at the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>The Father marries not his own Daughter, as ſome have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; they abhor that crime, and if there have been any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Fathers among them, they were forc'd to abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for had they been taken by the reſt, they would have burnt them alive, or torn them into a thouſand pieces.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere is hardly any Cuſtom among theſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> ſo brutiſh, as that which they uſe at the birth of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; their wives are delivered with little pain, and if they feel any difficulty, their recourſe is to the root of a certain Ruſh, out of which they get the juice, and having drunk it, they are immediately delivered: Sometimes the very day of their delivery, they go and waſh themſelves and the child at the next River or Spring, and fall about their ordinary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The <hi>Peruvian,</hi> the <hi>Japonneſes,</hi> and the <hi>Braſilian</hi> women<note place="margin">Garcil. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot. <hi>&amp;</hi> De Laet.</note> do the like; and it was ordinary among the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to waſh their children in cold water, immediately after their birth, to harden their skins. The <hi>Maldiveſes</hi> waſh theirs ſo for ſeveral daies together; and<note place="margin">Pirard.</note> it is affirmed by ſome, that the <hi>Cimbri</hi> were heretofore wont to put thoſe little newly-born creatures into ſnow, to accuſtom them to cold and hardſhip, and to ſtrengthen their members.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:58704:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>They make no feaſt at the birth of their Children, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at that of the firſt-born, and they obſerve no ſet time for that, but every man according to his humour: But when they aſſemble their friends to rejoice with them upon the birth of their firſt-born, they ſpare nothing that may contribute to the entertainment and merry-making of the invited; whereas heretofore the <hi>Thracians</hi> accompanied with their tears the cries<note place="margin">Herod. <hi>l.</hi> 5.</note> of thoſe who came into the world, reflecting on the miſeries they were to ſuffer in this life.</p>
               <p>But behold the brutality of our Savages in their enjoyments, for the augmentation of their Family! Aſſoon as the Wife is delivered the Husband goes to bed, to bemoan himſelf there, and act the part of the woman in that condition; a cuſtome, which, though ſavage and ridiculous, is yet uſed, as ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm among the Peaſants of a certain Province of <hi>France,</hi> where they have this particular phraſe for it, <hi>faire la couvade:</hi> But what is moſt troubleſome to the poor <hi>Caribbian,</hi> who hath put himſelf into bed inſtead of his newly-delivered Wife, is, that they oblige him to a certain diet for ten or twelve days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, allowing him every day only a little piece of <hi>Caſſava,</hi> and a little water, wherein there had been boiled a little of that root-bread; afterwards his allowance is a little encreaſed, yet ſtill continued in that ſame diet; but he breaks the <hi>Caſſava</hi> which is preſented to him only in the middle, for the ſpace of about forty days, leaving the extremities entire, which he hangs up in his Hut, to ſerve at the entertainment he afterwards intends to make for all his friends; nay after all this, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains, ſometimes for the ſpace of ten months, or a whole year, from ſeveral kinds of meat, as Lamantin, Tortoiſes, Swines-fleſh, hens, Fiſh, and delicious things, being ſo pitifully ſimple as to fear that thoſe things might prejudice the child: but this great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence they obſerve only at the birth of their firſt-born; for at thoſe of the reſt, their faſts are much leſs rigorous, and ſhorter, not laſting ordinarily above four or five days.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Japonneſes</hi> and the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> the Husbands are<note place="margin">De Laet, <hi>&amp;</hi> Maffaeus.</note> alſo ſubject to the ſame extravagance of perſonating the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men delivered; but they are not ſuch fools as to faſt in their beds; on the contrary, they are deliciouſly and plentifully treated with all things: Some affirm, that heretofore the ſame thing was obſervable among the <hi>Tibarians,</hi> a people not far<note place="margin">Alex. <hi>ab</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandro. Fran. Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.</note> from <hi>Cappadoeia,</hi> and ſome others: But the natural Inhabitants of <hi>Madagaſear</hi> imitate this faſt of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> when they would have their children circumcis'd.</p>
               <p>Some of our <hi>Caribbians</hi> are yet guilty of another extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, worſt of all for the poor Father who hath a child born; for at the expiration of his faſt, his ſhoulders are ſcarified and open'd with the Tooth of an <hi>Agouty;</hi> and it is requiſite that the beſotted wretch ſhould not only ſuffer himſelf to be
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:58704:183"/>
ſo ordered, but he muſt alſo endure it without expreſſing the leaſt ſentiment of pain: Their perſwaſion is that the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent the Fathers patience ſhall be in theſe tryals, the more recommendable ſhall be the valour of his Son; but this noble blood muſt not be ſuffered to fall to the ground, ſince the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof contributes ſo much to future courage; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carefully ſav'd to rub the childs face withall, out of an imagination he will be the more generous: This is alſo done in ſome parts towards the Daughters; for though they are not to be in their military engagements, as the <hi>Amazons</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were, yet do they go to the Wars with their Husbands, to provide Victuals for them, and look to their Veſſels while they are engaged with the Enemy.</p>

               <p>The Names which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> impoſe on their male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſome time after their birth, are not to be continu'd while they live; for they change their Names when they come to the age requiſite to be receiv'd into the number of Souldiers: and when they have behav'd themſelves valiantly in the Wars, and have kill'd one of the chief Commanders of the <hi>Arou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agues,</hi> they aſſume his Name, as a mark of Honour: Which Cuſtom relates ſomewhat to what was practis'd among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> after their Victories, when they aſſum'd to themſelves the Names of the Nations whom they had ſubdu'd; as may be inſtanc'd in <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> and divers others whom we need not cite.

               <p>At two years of age their hair is cut, and then there is a Feaſt made for the whole Family; ſome Parents defer till that time the piercing or boring of their ears, lips, and the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the noſtrils; yet is not this much in uſe, but only when the weakneſs of the child will not permit it to be done ſooner. When they are a little more advanc'd in years, the Boys eat with their Fathers, and the Girls with their Mothers: Fathers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law, and all Relations which are in the collateral line with their true Fathers, they call by the general name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Though the Children of the <hi>Caribbians</hi> are not inſtructed to do any reverence to their Parents, nor to expreſs the reſpect and honour they owe them, by any geſtures of the body; yet have they a natural affection for them, and if any injury be done them, they immediately eſpouſe their quarrel, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all the ways they can to be revenged: For inſtance, a <hi>French-man</hi> of <hi>Gardeloupe</hi> having cut the cords of the <hi>Amac</hi> wherein an old <hi>Caribbian</hi> lay, by which means falling down he bruiſed himſelf and put his ſhoulder out of joint, the old man's Son-in-Law immedately got together ſome young men, who making an incurſion into the Iſland of <hi>Marigalanta,</hi> maſlacred the <hi>French</hi> who were then beginning to plant themſelves there.</p>
               <p>But the main buſineſs which the <hi>Caribbians</hi> mind in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Children, is to teach them the uſe of the Bow: And to bring them the better on, aſſoon as they are able to go the Parents put their Breakfaſt on the branch of a tree, whence they muſt ſtrike it down with their Arrows before they eat; if they cannot there is no compaſſion: As the Children grow up, their portion of meat is hung up higher: Sometimes alſo they cut off a <hi>Banana</hi>-tree, and plant it in the ground as a But, to teach their Children to ſhoot at the Fruit: by this means
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:58704:184"/>
in proceſs of time they come to be expert in that exerciſe. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtories tell us of other people, who not differing much from this Cuſtom of the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> obliged their Children to ſling down their meat from the place where they ſet it.</p>
               <p>They commonly deſign all their Sons to bear Arms, and to revenge them of their Enemies, in imitation of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: But before they are ranked among thoſe who may go to the wars, they are to be declared Souldiers in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all their kindred and friends, who are invited to be preſent at ſo ſolemn a Ceremony: The manner of it is thus; The Father, who had before got all his Friends together, cauſes his Son to ſit on a low ſtool, which is placed in the midſt of the Hut, or in the <hi>Carbet;</hi> and after he hath repreſented to him the whole duty of a generous <hi>Caribbian</hi> Soldier, and made him promiſe that he will never do any thing which may derogate from the glory of his Predeceſſors, and that he will to the utmoſt of his power revenge the ancient quarrel of his Nation, he takes by the feet a certain Bird of prey, which they call <hi>Mansfennis</hi> in their language, and which had been prepared long before for that purpoſe, and with that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges ſeveral blows on his Son, till ſuch time as the bird is killed, and the head of it cruſhed to pieces: After this rough treatment, which puts the young man as it were into a maze, he ſcarifies his whole body with the tooth of an <hi>Agouty,</hi> and to cure the wounds he hath made, he puts the dead bird into an infuſion of <hi>Pyman-ſeeds,</hi> and he rubs all the wounded parts therewith, which cauſes an extraordinary pain to the poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; but it is requiſite he ſhould ſuffer all this with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance, without the leaſt diſcovery of pain: Then they make him eat the heart of the bird; and to cloſe the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, he is laid into a kind of <hi>Amac,</hi> where he is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtretched out to his full length, till his ſtrength be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpent, by reaſon of much faſting: That done, he is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all to be a Souldier; he is admitted into the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the <hi>Carbet,</hi> and may go along with the reſt in all their military Expeditions which they undertake againſt their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Beſides the exerciſes of war, which are common to all the young <hi>Caribbians</hi> who would live in any eſteem among the Bravos of their Nation, their Fathers do many times deſign them to be <hi>Boyez,</hi> that is Magicians, and Physitians: To that end they ſend them to ſome one of the beſt skill'd in that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable profeſſion, that is, one who hath the reputation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating the evil Spirits, inſtructing people how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of their enemies by ſorceries, and in curing divers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes whereto thoſe of that Nation are ſubject: But it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the young man who is preſented to the <hi>Boyez</hi> to be inſtructed in his Art, ſhould be conſecrated thereto from his
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58704:185"/>
childhood by abſtinence from ſeveral kinds of meat, by rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Faſts, and that to begin his apprenticeſhip, there is blood drawn from all parts of his body with the tooth of an <hi>Agouty,</hi> after the fame manner as thoſe are to be treated who are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> do alſo teach their Children to fiſh, ſwim, make Baſkets, Clubs, Bows, Arrows, Girdles, Beds of Cotton and <hi>Pyragas:</hi> But to have any care of cultivating their minds, and inſtructing them in any thing of civility, or vertue, is more than could be expected from thoſe poor Savages, who have no other light than their own blinded underſtanding, nor follow any other rule in all the actions of their lives, than the ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of vicious and corrupt nature.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of the ordinary Age of the <hi>Caribbians;</hi> their Diſeaſes; the Remedies uſed by them in order to the Recovery of their Health; their Death, and Funeral Solemnities.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Caribbians</hi> being naturally of a very good tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and endeavouring all they can to avoid trouble and diſquiet, and conſequently to ſpend their lives with the greateſt enjoyment of mind; it is no wonder, conſidering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their ordinary temperance and ſobriety, that they ſhould be free from an infinite number of inconveniences and indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereto other Nations are ſubject, and that they ſhould come to their graves later than moſt other people: The good air they live in does alſo in ſome meaſure contribute to their health and long life.</p>
               <p>If therefore they do not die of violent deaths, they all of them live to a very great age; nay they are ſo vigorous in the extremities of age, that at fourſcore and ten they commonly get children: There are many among them who being above a hundred years of age, have not ſo much as a grey hair: <hi>De Lery</hi> an Author worthy credit, affirms, that he ſeldom ſaw any grey hairs in the heads of the <hi>Tapinambous</hi> of the ſame age:<note place="margin">Ch. 8.</note> Other Hiſtorians affirm; that the wives of thoſe Savages bear Children till they are fourſcore years of age: And<note place="margin">De Laets <hi>Hiſt. of</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</note> ſome <hi>French</hi> took notice of a Savage in the Country of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> who had a better ſight than any of them, and the hair of the head abſolutely black, though he were above a hundred<note place="margin">Leſcarbot.</note> years of age.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> live ordinarily a hundred and fifty years,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:58704:185"/>
and ſometimes longer: For though they cannot number their years, yet is the number thereof deduced from the account they give of certain accidents: And among others, there were not long ſince living among them ſome perſons who remembred the firſt arrival of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> Whence it is to be concluded, that they muſt be a hundred and ſixty years of age at the leaſt: And indeed theſe are ſuch a people as may paſs for the ſhadow of a body, and have nothing but the heart living, being continually bed-rid, immoveable, and reduced to pure skeletons; yet are they ſtill obſerved to be in health: And it is ſufficiently apparent, that their tongues are living as well as their hearts, and that their Reaſon is not expir'd; for they do not only ſpeak with much eaſe, but alſo their memory and judgment are not chargeable with any defect.</p>
               <p>Nor is it much to be admired that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> ſhould live ſo long, ſince both ancient and modern Hiſtories furniſh us with<note place="margin">Dutch <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24.

So that all this conſider'd, it is no incredible thing that our <hi>Caribbians</hi> ſhould live ſo long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſelepiades,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates, was of opinion, that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Plac. Phil. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 30.</note> the Inhabitants of cold Countries liv'd longer than thoſe of hot, giving this reaſon, that the cold keeps in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, and cloſes the pores to that end, whereas that heat is eaſily diſperſed in thoſe Climates where the pores are kept open by the heat of the Sun: But experience, in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbians</hi> and ſo many other Nations of the Torrid Zone who ordinarily live ſo long, while our <hi>Europaeans</hi> commonly dye young, deſtroies that argument.</p>
               <p>When it happens that our <hi>Caribbians,</hi> as ſometimes it muſt, are troubled with any indiſpoſition, they have the knowledge of abundance of Herbs, Fruits, Roots, Oils, and Gums, by the aſſiſtance whereof they recover their health in a ſhort time, if the diſeaſe be not incurable: They have alſo an infallible ſecret to cure the ſtinging of Snakes, provided they have not
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:58704:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
touch'd a vein; for then there is no remedy: This is the juice of a certain Herb which they apply to the wound, and in four and twenty hours they are infallibly cured.</p>
               <p>The bad nouriſhment of Crabs, and other inſects on which they commonly feed, is the cauſe that they are moſt of them ſubject to a troubleſome diſeaſe, which in their language they call <hi>Pyans,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> call it a kind of ſmall Pox: When thoſe who are fallen into this diſeaſe, eat of the <hi>Fram-Tortoiſe,</hi> or of <hi>Lamantin,</hi> or of <hi>Caret,</hi> which is another kind of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe, they are immediately full of little riſings, inaſmuch as theſe meats force the diſeaſe out; they have alſo many times great Impoſtumes, Cornes, and Carbuncles, in divers parts of the body: To cure thoſe, which proceed for the moſt part from the bad nouriſhment they uſe, they have the bark of a tree called <hi>Chipiou,</hi> bitter as ſoot, which they ſteep in water, and having ſcrap'd into that infuſion the inner part of a great ſhell called <hi>Lambys,</hi> they drink up that potion: They alſo ſometimes pound the bark newly taken from certain trees of <hi>Miby,</hi> or other <hi>Withyes</hi> which creep along the ground, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten on trees, and drink the juice gotten from it: but they do not willingly make uſe of this remedy but when the trees are moſt full of ſap.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Medicines wherewith they purge the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours within, they alſo apply outwardly certain unguents, and liniments, which have a particular vertue of taking away the bliſters and marks which commonly remain on their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies who have been troubled with the <hi>Pyans:</hi> They make up theſe Remedies with the aſhes of burnt Reeds, mixt with the water which they get out of the leaves at the top of the <hi>Bali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier</hi>-tree: They alſo uſe to the ſame end the juice of the <hi>Junipae</hi> fruit, and they apply on the botches the husks of the ſame fruit, which hath the vertue of drawing away the matter of the wounds, and to cloſe up the Ulcers: They have not the uſe of Phlebotomy, but they uſe ſcarifications upon the place affected, by ſcratching or opening it with the Tooth of an <hi>Agouty,</hi> and cauſing it to bleed a little. And to take off ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the aſtoniſhment, which might be conceived at what we have repreſented elſwhere concerning the inciſions which theſe Barbarians make on themſelves upon divers occaſions, whereby it might be imagin'd their bodies ſhould be as it were mangled and covered with ſcars, it is to be noted, that they have alſo certain ſecrets, and infallible remedies to cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves preſently, and to cloſe the wounds ſo that a man cannot eaſily obſerve the leaſt ſcar about their bodies.</p>
               <p>They alſo make uſe of artificial Baths, and provoke ſweat by a kind of ſtove, wherein they incloſe the Patient, who receives his abſolute cure by that remedy: The <hi>Sorriqueſes</hi> do alſo ſweat their ſick, but ſometimes they moiſten them with

               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:58704:187"/>When the ordinary Remedies which our <hi>Caribbians</hi> are wont to make uſe of when occaſion requires, have not the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs they had promiſed to themſelves, their recourſe is to their <hi>Boyez,</hi> that is their Magicians, who alſo pretend to the profeſſion of Phyſick, and having ſent for them, they ask their advice concerning the event of their ſickneſs: Theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py inſtruments of Satan have by their enchantments gain'd ſo great reputation among theſe poor beſotted people, that they are looked upon as the Judges of life and death, and ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon of their ſorceries, and the revenge they take on thoſe who ſlight them, that all think themſelves obliged to expreſs a complyance with their advice.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Ceremonies obſerved by them upon theſe occaſions, we have already given ſome account thereof in the Chapter of their <hi>Religion:</hi> It is requiſite above all things, that the Houſe or Hut into which the <hi>Boyé</hi> is to enter, ſhould be very neatly prepared for his reception; that the little Table, which they call <hi>Matoutou,</hi> ſhould be furniſhed with <hi>Anakri</hi> for <hi>Maboya,</hi> that is, an offering of <hi>Caſſava</hi> and <hi>Ouicou,</hi> for the evil Spirit, as alſo with the firſt-fruits of their Gardens, if it be the ſeaſon of fruits: It is further requiſite, that at one end of the Hut, there ſhould be as many low ſtools or ſeats as there are to be perſons preſent at that deteſtable action.</p>
               <p>After theſe preparations, the <hi>Boyé,</hi> who never does this work but in the night time, having carefully put out all the fire in and about the Houſe, enters into it, and having found out his place by the weak light of a piece of Tobacco ſet on fire, which he hath in his hand, he firſt pronounces ſome barbarous words, then he ſtrikes the ground ſeveral times with his left foot, and having put the end of Tobacco which he had in his hand into his mouth, he blows upwards five or ſix times the ſmoke which comes out of it, then rubbing the end of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co between his hands he ſcatters it in the air: Thereupon the Devil, whom he hath invocated by theſe apiſh Ceremonies, ſhaking very violently the roof of the houſe, or making ſome other dreadful noiſe preſently appears, and anſwers diſtinctly to all the queſtions put to him by the <hi>Boyé.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Devil aſſures him, that his diſeaſe for whom he is conſulted, is not mortal, the <hi>Boyé,</hi> and the Apparition which accompanies him, come neer the ſick perſon to aſſure him that he ſhall ſoon recover his former health; and to confirm him in that hope, they gently touch thoſe parts of his body, where he feels moſt pain, and having preſs'd them a little, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that there come out of them Thorns, pieces of Bones, ſplinters of Wood and Stone, which were, as theſe damnable Phyſitians affirm, the cauſe of his ſickneſs: Sometimes alſo they moiſten the part affected with their breath, and having ſuck'd it ſeveral times, they perſwade the Patient that by that
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58704:187"/>
means they have got out all the venome which lay in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and cauſed him to languiſh: In fine, to put a period to this abominable Myſtery, they rub the ſick perſon all over with the juice of the <hi>Junipa</hi>-fruit, which dies his body of a very dark brown, which is as it were the mark and ſeal of his cure.</p>
               <p>He who is perſwaded that he hath recovered his health by this damnable means, is wont by way of acknowledgment to make a great feaſt, at which the <hi>Boyé</hi> hath the chiefeſt place among thoſe who are invited: He is by no means to forget the <hi>Anakri</hi> for the Devil, who fails not to be there: But if the <hi>Boyé</hi> finds by the communication he hath had with his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, that the ſickneſs is to death, he comes and comforts the ſick perſon, telling him that his God, or to ſay better his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Devil, having compaſſion upon him, will take him into his company, and carry him along with him to be delivered out of all his infirmities.</p>
               <p>Certain people of old finding themſelves unable to endure<note place="margin">Aelian, <hi>l. 3. c.</hi> 38</note> the trouble and inconveniences of decrepit age, were wont to diſpatch their wearied ſouls out of their infirm bodies with a glaſs of Hemlock: And ſome others, as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms, being<note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 12.</note> weary of their lives, caſt themſelves into the Sea: But in other<note place="margin">Ael. <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 1.</note> Countries the Children thought it too long to ſtay till their Parents were come to ſo great age, and ſo became their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, and this they were authorized to do by a publick Law. And even at this day the Sunſhines upon ſome Provinces of <hi>Florida,</hi> where there are people ſo curſed, as upon a certain motive of Religion and Piety, to put their Parents to death when they are old, as perſons uſeleſs in this world, and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them.</p>
               <p>But how old ſoever they may be among the <hi>Caribbians,</hi> the Children are never troubled to ſee their Fathers and Mothers in that condition: True it is, that ſome <hi>Caribbians</hi> heretofore have haſtened the death of their Parents, and have killed their Fathers and Mothers out of a perſwaſion that they did a good work, and rendred them a charitable office, by delivering them out of many inconveniences and troubles which attend old age. An old Captain among them, whom the <hi>French</hi> called <hi>Le Pilote,</hi> made it his boaſt that he had done that deteſtable ſervice to many of his Anceſtors: But it is to be obſerved that the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> did not practiſe that inhumanity, but only towards thoſe who deſired to be delivered in that manner out of the miſeries of this life; and ſo it was a certain compliance with their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt entreaties who were weary of their lives: Moreover that piece of barbariſm was never univerſally received among them, and the more prudent ſort do at the preſent deteſt it, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Fathers and Mothers to the laſt gaſp, with all the care, and all the expreſſions of love, honour, and reſpect that can be expected from a Nation which hath no other light for
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:58704:188"/>
its direction, than that of a corrupt Nature: They patiently bear with their imperfections, and the frowardneſs of their old age, are never weary of miniſtring unto them, and as much as they can, keep neer them, to divert them, as the <hi>French</hi> have obſerv'd in ſome of their Iſlands; which demeanour of theirs is the more commendable, in that it is done amongſt Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: So that if any among them do not honour their Fathers and Mothers, they have degenerated from the vertue of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</p>
               <p>But when after all their care and pains they chance to loſe any one of their Friends or Relations, they make great cries and lamentations upon his death: Wherein they differ much from the ancient <hi>Thracians,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herod. <hi>l. 5. &amp;</hi> Philoſt <hi>in the Life of</hi> Apollonius, <hi>l. 5. c.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſlands,</hi> who buried their dead with rejoicing, dancing, and ſinging, as perſons delivered out of the miſeries of humane life. After the <hi>Caribbians</hi> have wept over their dead, they waſh them, paint the bodies with a red colour, rub their heads with Oil, comb their hair, thruſt up the legs to the thighs, and the elbows between the legs, and bend down the face upon the hands, ſo that the whole body ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the poſture of the child in the mothers womb; and then they wrap it up in a new bed, till all things be ready to diſpoſe it into the ground.</p>
               <p>There have been ſome Nations who caſt the bodies of the dead into Rivers, as ſome <hi>Aethiopians</hi> did: Others caſt them<note place="margin">Drake's <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, part</hi> 2.</note> to Birds and Dogs, as the <hi>Parthians,</hi> the <hi>Hircanians,</hi> and ſuch others, who were ſomewhat of the ſame humour with <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the Cynick: Some others covered them with heaps of ſtones. It is reported of ſome Inhabitants of <hi>Africk,</hi> that they diſpoſed their dead in earthen Veſſels; and that others put them into glaſs: <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> who maintained that fire was the principle of all things, would have the bodies of the dead burnt, that they might return to their firſt origine: And this Cuſtom, obſerved for ſeveral ages among the <hi>Romans,</hi> is at this day practiſed among divers oriental Nations: But <hi>Cyrus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xenoph. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropaed. <hi>l.</hi> 8.</note> at his death affirmed, that there was nothing happier than to be diſpoſed into the boſom of the earth, the common Mother of all mankind: The firſt <hi>Romans</hi> were of the ſame opinion, for<note place="margin">Plin. <hi>l. 7. c.</hi> 54.</note> they interr'd their dead: And of the ſeveral ways of diſpoſing of the dead, interring is that which is in uſe among the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians:</hi> They do not make their Graves according to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, but like thoſe of the <hi>Turks, Braſilians,</hi> and <hi>Canadians,</hi> that is about four or five foot deep, and round like a Tun: and at the bottom of it, they ſet a little ſtool, on which the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Friends of the deceaſed place the body ſitting, leaving it in the ſame poſture as they put it in immediately after the death of the party.</p>
               <p>They commonly make the grave within the houſe of the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:58704:188"/>
deceaſed; or if they bury him elſewhere, they always make a covering over the place where the body is to be laid, and after they have let it down into the grave, and wrap'd it in an <hi>Amac,</hi> they make a great fire about it, and all the more ancient both men and women kneel down: The men place themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the women, and ever and anon they ſtroke them with their hands over their arms, to incite them to lament and weep: Then ſinging and weeping they all ſay with a pitiful and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting voice: <q>Alas, why didſt thou dye? Thou hadſt ſo much good <hi>Manioc,</hi> good <hi>Potatoes,</hi> good <hi>Bananas,</hi> good <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas:</hi> Thou wert belov'd in thy Family, and they had ſo great care of thy perſon: Why therefore wouldſt thou dye? Why wouldſt thou dye? If the party were a man, they add, Thou wert ſo valiant and ſo generous; thou haſt overthrown ſo many Enemies; thou haſt behav'd thy ſelf gallantly in ſo many fights; thou haſt made us eat ſo many <hi>Arouagues;</hi> Alas! who ſhall now defend us againſt the <hi>Arouagues?</hi> Why therefore wouldſt thou dye?</q> And they repeat theſe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations ſeveral times over.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Topinambous</hi> make in a manner the ſame lamentations over the graves of their dead: <q>He is dead, <hi>ſay they,</hi> that brave<note place="margin">De Lery, <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> Huntſman; that excellent Fiſher man; that valiant Warriour; that gallant eater of Priſoners; that great Deſtroyer of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez</hi> and <hi>Margajats;</hi> that generous Defender of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he is departed this world:</q> And they often repeat the<note place="margin">Dutch <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, l.</hi> 1.</note> ſame expreſſions: The Inhabitants of <hi>Guinny</hi> do alſo ask their deceaſed what obliged them to dye, and they rub their Faces with a wiſp of ſtraw, to try if that will awake them: And <hi>Busbequius,</hi> in the Relation of his Embaſſies into <hi>Turkey</hi> relates, that paſſing through a Town of <hi>Servia,</hi> named <hi>Yagodena,</hi> he heard the women and young maids lamenting over a deceaſed perſon, and ſaying to him in their Funeral ſongs, as if he had been able to hear them: <q>What have we deſerved, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have we been deficient in doing thee ſervice, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting thee? What cauſe of diſcontent have we ever given thee that ſhould oblige thee to leave us?</q> Which ſomewhat relates to the complaints of our <hi>Caribbians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The howlings and expoſtulations of the <hi>Topinambous</hi> and the <hi>Virginians</hi> upon the like occaſions laſt ordinarily a month: The people of <hi>Aegypt</hi> continu'd their lamentations ſeventy dayes: And ſome <hi>Floridians</hi> employ old women to bewail the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the ſpace of ſix months: But <hi>Lycurgus</hi> limited mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Plot. <hi>in his Life.</hi>
                  </note> for the dead to eleven days; and that is much about the time that our <hi>Caribbians</hi> took to do the ſame office, before they put the dead body into the ground: For during the ſpace of ten dayes or thereabouts, twice every day the Relations, and the moſt intimate friends came to viſit the deceaſed party at his grave; and they always brought him ſomewhat to eat and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:58704:189"/>
drink, ſaying to him every time: <q>Alas! why wouldſt thou dye? why wilt thou not return to life again? ſay not at leaſt that we refuſed thee wherewithall to live upon; for we have brought thee ſomewhat to eat and drink:</q> And after they have made this pleaſant exhortation to him, as if he ſhould have heard them, they left the meat and drink they had brought with them at the brink of the grave till the next viſit, at which time they put it on his head, ſince he thought it much to ſtretch forth his hand to take it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Peruvians,</hi> the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> the <hi>Canadians,</hi> the Inhabitants<note place="margin">Acoſta, De Lery, P. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Fran. Cauche, Th.

And not to go to Countries at ſo great a diſtance, is there not ſomething of this kind done among us? for during certain dayes they ſerve the Effigies of our Kings and Princes newly dead, and they are preſented with meat and drink, as if they were living, nay ſo far as to taſte the meats and drinks before them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribbians</hi> of ſome Iſlands do ſtill ſet meat at the graves of the deceaſed, but they leave them not ſo long as they did heretofore, ere they covered them with earth: For after the Funeral lamentation is ended, and that the women have wept as much as they can, ſome friend of the deceaſed laies a plank over his head, and the reſt put the earth together with their hands till they have filled the grave; that done, they burn all that belonged to the deceaſed.</p>
               <p>They alſo ſometimes kill Slaves to attend the Ghoſts of the deceaſed, and to wait on them in the other world: But theſe poor wretches get out of the way when their Maſters dye, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome other Iſland. We may juſtly conceive a horrour at the relation of theſe inhumane and barbarous Funerals, which are<note place="margin">Acoſta'<hi>s Hiſt. of</hi> China, De Laet, Garcil.

                  </note> drench'd with the blood of Slaves, and divers other perſons, and among others women, who have their throats cut, are burnt and buried alive, to go and accompany their Husbands into the other world, whereof frequent examples may be found in divers Nations: But our <hi>Caribbians</hi> think it enough upon theſe occaſions to put to death only the Slaves of the deceaſed, if they can catch them.</p>
               <p>It was forbidden the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to bury any thing with the deceaſed perſon; but the contrary hath been and is ſtill practiſed in divers Nations: For not to mention the many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious<note place="margin">Virgil, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Tacitus.</note> things which were conſumed with the Bodies that were burnt among the ancient <hi>Romans, Macedonians, Germans</hi> and other people, we read in the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that King<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> put up great wealth with the body of <hi>David</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Thus the <hi>Tartars</hi> put into the grave with the dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon all his Gold and Silver: And the <hi>Braſilians, Virginians, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadians</hi> and ſeveral other Savages inter with the bodies, the cloths and whatever elſe belonged to the deceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:58704:189"/>The ſame thing was alſo practiſed among the <hi>Caribbians</hi> in their Funerals, before they converſed with the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> For at the laſt viſit they made to the deceaſed, they brought along with them all the things he had uſed or worn about him in his life time, to wit, his Bow and arrows, the <hi>Boutou,</hi> or Club, the Crowns of Feathers, Pendants, Chains, Rings, Bracelets, Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Veſſels, and other things, and buried all with him, or burnt them over the grave: But now they are grown better Husbands; for the Relations of the deceaſed reſerve all thoſe things for their own uſe, or elſe they beſtow them as preſents on thoſe who come to the Interment, who keep them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the deceaſed.</p>
               <p>After the body is covered with earth, the neareſt Relations cut off their hair, and faſt very rigorouſly, out of a perſwaſion that by that means they ſhall live longer and more happily: Others forſake the houſes and the place where they have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried any of their kinred, and go and live elſewhere: When the body is neer rotted, they make another aſſembly, and after they have viſited, and ſighing trampled on the Sepulchre, they have a merry meeting, at which they drown all their grief in <hi>Ouicou.</hi> Thus the Ceremony is concluded, and the poor Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs is no further tormented.</p>
