         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHile theſe <hi>Elegies</hi> of <hi>Cornelius
Gallus</hi> remain'd in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
dreſs, they were thereby ſecur'd
from the Cenſures of all, as well the
Learned, as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned: from theſe,
becauſe they could not either read or

<pb facs="tcp:101822:3"/>
the greateſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wits. But

Tongue, nor, 'tis likely, now ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to every Mode of Expreſſion in
that Language, as they might have
been by another Hand, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
to ſhelter them under Your

this I am incourag'd to from the ſence
I have of the many undeſerved Favours
Your Lorſhip (when applied to) affords
to any Diſtreſs; for ſuch is every one,
who in this Age adventures to write,
by oppoſing himſelf thereby to the uſual
Aſſaults, at leaſt, of the moſt rigid and

Hours, and paſs Your reading with

who, perhaps, may think it an Invaſion

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Deſign not in this <hi>Preface</hi> either to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
a Defence for my felf againſt the
Criticks, or by any Inſinuations to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
my own endeavours to the World as
valuable: Since none, no, not the beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
could ever advantage themſelves by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of that Nature, nor did the worſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
want ſome to eſteem and read their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
Thus the Great <hi>Dryden</hi> cannot eſcape
Cenſure; nor is <hi>Withers</hi> himſelf without his
Admirers. And therefore prepared by ſuch
Conſiderations, I am fortified againſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Fate may happen to theſe following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
moſt of which (for <hi>Praeſtat otioſum eſſe
quàm nihil agere</hi>) were the Effeſts of my idle
hours at Sea, and the reſt have been (for
want of better) the imployment of ſome of
my vacant time a Shoar.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall think the fifth <hi>Elegy</hi> too looſe,
and for that reaſon be ready to reflect upon
me, let them take that for my Apology which
<hi>Martial</hi> makes in his own behalf to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in
one of his Epigrams:
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:101822:5"/>
                  <l>Innocuos Cenſura poteſt permittere Luſus</l>
                  <l>Laſcivia eſt nobis Pagina, Vita proba eſt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But if that will not ſerve, and the ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
and nice will be offended, let them be
angry with the Author, who in the Original
takes greater liberty to himſelf in his Words
then I have done in the Tranſlation. And
beſides, I ſhall deſire they would regard theſe
<hi>Elegies,</hi> as they are deſign'd to expoſe the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
&amp; inexcuſable vices of laſcivious old Men,
in whom Luſt is more odious than in the
Young; for they being heated with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
ſallies of their youthfull blood, are
leſs culpable then thoſe who have appetites,
when Nature has ſcarce left them Health, or
the pleaſure of Taſt. And <hi>Juvenal</hi> himſelf,
when he laſhes (in his tenth Satyr, the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Follies of thoſe who wiſh to live to
a great Age) lays no reſtraint upon his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.
And that Satyr has been made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
in <hi>Engliſh</hi> more then once by ſeveral
Hands. However I believe the Authority of
the Author, <hi>Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, Horace</hi>
himſelf, and all the <hi>Epigrammatiſts</hi> may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:101822:5"/>
to defend what I have done. And if not,
ſure the Examples of the Poets of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Times will: For, can I name one
ſcarce, who has not either upon the Stage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
or otherwiſe writ, what is full as
much, if not more licentious then any thing
in this Book?
<q>
                  <l>—Pictoribus, atque Poetis</l>
                  <l>Quidlibet audendi ſemper fuit aequa Poteſtas.</l>
               </q>
And we ſee daily in Pictures thoſe Parts of the
Body lay'd open to the view, which are elſe
conceal'd: And therefore Poetry, which is a
ſpeaking ſort of Painting, ſpares not (when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
offers) to give the livelieſt Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Nature or Vice; And this has been ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary
in all Ages, that none will, ſure, refuſe
the ſame privilege to thoſe who write now.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but to ſtand excuſed before the
Ladies, becauſe the Famous Wits of that fair
Sex have ſeldom deny'd their Pens the liberty
to be as luxurious in this way of writing as
the Men, nor have they thought it either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious,
or ſcandalous to them, to publiſh many
things as laſcivious as this. Nor indeed, though
<pb facs="tcp:101822:6"/>
they ought to be ſo in their lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
it is not ſo very neceſſary that Poets
ſhould be reſerv'd and chaſt in their Verſes:
and this is the Opinion of <hi>Catullus.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Nam Caſtum eſſe decet pium Poetam</l>
                  <l>Ipſum, Verſiculos nihil neceſſe eſt.</l>
               </q>
For the Buſineſs of a Poet is either on the one
hand to incite Men to Vertue, and to do this
by rendering it amiable with the moſt ſutable
Deſcriptions, and moſt elegant and heighthen'd
Praiſes; or elſe, on the other hand, to deter them
from Vice, and then he muſt not ſcruple to
paint it in the moſt deform'd ſhape, or fear to
ſhew it in the worſt colours, to all the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
imaginable. Now if theſe Arguments
will not content ſome, who think it an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to be too preciſely rigid, I ſhall repeat
to them the ſame words which <hi>Martial</hi> uſes in
his Epiſtle before the 1ſt Book of his Epigrams,
<hi>Si quis tamen tam ambitiosè triſtis eſt, ut apud il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
in nullà paginà Latinè</hi> (or to adapt it more
to the preſent purpoſe) Anglicè) <hi>loqui fas ſit, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Epiſtolà, vel potius Titulo contentus eſſe.</hi> And
ſo farewell.</p>

               <hi>CN. Cornelius Gallus</hi> was thought to
have been Born about that ſame Year, when
<hi>M. Terentius Varro</hi> (one of the moſt learned
<hi>Romans</hi>) dyed, he is ſuppoſed, as to his Country,
to be a <hi>Forojulienſian,</hi> and to have been inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the moſt neceſſary and uſefull Arts, for
he was a long time familiarly converſant with one
<hi>Caecilius Epirata,</hi> the great Grammarian of his
time. Yet who his Father was, remains unknown,
nor is that, with his own Name, tranſmitted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity;
only 'tis generally held, that he was born
to a very ſmall Eſtate, though (not unlikely) of
a Noble Family, as <hi>Propertius</hi> ſeems to imply.

that full enjoyment he deſired of his more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Friendſhip.
<q>
                  <l>Delicias Domini nec quid ſperaret habebat.</l>
               </q>
The thing he ſo much coveted and wiſh'd for.
<q>
                  <l>O tantum libeat mecum tibi ſordida Rura</l>
                  <l>Atque humiles habitare Caſas—</l>
               </q>
For <hi>Gallus</hi> finding the Honours and Preferments
he receiv'd from <hi>Caeſar</hi> more ſutable to his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then the humble Pleaſures of a Country Life,
could not be invited to quit the Splendour of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Court, to take up with the more ſecure
ſatisfaction of a Rural Retirement, though <hi>Virgil</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101822:7"/>
endeavour'd to draw him to it by all the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and advantages he propoſed would accrue to
him thereby; and in Deſpair of ſucceſs, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how diſproportion'd his offers were to the
immediate favours he receiv'd from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
cries out at laſt,
<q>
                  <l>Ruſticus es Coridon, nec Munera curat Alexis,</l>
                  <l>Nec, ſi Muneribus certes, concedat Jolas.</l>
               </q>
               <hi>Virgil,</hi> out of the great Friendſhip he had for
<hi>Gallus,</hi> in Honour to him, had writ half the fourth
Book of his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> which <hi>Caeſar</hi> (after his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace)
commanded him to alter, and he turn'd it to the
Fable of <hi>Ariſtaeus.</hi> But all the Poets that were
his Cotemporaries had a very high value for him,
unleſs ſome Criticks, who ſay that <hi>Horace</hi> was
his Adverſary, have happened to be in the right.
However, ſuch were his qualefications, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertius</hi>
could admire him, though he was his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
in <hi>Cynthia,</hi> as he ſays in an Elegy writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that particular occaſion.
<q>
                  <l>Sed pariter miſeri focio cogemur amore,</l>
                  <l>Alter in alterius mutua flere ſinu;</l>
                  <l>Quare, quid poſſit mea Cynthia, deſine, Galle,</l>
                  <l>Quaerere, non impunè illa rogata venit.</l>
               </q>
               <pb facs="tcp:101822:8"/>
               <hi>Gallus</hi> was of a gay amorous temper, very fickle
and changeable, as <hi>Propertius</hi> in another place
tells him,
<q>
                  <l>Dum tibi deceptis augetur Fama Puellis,</l>
                  <l>Certus, &amp; in nullo quaeris Amore moram.</l>
               </q>
But he was alſo very paſſionate, and impatient of
any unkind uſage from thoſe Women to whom he at
any time addreſſed his Love, and them would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
come with his Complaints to <hi>Propertius,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Ah mea contemptus quoties ad lumina curres,</l>
                  <l>Quum tibi ſingulta fortia verba cadunt!</l>
               </q>
Yet at laſt he grew famous for the mighty love he
had for one <hi>Cytharis,</hi> a free'd Woman of <hi>Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi>'s,
and a Whore, who forſook him (perhaps
after he fell into diſgrace,) and went away with
one <hi>Antony</hi> to <hi>France;</hi> and it is not unlikely
that <hi>Propertius</hi> means her, when he ſays,
<q>
                  <l>Haec erit illarum contempti poena doloris,</l>
                  <l>Multarum miſeras exigit una vices;</l>
                  <l>Haec tibi vulgares iſtos compeſcet amores,</l>
                  <l>Nec nova quaerendo, ſemper amicus eris.</l>
               </q>
And a little after that he deſcribes ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
a Paſſion of <hi>Gallus,</hi> to which he was an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs,
that it may be very reaſonable to believe
<pb facs="tcp:101822:8"/>
in all that Elegy the Woman of whom he ſpeaks
to be <hi>Cytharis.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Vidi ego te tot vinctum langueſcere collo,</l>
                  <l>Et flere injectis Galle diu manibus,</l>
                  <l>Et cupere optatis animam deponere verbis,</l>
                  <l>Et quae deinde celat amice Pudor.</l>
                  <l>Non ego complexus potui deducere veſtros;</l>
                  <l>Tantus erat demens inter utruſque furor.</l>
               </q>
However <hi>Gallus</hi> no more then others could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
happy; and though he had been the great and
only Favourite of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> yet after he
was goue to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> thoſe who envy'd him, gain'd
their ends, and brought him more into Diſgrace,
and lower under the Emperour's Diſpleaſure, then
he was ever before rais'd in his Eſteem. Whether
he really deſerv'd the mighty Misfortune that fell
ſo heavy upon him, may be a queſtion, ſince not
always who merit beſt of Fortune are beſt uſed by
her; and after <hi>Caeſar</hi> was offended with him, he
ſuffer'd none of his other Friends to venture at his
juſtification, ſo fatal and dangerous is the Anger
of an inraged Monarch; yet <hi>Virgil</hi> even then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
to mourn his hard fate in his tenth Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue;
and ſtill lov'd him, though more ſecretly.
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:101822:9"/>
                  <l>Gallo cujus amor tantum mihi creſcit in horas,</l>
                  <l>Quantum vere novo viridis ſe ſubjicit alnus.</l>
               </q>
And though he deſign'd the Dedication to him of
his Books of <hi>Bucolicks,</hi> and his Books of <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks,</hi>
yet he afterwards durſt not do it for fear
of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and therefore they fell to <hi>Pollio</hi> and
<hi>Maecenas.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Praetera duo nec tuta mihi valle reperti</l>

he had ruin'd a City in <hi>Aegypt</hi> called <hi>Thebes,</hi>
and ſeveral other Imputations. <hi>Ovid</hi> ſeems to
imply, as if the freedom he uſed with his tongue,
when heated with Wine, might be the reaſon of his
loſing <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s favour; for which he was baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as ſome think.
<q>
                  <l>Non fuit opprobrio celetraſſe Lycorida Gallo,</l>
                  <l>Sed linguam nimio non teneiſſe mero.</l>
               </q>
Nor is it unlikely that <hi>Ovid</hi> himſelf, giving th<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been partaker with him in equal ſufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101822:9"/>
How he dyed, is uncertain; ſome think <hi>Caeſar</hi>
cauſed him to be put to death; others believe, that
being baniſhed, and his ambitious Soul not able
to brook the Diſgrace, or elſe apprehenſive of the
Malice of his Enemies amongſt the Nobility, kill'd
himſelf, as <hi>Ovid</hi> intimates.
<q>Sanguis, atque animae prodige Galle tuae.</q>
Others again believe his Miſtriſs <hi>Cytharis,</hi> whom
he called <hi>Lycoris,</hi> forſaking him, he was more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of the loſs of her then his Government, and
for that reaſon kill'd himſelf; and <hi>Virgil</hi> ſeems
to lament him as having been a Victim to that
unhappy Love of his.
<q>
                  <l>Quae Nemora aut qui vos ſaltus habuere Puellae</l>
                  <l>Naiades, indigno cum Gallus amore periret.</l>
               </q>
Yet <hi>Propertius</hi> may give occaſion to believe that
he was ſlain in ſome Battel.
<q>
                  <l>Gallum per medios ereptum Caeſaris enſes,</l>
                  <l>Effugere ignotas non potuiſſe manus.</l>
               </q>
But probably from both theſe expreſſions one may
naturally gather, that <hi>Cytharis,</hi> to appeaſe the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of her new Lover, was a contriver of his
Death, and hired ſome to kill him: He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb facs="tcp:101822:10"/>
an excellent Poet, and was particularly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in Elegies; in which way of writing he was
not held to be inferiour to either <hi>Tibullus</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertius.</hi>
We have an account that he writ ſix
Books of Elegies, of which, perhaps, theſe ſix Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
only are preſerv'd to us; and he alſo tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one <hi>Euphorion</hi> a <hi>Chalcidonian</hi> Poet, which
<hi>Virgil</hi> confirms.
<q>
                  <l>Ibo &amp; Chalcidico quae ſunt mihi condita verſu,</l>
                  <l>Carmina Paſtoris Siculi modulabor avena.</l>
               </q>
He writ four Books of his Love to <hi>Cytharis,</hi> who
he called <hi>Lycoris,</hi> but none of them are left; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Ovid</hi> takes notice of them, and numbers him
amongſt the Catalogue of the moſt Famous Poets of
the World, particularly for that very Poem.
<q>
                  <l>Gallus &amp; Heſperiis, &amp; Gallus notus Eois,</l>

               </q>
And thus much of his Life; and if I have done
him that juſtice I aim'd at in this Tranſlation, I
believe the Reader will not think his time loſt in
peruſing it; and if I fail'd in it, I cannot help

                  <p>In this <hi>Elegy</hi> the <hi>Poet</hi> gives an account how he was
very much in love, when but a <hi>Boy;</hi> and that the
young Creature, with whom he was ſo Enamour'd,
return'd his Paſſion to the full: yet after all, when
with much toyl and difficulty it was ſo brought
about that he had Liberty to enjoy her, he would not,
but was then (by having that privilege granted
him) cured of his <hi>Love.</hi>

                     <hi>A laſting</hi> Reſt <hi>within thy quiet</hi> Grave:</l>
                  <l>For all vain Mortals muſt reſign their Breath</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Time,</hi> when e'er he calls, and march to <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>All muſt tread that inevitable <hi>Road,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Though <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> meets all in diff'rent <hi>Mode.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Though ſome to <hi>Want,</hi> and ſome to <hi>Plenty</hi> live;</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>So ſome in <hi>Trouble</hi> dye, and ſome in <hi>State;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Some dye too ſoon, ſome timely, ſome too late,</l>
                  <l>And none can ſhun, or be exempted <hi>Fate:</hi>

                  </l>
                  <l>There Age and Infancy together come,</l>
                  <l>And there they meet with Youth at his long home.</l>
                  <l>The Rich and Poor are both made equal there,</l>
                  <l>And there, alike, the Prince and Peaſant fare,</l>
                  <l>For Death, alas, is a meer Leveller.</l>
