            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The case is mine, and I cannot (worthy Maister Lewkenor) but with a great fordooming of my selfe, attende the like, or a greater downefall. For hauing long striued beyond my forces, to creepe out of the lothsome Caue of ingratitude, wherein I haue so long lyen obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and knowing all my owne abilities too weake to carry me thence, I haue at length with these feathers, which I haue borrowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, endeuoured to make my flight. But I feare me much, that my ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of them, and my too much aduenturous presuming to flie with them, being not myne owne, shall no sooner appeare before the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of such a iudgement as yours, but that all my tackling wil faile, and my selfe be vnrelieuably throwne downe into the incurable gulfe of confusion, ignorance, and disgrace.

            <head>The Authors Epistle Dedicatorie, to the most Honourable and reuerent Praelate, <hi>Don Diego Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, de Soto Maior,</hi> Bishop of Astorga. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE graue and wise Philosopher, Hipocrates, well waying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and qualities of humaine life, briefely in few wordes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the whole that is contained in the same, when he said: Life is short, knowledge long, time swift, occasion headlong, and experience dangerous. This is (right honourable and reuerend Praelate) a Sentence so pithy, prosound, and delicate, that it were not possible for any man in howe long wryting so euer, better or more materially to expresse the misery of those that are passed out of this world, of vs that as yet liue in it, and of as many as shall heereafter be while it endureth: And I know not who is so deuoyd of sence, but that sometimes thinketh with himselfe how wretched and vnstable is our estate, how swiftly and irreuocably time flieth away, and howe small a space our life endureth, which at such time as wee thinke that we haue reaped some knowledge and vnderstanding of some things in the world, though God wot it be but little in respect of the much that it is to be knowne; then presently commeth Death and cutteth vs off, who for late that he stayeth, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth he in the childhood of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. For if we marke it well, we shall finde, that how wise and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious so euer we account our selues, yet that in the very Winter and last of our life, we begin to learne and see new Accidents, at which we wonder as things that were neuer heard of before, and though we imagine that there is nothing in the whole world of which we are ignorant: yet euery day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most presenteth to our eyes some new matter or other vnknowne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderstood, thereby to abate the vaine conceaued pride of our owne vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall knowledge; and if we should liue a 1000. yeeres more, we should in like sort daily find new things to astonish vs. Those that are wisest ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are neuer puffed vp with such an opinion of their owne wisedome: but conforming themselues with the truth, doe say as Socrates sayde? One thing onely doe I know, which is, that I know nothing. This proceedeth of the shortnes of our life, the greatnes of the world, the secrets of Nature, the weakenes of our vnderstanding, and the error with which we abuse our selues in thinking that all things to be knowne, are comprehended in that little which we know. Diuers therefore of cleare iudgments, seeing the end of their dayes vnineuitably approach, sustaine no small griefe to see that they scarcely begin to know the worlde, and to vnderstand some particularities thereof, when forcibly they are constrained to leaue the same, and so to dye with the milke of wisedome in their mouthes. The excellent Philosopher Gorgias Leontinus, hauing liued a hundred and seauenty yeeres, when the houre of his death drew neere, seemed to be very heauy and sorrowfull; and when his friends and Schollers endeuoured to giue him consolation he aunswered: My sadnes is not because I dye, but because hauing studied all my life, it faileth me now when I begin to know and vnderstand somwhat.

astonished &amp; hold for miracles some new things, aboue their capacity, which happen in the worlde, haue small reason of their so great amazement. For what can be more worthy of admiration to men vertuous and of cleare iudgement, then the wonderfull machine and composition of this world, the mouing of the heauens in order so iust and due, the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects of the Sunne, the Moone, and of the other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: the strange influences of the Starres, the exceeding strength of the Poles, vpon whom all these things not stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one iote out of compasse, are moued with a Harmony so meruailous: the reason, wherewith the foure Elements stand and containe them selues, in their places appointed them, each of them affording vnto vs that part of himselfe of which we haue neede: the cloudes forming and thickning them selues in the region of the ayre: the raine, haile, snow, and ice, the vehement force and terrible violence of the winds, thunders, lightnings, and blazing-starres. Besides these, the world dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bringeth foorth and yeeldeth to our view so many thinges new, rare, and full of wonder, that if we would busie our selues to admire and contemplate the variety &amp; strangenes of each of them, we should haue leasure to doe nothing else. For how wonderfull is it to see that amongst so many men as are in the world, and daily are borne of new, though they beare all one proportion and shape, of eyes, mouth, nose, forehead, lippes, cheekes, eares, &amp;c. Yet it is almost impossible to finde one like another, and though it happen somtimes that one resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble another: yet there neuer wanteth some difference of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity. Besides this, behold the difference of trees, plants, hearbs, and flowers, which in each Countrey groweth, with such diuersity of colour, tast, smell, property, and vertue: and if these things, because we see them daily with our eyes, and handle them with our hands as thinges common, doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze vs, why should wee then so much wonder in seeing some things, which passe this common agreement and order of nature. Which for all that doe not exceede nature, neither are vnnaturall: though the conceite thereof, passe the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our reach and vnderstanding. To see a dead man ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, a dumb man made speake, or a man borne blind restored
<pb facs="tcp:19072:9"/>
to sight, such a thing we may well terme vnnatural &amp; miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: But as for things monstrous, of which som we see, some are out of vse, &amp; some vtterly vnknowne, me thinks in a vvise man they should work no alteration, nor breed any astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. Look amongst the green plants &amp; hearbs, &amp; you shall there somtimes find litle creepers &amp; worms, some of one sort, some of another, painted with sundry colours, some with many feet, some with great hornes in the forehead, some with wings, some with 2. heads, one before, and another behind, &amp; that they go &amp; moue as well of the one side as the other, &amp; if we should see these great &amp; huge, how would they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; be amazed that are ignorant of their causes. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, he that created al things aboue &amp; vnder the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in the aire, the earth, &amp; the Sea of nothing, with his only wil, hath lost his force: or his hand is become vnable, to doe all the rest, which in respect therof is nothing.

Wheras I haue heard &amp; read of many that were so like in resemblance the one vnto the other, that there was no difference at all to be found between them. Your selfe I know, must needs haue better knowledge hereof then I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you haue read Pliny &amp; other authors, which treat ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and <hi>Pedro Mexia</hi> hath copied out many examples of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his forrest of collections, besides all the which I wil alledge some notable examples.

I am sure you haue read what many authors write of K. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who <note place="margin">The likenes of Artemon to Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</note> being murdered by the means of his wife <hi>Laodice,</hi> she placed in his steed, &amp; clothed with his rich habiliaments &amp; regall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments one <hi>Artemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> of Siria, who resembled him in such sort, that he raigned two yeres, without being known or discouered of any man.

The Lacky com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, could not perswade them but that he was the selfe same whom they supposed, in the end, the old vvoman looking fixedly vpon him, for better assurance, (quoth she) if thou art my sonne, thou hast in such a place of thy legge a marke, vvhich vvhen thou wert a child was burned. The Lacky with wonderfull astonishment confessed that he had such a marke indeede, though still perseuering with oaths to affirme that he knew them not, and that hee neuer in his life before had beene in that Village, as the truth indeede vvas, for afterward it was proued, that he was borne farre from that place, and it was well knowne who were his Parents. Besides <note place="margin">A thing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table of two daughters and a sonne, borne all at a burthen.</note> this, it was my hap being but a stripling, to see an other the like, very strange, in a Village hard by the Citty of Segouia, where I remained foure or fiue dayes, in the house of a very honest &amp; substantiall man, which had by his wife two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

But leauing thys, let vs come to Auicenna, (for in thys matter we cannot goe out of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Philosophers) whose opinion in his seconde Booke is, that the imagination of the minde, is able to work so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a change in naturall things, that it hapneth oftentimes the Childe to resemble that thing which the Mother at the time of her conception imagineth. The selfe same sayth S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, in his 12. Booke of the Citty of God: that the earnest imagination of a woman going great, causeth often the child to be borne with the qualities &amp; conditions of the thing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19072:15"/>
and vve reade in Plutarch, that a white woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing chylde by a vvhite man, was deliuered of an Infant <note place="margin">A blacke child, borne of white Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> coale-blacke, because at the tyme that she conceaued, she held her eyes and imagination fixed vpon the picture of a Black-Moore which was painted in a cloth vpon the wal, which the child wholy resembled.</p>

There are others without either neck or head, hauing their eyes in their shoulders: others their faces plaine without nosethrils, in steed of which they haue tvvo little holes onely: others without mouthes, maintaining them selues with the onely smell of fruits &amp; hearbs, the force of whose sent is such, that they dry and wither vp the flovvers, in smelling out of them all their substance. The smell of any euill or noysome thing is so contrary to them, that oft-times it putteth them in danger of their liues. Their speech and vndestanding is by signes. Besides, they vvrite that there are men in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Scithia, or Tartaria, with so little mouthes, that they cannot eate, but maintaine their liues with sucking in onely the substance and iuice of flesh and fruites. There is another kind of men with dogs faces and Oxe feete, which containe all their speech vnder two wordes, onely with the which the one vnderstandeth the other. There are others whom they call Phanaces, whose eares are so great, that they couer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">Phanaces.</note> their vvhole bodies: they are so strong, that vvith one pull they teare whole trees vp by the roots, vsing them in their

Others they describe with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and monstrous formes, which if I should rehearse all, I should neuer make an end, yet by the way, I will tell you what I haue reade in one of Ptolomes tables of <hi>Tartaria maior,</hi> There is in it, sayth he, a Country now called <hi>Georgia,</hi> fast by the kingdome of Ergonil, in the which there are fiue sorts of <note place="margin">Sundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers shapes of men in the Country of Georgia.</note> people, some blacke as Ethiopians, some white like vs, some hauing tailes like Peacocks, some of very little and low stature with two heads, and others whose face and teeth are in maner of horse iawes.

Many affirme, that they haue seene them in the deserts of Aegipt. The Gentiles in diuers places adored them for Gods, and Pan the God of Sheepheards, was alwayes painted in the likenes of a Satyre.

               <p>As for the Amazons, many Writers affirme that they haue been, <note place="margin">Pigmees. Amazons.</note> and there are so many histories recorded of them, theyr valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deedes of Armes, the battailes and warres in which they

were, that it should seeme great temerity to say the contrary. Though Plutarch writing the life of great Alexander, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth xij. Greeke Authors that wrote also of his life, some in his very time, and some little after his death, of which some fewe make mention of one Thalestris, Queene of the Amazones, that came so far to see him and speake with him, but the rest <note place="margin">Thalestris Qu. of the Amazons.</note> and the greater part say nothing at all thereof, wherby he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to doubt whether it were true or no, for if it were, hee thinks that such and so esteemed Authors would neuer haue past so notable a matter in silence. Besides, Strabo was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that this matter of Amazons was altogether faigned, whose wordes are these: Who can beleeue that there was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at any time, Army, Cittie, or Commonwealth onelie of women, and not onely that there were, but that they made war &amp; inuaded conqueringly vpon other Countries, subdued their neighbours in battailes, ranged and dared set their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Ionia, and on the farther side of Pontus, euen to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica?

               <p>Of these the most parte of Cosmographers make mention, describing them to be men of three spans in length.

But omitting the sundry opinions of others, which haue written of this matter, it should be a great rashnes, not to giue credite to so graue Authors, as were Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, Soline, and Pliny, which affirme them to be: and it may be, that in times past this race of men, were in those sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts which they say, all of one forme and likenes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which wee sayde of the Amazones: but let vs leaue this to be concluded, by men of greater curiosity then wee are, onely by the way, I will tell you this, that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of opinion, that these Pigmees are not reasonable men, but beastes, bearing the figure and likenesse of men, vvith <note place="margin">Pigmees are men, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the vse of reason.</note> some little more vse of reason, then the other beastes haue.</p>

so that euery one will tell you a new thing, and for my part I will not beleeue but that they are true: because we see euery day new secrets of nature discouered, &amp; the world is so great, that we cannot knowe in the one part what is done in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If it were not for this, it were vnpossible to write the number of them, neither were any booke how great so euer, able to containe them. But for the proofe of the rest, I will tell you of one strange people, found out in the world. Mine author is <hi>Iohanes Bohemus,</hi> a Dutch man, in his booke, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Iohanes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemus.</note> the manners and customes of all Nations, who though he declareth not the time wherein it happened, nor what the <note place="margin">The story of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Iland found out by Iambolo</note> person was that found them out, yet he writeth it so familier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it seemeth he was some man meruailous well knowne in his Country: but because you shall not thinke that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunce the matter with wordes of mine owne, I will repeate those selfe same which he vsed, in the which haue patience if I be somwhat long. <hi>Iambolo,</hi> sayth he, a man from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood wel brought vp, after that his Father died, vsed the trade <note place="margin">Iohanes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemus. <hi>Cap.</hi> 26.</note> of Merchandize, who voyaging towards Arabia, to buy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and costly perfumes, the ship wherein he went, was taken by certaine Rouers, which made him with another of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, Cow-heard, and keeper of their cattell, with which as he went one morning to the pasture, hee and his companion were taken by certaine Aethiopians, and caried into Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, to a Citty situate on the Sea, whose custome was from long and auncient time to cleanse that place, and others of the Country there abouts, according to the aunswere of an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of theirs, in sending at certaine seasons two men beeing strangers, to the Iland which they call Fortunat, whose enha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants liue in great and blessed happines. If these two went thither and returned againe, it prognosticated to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try great felicity: but if they returned through feare of the long way or tempest of the Sea, many troubles should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to that Country, and those which so returned, were slaine and torne in peeces. The Aethiopians had a little boate, fit for two men to rule, into the which, they put victuals enough for sixe moneths, beseeching them with all instance to direct the Provv of their boate, according to the commaundement
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19072:22"/>
of the Oracle, towards the South, to the end they might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue in that Iland where those fortunate men liued, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them great rewardes, if after theyr arriuall they returned backe: threatning to pull them in peeces, if they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore through feare returne to any coast of that Country: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause theyr feare should be the occasion of many miseries to that Land; and as in so returning they should shewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues most wicked and cruell, so should they at theyr hands, expect all crueltie possible to bee imagined. Iambolo and his companion beeing put into the boate with these conditions, the Ethiopians remained on the shore celebrating theyr holie ceremonies, and inuoking theyr Gods to guide prosperously thys little ship, and to graunt it after the voyage finished, safe returne. Who sayling continuallie 4. months, passing many dangerous tempests, at last, wearied with so discomfortable a voyage, arriued at the Iland wherto they were directed, which was round and in compasse about 5000. stadyes, approching to the shore, some of the inhabitants came to receiue them in a little Skiffe, others stoode on the shoare, wondering at the strangenes of theyr habite and attyre: but in fine, all receiued them most curteously, communicating with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such thinges as they had. The men of this Iland, are not in body and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners like vnto ours, though in forme and figure they resemble vs, for they are foure cubites higher, and theyr boanes are like <note place="margin">Men whose bones are like sinewes.</note> sinewes, which they double &amp; writhe each way, they are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing nimble, and withall so strong, that whatsoeuer they take in theyr handes, there is no possible force able to take it from them. They are hairie, but the same is so polished and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that not so much as any one haire standeth out of order. Theyr faces most beautifull, theyr bodies well featured, the entry of theyr eares far larger then ours. The chiefest thing wherein they differ from vs, is theyr tongues, which haue a singuler particularitie giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Nature, the which is, that from theyr birth, they are so parted and deuided, that they seeme to be double, so that they vse them diuersly, and in one <note place="margin">Men with deuided tongues, which spe<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

men at once, to one with the one part, and to the other vvith the other part of the tongue, and demanding of the one, they aunswere to the other, as though the two tongues were in two seuerall mouthes of two sundry men. The ayre is al the yeare long so temperate in this Iland, that (as the Poet writeth) the Peare remaineth on the Peare-tree, the Aple on the Aple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and the Grapes vppon the Vine, without withering or drying. The day and night are alwaies equall, the Sunne at noone dayes maketh no shadow of any thing. They liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kindreds, to the number of 500. in company together. They haue no houses not certaine habitations, but fieldes and Medowes. The earth without tillage yeeldeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboundant store of fruites, for the vertue of the Iland, and the temprature of theyr climate, maketh the earth being of it selfe fertile, passing fruitfull, yea more then enough. There grow many Canes, yeelding great store of white seedes, as bigge as Pidgions eggs, which gathering and making wette with hote <note place="margin">Bread made of white seede.</note> water they then let dry, which being done they grinde it, and make thereof bread wonderfully sweet and delectable. They haue sundry great Fountaines, of the which some are of hote water, most wholesome to bathe in, and to cure infirmities, &amp; others to drinke, most sweete and comfortable. They are all much addicted to Sciences, and principally they are curious in Astrologie: they vse 28. letters, and besides them other 7. <note place="margin">These men vse 28. let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> Characters, euery one of the which they interprete 4. wayes for the signification of theyr meaning. All of them for the most part liue very long, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly till the age of a 150. yeres, and for the most part without any sicknesse. And if there be any one that is diseased with a long infirmitie, he is by the law constrained to die. In like sort, when they come to a certaine <note place="margin">At 150. yeres they kil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues</note> age which they account complete, they willingly kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. They write not like vnto vs, for theyr line commeth from aboue, downeward. There is in that Ilande a kinde of hearbe, vpon which all those that lay themselues downe, dye sleeping as it were in a sweet slumber. The women mary not but are common to all men, &amp; they all bring vp the children with equall affection, oftentimes they take the children from their mothers, and send them into other parts, because they

should not know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which they do to that end that there should be no particuler but equall loue &amp; affection amongst them; they haue no ambition of honour or valour more one then another, so that they liue in perpetuall agreement and conformity. There are bred certaine great beasts, of a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous nature and vertue, in their bodies they are rounde like a <note place="margin">A most strange kind of beast.</note> Tortoys, &amp; in the midst diuided with 2. lines athwart, in the end of each of those halfes, they haue 2. eyes, and 2. hearings, but one belly onely, into the which the sustenance commeth as well from the one part as the other: they haue many leggs and feet, with the which they goe as well one way as another, the blood of thys beast is of singuler vertue for diuers things: what part soeuer of a mans body being cut and touched with this blood, healeth presently. There are in this Iland manie Foules, and some of such greatnes, that by them they make experience of theyr children, setting them vp on theyr backs, and making them flie vp into the ayre with them; and if the laddes sitte fast vvithout any feare, they account them hardy, but if they tremble or seeme to be fearefull, they bring them vp with an ill vvill, reputing them simple, of dull courage, and of short life. Amongst those kindreds which keepe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes companie together, the eldest is King and gouernour, to whom all the rest obey, who when he commeth to the age of a hundred and fiftie yeares, depriueth himselfe of life, in whose place succeedeth without delay the eldest of that Trybe.</p>

               <p>This which you haue sayd, agreeth with that which Iosephus writeth, in his fift booke of Antiquities.

And in time of Pope Iulio the third, no longer agone, there was a man in a Village of Calabria, who perchance is yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, of so extraordinary a sise and stature, that the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous <note place="margin">A man of Calabria of a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous tall and big stature.</note> to see him, sent for him to Rome, who because neither Horse nor Mule was able to carry him, was brought to Rome in a Coach, out of the which his legs from the knees down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hanged foorth: he was so high, that the tallest man in Rome reached not to his halfe breast, according to which height, the rest of his members were proportioned: it was a thing of admiration, to see how deuouringly he eat &amp; drank.

               <p>I am of opinion, that in times past, the men were for the most part greater then they now are, and that by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they decrease daily: and whereas the Auncients write, that men then exceeded not the measure of seauen feete in height, that their feete were then greater then ours, and their cubits, inches, spans, and all their other measures also, so that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the world lasteth, the lesse shall the people waxe.

not to the life of man, for what auaileth long life, if men liue continually in penury and want of thinges necessary? For in so great a height, Spring they could haue none, neither could they gather water into Cesternes, because it was higher then the Region where the clouds are congealed, which could by no means moue themselues wanting wind as they must needs want there: for howe can there be any, where the ashes lye without mouing? so that this &amp; other commodities for their sustenance, were to be prouided, with such paine, difficulty, and vnease, that forsaking this place, they chose rather with more ease though shorter life to commodate themselues else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: for this selfe same cause is the mountaine of Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus <note place="margin">There blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth no wind at all on the top of the hill Olympus.</note> vninhabited, in whose top also it is affirmed, the ayre to be so pure, that there bloweth no wind at all.

But all this is to no other ende, then that you should vnderstand the reason, how mans life is to be conserned more in some places then in others: and euen so I thinke it to be, in the Prouinces which we haue rehearsed &amp; that also which the selfe Solinus sayeth of the Aethiopians, whom they call Macrobians, who are on the other side of the Iland Meroe, and liue ordinarily <note place="margin">Macrobians.</note> 150. yeeres, and many reach to 200. And Gaudencius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula writeth, that he hath found Authors, which affirme, that in the selfe same Iland Meroe, the people neuer die of any sicknes, liuing so long till very age consume them. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Men neuer die of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the Iland Meroe</note> this generality of liues, let vs come to entreate of some particulers without alleadging the liues of those holy Fathers out of the old Testament, before and after the flood, of 800. and 900. yeeres a peece, which we firmely beleeue through faith, and because the holy Church affirmeth it, so that wee know it to be true and indubitable: neither is that a small ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to giue credite to some things, which seeme for their strangenes fabulous, as that which Pliny writeth, alleadging Damates in his chronicle, where he saith, that <hi>Pictorius</hi> Prince of the Epiorians, liued 300. yeeres. Xenophon affirmeth, <note place="margin">Pictorius li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued 300. yeeres.</note> that a King of the Maritimes, had 600. yeeres of age, and a Sonne of his 800: But Pliny iesteth thereat, saying that this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19072:30"/>
computation of yeeres &amp; ages was made through ignorance of times; for in those dayes, many reckoned the Sommer for one yeere, and the Winter for another, others made them shorter, reckoning the Spring for one, and the Autumne for another, so that one of our yeeres co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth as much as foure of theyrs. So counted the Arcadians: and the Egyptians made a yeere of euery month, from one coniunction of the Moone to another: so that it is no maruaile if they say, that some of them liued a 1000. yeeres and more. And if that K. of Maritimes liued 600. and his sonne 800. yeeres, I vvarrant you it was according to this account, so that in fine it seemeth that the longest age of a man cannot extend aboue a 150. or a 160. yeares, and so long, sayth Mucianus, they liue that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite the top of the mountaine Timoli.</p>

               <p>I will not wonder at this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I my selfe haue knowledge of two the like, wherof the one is, that being in Rome the yeare 1531. the publique voice and fame throughout all Italy was, that there was in Taranto <note place="margin">Two men that in theyr old age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g againe.</note> an olde man of a 100. yeares that had turned young againe, changing all that euer he had in him, euen to his skin and the very nayles of his feete and hands, of which dispoyling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe like a Snake, hee grew so newe and fresh, and became so young and frolick, that his very familiars knew him not, and in the end, for it was well 50. yeares past that this had hapned to him, he turned to be so old againe, that his colour proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resembled the roote of a vvithered tree. The other vvas, (which is most true and assured) that the Admirall Don Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driques passing in his youth through a Village called Rioia, encountred a man of the age, as it seemed, of fiftie yeares, who tolde him, that hee had beene footeman to his Grandfather, vvhich the Admirall making difficultie to beleeue, because his Grandfather was dead long and many yeeres agone, the other with othes assured him that it was true, and vvithall, told him that he was at that present a hundred yeeres old, and that he had turned to be young againe: changing his nature, and renuing in him all things that caused age. The Admirall astonished at thys myracle, made diligent enquiry therof and found by infallible proofes, the trueth to be in each poynt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had sayd: and this is by the vulgar fame, and by infinite witnesses that were present, notoriously known to be

He remembred when that Citty was vnpeopled, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the chiefest &amp; most important strengths of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia: he had 4 times being old renued to youth, each time ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of his hoary haires and riueled wrinckles, and sheading his rotten teeth, in place of which fresh and new arised: and at such time as the Vizroy sawe him, the hayres of his head were black, and those of his beard also, though hee had there but few. A Phisition being present, was bid feele his pulses, the which were found to be as lusty, as though he had beene in the flower and prime of his youth. This man in his youth had been a Gentle, and afterwards turned to embrace the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious beleefe of the Moores, hee was naturall of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Hungarie, hee confessed that in his time he had had seuen hundred wiues, of which some died, &amp; some he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken. The King of Portugall had notice of this man, &amp; kept reckoning of him, and the Armies that came yeerelie from thence, brought him tydings that hee lyued, and liueth as yet as they that come thence say, so that he must now haue 370, yeres. The selfe same chronicler also writeth, that at such time as the selfe <hi>Nunnes de Acuna</hi> gouerned, there was in the cittie of Vengala another Moore, named Xegueor, natiue of a Prouince called Xegue, that was also 300. yeeres old both by <note place="margin">A Moore in the Citty of Vengala 300. yeeres olde.</note> his lowne saying, and the affirmation of those that knew him well besides other many great proofes and arguments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

These vndertooke this enterpise to destroy these Bulls, and through the aduantage of their horses, &amp; the vertue of theyr own courage, slew &amp; tooke daily so many of them, that at last they cleared &amp; deliuered the Country of this anoyance.

My witnesses are men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the order of Knighthood, that on the Ocean Sea neere to Calays, they saw come into their shippe about night time a Sea man, whose shape without any difference at all was humaine, he was so great and wayed so heauy, that the boate began to sinke on that side where hee stoode; and if hee had <note place="margin">A strange History of a Sea man.</note> stayed any thing longer, it had been drowned. <hi>Theodore Gaze</hi> also alleadged by Alexander of Alexandria, writeth, that in his time one of these Sea men, or rather men fishes, accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to hide him selfe in a Caue, vnder a Spring by the Sea side in Epirus, where young maydens vsed to fetch their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which seeing any one comming alone, rising vp, hee caught her in his armes, and carried her into the Sea, so that hauing in this sort carried away diuers: the enhabitants being aduertised thereof, set such grins for him, that at last they tooke him, &amp; kept him some dayes. They offered him meat,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19072:34"/>
but he refused to eate, and so at length, beeing in an element contrary to his nature, died.</p>
               <p>The same Alexander speaketh of another Sea-monster, which Bonifacius Neapolitanꝰ, a man of great authority cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified him that he saw brought out of Mauritania into Spain, <note place="margin">A Sea man brought out of Maurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia into Spaine.</note> whose face was like a man some-what aged, his beard &amp; haire curled and glistring, his complexion and colour in a manner blew, &amp; in all his members proportioned like a man, though his stature were somewhat greater, the onely difference vvas, that he had certaine finnes, with the which as it seemed, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the water as he swamme.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues withall. Olaus Magnus handleth very copiously thys matter of Tritons or Sea-men, of which in the Northerne Seas, he sayth there is great abundance, and that it is true that they vse to come into little Shyps, of which with their weight they ouerturne some, and that they gette vp also into great ships, but as it seemeth, not with meaning to doe hurte, but onely through nouelty and curiositie to view them, and that commonly they keepe together in flocks and companies, in maner of an Armie: and it hath happened, that som of them entring into shyps, haue been so amazed, that they haue been taken by the Mariners: but in finding themselues layde hold on, they giue loude and pittifull shrikes, making a most hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous and ilfauoured noyse: at which very instant there are heard infinite other the like cryes and howlings, in such sort,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:35"/>
that they make deafe the eares of them that heare them, and there appeare so many of theyr heads aboue water, as though they were a mightie Armie of many people, with the vvhich, and with their terrible noyse, they make the waues rise so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently that is resembleth a furious tempest.

And therfore that which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Ludouico</hi> saide, is not without reason, for truely though they be not creatures reasonable, yet seeme they to haue farre greater vse thereof then other Fishes haue, for as farre as wee can conceaue and iudge, that entry of theirs so boldly into the ships, is not with any intention to do harme, but only to view what is in them, and to behold the men whose likenesse they beare. And if perchance they ouerturne any little vessel, such as are Cockboats or Skiffes, it is through their heauy weight, and not through any will to doe mischiefe.

               <p>One poynt herein me thinks by the way is rather to be helde for a fable then to bee credited: for though it were that Nature through any such copulation, should suffer some thing to be engendered, yet should the same be a monster, &amp; <note place="margin">Reasons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the former sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of men, called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini.</note> not a man capable of reason, as you say this was, for hence would arise two no small inconueniences; the one, that there should be men in the worlde, whose beginning shoulde not discend from our first Parents Adam and Eue: for this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton neyther is, neyther can bee accounted a reasonable man, and of the posteritie of Adam, in like sort, neither his sonne, nor those that shall discend of him: the other is, to gaine-saie the generall rule of all Philosophers and Phisitions, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely affirme it to be vnpossible, that there shoulde be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered of the seede of a man reasonable, and of a creature vnreasonable, any creature like to eyther of them, perfectlie bearing eyther of both theyr shapes. Though put the case that the contrary sometimes happen between a Mare and an Asse, a dogge and a Shee-woolfe, or a Foxe and a bitch, yet the contradiction is not so great, these beastes differing so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one from another, as the great and vnspeakeable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vvhich in so manie poynts is betweene men and bruite beastes. And though in likenesse and similitude a Seaman resemble a man of reason: yet it suffiseth that hee differ onely in reason: then the which, there can in the world be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difference. And therefore Galen the Phisition, in his third Booke <hi>De vsu partium,</hi> in scoffing manner iesteth at a certaine Poet called Pindarus, because hee affirmed the fable of Centaures to be true.</p>

               <p>There liued, say they, in a Towne of the Kingdome of <note place="margin">A most strange and admirable History, of a Virgine deflowred by a Beare.</note> Sweueland, built neere the mountaines, a very principall and rich man, who had a daughter very beautifull and faire, the which going foorth one euening in company of other may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to walke and take the ayre, as they were sporting in the midst of their deuises and pastimes, there issued out of a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket that was on those mountaines a Beare, of exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fierce, and terrible, making towardes them as fast as hee could, the which tremblingly &amp; fearefully began to flie, each one procuring to saue her selfe, onely this seely young may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens hap was to fall into his pawes, with whom running away as fast as hee might, without any resistance he recouered the thicknes of the wood, whose principall intention though it were (as it is to be imagined) to satisfie the appetite of his raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hunger: yet was it the pleasure of God, not to permit this maydens death; for the Beare moued with an instinct of Nature different farre from his cruell kind, refrained not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from deuouring her, but carrying her into a Caue which he had, in the bottome of a deepe Valley in the Forrest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the rage of his cruelty into a loue most vehement, stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her softly with his pawes, cherinshing, and handling her in such gentle sort, that she perceauing his intention, relented in some part her feare, and for terror of death not daring to resist his fiercenes, suffered him to gather the flower of her virginity. The Beare daily issued out of the Caue, chasing Harts and other beasts, presenting alwayes part of his pray vnto her, of which hunger compelled her to eate: her drinke was cleare water, out of a running Fountaine that passed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the trees neere this Caue, and in this sort sustained she her desolate life, praying continually vnto God to haue pitty on her, and to deliuer her out of this wretched estate and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calamity: And though shee determined oftentimes to
<pb facs="tcp:19072:37"/>
runne away when the Beare was out, yet shee neuer dared to attempt the same, fearing death if she were found by him, and besides, not daring to aduenture through the mountaines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so full of sundry &amp; diuers cruell wild beasts. Hauing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine moneths endured this vnhappy kind of life; it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that certaine Noble men came with nets, toyles, &amp; dogs a hunting into this Forrest, by whom this Beare was entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and slaine. The vvench hearing their cries and voyces, and that they were neere vnto her Caue, ranne with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble speed vnto them, who with singuler amazement, as well at the ralation shee made, as at the wildnes of her affrighted countenance, carried her away with them, and deliuered her vnto her parents, who scarcely knew her, she was become so vgly &amp; disfigured. Nature which often worketh things mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous out of her natural order &amp; common obserued course, ioyned in such sort the seede of this brute beast in the body of this mayden, that to her intollerable greefe and dismayment, shee perceaued her selfe to goe great, fearing nor attending anie thing else, then to bee deliuered of some horrible mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. But such was the will of the Almighty, that at the end of nine moneths, shee came to beare a goodly Boy, resembling in nothing else his Father, then that hee was somewhat more hairy then other children are. They nourished him vp with diligence and care, calling him the Beare: or perchance that name was giuen him afterwards by the people, wondering at his miraculous fiercenes &amp; valour; for after he came to mans estate, he became so strong, valiant, and hardy of his person, that he was redoubted farre and neere, and comming to haue knowledge of those that slew the Beare, by whom he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered, he depriued them of life, saying; That though by theyr meanes he had receaued a good turne, yet could he doe no lesse then reuenge his Fathers death.

               <p>In trueth this Story should seeme fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, were it not by so many graue and learned men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be true: but wee may well giue it credite, because wee haue knowledge of the like happened in our time no lesse monstrous, nor woorthy of admiration, then this which you haue rehearsed; and there are as yet many which founde themselues present, and can giue witnesse thereof. It was in this sort, as I haue heard it through true relation of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, most woorthy to be beleeued. A vvoman in Portugale for a hainous offence by her committed, was condemned, <note place="margin">The most wonderfull History of a woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten with child by an Ape.</note> and banished into an vninhabited Iland, one of those which they commonly call the Isles of Lagartes, whether shee was transported by a shippe that went for India, and by the way set a shoare in a Cock-bote, neere a great mountaine couered with trees and wilde bushes, like a Desert. The poore vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man finding her selfe alone forsaken and abandoned, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of life, beganne to make pittifull cryes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, in commending her selfe vnto God, him to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour her in this her lamentable &amp; solitary estate. Whiles shee was making these mournfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, there discended from the mountaine a great number of Apes, which to her excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding terror and astonishment, compassed her round about, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the which, there was one far greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest, who standing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hind legs vpright, seemed in height nothing inferiour to the common sort of men: he seeing the vvoman weepe so bitterly, as one that assuredlie held her self for dead, came vnto her, shewing a cheerefull semblaunce, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly as it vvere comforted her, offering her certaine fruites to eate, in such sort, that he put her in hope that shee should not receaue any damage of those other Apes, taking her by the arme, and gently as it vvere inuiting her to followe him to the mountaines, to the which she willingly condiscending, he led her into his Caue, whether all the other Apes resorted, prouiding her such victuals as they vsed, where-with &amp; with the water of a Spring neere therevnto, she maintained her life a certaine time, during the which, not being able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, vnlesse she would haue presently been slaine, she suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Ape to haue the vse of her body, in such sort that
<pb facs="tcp:19072:38"/>
she grew great, and at two seuerall times was deliuered of two Sonnes, the which as she her selfe saide, and as it was by those that saw them afterwards affirmed, spake, and had the vse of reason. These little boyes, being the one of two &amp; the other of three yeeres aged, it happened that a ship returning out of India, passing thereby, and being vnfurnished of fresh water, the Marriners hauing notice of the Fountaine which was in that Iland, and determining thereof to make their prouision, set them selues a shore in a Cockbote, which the apes percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, fled into the thickest of the mountaine, hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, wherewith the woman emboldened and determining to forsake that abhominable life, in the which she had so long time against her will continued, ranne forth, crying as loud as shee could vnto the Marriners, who perceauing her to be a woman, attended her, and carried her with them to their ship, which the Apes discouering gathered presently to the shore, in so great a multitude, that they seemed to be a whole Army, the greater of which through the brutish loue and affection which he beare, waded so farre into the Sea after her, that hee was almost drowned, manifesting by his shrikes and howling how greeuously he took this iniury done him: but seeing that it booted not, because the Marriners beganne to hoise their sailes and to depart, he returned, fetching the lesser of the two Boyes in his armes, the which, entring againe into the water as farre as he could, he held a great while aloft aboue water, and at last, threw into the Sea, where it was presently drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: which done, he returned backe fetching the other, and bringing it to the same place, the which in like sort he held a great while aloft, as it were threatning to drowne that as hee had done the other. The Mariners moued with the Mothers compassion, and taking pitty of the seely Boy, which in cleare and perfect words cryed after her, returned back to take him, but the Ape daring not attend them, letting the Boy fall into the water, returned, and fled towards the mountaines with the rest. The Boy was drowned before the Marriners could suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour him, though they vsed their greatest diligence: At their returne to the ship, the vvoman made relation vnto them of all that happened to her in manner aboue rehearsed, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19072:38"/>
hearing, with great amazement they departed thence, and at their arriuall in Portugall made report of all that they had seene or vnderstoode in this matter. The woman was taken and examined, who in each poynt confessing this fore-saide history to be true, was condemned to be burnt aliue, aswell for breaking the commaundement of her banishment, as also for the committing of a sinne so enorme, lothsome, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable. But <hi>Hieronimo capo de ferro,</hi> who was afterwards made Cardinall, beeing at that instant the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, considering that the one of her faults was to saue her life, and the other to deliuer her selfe out of the captiuity of these brute beastes, and from a sinne so repugnant to her nature &amp; conscience, humbly beseeched the King to pardon her, which was graunted him on condition, that shee should spende the rest of her life in a Cloyster, seruing God and repenting her former offences.</p>

               <p>That which <hi>Iohn de Banos,</hi> Chronicler of the King of Portugall writeth, is no lesse meruailous, but of as great or greater admiration then any of these, if there were thereof so sufficient witnesses to proue it true. Writing certaine memorable thinges of the Kingdomes of Pegu and Sian, which are on the other side of the Riuer Ganges, hee sayth, that the people of those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, hold and affirme for a matter assured and indubitable, that of long time that Country was vninhabited, and so wild and desert, and possessed of so many fierce and cruell beasts, that if a whole Armie of men had come, they could not haue preuailed against theyr multitude. It hapned on a time, that a ship comming from the Kingdome of Chinay, was through a violent tempest driuen on that Coast among the Rocks, so that all those that were therein perrished, sauing onely one woman, and a mighty great mastiue, the which defended her from the furie of wilde beastes, vsing daily with her fleshlie copulation, in such sort, that she became great, and in proces of time was deliuered of a sonne, she being at that present ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie young, the boy in space of time had also acquaintance

               <p>It is true, there is indeede much talke of the <note place="margin">Mermaids.</note> Mermaydes, whom they say from the middle vpward to haue the shape of women, and of a fish from thence downeward.

Onelie Pedro Mexias sayth, that in a certaine strange and terrible tempest, there was one of them amongst a number of other Fishes, driuen a shoare on the Sea-coast, hauing the visage of <note place="margin">A mermayd driuen a shore on the Sea-coast.</note> a vvoman most beautifull, expressing in lamentable sort such sorrowe and griefe, that shee mooued the beholders to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, vvho gently turned her backe againe into the water, vvhereinto shee willingly entred and swamme away, vvithout being seene any more.

               <p>Neuer wonder so much at <note place="margin">Tyresias the Theban Prophet</note> this, for possibly this which is reported of him as a tale false and feigned, was indeede truth, as many other the like, which haue with great authority beene written and affirmed. For proofe whereof read Pliny in his 4. chapter of his 7. Booke, where he vseth these words, It is no matter feyned, sayth hee, that women sometimes change their sexe, for we sinde in the Chronicles, that Publiꝰ Liciniꝰ Crassꝰ, &amp; Caius Cassiꝰ Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginꝰ beeing Consuls, a young mayden, perfect in that sexe, <note place="margin">The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Casin changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man.</note> daughter to Casinus, was changed and metamorphozed to a perfect man, and therefore by the commaundement of theyr Soothsayers, was carried away as a thing prodigious, and cast into a desert Iland.</p>
               <p>And Licinius Mucianus affirmeth, that he saw in Argos a man called Aresconte, who had beene first a vvoman, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">The like of a woman in Argos.</note> Arescusa, after the changing of her sexe she came to haue a beard and married a vvife: of the like sort he sawe a young strypling in the Citty of Smyrna, and a little farder he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to say, &amp; I my selfe saw in Affrica, Luciꝰ Cosciꝰ, a cittizen of Triditania, who the selfe same day that he was maried, beeing then a woman, was transformed into a man.

Another far stranger then eyther of these is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the same authour, of a woman that had been maried &amp; brought forth a sonne, which afterwards beeing conuerted into a man, married another woman, and had children by her,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:40"/>
but because these are old matters, and it may be sayd that wee goe farre for witnesses, I will tell you what Doctor Amatus writeth, a Phisition of no small estimation in Portugall, who in a worke of Phisicke which he made, sayth, that in a village called Esgueyra, distant ix. leagues from the Citty of Corim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, there liued a Gentleman, who had a daughter named Marya Pacheco, the which at such age as by the course of nature her flowers should haue come downe, in sted thereof, as though it had before lyen hidden in her belly, there issued <note place="margin">A gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans daugh ter of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her sex.</note> forth a perfect and able member masculine, so that of a vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shee became a man, and was presently clothed in mans habite and apparrell, and her name changed from Marie to Manuell Pacheco, and not long after, passing into the East Indies, shee wan in the vvarres great reputation through the valour of her person, from whence returning most opulent and rich, she shortly afterward married a Gentlewoman of a very Noble house, by whom whether she had any children or no, he writeth not: but onely that she neuer came to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beard, retayning alwayes a womanly face &amp; countenance: and thys he affirmeth of his owne sight and knowledge. But those that will neyther giue credite to these thinges vvhich I haue sayde, nor to the Authors of them, let them read Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, by a common consent called the Euangelist of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.

Elements concurring in the generation of all things created) with sundry proper and particuler gifts, vertues, and operations, the diuersities of which, by experience we finde in Riuers, Springs, Fountaines, Ponds, Lakes, and Floodes: the cause whereof is, (though the water be all one, &amp; proceed wholy from one beginning &amp; originall) that the Sea passing through the veynes and concauities of the earth, taketh and participateth the vertue, nature, and propertie of the same earth and minerals through which it passeth, whereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that some Springs are hote, some cold, some bitter, som sweet, some salt and brackish, and others of so many different tastes &amp; properties, that it is vnpossible to reckon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There are many Authors which write of theyr different vertues and conditions, some of the which are recited by Pedro Mexias, in a chapter of his booke entituled, The Forrest of Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which (seeing you may there finde at large, when it shall please you to peruse him) I will spend no time in rehearsing.</p>

               <p>I am perswaded that he left them out, not for vvant of remembrance or knowledge of them, but onelie that hee wrote those, which he accounted the principallest, &amp; of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test wonder. For what greater or more incredible strangenes
<pb facs="tcp:19072:43"/>
may there be then that of the Fountaine of <hi>Epirus,</hi> into the <note place="margin">The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus.</note> which putting a Torch or a candle lighted, it quencheth and extinguisheth the flame thereof, and putting it in dead, it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleth and enflameth the same: and that which he writeth of other Riuers &amp; Lakes, which burned the hands of those that had falsly sworne beeing put into them, and others that filled them ful ofleprosie; and of the Fountaine <hi>Elusidis,</hi> which in <note place="margin">The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidis.</note> sounding a Flute or other musicall instrument, beginneth to swel &amp; buble vp in such quantity as though it would flow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the which in ceasing the sound, appeaseth it selfe againe, &amp; sinketh &amp; setleth it selfe into a quiet estate as it was before. There are so many like vnto these written &amp; reported, that to go about to rehearse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all would be an endlesse work. I will only therfore recite some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> recited by Pliny, in his second booke cap. 103. &amp; som other mentioned by other authors of great authority, grauity and credit, which I imagine you haue not heard, neither are they in the collections of the beforesayd Author remembred. First therfore to begin, how strange &amp; miraculous is that of <hi>Iacobs Well</hi> in Sichar, where Sychen the son of Emor died, by signes and tokens of which, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants <note place="margin">Iacobs Wel in Sichar.</note> knowe in what sort the Riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> shall ouerflowe that ensuing yere (for it hapneth yerely once) at which time they faile not with all diligence to obserue the tokens thereof, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially how high the water riseth, wherby they assuredly know in what sort the <hi>Nile</hi> shall rise, and how far he shall ouerflowe that yere: by which obseruation, they know if the yere shalbe scarse &amp; barrein, or plentiful &amp; abundant, according to which they make their prouisions, fetching from other parts thinges necessary for their sustenaunce, if there be any apparance of dearth. Of the Lake which Pedro Mexias sayth is in Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, in the which those that bathe themselues, come forth as it were annoynted and besmeared with Oyle: Pomponius Mela &amp; Solinus make mencion, whom hee alleageth for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, saying that the water thereof is so subtile, delicate and and pure, that a feather falling therein, goeth straight without any let downe into the bottome, which is no small cause to wonder at, that being in shew greasie and full of grossenesse, the effect thereof should bee so aboue reason contrary. The
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19072:43"/>
selfe same property writeth Gaudencius Merula of a Lake which is in India, called <hi>Silias,</hi> into the which, casting the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <note place="margin">The Lake Silias.</note> thing that may be, it sinketh presently to the bottom. The which according to the Philosophers opinion, proceedeth of the great purity and thinnesse, which is very neere to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into ayre. There are also in a vally of Iury (as wryteth Iosephus in his booke of the captiuity of the Iewes, alleaged <note place="margin">Sundry Springs of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in a valley of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, neer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherunte.</note> by Nicholaꝰ Leonicꝰ, neer a place called Macherunte, a great number of Springs, of the which some are sweet &amp; of a most pleasing tast, and others vnsauory and bitter in extremity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all wreathed, &amp; as it were mingled one with another. Not far from thence there is a Caue, into the which there issue out of a Rocke two fountaines, so neere together that they seeme to be both but one, and yet are in their effects most different &amp; contrary, for the one is extreame colde, and the other hote, so that between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both they make there a lake of most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler temprature, healing those that bathe themselues therein of diuers infirmities. And seeing it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe to count the wonderful things of this vally, though we digresse a little from the order of our discourse, concerning the property of waters, I will tell you what the same Authour writeth of the property of an herbe which there is found, called <hi>Baharas,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his name of that part of the valley where it groweth. It hath the colour of a bright &amp; shining flame, by the glistering <note place="margin">The most strange na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the herbe Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haras.</note> discouered far of by night, but the neerer you approche vnto it, the more it loseth of his brightnes, which when you come to take it, vanisheth, leauing deluded &amp; deceaued the handes of those that seeke it. Neither can it be found, vnlesse you first cast vpon it the vrine of a woman that hath her flowers, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted and poured downe all at once vpon it, which beeing done, it discouereth it selfe presently to the viewe of those that seeke it, who die at the very instant, vnlesse they haue a peece of the roote of the same herbe gathered before, bounde to theyr arme, hauing which, they remaine secure, &amp; may gather it without any perrill or danger.</p>
               <p>But they haue also another manner of gathering the same, which they hold for the surer, which is thus. He that goeth in search thereof, finding it, pareth the ground close rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:19072:44"/>
away, and bringing with him a dogge, bindeth him with a corde fast to the roote therof, at whose departure the dogge striuing to follow him, pulleth it vp by the roote, falling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently downe dead in the place, by his death giuing securitie to his Maister to take vp the roote without any danger at all, and to carry it away, &amp; to apply it to such vse as pleaseth him. The vertue therof is so great, that it healeth men possessed of deuils: besides, many and diuers other infirmities, for which it is a remedy most excellent. So that some will say, that the <note place="margin">The vertue thereof.</note> vertue of this hearbe was not vnknowne to Salomon, by the excellencie and force whereof, hee expelled euill spirits, and cured infinite diseases, which was an occasion to make his wisedome be held in greater admiration: &amp; that others lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this of him, after his death working therewith many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous and admirable things, exceeding the rules of Nature, but thys is Apocryphus, and not written by any Authour of credite.</p>

               <p>God ordained not this hearbe with such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to be found and gathered, without enduing it also with some especiall and particuler vertue, which, as sayth Hermes, he hath in such sort imparted to herbes, plants, &amp; stones, that if we had the knowledge and vse of them, we should so cure all infirmities and diseases, that wee should seeme to be in a manner immortall.</p>

               <p>Beleeue me, the vertues of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are no lesse then theyrs: for as the herbes sucke and draw theyr propertie and vertue out of the earth, which nourisheth and produceth them, yeelding moisture and sustenaunce to their rootes: so likewise the water draweth to it selfe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the earth &amp; minerals through which it passeth, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of their vertues; which beeing so deepe in earth, are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs hidden &amp; vnknown. But I know not whether the vertue of a Spring which Aristotle writeth to be in Syci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia in the Country of the Palisciens, proceede of thys cause, <note place="margin">A Spring in Sycilia, most admirable.</note> for the misterie which it contayneth is farre greater, and so sayth Nicholaus Leonicus, that it is a thing verie hardly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible: for he affirmeth the propertie thereof to be such, that who so taketh a solemne oath, and the same oath be written in Tables, and cast with certaine solemnities into the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: If the oath contained therein be true, the Tables re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

floating aloft vpon the water, but if it be false, they sink incontinently downe to the bottome: And he which tooke the same, is burned presently in the place, and conuerted into ashes, not without damage many times of those that were present: They called this the holy Fountaine, and appointed the charge and custody thereof to Priests, which suffered no man to sweare, vnlesse that hee first put in sureties, that hee would content him selfe to passe by this triall.</p>

But of this Fountaine there is now no notice at all, for I haue beene long resident in that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, during which time, I neuer heard any such matter. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the like vnto these are written of by diuers Authors, the which for their vncertainty, I wil not weary my self in rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: only I wil tell you of a Lake, which is in the Spanish I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land called S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> in a mountaine very high &amp; vninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Spaniards hauing conquered that Country, found round about this mountaine no habitation of people, through <note place="margin">A Lake on the top of a mountaine in the Ile of S. Domingo</note> the cause of a hideous noise, which was therein continually heard, amazing &amp; making deafe the hearers therof, the hiden cause &amp; secret mistery wherof, no man being able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, three Spaniards resolutly deliberated to goe vp into the height thereof, &amp; to discouer if it were possible the occasion whence this continuall roaring proceeded: so that prouiding them selues of all things necessary, for the difficulty &amp; ragged sharpnes of the way, being ful of craggy rocks &amp; shruby trees &amp; bushes, stopping their eares fast &amp; close with pelets of wax, &amp; taking some few victuals with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, put themselues onward in their enterprize, not without exceeding wearines &amp; trauel, insomuch that the one fainting by the way, was forced to bide behind. The other two with chereful labor &amp; vertuous alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming all difficulties, cam at last with much ado vnto the top of the mountain, wher they found a great Plain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trees, &amp; in the midst a lake, the water of which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure &amp; black as inke, boiling &amp; bubling vp, as though all the fire in the world had been flaming vnder it, making a noise so terible &amp; thundring, that though they had stopped their eares with all possible care &amp; diligence: yet the intollerable roring noise thereof, wrought such a humming and giddines in their heads, that they were constrained with all possible hast to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, without bringing any certaine relation then this which you haue heard.</p>

               <p>It were neede of great Philosophy to know the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of this, that vvater should in such sort harden, that it should neuer afterwards dissolue: the contrary reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we see in great heapes of Ice, which how hard so cuer they be, yet change of weather, maketh them to dissolue and melt.</p>

               <p>This is because the heat vndoeth that which is done by the cold, as in snow, haile, &amp; ice; which seeing it worketh not the like effect in these stones, we may thereby gather that, not the cold but som other secret to vs hidden &amp; vnknown, is the cause of this obduration &amp; hardnes. I haue heard with great credite affirmed, that there is also neere the towne called <hi>Uilla Nueua del obyspo,</hi> a Fountaine, in which during sixe moneths of the yeare, from such time as the sunne entreth into the signe of Lybra, which beginneth about the midst of September,

called the Equinoctiall of the Autumne, till the middest of March, there is no one drop of water, and all the other halfe yeare, there runneth a most cleere &amp; abundant streame: and thys is euery yere ordinary.

               <p>If this be true, then am I deceaued, for I neuer thought that stones could be bred, but that they were as the bones of the earth, alwayes of one bignes, neyther decreasing nor increasing; for otherwise, if stones should grow, in time they would come to be of such quantitie and greatnes, that they would be in diuer parts very combersome.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19072:47"/>
our discourse of Fountaines, I am perswaded that there are many of rare and great vertues, vtterly to vs vnknowne, and sometimes it hapneth, that the vertue of the water, worketh through the ayde of some other thing, ioyntly together, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters verie admirable, as that which Alexander writeth in his booke <hi>De diebus genialibus,</hi> that in those partes of England vvhich bende toward the West, when any shyps are broken, <note place="margin">These Fouls are in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish called Barnakles.</note> and the ribbes or planches of them remaine a while in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that with the continuall moystnes, they engender &amp; bring forth certaine Puscles like Mushromps, which within fevve dayes seeme to be aliue and to haue motion: and by little and little grow &amp; gather feathers. That part wherewith they are fast to the rotten tymber is like vnto a water-foules bill, which comming lose of it selfe, thys miraculous foule beginneth to heaue it selfe vp, and by little and little in short space of time to flie and mount into the ayre. Pope Pius, whose name was Aeneas Siluius, rehearseth this in another sort, saying, that in <note place="margin">The Author is heerin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, for these are 2. seuerall sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; both very true.</note> Scotland, vpon the bankes of a Riuer, there growe certaine Trees, whose leaues falling into the water and putrifying, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender in them a certaine vvorme, which by little and little becommeth great and feathered, and at last lifteth vp the wings and flieth into the ayre. Cassaneus in his Catalogue of the glory of the world, in the twelfth part repeateth thys o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. In times past, sayth he, there grew in England vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Riuers side a strange and wonderfull tree, that brought forth a fruite like vnto Ducks, the which being ripe and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of, those which fell on the Land side, rotted and perished, but those vvhich fell into the vvater receaued presently lyfe, recouering feathers and wings, and in short space became a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to flie. Others write that there were many of these Trees, and so by consequence many such foules in great number. But whether there be any such nowe or no, I know not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these Authors. I remember that I read in an Epitaphe which is written in the Map of the world, printed by a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian called <hi>Andreas Valuasor,</hi> that one <hi>Andrew Rosse,</hi> cittizen of the same towne, had at that present two of these foules, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bignes of two little Ducks, the which were brought him out of Spayne, but I think there was an error in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19072:47"/>

Therefore, whatsoeuer is said and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by graue Authors, we ought to beleeue that it may be, for though some haue a fault in ouerreaching, yet others will not register any thing but that which is true. Turning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to our purpose of waters, let vs not in silence passe ouer the greatnes of such Riuers as haue beene in our times disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: for till now <hi>Nylus, Ganges, Danubius,</hi> and <hi>Boristhenes</hi> haue bin accounted great, but at this present, the greatest that is in all Asia, Affricke, or Europe, is but a little streame in comparison of those, vvhich by Nauigation are newly found out in the West Indies, scarcely to be beleeued, vvere they not sufficiently authorized by the infinite number of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">Certaine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible greatnesse, found out in the West Indyes.</note> vvitnesses: As for example, the riuer of Orellana, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by the name of him that first discouered it, is so great, that it beareth fifty leagues of breadth at the mouth where it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth into the Sea, and through the extreame furie vvith vvhich it forciblie passeth, it pierceth in such sort through the vvaues of the salt vvater, that the Saylers call that Coast the

Sweete vvater Sea. The Riuer <hi>Dela plata,</hi> nowe inhabited by our Spanyards, there as the Sea receaueth it, containeth xxv. leagues in breadth, and the Riuers of Maranion fyfteene. There are also many others, of infinite largenesse, whereby we may coniecture, that there is a greater quantity of Lande the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is already discouered, for it is not possible that such mighty Riuers shoulde rise out of any Spring, but that many other Riuers shoulde fall into them, and that out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Regions, but let vs leaue this till we meete another time, when we shal haue more leysure.</p>

               <p>Well then, seeing it so pleaseth you, I will recite the opinions of such as vnderstand it better than I doe, and you may thereof iudge, that which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth most agreeing to our Catholique faith and to reason, &amp; I will with the greatest breuity I may, make you pertaker of that which I remember.</p>
               <p>Many Diuines, especially those which haue written vpon Genesis, haue discoursed vpon this matter of earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: amongst whose opinions, though there be some diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, yet they shoote all at one marke, though in the meane time it be some confusion to those which curiously procure to sift out the truth thereof: But seeing their opinions are all Christianlike and of good zeale, I account it no error in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing eyther of them. But leauing a while the Christians and Diuines, let vs first see what was the old Philosophers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, though it were at blindfold, concerning Paradise: and the place on earth, where they thought it to be. If wee take this name of Paradice generally, it signifieth a place of delight,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:49"/>
and so sayeth Saint Hierome in his Translation, that Heden <note place="margin">What the word of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</note> in the Hebrew Text signifieth delight, according to the 70. Interpreters, which hauing said that God planted Paradice in the place of Heden, turne presently to declare the same, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it a Garden of delight: &amp; of these delightful places there are many in the worlde for their exceeding beauty and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnes called by this name, and so Casaneus alleadging Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus Bergamensis, the one very late, the other not very aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, sayeth, that there is one in the Oryent towards the side <note place="margin">The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice.</note> of Zephyrus, (and this hee thinketh to be the same of which we now speake,) another in the Aequinoctiall betweene the winds Eurus &amp; Euronotus; the third betweene the tropick of Cancer, and the circle of the South pole; a fourth in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent on the other side of the Aequinoctiall, where the Sunne scorcheth with so vehement heate: a fifth at the Southerne pole, of which he sayth, that Solinus also maketh mention, and as I take it, it is in his discourse of those that dwell on the other side of the Hyperbores. The sixth he placeth in the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and withall he alleadgeth, that the Senate of Rome had made a decree, that none should be chosen high Pontif, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he were in the Garden of delights in the prouince of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But me reemeth that Casaneus &amp; Philippus reckoning vp such places as these are, &amp; calling them paradices, and taking the word so largely, might haue found a great many more. For Salomon also sayeth: he maketh Gardens and paradices, and planteth in them fruitfull trees. And Procopius writeth of a paradice in a certaine part of Affrica, whose wordes are these: There was, saith he, builded a royall pallace, by a King of the Vandales, in the most delightfull paradice of all those that euer I haue seene, for there were many delicious Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, of which it was bedewed and watered: and the vvoods round about were continually most fragrant, greene, &amp; flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing. These paradices are vnderstood, as I haue said, to be all the purest &amp; pleasantest places of the earth, refreshed with sweet gales &amp; temperate wholesome ayres, though perchance also such as haue written of them, haue added somwhat to the truth: and as for those of which Phillip of Bergamo speaketh, they are described in places so far distant from vs, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19072:49"/>
vnpossible to know the truth. The Gentiles likewise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Where the Gentiles supposed the Elisian fields to be.</note> to their fals, sects, &amp; opinions, fained the Elisian fields to be paradice; whether they imagined the soules of those that liued well; to be transported after their death. Which some dreamed to be in the prouince of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> in this our Spain, because it is a plat most pleasant &amp; delectable.

But the commonest opinion was, that the Elisian fields were those, which we now call the fortunate Ilands, the enhabitants of which are saide to liue so long, that they are held to be as it were immortall. <hi>Plato</hi> in his fourth book called <hi>Phedon,</hi> writeth, that there is a place on the <note place="margin">Plato.</note> earth so high aboue the clouds, that they cannot raine vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same; neither though it be neere the region of the fire, feeleth it any immoderate heate: but that there is alwaies a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of aire most pure &amp; perfect, in such sort, that many are of opinion, that al things grow there, in greater fertility &amp; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, then in any other part of the earth: and that the men are of purer complexion &amp; longer life then we, whose bodies are such, that many think them to be formed the greater part of fire &amp; aire: as for water and earth they participate thereof very little, neither feed they of such fruits &amp; victuals as we doe heere, but differ far from vs in customs, &amp; alwaies enioy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freshnes of youth. These words rehearseth <hi>Caelius Rodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus,</hi> which were saith he, of a man that went serching out the certaine knowledge of our faith, &amp; who was not far of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Christian, if there had been any man to haue instructed him, wherin he was found to say so of him, I know not, for <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> spake &amp; wrote many other things, wherein he deserued the name of Diuine, &amp; out of which greater argument may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, then out of these words to iudge as he doth of him. That agreeth very well with this of <hi>Plato,</hi> which <hi>Lactantius Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi> writeth in verse, in a little Treatise of the Phaenix, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of that Country, whether after shee hath burned her selfe in Arabia, and turned to reuiue againe of a vvorme

There is (saith he) in the farthest part of the East, a blessed place, where the high gate of the eternall pole is open, it is neyther anoyed with the heate of the Sunne, nor the colde of the Winter, but there whence the Sunne sendeth &amp; discouereth to vs the day, there are neyther high mountaines nor low Valleyes: the fields are all flat in a great and pleasant Plaine, which notwithstanding the euen leuell thereof, is ten fadoms higher then the highest mountaine of ours. There is a flourishing vvood adorned with many beautifull trees, whose braunches and leaues enioy <note place="margin">Lactantius Firmianus discourse of Paradice.</note> perpetuall greenes, and at such time as through the ill guiding of the chariot and horses of the Sunne by Phaeton, the whole world burned, this place was vntouched of the flame, and when Deucalions flood ouerwholmed the whole world, this remained free, for the waters were not able to ouercome the height thereof. There is neyther languishing disease, paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full old age, nor consuming death. No feare, no greefe, no coueting of riches, no battailing, no raging desire of death or vengeance bereaueth their repose. Sorrowfull teares, cruell necessities, and carefull thoughts, haue there no harbour. No frozen dewe toucheth their earth, no misty cloude couereth their fieldes: neyther doe the heauens poure into them anie troubled waters, onely in the midst thereof they haue a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which they call <hi>Uiba,</hi> cleare, pure, &amp; aboundant of sweet vvaters, which once a moneth moystneth the whole vvood. The trees therein are of a meruailous height, &amp; hang alwaies full of fruit: in this delicious Paradice liueth the Phaenix, the onely one bird of that kinde in the world, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Well, be then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentife a while. Venerable Bede handling this matter, sayth: Earthly Paradise is a place most delightfull, beautified with a <note place="margin">Venerable Bedes opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> great abundance of fruitfull trees, &amp; refreshed with a goodly fountaine. The situation thereof is in the oryentall parts, the ground of which is so high, that the water of the flood could not ouer-reach the same: and thys opinion holdeth Strabo <note place="margin">Strabo the Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans opinion.</note> the Theologian, affirming that the height of the earth where Paradise is, reacheth to the circle of the Moone, through which cause it was not damnified by the flood, the waters of which could not rise to the height thereof. Those which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this opinion, might better conforme themselues with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen, who iudgeth, that all this which is written of Paradise, <note place="margin">Origens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note> must bee taken allegorically, and that it is not situate on the earth, but in the third heauen, whether S. Paule was lyfted in Spirit; but leauing him, because hee is alone in his opinion, without hauing any that followeth him, let vs returne to our
<pb facs="tcp:19072:51"/>
alleaged Authors, against who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Thomas and Scotus argue, saying, that Paradise can by no meanes reach vnto the circle <note place="margin">These opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by S. Thomas &amp; Scotus.</note> of the Moone, because the Region of the fire beeing in the midst, the earth can by no meanes passe thorough the same without being burnt &amp; destroyed. Besides this, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reasons sufficient to refute this opinion, for so shold those Riuers which come from Paradise, passe through the region of the fire, which, the contrariety of the two Elements being considered, is absurd: and besides, if this ground vvere so high, it could not chuse but be seene a farre of from manie parts of the world aswell by sea as by land: and by this means also, there should be a place in the worlde, by the vvhich it seemes a man might goe vp into heauen, so that this opinion is grounded vpon small reason, and easie to be confuted.</p>
               <p>Many other Authors there are, which affirme Paradise to be in so high a part of the earth, that the water of the Deluge could not reach vnto the top thereof to anoy it: and to the obiection which may be made against them out of Moises, which sayth, that the waters thereof couered and ouerflowed; the height of xv. cubits, all Mountaines vnder the vniuersall heauen: they aunswer, that these Mountaines are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood such as are vnder the region of the Ayre, where the clowdes are thickned and ingendered, for Heauen is meant many times in the holy Scripture by this region, as the royall <note place="margin">Heauen ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ayre, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of Scripture.</note> Psalmist saith: The foules of heauen &amp; the fishes of the Sea. Where by this word heauen, is vnderstoode the region of the ayre, thorough which the birds flie; so that according to their opinion, the mount or place where Paradise is, exceedeth, &amp; is aboue this region of the ayre, where there is neither bluste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of winds, nor gathering of cloudes, so that it could not be endomaged by the waters of the flood. This is the selfe same of which we discoursed yesterday, as touching the mountains Olympus, Athos &amp; Atlas, &amp; that of Luna (which in height, according to the opinion of many, exceedeth all the rest on the earth) and many other like mountaines in the world, ouer whose tops there is neither raine, wind, nor clowdes, the ashes lying from one yere to another vnmooued, because that the height of their tops exceedeth the midle region of the ayre, &amp;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19072:51"/>
pierceth thither where it is still &amp; pure without any mouing. But S. Thomas also argueth this not to be tru, saying that it is no conuenient place for Paradise to stand in the midst of the region of the ayre, neither could it, beeing there, haue such qualities &amp; conditions as are necessary, because the winds and waters would distemper it.</p>

               <p>You say tru, but things are not to be taken in such extremety as you take them, for though it be said the superior part, yet therby is not meant the vtmost thereof, neither is that which we call the superior part with out a difference and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between the beginning &amp; the end, the which thogh it be in the midle temperat, yet the end being neer to the fire, &amp; participating with the heat of the Sun, wanteth that tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; &amp; that which S. Thomas saith, is to be vnderstood, that if Paradise be in the region where the clowds be engendred, it cannot be in a place temperate, neither if it reach vnto the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost of the superior part of the pure aire, by reason of the great heat &amp; drines of the fiery element. But these are matters spoken at randon, without euer beeing seen or verified: and therfore euery one thinketh &amp; iudgeth that which in his own fancie he imagineth to agree with reason. For no man is able to doe that which Lucian in his Dialogues writ of Icarus, the which with artificiall wings flewe vp into the ayre. Leauing therfore fables, I say that the common opinion of all men is, that Paradise is seated in the oryent, &amp; in a country or region abounding in delights, &amp; so writeth Suidas a greeke Author, whose words are these. Paradise, saith he, is in the East, the seat therof is higher then all the other earth, it enioyeth a tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Suidas a greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> pure in al perfection, an ayre most delicate &amp; cleere, the trees therof flourish in perpetuall greenenesse, laden vvith
<pb facs="tcp:19072:52"/>
flowers and fruites, a place full of all solace and sweetnes, and of such beauty and goodlines, that it passeth all humaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Conciliador and Scotus are of the same opinion, and these are the words of S. Thomas him selfe. Wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee beleeue Paradice to be, it must be so, that it be in a place very temperate, be it vnder the Aequinoctial or in what other part so euer. To this purpose Caelius Rodiginus appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that of Arryanus, a Greeke Historiographer, to whom <note place="margin">Arrianus a Greeke Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</note> they attribute so much credit, that they call him the very sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of verities, who sayeth, that Hanno a famous and renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Cartagenian Captaine, parting with an Army from the pillers of Hercules, where the Citty of Calyz is, forward into the Ocean, leauing Lybia &amp; Affrica on the left hand, sayling towards the West, and afterwards turning his course towards the South, suffered by the way many and great impediments &amp; discommodities, for besides the great feruentnes of the hot <note place="margin">The strange aduenture happening to Hanno a Carthageni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Captaine.</note> starres, as if it had beene in the part of a burnt vvorld, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to want water, or if they found any, it was such as they could not drinke; they heard terrible thunders without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, their eyes were blinded with continuall flashes of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and it seemed that there fell from heauen great flakes of flaming fire, so that they were forced to returne. Some think that this Nauie went very neere the Aequinoctial, but Caelius aleadgeth it, speaking of Paradice, saying, that all these were tokens of Paradice, beeing neere there abouts, according to that of Genesis, where he sayeth, that God placed before the gate thereof a Cherubin with a sword of fire, which turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout on all sides, to the end that he should suffer no man to enter into that place: But I rather beleeue, that Hanno with this Nauy came to be vnder the <hi>Torrida Zona,</hi> at such time as the heate thereof caused these effects, making him returne so astonished, whereas if he had stayed, perchaunce hee should haue found both time and place to passe forward, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the first to Colona, who going to discouer the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, found him selfe vnder the same Zone, where the vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waxing calme, his ships were detained two or three daies, without any hope euer to come foorth, or to saue their liues: but afterwards, a gentle gale arising, they passed forth without
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19072:52"/>
any danger, and now since, diuers passe thereby daily in their Nauigations: but all these are imaginations of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue men, seeking to sift out the truth.</p>
               <p>There are some also that affirme Paradise to be in that part where God when he framed the world, began the first moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the heauens, which they call the right hande of the worlde, and the best part thereof.

Ezechiel, where he reckoneth vp many people, &amp; diuers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that handled &amp; trafficked with the citty of Tyre, saying, that there came also thither people out of the Countries of Charam, Chene, &amp; Heden: yet <hi>Caeton</hi> thinketh that Heden in this authority, is not the place where terestrial Paradise was, but the name only of a particuler Citty: But following the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Eugubinus,</hi> we may gather that the Country where earthly Paradise was planted, was inhabited, &amp; that neere vnto it were peoples &amp; Nations: &amp; therfore God placed the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin there, with the turning fiery sword, to the end he should not let enter there-into any person liuing: for if Paradise had been the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnknown as now it is to al men, what need had there beene of an Angell to gard it, when no man knew where it stoode, nor which way to come vnto it: Besides it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that put the case that Paradise stood towards any part of the East, yet could not the same be far off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Citties of Ierusalem &amp; Tyre, because he nameth iointly together Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram &amp; Heden, being a thing most manifest, that Charam is a Prouince in Chaldae or Mesopotamia, which appeareth by the words of Genesis, saying: God took the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Vra Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of the Chaldaeans, that they might go to Canaan, &amp; they cam euen to Charam: these are euident reasons to proue that Paradise stood in that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, &amp; that if as yet it be, it standeth there: it maketh the better with this opinion, because the two Riuers <hi>Tygris &amp; Euphrates,</hi> bath and water that Prouince.

               <p>In good sooth you haue great reason, but now seeing you haue sayde as much as may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the situation of Paradice, goe forward with that of the Riuers which come from thence, a matter, vnlesse I be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of no lesse difficulty, then the before rehearsed.</p>

               <p>I assure you it is such, that I should haue been glad if you had ouerslipped it, doubting least I shall be vnable to satisfie your expectation: for as Eugubinus sayeth, there is so great and so intricate a difficulty heerein, that he is hardly able to vnwinde him selfe there out, whom of force in this matter I must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for as for the other Authors which write heereof, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that they stay at the halfe carere, without reaching to the end of the course. To begin therefore, it is sayd in Genesis, that there issued a Riuer out of Paradice, deuiding it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">The foure Riuers that issue out of Paradice.</note> foure parts, the which were <hi>Gion, Fison, Tygris,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates;</hi> But seeing the difficulty of the seate and place of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice cannot clearely be determined, much lesse can this be of the foure Riuers which issue thence, especially knowing at this present that their Springs and risings are in diuers diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of the world: yet for all this sifting and bolting out the truth, we will approach as neere it as we may. This Riuer which deuided it selfe into foure, first issued out of the place of delights, which was according to Eugubinus the Prouince of Heden, and from thence entered to inundate Paradice, whence comming forth it made this deuision. It is manifest, that the first part therof called <hi>Gion,</hi> is the same which we now call Ganges, for this is it which watreth the land of Heuylath: The second Riuer <hi>Fyson,</hi> is without all doubt that which wee now call Nilus, seeing there is no other which watereth and compasseth about the Land of Aethiopia, as the text it selfe sayeth: As for <hi>Tygris &amp; Euphrates</hi> they retaine yet their selfe same first names, and runne along the Country of the Assiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and of these two last it may be sayde, that they rise, or at the least that the first Land which they water, is the same,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19072:54"/>
which according to that before alleaged, may be called the prouince of Heden.</p>

               <p>These two Riuers are by all Cosmographers described to haue their risings in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Taurus in Armenia, and it is true that they vvater the prouince of the Assirians, but theyr rysing and beginning is farre from thence, as saith Strabo by these words. Euphrates and Tygris rise in the Mountaine Taurus, and compassing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">The rysing of the riuers Tygris and Euphrates.</note> Mesapotamia, ioyne themselues together by Babylon, and from thence goe to enter into the Persian Sea: the spring of Euphrates is on the North side of Taurus, and that of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris on the other part of the same Mountaine tovvardes the South: the sources of these two Riuers are distant the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other 2500. stadies. This is also affirmed by other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and Beda sayth: It is a thing most notorious, that those riuers which are said to come out of Paradise, spring and ryse out of the earth; Gion which is Ganges, out of the hill Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casus, which is a part of the mountaine Taurus: Fison, which is Nilus, not farre from the mountaine Atlas in Affrica, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">The sources of Ganges and Nylus</note> the West, and Tygris and Euphrates out of a part of Armenia: which two &amp; Nylus, as the Historiographers say, hide themselues in many places vnder the earth. Pomponiꝰ, Solinus, Ptolomie, and the rest are of Bedas opinion as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the rising of these Riuers: and the words of Procopius are these; Out of this Mountaine, saith hee, arise two Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, the which immediatly make two riuers, of that on the right hand commeth Euphrates, and of that on the left hand Tygris.</p>

               <p>Leauing these two Riuers, let vs speake of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, seeing it is also notorious, that Ganges taketh his beginning in the Mountaine Caucasus, though some vvill <note place="margin">The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</note> say in the Mountaine Emodos, whose height and sharpnesse is such, that few haue been able to reach vnto the place where the source of the Riuer is, whence some took occasion to say,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:55"/>
that Paradise was placed in the midst of those Rockes, and rough vnaccessible crags, and so shall you find it described in the most part of Mappes, but is certaine that this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is false, and leauing it for such, I say that the streame of this Riuer, discendeth from betweene the East &amp; the North, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth running thorough many Countryes of the East-Indies, euen till it enter into the Ocean Sea, and contrarilie, the Riuer Nilus ryseth as I haue sayde in Affrica, neere the Mountaine Atlas, and as some thinke, towards the East, though by the Nauigation of the Portugals which discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, it seemeth that the rysing thereof shoulde bee in the Mountaine called De Luna, bending towards the South. But how soeuer it be, his streame is contrary in opposit to the <note place="margin">The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Moone.</note> riuer Ganges, and entred by a different and contrary way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Redde Sea, so that I see not how it may stand with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that these two Riuers shoulde conforme themselues in theyr rysing, or that they shoulde euer come both out of one part.</p>

               <p>Haue patience awhile, and perchaunce, though now it seeme to you vnpossible, you will straight be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie opinion: First therefore you must suppose, that there is eyther now a Paradise in the worlde, or else that the same is through the waters of the Generall floode destroyed. The will of him which planted and made it, is not that we should haue thereof any notice, not onely concealing from vs the place where it stoode and standeth, but taking also from vs all signes and tokens, whereby we might come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderstanding thereof: So that though Paradise nowe remaine in such sort as when it vvas first made &amp; plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the hands of GOD: yet hath hee so diuerted from thence the current of those Riuers, guiding them by vvayes different and contrary one to another, that by them it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to attain to the knowledge therof: For it Paradise be in the East, and vnder the Aequinoctiall, according to the common opinion, and that the foure Riuers ought to come from those parts, and to deriue theyr streames from thence, we now see, that Nilus and Ganges are towards the West, or rather South-west, and Tygris and Euphrates, though they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19072:55"/>
come from the East-wardes, yet is it by very contrary wayes, the reason is, because those Riuers at theyr comming foorth of Paradise, or at least before they come to be knowne of vs, <note place="margin">The Riuers that come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paradise, hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the hollowes of the earth.</note> doe hide themselues in the depths and veynes of the earth, breaking out againe in other parts with new Springs and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, the one beeing distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other so many thousand leagues: and that this may be so, vvee see daily amongst our selues the experience thereof, as for example, the Riuer of Alpheus in the prouince of Achaia, which entring into a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauitie vnder the earth, turneth to come out againe in the <note place="margin">The Riuer Alpheus.</note> Spring of Arethusa neere Caragosa in Sicilia, vvhich by this experience is apparantly knowne, for all such thinges as are throwne into the same in Achaia, beeing such as may swim and flote aboue water, come foorth at the mouth of Arethu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, passing not onely vnder the earth, but also vnder the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Sea, as Plinie affirmeth, saying: There are many <note place="margin">Sundry Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnder the earth, come to rise out in newe springs.</note> Riuers that hyding themselues vnder the earth, come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and runne anewe in other partes: as the Riuer Licus in Asia, Erasine in the region of Algorica, and Tygris in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sapotamia. The like also doe the Riuers of Sil and Gaudiana in our Spaine, although the space of grounde vnder which they runne hidden be not so great, yet suffise they for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that which wee say. And in thys manner doe the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers which come from Paradise, hide and put themselues in the concauities and hollowe veines of the earth, and turne to breake out anew in other parts, where of force they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and change the course and currant of theyr streames.</p>
               <p>S. Augustine entreating of thys matter, affirmeth the riuers of terrestriall Paradise to hide themselues vnder the earth. Encisus in his Cosmography, discoursing of Landes on the Coast of the Oryent, reaching to the Golfe called the great Sea, which by the same coast goeth towards the North, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to speak of the land called Anagora, sayth, From thys <note place="margin">The Gulfe called Mare magnum.</note> place forwards, there is knowledge of no more Lands, for no man hath sayled any farder, and by Land it is vnaccessible, for the Lande is full of Lakes, and high rockie mountaines of <note place="margin">Encisus, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</note> meruailous greatnes, where they say is the seate of earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, and that there is the Fountaine, where the foure Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb facs="tcp:19072:56"/>
make a crosse, and afterwards sinck into the earth, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along by the hollow veynes vvhereof, they come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the one at the Mountaine Emodos which is Ganges, and the other in Ethiopia, at the mountaine De Luna, which is Nylus, and the other two at the rough mountaines of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, which are Tygris and Euphrates. All this is so easie for him which made the whole World of nothing, &amp; of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing created all thinges in the same, that we ought not so to meruaile at this, but as a thing vvhich may be. Leauing thys opinion, and returning to that of Eugubinus, that Paradise should be planted in the prouince of Heden, &amp; that through the waters of the Generall flood, it should be destroyed and ouerthrowne: the selfe same consideration may serue for this of the Riuers not without proofes very euident and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reason, for if it were destroyed with the Flood, euen as it pleased God to permit the vndooing thereof, so would hee also ordayne, that all signes and markes of the same shoulde cease, to the end, that the peoples dwelling in the prouinces and borders thereabout, shoulde haue no knowledge at all thereof, &amp; that it should be no longer necessary for the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin to remaine in garde thereof with a fierie Sworde, as till that time hee had done. But before wee come to handle the principall causes, you shall vnderstande, that there are some who holde opinion, that all these foure Riuers, rise neere the Land of Heden, and come to ioyne in the same. Leauing therefore a part Tygris and Euphrates, because that of them seemeth in a manner verified; as for Ganges, the course ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not so contrarie, but that it may well meete where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riuers doe: and that any inconuenience eyther of lownes or highnes of the earth, might bee sufficient to diuert or to cause the same to runne where it now doth: But this is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that neyther concludeth, nor carrieth any reason withall.</p>
               <p>As for the Riuer Nilus, they goe another way to worke, <note place="margin">Some hold opinion that Nilus is not the same w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in the holy Scripture called Fison.</note> saying, that it is not the same, which in the holy Scripture is called Fison, for there are two Ethiopias, say they, the one in Affrica, which is watred with Nilus, the other in the West In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in Asia, beginning from the coast of Arabia, &amp; folowing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19072:56"/>
along the coast of the Ocean sea towards the East, the which may be vnderstood by the holy Scriptures, who call those of the Lande of Madian neere to Palestina, Ethiopians: &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phora also that was wife to Moises, beeing natiue of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was called Ethiopesse. And with this agreeth a Glosse written in the margen of Caetano his discourse vppon thys matter, by Anthonio de Fonseca, a Frier of Portugall, and a man very learned: so that Fison may well be some Riuer of these which watereth this Country, first discending by the Lande of Heden, comming from the same to enter into the Ocean, as Tygris and Euphrates, and many other deepe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe; in the same maner may it be coniectured that Gion should bee some one of these riuers, the one and the other through antiquity hauing lost theyr names, and that it is not knowne, because it cannot perfectly be prooued whether of these two Ethiopias is meant by the holy Scripture. <hi>Auene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> saith, it is a thing notorious, that the Riuer Gion was not far from the Land of Israell, according to that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the third booke of Kings. Thou shalt carry it into Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although there be other Authors that vnderstande not Gion to be a Riuer, but to be the Lake Siloe, or else a Spring so called. If that Gion were Ganges, it is manifest that it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not so neere vnto Israel, as it is heere said. S. Isidore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of this matter, sayeth, that the Riuer called Araxes, commeth out of Paradise, which opinion is also maintained by Albertus Magnus. Procopius writeth of another Riuer, called Narsinus, whose streame issueth from thence neere to the Riuer Euphrates: some thinke that these are Gion and Fison, though at this time, their waters runne not through the same Lands. These are the opinions of Ecclesiasticall Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, labouring to discusse and sift out the truth of this secret: But leauing them all, I will tell you my opinion partly, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Eugubinus and his followers; that when it pleased God to drowne the whole worlde, in time of the Patriarch Noe, with a vniuersall flood, mounting according to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Text, fifteene cubits in height aboue all the mountaines of the earth: the same must of necessity make and vnmake, change, alter, and ouerturne many things, raysing valleyes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
<pb facs="tcp:19072:57"/>
mountaines, altering the Deserts, discouering many <note place="margin">The Authors conclusion concerning the foure Riuers.</note> parts of the earth vnseene before, and couering &amp; drowning many Citties and Regions, which from thence forth remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder the water ouerwhelmed in the Sea, or couered with Ponds and Lakes, as we know that which without the flood, happened to Sodome and Gomorrha, with the rest, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were burnt did sinke with them: And we see often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the swelling and ouerflowing of great Riuers, whole Countries drowned and made like vnto a Sea, yea, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mighty Riuers to lose their wonted passage, and turne and change their course another way, farre different from the first: If I say the violent impetuosity of one onely riuer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to worke these effects? What shall we then thinke was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe the incomparable fury, and terrible swinging rage of the generall and vniuersall flood? In the which as the same Text sayth, all the Fountaines and Springs of the earth were broken vp by their bottomes, and all the Conduits of heauen were opened, that there might want no water eyther aboue or beneath. If then the Springs so brake vp, it could not be, but that some of them were changed, and passed into other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, different from those in which they were before: theyr streames scouring along through contrary wayes and veines of the earth. In like manner might it happen to those which entered into terestriall Paradise, &amp; issued forth to water those Lands named in the holy Text, which eyther through the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe of huge mountaines and rocky hills, or filling vp of lowe valleyes, might be constrained to turne their streames farre differently to their former course, or else by the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and will of GOD, (which would haue vs to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this secrete) they changed their Springs and issues by hiding and shutting them selues in the bowels of the earth, and running through the same many thousand miles: and at last came to rush forth in other parts, farre distant from those where they were before; neyther passed they onely vnder a great quantity of Lands enhabited and vninhabited: but the very Sea also (whom they hold for mother &amp; Spring whence they proceede) hideth them vnder her, to the ende that they might returne to issue foorth, where they were not knowne,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19072:57"/>
or if through some cause they were, it should be vnto our greater admiration and meruaile, as now it is.</p>
               <p>Neyther wonder you at all, if the generall flood wrought <note place="margin">The opinion of som who thought the world to be plaine and leuel before the time of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall flood.</note> so great a mutation in the world: for there haue not wanted graue men, who affirme, that the whole world before the time of the flood was plaine and leuell, without any hill or valley at all, and that by the waters thereof were made the diuersities of high and lowe places, and the seperation of Ilands from firme Land. And if these reasons suffice not, let euery man thinke heerein what shall best agree with his owne fancy, for in a mistery so doubtfull and secrete we may as well misse as hit: and so S. Augustine thinking this to be a secret which God would not haue knowne, but reserues it to himselfe, saith, that no man may certainly attaine to know where the place of terestriall Paradise is, vnlesse it be by reuelation diuine, which selfe same hee might haue saide of the foure riuers that issue there out. But seeing this is a matter, which the more wee penetrate into, the greater difficulties we shall finde: it were better that wee lefte the same to be discussed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, of men whose learning and capacity is more profound then ours, alwayes submitting our selues to their iudgement and censure.</p>

But leauing this for another time, I say, that the blindnes of the Gentiles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, not in that they followed the simplicity of the Lawes of Nature, the which if in those dayes they had vsed well, they might rightly haue called themselues, wise: But that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to frame and forge new Sects and Religions: Whereas I can not perswade my self, but that they knew that there was one only God, onely puissant and almighty, who of nothing created the whole word, and all things therein contained, but such was theyr malice, that they would needes put vp &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt into the heauens other men, deifying and making them Gods, by their owne authoritie. Of the beginning and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Idolatry, though there be many and diuers opinions, <note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Idols.</note> yet for breuities sake I will omit them, onely the commonest is, that Ninus King of the Assirians, after the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King Belus, made and erected an Idol of his likenes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayning the same to be a suretie and defence to all those that had theyr refuge thereunto, howe capitall and haynous soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were the offences by them committed: so that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders finding there a securitie inuiolable against those by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were persecuted, began with all reuerence to worshippe that Idoll, and to doe sacrifice vnto the same, as though it had been God. From that time forward, the ignorant blindnesse of the common people began to adore theyr Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and to call them Gods, imagining that as they had been mighty on the earth while they liued, so shoulde they be in heauen after theyr death. Against the grossenes of this error, furdered by the deuill, which put himselfe into the Idols they made: and to deceaue them the more, spake and gaue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres, many haue written, chiefely Lactantius Firmianus, in his Booke of Diuine Institutions, highly and cleerly making them vnderstand, the error and deceite wherein they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused in adoring creatures, &amp; leauing to adore the Creator. Neyther doe you thinke but that the wiser sort had in dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
<pb facs="tcp:19072:59"/>
theyr ignorant errors, laughing at the foolish multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and though in publique they did like the rest, because they would not lose theyr worldly estimation, yet in theyr se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete breast they were of a farre different opinion, which they shewed as cleerly as they might, namely Diuine Plato, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, Porphirius, Socrates and Cicero, who in his Treatise of the Nature of the Gods, gaue to vnderstand, howe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently <note place="margin">The olde philosophers in theyr se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conceit, detested the adoration of the feyned Gods.</note> hee iudged of those false Gods, if it had beene lawfull freely to haue vttered that which in his breast hee conceaued. To be short, there were fevve Philosophers, eyther Latines or Greekes, which vnderstood not this common blindnesse, hauing the same in abhomination and horror. If you doubt heereof, aske Hermes Trismegistus, who confesseth that there is no more but one true and onely God. Looke in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians workes, and you shall finde them full of scoffs &amp; iestes in derision of his Gods: whom as there was then no man to lighten and instruct them in the way of truth, they went gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and feeling at blindfold, as all the Gentiles doe vvhich are now at this day in the world. For beeing now generallie come to know and confesse the truth, that there is one onely GOD which created the vvorld, and is the beginning of all things, they ioyntly adore with him, many other imagined Gods, as the Sun, the Moone, the Starres, &amp; all other things of which they think themselues any way to be benefited. But their insensible madnes endeth not heere, for in many places they worship with diuine honors the deuill himselfe, making him temples and sacrifices, and honouring him with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible veneration: as in many prouinces of India Maior, but cheefely in the West Indies. Beeing asked if there be one onelie GOD, the Creator of all things, they say, yea: and if they knowe the deuill to be of all other creatures the most wicked &amp; abhominable, with open mouth they confesse that he is: if you turne to aske them, wherefore then they adore him, they aunswer, that as God is cheefely Good, so is it his custome and Nature to doe alwayes good and neuer euill, for all euill workes proceede of the deuill, who is the onely Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note place="margin">The cause why the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles adore the deuill.</note> of them: so that they haue no neede, say they, to serue or honour God, because they are assured that he wil neuer cease
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19072:59"/>
to doe them good, and therefore they serue and honour the deuill, because he should not doe them all the euill hee may: as though the deuill without the permission and sufferaunce of God, could doe or vndoe any thing; so that with these, &amp; such like toyes and frenzies, they runne headlong into hel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to take possession of those goodly seates which theyr Deceauers left voyde in heauen.</p>
               <p>The Moores and Turkes, presuming to be a people more aduised and setled in reason, deceaue themselues through the sweetnes and libertie of their Law, which flattereth them in their delights and fleshly lusts, without binding them to anie precepts, so that they run on a head, defending it with Armes <note place="margin">The Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metists will neither hear nor answer any man in disputation against theyr religion.</note> and not with reasons, according to the commaundement of Mahomet, saying, that he that hath an ill cause, puts it to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but the likeliest is, that being assured to be vanquished and confounded, if they come to disputation, they wil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neyther heare nor aunswere any man. As for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as crafty and as wise as he was, yet like a most barbarous and vnlearned man, who neither knew how to read nor write, (besides infinite fansies and toyes that hee saide, aswell in his Alcoran as in the booke called Zuna, compiled of his words and deeds by the wise men of his law) contrarieth himselfe in so many places, that he must be more then blind which seeth not his falsenes, deceit, &amp; beastly ignorance. Concerning thys <note place="margin">Many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Authors that vnrip &amp; lay open the beastly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities of Mahomets Secte.</note> point read S. Isidore, &amp; Anthoniꝰ Archbishop of Florence, and <hi>Vincentius de speculo historiali,</hi> &amp; a booke entituled, <hi>Forta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum fidei,</hi> and another made by <hi>Iohn Andreas,</hi> who was first a Moore &amp; an <hi>Alfaqui</hi> of great estimation, and an other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by <hi>Lope de Obregon,</hi> Curat of Saint <hi>Uincent de Auila,</hi> entituled, <hi>Confutatio Secte Mahumetanae,</hi> the which besides many other Authors, entreat particulerly of this matter: So <note place="margin">The wise &amp; learned men amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what shewe soeuer they make in publique, do in secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test his abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> that I need not vse any longer discourse heerein, seeing his falsenes, abusions, contradictions and follies, beeing neyther Philosopher nor Astronomer are most manifest: onely I will say, that I holde it also for certaine, that the wise and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men amongst them, howsoeuer in publique they obserue this Lawe, yet they are in theyr hearts otherwise perswaded: for me thinks, though there were nothing els yet some points
<pb facs="tcp:19072:60"/>
which they themselues confesse, were sufficient to make them find theyr error, and to leade them into the knowledge of the truth, which are such as Mahomet himselfe confesseth, and are expressed in his Alcoran, in the Zuna, and in another Booke which they call Mahomets Ladder of Heauen, full of monstrous absurdities, where he sayth, that going vp with the Archangell Gabriell, who was his guide to bring him into the <note place="margin">Mahomets confession touching our Sauiour Iesus Christ, our blessed Lady, the Gospell, and our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Beleefe.</note> presence of God, hee sawe stand in the seauenth Firmament two auncient Men of great authority and venerable maiestie, and that asking the Archangell who they were, hee answered that they were two very iust men, and great seruants of God: the one S. Iohn whom they called Baptist, and the other, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, who was not begotten by man, but by the onelie Spirit of God, and that he was borne of Mary, who after she was deliuered, yet still remained a pure Maiden in perfect virginitie. And in another place he sayth, Christ the Messias, the Word of God, and the holy Spirit of the Highest: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in another chapter of the Alcoran: Christ shall turne to discend vpon the earth, and shall be the righteous Iudge of the people. And of our blessed Lady he sayth, that the virgin Marie, mother of Iesu Christ, was conceaued without sinne, and offered vp in the Temple, and dedicated to the seruice of God, and that the lotte fell vpon Zacharias to haue charge &amp; care ouer her: that shee spake with the Angels, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with them: that she was fed with caelestiall food: and that the Angels said vnto her, O Mary, Mary, certainly God hath chosen thee, and adorned thee, and exalted thee aboue all the vvomen of all generations. But aboue all, I vvoulde haue you marke one grosse absurditie of this naughtie man, the vvhich alone were sufficient to make all Moores, Turkes, and Infidels in the world, to discouer &amp; find out his ignorant falsenes, that is, where he affirmeth our blessed Lady, to be that Mary which was sister of Aaron: wheras there is so great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of yeres passed between the one &amp; the other, &amp; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing so manifest, that Christ was in the time of the Emperours Augustus and Tyberius Caefar. The which is an errour so notorious, that it shoulde cause the whole world to know and detest his blindnes, abusion, and ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:19072:60"/>
Besides, the selfe same Mahomet speaking in his Alcoran of the Gospell, termeth it the light, health, way, and law of the people, without the which they cannot be saued: and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places he confesseth the faith of the Christians to be holy and good, though afterwards like a blind, wicked, and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick man, hee turneth to speake against it, condemning the same for naught: and yet all his Alcoran and the bookes of Zuna, of no lesse reputation amongst the Moores then the Alcoran, are full of the praises of Christ, of his holy Mother, and of the Gospell: which was an occasion that not long since, there were some among the Turkes in Constantinople, that dared openly maintaine and affirme, that Christ was a greater Prophet and better beloued of God then Mahomet. But let vs leaue these kind of men, running wilfully vnto their <note place="margin">The slauery and serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which the Iewes haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red since the deniall of our Sauiour the true Messias, is an euident argument to confute their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> owne damnation, and come vnto the Iewes, a people no lesse obstinate and wilfull then the other, who by no meanes will confesse that the prophesies of the Messias, promised in their law was fulfilled in our Sauiour Christ, but remaine obstinate in stubbernes and hardnes of hart: and therefore God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth that they liue continually in slauery and subiection of Christians, Moores, &amp; Pagans, reproached, contemned, and persecuted, in which seruile &amp; miserable state they shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so long, as they doe perseuer in resisting, &amp; not willingly acknowledge the manifest and knowne truth: But this is so cleare, that it were in vaine to spend therein any time.</p>
               <p>Turning therefore to that, whereas you said, that in respect of other sectes, there were but few Christians in the worlde, I would haue you otherwise perswaded: for presupposed that the greater and truer Christianity be in these our parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Yet for all that there are Christians in all parts of the world, or at least ouer the greater part thereof. Besides, those with whom we commonly heere conuerse, there is on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of Alemaigne, Hungry, &amp; Polonia, within our Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, a great number of Christian Regions: as Russia, Prusia, Lituania, Moscouia, part of Tartaria, &amp; many other mighty Prouinces which followe the Greeke Church, though not wholy, for some of them apart &amp; sepuester them selues from the same, holding seueral &amp; different opinions. Besides these,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:61"/>
there are the kingdomes of Scotland, Mirguena, Swethland, and Westgothland, with infinite others towards the North, of which we will one day discourse more particulerly, and at length. But leauing Europe, because it is so knowne and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious; let vs passe into Libia &amp; Affrica, which is the second part of the world, where we shall finde, besides many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries conquered by the Crowne of Portugale, and reduced to the Christian faith, that on the Coast towards the South, in the midst thereof is a Christendome, so great, large, and wide, that it is little lesse then this of our Europe, which is wholy vnder the gouernment and subiection of one King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour.</p>

               <p>I confesse it to be so, and that it is a great chaunce if you find any man affirme the contrary: but if you will heare me a little, you shal vnderstand wherein the error is; so that you your self wil confes that I haue reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that which I will say: First therefore it were good that you did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> entreating of this matter affirmeth, who sayth, that this name of Prester Iohn is corrupted, &amp; that his true name is Belulgian, which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the Kings <note place="margin">The name of Prester Iohn is rightly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulgian.</note> of that Land: the which interpreted, signifieth a rich pearle of great &amp; incomparable excellence: But turning to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if you reade the life of S. Thomas the Apostle, and S. Luke, in the Acts of the Apostles, you shall find that S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas went to preach the faith in India maior, where he died, leauing conuerted to the Christian beliefe infinite multitudes of people, who electing and choosing after his death, a priest that was called Iohn, to gouerne, instruct, &amp; rule them, from that time forward each of their Gouernors being for the most part priests, were called Priest Iohn, bearing the name of the first elected. Of their election there is written a very strange <note place="margin">An egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fiction of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> History: that at the time of the solemnity thereof, a hand of S. Thomas was brought forth, into which putting a dry wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19072:61"/>
Vine, when hee that was elected passed by: the same burgened and sprouted out Vine leaues, greene branches, and sundry clusters of ripe Grapes, out of which they pressed the wine, with which they celebrated the same day seruice. But though you beleeue not this, there is no greater danger: For they had not the body of S. Thomas, neither knew they where it was; and as we find in the Chronicles of Portugale, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The place where Saint Thomas the Apostle died</note> Apostle died in a Country called <hi>Choromandel,</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Bishaga, &amp; in a citty named Melia, somtimes the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of that kingdom, but now ruinated, remaining only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine auncient and noble buildings, by which it appeareth the Citty to haue been somtimes great &amp; populous: amongst the which there is a church held by the enhabitants in great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, saying, that there lay buried the body of S. Thomas, &amp; another of a King by him conuerted to the faith of Christ. The Portugales digging in search thereof, found 3. bodies, the one of the king, another of the Apostle, &amp; a third of one of his Disciples. That of the Apostle they knew by sundry markes, chiefly in that they found lying by him in his graue a Launce, with the which, the fame went in those Countries that he was slaine, vvhich opinion whole India maintayneth: but the Church in his life recordeth the same in another sort, saying, <note place="margin">The Church holdeth that S. Thomas was slayne with a knife by an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Priest.</note> that he was wounded to death with a knife, by the hands of an Idolatrous Priest: though herein be small difference. S. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidore speaking of him, saith, that he died with the stroke of a Launce, &amp; his body, as it is written in his life, was transported into the Country of Syria, into the Citty of Aedisa: and this is that which we chiefly ought to beleeue. But how so euer it be, S. Mathew was he who preached in Aethipia, and S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas in India, after whom succeeded Prester Iohn, whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of rule was great &amp; mighty, which authority in space <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the name and authority of Prester Iohn</note> of time they came to loose, and to be yoked vnder the subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Cham. The manner of this, being so far off, hath not beene well vnderstooode, though some haue ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to write and giue notice thereof, principally, though passing obscurely a certayne Armenian: but certayne it is, that there are as yet sundry tokens of this Christianity. Iohn Mandeuile vvryteth in the description of a iourney, vvhich
<pb facs="tcp:19072:62"/>
he made, that there are many of these Christian Prouinces vnder the dominion &amp; Empire of great Cham, whom at his entry into their Townes, they encounter with their Cleargy in Procession, &amp; the holy Crosse before them, to which hee boweth &amp; maketh low reuerence: and that they blesse fiue Apples, presenting them vnto him in a dish, of which hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and eateth of the one: If he refuse so to doe, they take it for a great disfauour. Lodouicus Patritius Romanus, writeth, that being in Taprobana, he found there sundry Merchants of the fore-said Prouinces, who professed the faith of Christ, making him great and large offers, if hee would accompany them home into their Country, &amp; instruct them more amply &amp; throughly in the faith, according to the vse of the Romain Church: which request of theirs he would willingly haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, but that he dared not vndertake so far a voyage: so that heereby wee may gather, that Prester Iohn is not hee which is in Aethiopia but he who was in the Oriental Indies, <note place="margin">Prester Iohn is not hee which is in Aethiopia, but he who was in the East Indies conquered by the great Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though the other be now throgh error so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> and that he name giuen vnto him of Aethiopia, was but through error, &amp; because the people would haue it to be so. Iohannes Teuronicus, in his book of the rites &amp; customes of Nations, is as well deceaued also in this matter as the rest, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion, that he of Aethiopia in Afrique should be Prester Iohn: the other hauing raigned &amp; beene subdued in the end of Asia, where, as I said, the great Cham or Tartare holdeth his Empire &amp; signeury, who as it is thought, is one of the puissantest &amp; mightiest monarches of the world, &amp; so he entituleth himselfe King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords. This matter, though otherwise well knowne and verified, is also confirmed by <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</hi> who was along time resident in Townes &amp; Citties of his Empire, and by an English Knight, likewise called Iohn Mandeuile, who seruing him in his warrs, receaued his wages &amp; pention.</p>

               <p>You haue great reason in all this which you haue said: and now I call to memory, that the Aethiopians beganne to receaue the faith of S. Phillip the Deacon, and afterwards by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. Mathew the Apostle, and therefore they vaunt them selues to be the first Christians that were in the world in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. But leauing these, there is a prouince of Christians
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19072:62"/>
in Asia, called <hi>Georgia,</hi> the which say they, were so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were conuerted by S. <hi>George:</hi> but I rather take it to <note place="margin">A Prouince of Christians called Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</note> be the ancient proper name of the Prouince. These <hi>Georgists</hi> are also called <hi>Yuori,</hi> they haue their Embassadours alwaies in the Court of the Sophie, I knowe not whether they pay him tribute or no: their Country is very colde and full of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Those also of Colchos are christians, now called by an <note place="margin">Sundry Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Christians.</note> other name, Mengrels. There is another kind of people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Albanes, who maintaine the Christian religion. There is another country of Christians who are called Iacobits: &amp; on the Mountaine Sinay there are other christians named Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romites. And all the coast of India is inhabited of christians, from the entry of the Red-Sea, where the citty of Aden stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, to the citties of Ormur, Dia, &amp; Malaca, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence forward to the kingdoms of Iapon &amp; China, which are verie great &amp; mighty: and hereabouts border many other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, citties, &amp; Ilands, as Zamora, Taprobana, Zeilan, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the Iles of Molucco, whence the spice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, with many other Regions great &amp; little, where dwell infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christians, as well Portugals as other, which (through their good example) haue conuerted themselues to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith: the like is hoped that those wil doe which liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the subiection of the great Cham, seeing they drawe so neere vnto it, which should be a great augmentation of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie: so that by this meanes Christianitie goeth as it were compassing round about the whole world. The christianitie <note place="margin">Christianity goeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about the whole world</note> of the Armenians is notorious to all men, in the greater of which they are in a manner all christians, and in the lesser, the greatest part. There are likewise christians in Sury in Egypt, where as yet remaine sundry signes of ancient christianity, &amp; in many other parts, though in respect of their farre distance from hence, we haue no plaine and perticuler knowledge of them. I haue read in the chronicles of Portugall, that vvhen the Ilands of <hi>Catatora</hi> were founde out, the enhabitants were all christians in their beliefe, though, God wot, passing igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the misteries of the same: for they onely worshipped the Crosse, because they said that God the redeemer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind died vpon the same: as for the rest, they held a few pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:63"/>
the chiefest of which was, to obserue the law of Nature. They called themselues by the names of the Apostles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints, whereby it may be thought, that some good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man had arriued in that Iland, and conuerted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the faith, through whose death or departure from thence, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained so smally endoctrined in that Beliefe, through the which they should worke their saluation. As for the christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the West Indies &amp; new discouered world, we al know it &amp; hold it for a thing most assured, that asmuch as is &amp; shall be discouered, will embrace the Catholick faith: because that people easily discouereth the error of their Idols and false gods, knowing him whom they serued, to be the verie deuill himselfe: for some of them were of the same beliefe as those of India Maior, of whom I spake before, who held him in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne reuerence with sacrifice &amp; temples. But since the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians arriuall in those parts, now they see the dreadful state of damnation wherin they stood, &amp; withall, the deuils authority daily decaying: (for he speaketh nor appeareth now no more <note place="margin">The deuill speaketh nor appeareth no more to those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Christian fayth.</note> vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he was wont to doe) there come daily such migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty numbers of them, &amp; with such sorrowfull contrition &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to receiue the Christian faith, that it is wonderfull: in which after they are once throughly instructed, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer with such ardent charity, zeale and perfection, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I am ashamed to say, how far they doe excell vs of vvhom they receaued it.</p>

               <p>Why it is openly sayde ouer all the Towne, that there hath of late appeared in thys Garden certaine visions &amp; Spirits, which haue affrighted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men, so that for my part, though it be somewhat against my good reputation, I am not ashamed to confesse it, I am so fearefull, that I had rather fight with any man, how far so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer aboue mee in force and strength, then to be alone in place, where any such cause of feare and amazement might happen.</p>

               <p>There are many which would laugh at this which you say, &amp; attribute your feare to faintnes and want of courage: but I will not meruaile hereat, because I know how violently such passions and conditions of the mind are, which as it seemeth, grow and are borne in men, so that, though they would neuer so faine, yet they cannot shake them off &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19072:64"/>
them: so that I haue seene a man, who, if you shewed him <note place="margin">A man that could by no meanes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the sight of a Rat.</note> a Rat, would cry out, and enter into amazement, trembling like a child; though in all other his actions, he wanted neither valour nor courage.

               <p>These are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall passions and imperfections, which seeing, as the olde prouerbe is: no man can take away that which Nature hath giuen, they that are troubled with them, are not to be blamed, if they cannot leaue and cast them off so lightly, as it seemeth they might, to those that are not encombred with them.</p>

               <speaker>AN.</speaker>
               <p>They are not so absolutely naturall, as you terme them, for they are qualities which worke in men, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of which they are: and as the complexion which is the causer of them may change, and is often changed through space of time and many other accidentall causes; so also may be changed, these which you call passions, defects, or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions naturall. We see this verified by good experience, in those who are much troubled with melancholly, who so long as this humor dureth, are amazed at all things which they see, hauing in their minds a kind of impression and imagination, which maketh those thinges seeme to be of an other figure, then in deede they are: but this humor consuming, and the other humors comming to praedominate aboue that of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, this amazement of theirs weareth away, and they become in conditions far different to that they were before: in this sort the chollerick man is commonly hasty and heede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in all occasions; and the flegmatick more slowe and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise: But age, time, and chaunces, change many times one complexion into an other, and ioyntly the passions, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and operations of them, as by example we see euery day.</p>

               <p>Yea indeed may they, for I my selfe haue seene good experience thereof, <note place="margin">A strange melancholly humor of a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which by reason &amp; discretion she violently suppressed.</note> in a kindswoman of mine, not dwelling farre from hence, which being vexed with a kind of melancholly, called by the Phisitions Mirrachia, vvhich bereaueth the Patient of all iudgement, driuing him to a kind of madnes and frenzie: in such sort suppressed and preuented the same with discretion and reason, that shee sildome suffered her selfe to be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed thereof: And truly it was strange, to see the combate that passed betweene her &amp; the melancholly, in such sort that you should see her sometimes forced to fall downe groueling to the ground, flat vpon her face: and though the violence of this humor was such, that it forced her somtimes to teare in peeces such thinges as she had about her, and to cast stones at those that passed by, and to bite those that approached her: yet reason continually so striued against the vehemencie of these passions, gouerning, detaining, &amp; suppressing them, that by little and little they vtterly forsooke her, leauing her sences cleare, &amp; her iudgment vntroubled as it was before: but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this, and returning to your speech of the Spirits, which are reported to be seene somtimes in this Garden: did you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer procure to sound out the truth thereof?</p>

The Peripatetikes &amp; chiefely Aristotle, were of opinion, that there were no deuils at all, and so saith Aueroes, that hee knew no spirituall substances, but those which moue the heauens, which he calleth also Angels, seperated substances, intelligences, &amp; mouing vertues, so that the deuils being spirituall substances, he seemeth to deny that there be any. Of the same opinion was Democrites, &amp; therin so obstinate, that certaine yong men clothing themselues one <note place="margin">Democrites would by no meanes beleeue that there were any deuils.</note> night in deformed &amp; vgly attire, seeming to be very deuils in deed, thinking to make him afraide, when they came into the place where he was, vsing horrible &amp; feareful gestures, he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed himselfe secure without any alteration at all, bidding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cease to play the fools, because he knew wel there were no such bugs as they represented. And when these Philosophers were asked, what griefe that was which those endured who
<pb facs="tcp:19072:66"/>
were possessed of Spirits: they answered it was a passion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <note place="margin">The olde philosophers opinon tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching those that were possessed with Spirits.</note> of a melancholly humor, affirming melancholly to be able to worke those effects: and as yet the most part of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, maintaine the same; affirming that when the deuill speaketh in diuers tongues, yea, though often very highly and mistically, yet that all this may well proceed through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a vehement melancholly. But this is a manifest er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for amongst the Ethnike Philosophers them selues, there were diuers of a contrary opinion: as Pythagoras, Plato, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Trismegistus, Proculus, Pophirius, Iamblicus, &amp; many others, though S. Austine in his ninth booke <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> sayeth, that Plato and his followers called the superiour An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Gods, and that they were the selfe same, whom Aristotle called Angels; and in this sort is to be vnderstoode the spirit of Socrates, so famous in Platos works, and of which Apulei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us writeth a whole booke, and whosoeuer attentiuely readeth the Tymeus of Plato, and his Cratilus in the tenth Dialogue <hi>De legibus,</hi> shal find that he meant the same: &amp; Aristotle him selfe, sayeth, that Lemures and Lamiae dwell in a sad Region.</p>

The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers which confessed that there were deuils, though they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19072:66"/>
vnderstood, that theyr office was to torment the soules of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill liuers, as saith Plato, and Xenocrates in his booke which he made of death, yet they drawe diuers waies, for they make good spirits and euil spirits, and they call the departed soules of great wise men, Spirits, &amp; halfe Gods, feyning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the excellencie of their merrits, to be assumpted into heauen, where, though they neuer entered into the Consistory with <note place="margin">The fabulus fictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the old Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.</note> the other Gods, but when they were called and appointed, yet were they Mediators for men that liued on the earth, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and offering vp theyr messages, requests, demaunds &amp; supplications to the Gods in heauen. Neyther made they heere an end, but they called also the Gods, <hi>Daemons,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <note place="margin">Daemonia.</note> by the words of Trismegistus, which are thus. When the separation, saith he, shall be of the soule from the bodie, the examination thereof shall be tryed by the power &amp; iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the chiefe Daemon, who finding it righteous &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, will assigne it a conuenient &amp; happy place: but if he find it spotted with wickednes, and defiled with sinnes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hee will throw it into the deepe <hi>Abysmes,</hi> where there is alwayes horror and confusion, terrible tempests, violent waters, and vnquenchable fires; And so by degrees downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes towards the earth, they place other Gods, still decly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till they come to the ill Spirits, which they say are those who dwell vnder the earth in the deepe <hi>Abysmes</hi> thereof. Feyning besides, a hundred thousand other such like toyes &amp; vanities, which if you desire to see, you may reade the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers before named, and besides them Caelius Rodiginus, Protinus, Pselius and many others, who haue perticulerlie written of this matter. But one thing I will assure you, that he had neede of a very diuine iudgement, whom they confound not with theyr intricate and obscure contrarieties: it is best therefore that we referre our selues to the Church, following for Pylots in this matter the holy Doctors, who cleerelie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the pure truth hereof, and so shall we attaine to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of that which we pretend.</p>

For which cause, God permitted a great part of them to remaine in the ayre, the earth, and the water, vvhere they shall continue till the day of iudgement, and then they shall be all damned into the very dungeon of Hell: so that we haue with them a continuall warre: who though they be in the places which I haue said, yet are they not out of Hell in respect of torment, for theyr paine is all alike. All this is out of S. Thomas, in the first part. <hi>Quest. 64. Ar. 4.</hi> The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the degrees of Spirits, is rehearsed by Gaudencius Merula, taking the same out of Pselius, who maketh 6. kinds <note place="margin">Sixe degees of Spirits.</note> of Spirits betweene Heauen &amp; Hell.

For the cheefest greefe and paine of the first, which vvere those that had least offended, seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so neere Heauen, is the contemplation, that through theyr wickednes they haue lost so great a Beatitude, (though this be generall to them all) and these are nothing so harmfull as the others are. For those which are in the middle of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Ayre, and those that are vnder them neerer the earth, are those which sometimes, out of the ordinary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, doe mooue the windes with greater fury then they are accustomed, &amp; doe out of season congele the clowes,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19072:67"/>
causing it to thunder, lighten, haile, and to destroy the grasse, Corne, Vines, and fruites of the earth, and these are they, whose helpe the Negromancers do often vse in their deuilish operations. Amongst other things which are written in the Booke called <hi>Mallcus Maleficarum,</hi> you shall finde, that the Commissioners hauing apprehended certaine Sorceresses, <note place="margin">A strange story written in the book called, The Hammer of Witches.</note> willed one of them to shew what she could doe, assuring her life, on condition that from thence forward, shee should no more offend in the like. Wherupon, going out into the fields, in presence of the Commissioners &amp; many other besides, she made a pitte in the ground with her hands, making her vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the same, which being done, she stirred about the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine with one of her fingers, out of the which, by little &amp; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after shee had made certaine Characters, and mumbled a few wordes, there arose a vapour, which ascending vpwarde like a smoake, began to thicken of it selfe in the midst of the region of the ayre, gathering and making there a blacke fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Clowde, which cast out so many thunders &amp; lightnings, that it seemed to be a thing hellish and infernall: the vvoman remaining all thys while still, asked at last the Commissioners where they woulde haue that clowde to discharge a great quantitie of stones, they poynting her to a certaine place, where it could doe no hurt at all, the clowde of a suddaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to moue it selfe, with a great furious blustering of winds, and in short space comming ouer the place appointed, dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a great number of stones, like a violent shower, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly within the compasse thereof. And in this sort may the Witches and Negromancers worke many such like thinges, through the help of those Spirits, as we wil hereafter declare. But turning to the third kind of Spirits beeing on the earth, <note place="margin">The office &amp; function of the thirde degree of Spirits.</note> whose principall office &amp; function is to persecute men, and to tempt and allure them to sinne, and thereby to worke theyr damnation, enuying that those glorious places which they once enioyed in heauen, should bee possessed &amp; replenished with men.

And though Gaudencius &amp; <note place="margin">The deuils though of different kindes, yet in malice &amp; desire to doe euill, are all alike.</note> Pselius attribute to sundry kindes of Spirits, sundry functions in perticuler, yet in generall each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can indifferently vse them, though they be of another kinde.

<pb facs="tcp:19072:69"/>
was scratcht &amp; grated, as though he had been drawn through thornes and briers: and he was so disfigured &amp; dismayed, that hee came not that whole night to himselfe. In the meane time, his parents caused him to be drest and cured in the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest sort they might, omitting nothing which they thought to be expedient for the recouery of his health: The next day, after his sences were somwhat comforted, and that he began to recouer his iudgment, they asked him by what meanes this mischaunce had happened vnto him, to whom he made aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that as he stoode in the court or trippet, there came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him certaine men of exceeding great stature, grim in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and in gesture lothsome and horrible, who presently without speaking any word, hoised him vp into the ayre, and caried him away, with such swiftnes, that it was not possible to his seeming, for any Bird in the world to flie so fast; and at last lighting downe amongst certaine mountaines full of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes &amp; briers, they trailed him through the thickest of them, from one side to another, araying him in such sort, as at this present he was to be seene: and thinking surely none other, but that they would kill him, he had at last the grace and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to commend him selfe vnto God, beseeching him to helpe and assist him: at which very instant they turned backe with him through the aire, and put him in at a little window, which was there in the chamber, where when they had left him, they vanished away. This Boy I knew familierly, both in his young and elder yeeres, for he liued many yeeres after: but hee remained euer after that time deafe, and dull concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neuer recouering his former quicknes and viuacity of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: taking continually exceeding griefe, when any man tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with him of this matter, or brought it anie way into his memorie.</p>

power to touch his soule, and the like hath he done and doth, in other things which we haue seene and knowne, and haue happened, and daily happen in diuers parts: of the which I will tell you one, that happened about 8. or 10. yeeres since, in a Village called Benauides, where two men being together in <note place="margin">A verie strange thing that happened in Benauides.</note> a fielde, there arose of a sodaine a terrible tempest, with such violence of vveather and vvinde, and presently there-vpon a vvhirl-wind so strangely impetuous, that it amazed those that beheld it.

               <p>You may well call it a secret, considering the diuers opinions that are thereof, for many say that they are pure Spirits, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puleius, who made himselfe so well acquainted with them, writeth that there is a kinde of Spirits, who are alwayes free from the strings and bonds of the body, of vvhich number is Sleepe and Loue, whom he termeth spirits: vvhereby he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to confesse, that there are others which haue bodyes, &amp; so thinketh S.

Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile touching the bodies of Spirits.</note> words of Pselius. They who followe this opinion, alleage for the maintenance thereof the wordes of the Prophet Dauid, where he saith: He which maketh his Angels, spirits, and his ministers of fire, &amp;c. They alleage also S. Augustine to haue beene of the same opinion, saying: that the Angels before theyr fall, had all, their bodies formed of the superior &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest part of the Ayre, and such those haue as yet, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained guiltlesse of Lucifers offence: the bodies of whose followers were turned into a thicker and grosser ayre, to the end they might be therein more tormented. But the Maister of Sentences sayth in his second booke, that this is not Saint Augustines opinion, but falsely attributed vnto him, and so the common opinion of all the holy Doctors is, that both the Angels and deuils are pure Spirits, as S. Thomas, and Saint <note place="margin">Both the Angels and deuils are pure Spirits.</note> Iohn Damascene, and S.

<pb facs="tcp:19072:71"/>
paine, but that also to feele them in vnderstanding is vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But as for this opinion, holde it for a manifest error, for truly Gaudencius in some of his opinions, goeth farre vvide of the marke. If I should heere rehearse each of the seuerall <note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion of the holy Doctors co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the substance of Spirits.</note> Doctors opinions, I should beginne an endlesse worke: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them therefore, I will come to the poynt indeed, &amp; that which the rest confesse to be the generall opinion, as I sayde before, of all or the most part of the holy Doctors of the Church, which is, that the Angels when it is necessarie, doe fashion &amp; make vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues visible bodies, for the effects which they pretend, as we finde in many places of the holie <note place="margin">The Spirits when it is necessary, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion vnto themselues bodies of fire, ayre, or earth. &amp;c.</note> Scripture: whether it be of ayre thickned, of fire or of earth, it maketh no matter, but that so it is, see what is written of the three Angels that came to the house of Abraham in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of three beautifull young men: and the Angell Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell appeared to the glorious virgine in a most goodlie forme and figure, when he brought her the salutation. The selfe same is permitted to deuils in their operations, whose bodies though we call fantasticall, because they vanish presentlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet they verily are visible bodies, formed of some such substance as I said before, but the same is so fine and delicate, that it straight dissolueth &amp; vanisheth.</p>
               <p>And because this is to the purpose of that which you asked mee, and which we now discourse of, I haue so lightlie passed ouer all the rest, for there haue not wanted Doctors vvhich affirme the deuils to be in such manner bodily, that they haue neede of foode vvherewith to sustaine themselues and that they feare stoute men, and flie from theyr sharpe vveapons, and that beeing striken, they feele anguish and payne. And if you be desirous to see many particularities, and the seuerall opinions of diuers learned Authors, read Caelius Rodiginus, in his second Booke <hi>De Antiquis Lectionibus,</hi> where hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth copiously thereof.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19072:72"/>
As he had beheld them awhile, the haire of his head began to stand an end, so that being somewhat affrighted, he turned his horse bridle, and rode away: but he had no sooner lyfted vp his eyes, when hee sawe the three visions going together a little space before him, seeming as it were to beare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, so that commending himselfe to God, &amp; blessing him selfe many times, he turned his horse, spurring him from one side to another, but wheresoeuer hee turned, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before his eyes; vvhereupon, seeing that he coulde not be rid of them, putting spurres to his horse, he ranne at them as hard as he could with his Launce, but it seemed that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions went and mooued themselues, according to the same compasse wherein hee guided his horse, for if he went, they went, if he ranne, they ranne, if he stood still, they stood still, alwaies keeping one euen distance from him, so that hee was perforce constrained to haue them in his company, till hee came to his owne house, before which there was a great court or yard, opening the gate of which, after hee was lighted of his horse, as he entred he found the same visions before him, and in this manner came hee to the doore of a lodging where his wife was, at which knocking and beeing let in, the visions vanished away: but hee remained so dismayed and changed in his colour, that his wife thinking hee had receaued some wounde or mishap by his enemies, often asked him the cause of this his deadly countenaunce &amp; alteration, and seeing that he would not reueale the same vnto her, she sent for a friende of his that dwelt thereby, a man of good qualitie, and of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler learning and integritie of life, who presently comming, and finding him in that perplexity, importuned him vvith such instance, that at last he recounted vnto him the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of each thing that had hapned. He being a very discrete man, making no exterior shewe of vvonder or amazement, bad him be of good courage, and shake off that dismaiment, with many other comfortable perswasions, causing him to goe to supper, and from thence brought him to his bedde, in which leauing him layd, with light burning by him, he vvent forth, because he would haue him take his rest and sleep, but hee was scarcely gone out of his chamber, when <hi>Anthonio</hi>

                  <hi>Costilla</hi> began with a loud skrietch to cry out for help, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he with the rest entring into the chamber, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cause of this outcry: he told them, that hee was no sooner left alone, but that the three visions came to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and made him blind with throwing dust vpon his eyes, which they had scraped out of the ground: which in trueth thed found it to be so: from that time forward therefore they neuer left him vnaccompanied: but all profited nothing, for the seauenth day without hauing had Ague or any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, he departed out of this world.</p>

               <p>The same also may wel be, for many times it seemeth that we see things, which in deed we doe not, being deceaued through the force of our imagination: and perchance this of those visions may be the like, who being once represented in the imagination of fancie, had force to work those effects: and the humor which caused the same, encreasing through amazement and feare, might at last procure death: yet for all this, I will not leaue to beleeue, but that these visions were some Spirits, who taking those bodies of ayre, earth, water, or fire, or mingling for that effect any of those Elements together, came to put so great amazement in this man, that the same was cause of his death.</p>

               <p>I will tell it you, as it was told me, &amp; as it is both in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia and Spaine, by infinite testimonies confirmed. This Ayola in his youth, with other Spaniards his companions, comming to Bolonia, with intention to remaine there, and to study the Lawes, as many of his other Country-men did, and finding at the first no conuenient lodging, wherin they might commodiously remaine, so as for their study was necessary: as they went, enquiring vp &amp; downe the streetes, they met with three or foure Gentlemen of the Towne, of whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, if they could adresse them to any good place where they might abide being strangers newly come out of Spaine, and vnacquainted: the one of the Gentlemen smiling, made them aunswere, that if they desired to haue a commodious house, he would furnish them with one, poynting to a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great house in the same streete, whose dores and windowes were fast closed vp, and that without any rent or hire at all: at which liberall offer of his the Spanish Studients being som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abashed, thought surely that hee had iested with them, till another of the Bolonians tolde them that the same was in deede spoken merily, because the same house had beene mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, well twelue yeeres since, no man in all this space daring liue within the same, by reason of the fearefull visions and sights, which are there vsually seene and heard by night: so that the owner, sayth he, hath giuen ouer and abandoned it as a thing lost, because there is not any man found so hardy, that dare aduenture to abide there onely one night. If the matter be no greater then this (quoth Ayola) let him deliuer me the keyes, and I and my companions will (God willing) goe liue in the same, come what will. The Gentleman hearing this their resolute answer, told them that if they required the keies, they would cause them to be deliuered vnto them, with many thanks besides: vvherevpon finding them still persist in their determination, they brought them to the owner of the house,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19072:73"/>
who laying many terrors before their eyes, &amp; seeing them not regard the same, but rather to laugh thereat, caused the doores to be vnrammed &amp; opened: and deliuering them the keyes, put them in possession of the house, assisting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> besides with some necessary houshold-stuffe; the rest that wanted, they prouided for themselues, so that being furnisht of all thinges, they tooke vp their lodging, in a chamber that opened into a great Hall, hiring a woman that dwelt there without to dresse their victuals, for they could not finde any that dared serue them within the house. All those of Bolonia stood intentiue to behold the successe of this matter: the Spaniards only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a mockery thereof, for hauing beene there aboue thirty dayes, they had neuer seene nor heard any thing, so that they held all that which was said to be a meere fable: but within a while after, the two being one night laid downe to sleepe, &amp; Ayola remaining at his study, towards midnight he heard of a sodaine a great brute &amp; noise, as if it had been the clattering of many chaines together: vpon which, growing into some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, he imagined presently with him selfe the same to be without doubt the vision, which was wont to be seene in this house, &amp; therefore determined to goe &amp; waken his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but being about to goe, it seemed that his hart failed him, so that he was, as it were, forced to attend the euent of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: after he had listned intentiuely a while, he perceiued that the same noise cam vp the great staires of the hall, so that pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp his spirits, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending himselfe to God with a good hart, &amp; blessing himselfe many times, taking in one hand his sword, &amp; in the other a candel lighted, he went out of his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and put himselfe in the midst of the Hall, for the chaines, though the noise they made were great, seemed to come very leasurely: standing so a while, he might see com towards him throgh the dore that opened to the staires, a fearful vision, that affrighted him extreamely, &amp; made all his haire stand an end, for it was the carkas of a very great man, only knit together by the bones without any flesh at all, like the forme wherin death is painted: he was tied about the legs, &amp; round about the body with certain cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es, which he drew trailing along: &amp; so stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe, the one &amp; the other stood still beholding a while,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:74"/>
till at length Ayola recouering courage, seeing that the vision moued not, began to coniure him with the greatest &amp; holiest wordes that his feare suffered him to imagine, to tell him what the thing was which he sought or desired, and to let him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, if he needed any thing, promising him his helpe &amp; assistance so farre as he possibly could. The vision laide his armes a crosse, and making shew that hee receaued gratefully this offer, seemed to recommend himselfe vnto him. Ayola bad him againe, tell him, if he would haue him goe with him to any place. The vision bowed downe his head, &amp; pointed to the staires, whence he came. Ayola bad him goe on before in Gods name, promising stedfastly to follow him, whether so euer hee went: vpon which, the vision began to returne whence he came, going with great space and leasure, seeming to be so clogged with the chaines, that he could goe no faster. Ayola following him, as he came to the midst of the staires, whether through the wind, or that he trembled in seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe alone with such company, his candell went out, so that his amazement &amp; feare was much greater then before, yet gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together his spirits as well as he might, he said to the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: thou seest that my candell is out, therefore stay heere a while, &amp; I will goe light him, and come presently back againe, where-vpon going backe, &amp; kindling the same in the fire, he returned, finding the vision in the selfe same place where hee left him, so that the one &amp; the other going on a new, they past through the whole house, and came into a Court, and from thence into a great Garden, into which the vision entred, and Ayola after him: but because there was in the midst thereof a great deepe Well, Ayola stayed, feating least the vision shold turne vpon him, &amp; doe him some outrage: vvhich the vision perceauing, made signes that he shold not be afraid, as it were requesting him to goe with him to a certaine place of the garden, towards which he pointed, whether they were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come, but the vision vanished sodainly away.</p>
               <p>Ayola beeing alone, began to call and coniure him, making great protestations, that if there were any thing, in vvhich he might stand him in sted, he was there ready to performe the same, and that there should be in him no fault at all: but stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19072:74"/>
there awhile, and seeing not hearing any thing more, he aduised to pull vp foure or fiue handfuls of grasse &amp; herbes, in the selfe same place where himselfe thought that the vision vanished, hauing done which, hee returned and awaked his companions, whom he found both soundly sleeping. They looking vp vpon him, sawe him so altered, and his colour so changed, that they verily thought he would there haue ended his life, whereupon they rose vp, and forced him to eate of a conserue which they had, and to drinke a little wine, then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him downe on his bedde, they asked him what was the cause of this his deadly alteration of looke, wherupon he told them all that had happened, beseeching them to keepe it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, because in reuealing it to others, they shoulde neuer be beleeued. But, as these things are hard to be kept secret, so one of them told it in a place, whence it was knowne throughout the whole Citty, and came at last to the hearing of the chiefe Magistrate, who endeuouring to sound out the truth therof, commaunded Ayola by solemne oath to declare the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie of each thing which he had seene, who did so, making this former relation. The Gouernour hearing him tell the same with such assurance, went with others of the Towne to the same place of the Garden, where, according as hee had told them, they founde a great heape of withered grasse, in which, commaunding certaine men to digge with spytters, they founde, and that not very deepe, vnder the grounde a graue, and in the same a carkas with all the markes declared by Ayola, which was the cause that his whole report was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited to be true, but seeking to enquire and learne what body the same so buried should be, so encheyned and exceeding in greatnes the ordinary stature of other men, they founde no man that could expresly satisfie them therein, though there were diuers old tales told of the predicessours of the owner of that house. The Gouernour caused incontinently the carkas to be taken vp, and buried in a Church, from which time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, there were neuer any fearefull visions or noyses seen or heard more in that house. Ayola returned afterwardes into Spayne, and was prouided, through his learning, of many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices vnder the Crowne, and his sonne after him, in our time,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:75"/>
was a man of great sway and authoritie in this Country.</p>

               <p>At least the Phylosophers and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, cannot attribute it, to the abundance of melancholie, because it appeared by the carkas which they found buried, that the same vision was truly and substancially seene by Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola, and not represented in his fancie. And if there were here any Diuines, I dare vndertake there would not want diuersity of opinions, for some would say that it was the worke of the deuill, to no other end then to mocke the people, in forming to himselfe a body of ayre or earth, of the same figure like the carkas that lay buried: Others woulde rather maintaine the same to be a good Angell dooing so, to the intent that the same body, whose soule was perchaunce in heauen, might enioy sacred buriall, neither woulde they want reasons for maintenaunce of their opinions, euery man may therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue herein as pleaseth him, without offending, but howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it vvere, by a good or euill Angell, it was by the wil and sufferaunce of God, and for my part I take it to be the surest to iudge alwayes the best.</p>

The other remained in the bed, with so great feare and perplexity, that he fell therof greeuously sicke, &amp; was in great hazard of his life, though he recouered at last: hee affirmed, that when hee made that resistance to keepe the dead man from him, that by chaunce the other touched him with one of his feete, which exceeded all the Ice of the world, in extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of coldnes.</p>

And that the deuills forme and thicken in such sort their bodies, that they seeme somtimes verily and visibly to resemble vs: you may plainely vnderstand by another example of the said Alexander, who sayeth, that a certaine Monke called Thomas, with whom he <note place="margin">Another most stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge history writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander de Alexandro.</note> was familiarly acquainted, beeing a man euer after this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of a most holy and approued good life, who being resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a Monastery neere vnto the Citty of Luka, being si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated amongst certaine mountaynes, falling one day out with some other of the Monkes, and mooued with an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding passion of choller, went furiously out of the Cloyster, with determination to absent himselfe from thence for euer, and to goe liue in some other part: as he was thus trauersing the thickest of the mountaine, hee met with a great tall man, of a tawnie Sunne-burnd complexion, with a long blacke beard, rowling eyes, and his garment hanging downe to the

After hauing saluted him, the Moonke asked him whether he went that way, seeing the same was no beaten or vsuall path: The other aunswered him, that hee followed a horse of his, which was broken loose, and had strayed ouer those mountaines into certaine meddowes on the other side, so that they went on together talking, till they came to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at the foote of the mountaine: which because the same was very deepe, and full of great pits, they went along the side thereof seeking a Foord or passage, till at last comming to a certaine place which seemed passable: the Moonke would haue puld off his hose and shooes, but the other would by no meanes suffer him so to doe, saying: that he was tall &amp; strong enough, to carry him safely ouer on his shoulders, in which perswasion he was so earnest, that make the Monke what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse he could, he trussed him, halfe perforce vp vpon his shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: at which instant looking downward, he chanced to spie his Ferrymans feete, not hauing seene them till then, which were of a farre different making from those of other mens, so that entring into some suspition, hee would faine haue losed himselfe, but he could not, for the other began to wade with him into the deepest of the streame: vvhere-vpon, fearing it to be as in truth it was, he began with great inward deuotion to commend him selfe to God, and to call vpon the blessed name of Iesus for helpe: at which very instant, the other who was the deuill indeede, threw him downe on the shoare of the Riuer, vanishing presently away, vvith so horrible a noise and tempest, that the very sands of the Riuer, were turned vpsie downe: and the Oakes that grew vpon the banks were torne vppe by the rootes, and the poore Moonke left in a traunce, halfe dead, who so soone as he reuiued and came to him selfe returned penitently to his Cloyster, giuing thankes vnto GOD, for the danger out of which hee had deliuered him.</p>

Caelius Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diginus saith, that there was in Greece a man called Marcus, naturall of Cafronesus, vvho had great familiaritie with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, for which cause he liued alwaies solitary, conuersing little with other men.

In this manner passed ouer manie monthes, the deuill alwaies perswading her, not to sende him any messages, because it was for some respects conuenient to keepe the matter for a while secret, &amp; withall, that she should not conceaue any vnkindnesse, if seeing her in publique, hee vsed no outward semblance of loue towards her, aduising her also, to vse in all poynts, the like strangenesse towardes him,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:80"/>
preuenting heereby the inconuenience that might haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if she should haue found herselfe in company with the supposed Gentleman. The matter continuing thus, it fell out that the Mother of this mayden gaue vnto her a booke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout prayers to read, which she often perusing, the deuill had no more power at all to come in place where she was, nor to abuse her any longer, because she ware the same continuallie about her necke: Whereupon, at the end of three Moneths, shee wondring much at his absence, and withall, hearing that he, I meane the supposed Gentleman, courted another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, entring into a most vnpatient iealousie, shee sent him one day word, that by any meanes he should com speak with her, about a matter most important. The Gentleman, without vnderstanding the cause, beeing full of curtesie and good behauiour, awayting a time when her mother was out, came and founde her alone, and after hauing curteously salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, demaunded what her pleasure was. The mayden see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him speake as one that scarcely knewe her, bathing her face with teares, in wordes full of griefe, complayned of his strangenesse and forgetfulnesse, asking him for what deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of hers he had left her so long vnuisited. The Gentleman astonished at this manner of speech, aunswered her as a man amazed, and vtterlie ignorant of her meaning: whereupon, kindled with exceeding choller, shee began to threaten him, that seeing he had despoyled her of that which she held dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, that he should not now thinke to cast her of, and that if he would not of his owne accord accomplish the promise of marriage vvhich he had vowed vnto her, shee would besides her complaints to God and the world, doe her vttermost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to constraine him perforce to that, whereto by his most solemne protestation hee was bound. The Gentleman, strooken heerewith into greater admiration then before, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered her, that he thought her not to be in her right sences, for neuer in his life had he promised marriage, nor once spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to her in secret, neyther was of meaning to satis-fie anie such demaund of hers.</p>
               <p>The poore vvench welnigh out of her wits, after infinite exclamations, calling heauen and earth to witnes, began per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly

to recite vnto him all such thinges as had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her and the deuill, asking him how he could be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent to deny the same; she mingled with threatning teares, wishing him to haue the feare of Gods vengeance before his eyes. The Gentleman with great confusion began to blesse himself, protesting vnto her by the most solemne sort of oaths he could, that she was deceaued, and that of this matter hee knew nothing at all. Oh God (quoth shee) and howe is this possible, doe you not remember that on such a very day (to mee most vnfortunate:) naming a great feastiuall day, you sware, and vowed to accomplish with mee the holy estate of marriage in the open face of the Church, which you said you were constrained to deferre as yet for some respects. But he hauing heere no longer patience, to the end (quoth he) that you shal fully and plainly perceaue your owne error, I will by sufficient information and vnrefusable witnesses proue vnto you, that I was not in this Towne the day you say, neither 20. dayes before, nor 20. dayes after: if any man therefore in my name haue deceaued you, I am not to be blamed: and to the end shee might be the better resolued, he sent incontinently for seauen or eight persons of credite, as well of his house as others, which without knowing the cause wherfore, solemnly swore and declared, that this Gentleman had beene the very day and all the time mentioned, absent in another Towne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fifty leagues from thence.

which came by obseruations of certaine houres and points in working of those Images, of which they tooke great recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and heede, to the end that the planets might the better vse their influences in working those thinges, which seemed supernaturall. The vse of all this is so lawfull, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be sayde to the contrary. The other kinde of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancie <note place="margin">The vse of natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique is lawfull.</note> or Art Magique, is, that which is vsed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the helpe and fauour of the deuill, which hath beene of long time, as we know, exercised in the world? And of this, the holy Scriptures giue vs sufficient testimony, as well in the old Testament, speaking of the Magitians of Pharaoh, who contended with Moyses and Aaron, as in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, in the Acts of the Apostles, making mention of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus, rebuked by S. Peter: and besides, to satisfie your demaund, you must vnderstand, that the deuils may also be forced and constrained by the good Angels; and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the grace which the one lost, and the other as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>But leauing a-part the examples vvhich wee finde in the newe Testament, of that which our Sauiour Christ, as very GOD and manne wrought with them: Let vs come to the Apostles and Saints, who by the vertue of wordes, and in the onely name of Iesus, made them obey and accomplish all that which they commaunded them: But the Magitians, neyther by themselues, neyther by their wordes, Characters, or signes, haue power or force to constrayne the deuills to any thing, howe so euer they persvvade them selues to the contrarie: vvhich because you shall fully vnderstand to be so, you must knowe that none canne vse or exercise this Arte of Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie, vnlesse hee first make a secrete agreement, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant and agree with the deuill.</note> couenaunt vvith the deuill, and such deuilles vvith vvhom they deale in these couenauntes, are not of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort, but of a higher and superiour condition: For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them selues (sayeth Father <hi>Franciscus de victoria)</hi> in a Repetition vvhich hee made of Magique, they doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue theyr orders and degrees of superioritie: and this is for the better vse of theyr wickednesse: and so sayeth Saint Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas: some deuils (sayeth hee) are preferred as principals, to
<pb facs="tcp:19072:82"/>
commaund the rest, and the inferiour deuils are subiect vnto <note place="margin">Some deuils higher in authoritie then others.</note> those, which are of mightier force, to execute theyr wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and therefore the Iewes sayde vnto Christ, that hee wrought his miracles in the name of Belzebub, Prince of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, so that the Negromancers and Magitians that are confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated with the Princes and Captaines of the Infernall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, haue alwaies the lesser &amp; inferiour deuils in a readines at commaundement to doe their will and pleasure, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto constrained, by those of the higher dignitie and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And whereas you say, that the deuils are kept by some bound and enclosed in Ringes, Boxes or Viols, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon error and deceite, which the deuils make them beleeue, with whom they deale, for they are where, &amp; in what place, and when they list themselues, and how farre soeuer they be of, yet at such time as they are called, or theyr presence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they come in the very same instant to make aunswere, to those which holding them for Familiars, and thinking surelie that they carry them alwaies present with them, demaund or aske any thing of them, who are greatly abused &amp; deceaued, in presuming that they are able to hold them forcibly at theyr commaundement: because it proceedeth not through the words of the Negromancer, but through the might and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the higher Spirits and deuils, which as Captaines gouerne and commaund them: Yea, and some-times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayning them to remaine bound indeed, when they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable exployt in hande, but els for the most-part they leaue them alwayes at libertie.

Her Mistres being out of patience, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during to stay so long, tooke another candle, &amp; going to the house of one of her acquaintance, lighted the same, returning at that very instant by one side of the Church, as her may de dyd by the other, and being in the Sommer time both vnclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, sauing onely that they had a thin white peticoate ouer theyr smockes, they chaunced to be seene by a neyghbour thereby, who was risen a little before, whose eyes belike not being well opened, he tooke them to be Sprights, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the next day that he had seene certain women go about the Church in Procession with candles in their hands.

tale, which I will tell you, the truth whereof came after to be discouered. There dyed in a towne of this Countrey, a Gentleman very rich and of great reputation, who had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained his body to be buried in a Cloyster of Fryers, vvhich <note place="margin">Another pretty tale of a Spright.</note> was performed, and his funerals doone sumptuously, vvith great pompe and magnificence. The night comming, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mad woman that ranne vp and downe the towne halfe naked, was by chaunce left in the Church of the Monasterie when the Sexton lockt the doore, who hauing seene the dead mans Herse which stood in the midst of the Church couered ouer, &amp; of each side with a black cloth trayling on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, with great compasse and widenes as the manneris, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be pinched with cold, (for it was in the middest of the Winter) went to shroud herselfe vnder the same, in which sort the fell a sleepe, till at last the Fryers came into the Quire to say theyr matins; with the noyse of whose voyces awaking, she thought good to sport with them a little, &amp; to make them afrayde, beginning to giue great bounces and rumblings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Coffin, and withall, to skritche and howle in the lothsomest manner she could. The Pryor and his Brethren, somewhat troubled at the suddainenesse thereof, came downe into the body of the Church, bringing with them Holy-vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and holding in theyr handes halowed Candles burning, and vsing such prayers and deuotions as for such a case they thought conuenient.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, the foolish woman resolute to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with that which shee had begunne, the neerer she heard them approach, the greater bounsing shee made, and withall, rearing vp the coffin in height with her head, let both herselfe and the same fall as hard as she could, which though she did manie times, yet the largenes of the mourning cloth kept her from beeing discouered. The Pryor seeing that this coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; exorcismes profited nothing at all, thought it should be a great rashnesse to lift vp the cloath, and to discouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, least thereby, through feare and amazement, might ensue some harme or danger to some of the Fryers, and so commaunded them to returne to theyr Matines. The foole seeing the danger ouerpast, layd her downe to sleepe awhile,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19072:83"/>
and vvaking about the breake of day, conueyed herselfe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly from vnder the Herse, hyding herselfe in a place of the Church, vntill such time as the Sexton came to open the doore, and people began to presse in, at which time she stole priuily out of the Church. The Fryers comming to visit this Herse, &amp; lifting vp the cloth, found nothing but the ground trampled and troden, so that they knewe not what to iudge thereof. This matter could not remaine so secrete, but that it was in fewe dayes published, not onely through the vvhole Cittie, but also in many other places, and euery man adding what pleased him, it was told in diuers sorts, and the opinions and iudgements thereof likewise were diuers, no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth thereof, till on a certaine day, two months after the foresayd buriall, it chaunced that this foolish or franticke vvoman standing in the Market-place, and beeing enuironed with a number of boyes and idle fellowes, that were iesting and sporting with her, spyed by chaunce two Religious men of the same Cloyster passing by, at which breaking out into a great laughter, i-fayth, quoth shee, Fryers, Fryers, as lustie as you are, I made you once tremble and shake for feare: At which turning backe, better to vnderstande that which shee sayde, shee tolde them laughing that it was shee that lay the same night vnder the Herse, and which made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so afray de vvhen they came into the Church to say theyr Matines. The standers by, made her by sweete speeches and fayre promises confesse all that had passed, laughing not a little at the crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the foole, and at the generall error in which they had still remained, if shee had not herselfe disclosed vnto them all the particularities thereof.</p>

               <p>Many of them without doubt are forged, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">Hobgoblins and Robin Goodfelows</note> also true, for these kindes of Spirits are more familiar and domesticall then the others, and for some causes to vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, abide in one place more then in another, so that some neuer almost depart from some perticuler houses, as though they were their propper mansions, making in them sundry noyses, rumors, mockeries, gaudes, and iestes, without doing any harme at all: and though I am not my selfe witnes thereof, yet I haue heard many persons of credit affirme, that they haue heard them play as it were on Gyternes and Iewes Harpes, and ring Belles, and that they aunswer to those that call them, and speake with certaine signes, laughters &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gestures, so that those of the house come at last to be so familiar and well acquainted with them that they feare them not at all. But in truth, as I said before, if they had free power to put in execution their malicious desire, we shoulde finde these pranks of theirs, not to be iestes, but earnest indeed, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the destruction both of our bodie and soule, but as I tolde you before, this power of theirs is so restrained and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they can passe no farder then to iestes and gawdes: and if they doe any harme or hurt at all, it is certainlie verie little, as by experience we dailie see: and therefore leauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rehearsed an infinite number of fables and strange tales tolde of them by the common people, I will tell you truly what I savve my selfe, beeing a boy of tenne yeeres old, &amp; a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Salamanca.</p>
               <p>There was in that Citty a widdow, very principall and rich, somewhat aged in yeeres, which kept in her house foure or fiue mayde Seruants, of the which two were young and very <note place="margin">A Hobgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin in the Citty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanca.</note> beautifull. There was a common report bruted abroade in the Towne, that there should be in this vviddowes house a Hobgoblin or spright that plaid daily sundry strange pranks, of which the most vsuall was, that hee threw stones from the roofe of the house, not onely vpon the persons therein, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vpon others that came to visite the vviddow, in such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and with such noise, as though whole showers of them had beene rained out of the Element, yet alwayes harmlesly without hurting any man. This matter grew so publique, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19072:84"/>
the brute thereof came at last to the eares of the Magistrate, who desiring to know the truth thereof, went presently to the widdowes house, with at least twenty in his company, entring into which, hee commaunded a Sergeant accompanied with foure other men, to seeke round about the house with a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Torch, willing him not to leaue any corner aboue or beneath vnsearched, wherein by any possibility a man might be hidden, which he and his fellowes executed so neerely, that vnlesse they would haue vntiled the house they could doe no more: so that returning they made relation, that there was no seeking any farther, for all was safe: vvhere-vpon, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate told the Gentlewoman of the house, that she was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and deceaued, and as it was most likely by her yong may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, who might bring into her house their Louers, by whom these stones might be so throwne vp and downe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willed her for auoyding of all inconueniences, to looke more narrowly vnto them, least emboldened through this simplicity of hers, they might in time attempt some greater matter. The good Gentlewoman was the most ashamed of the world, not knowing what to reply, yet still persisted to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that of the throwing of the stones to be most true. The Magistrate and the rest iesting at her simplicity, tooke their leaue to be gone, but they were scarcely off the staires, but there came such a whirling of stones about their eares, &amp; with such a noise, as though they had beene throwne with three or foure slings together, as thicke as might be: which falling on their leggs, armes, and feet, did them no hurt at all. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate caused the selfe same man which had searched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to search againe, with great diligence and hast, but it was all in vaine, for there was no body to be found: at which, as they stood wondring, there fell of a sodaine in the portall of the house, such a shower of stones amongst them, that it farre exceeded the former, at which their amazement encreasing, one of the Sergeants tooke vp amongst the rest that lay on the flower, a markt stone, and throwing it ouer the top of the house that stoode on the other side of the streete in front; If thou be a right deuill (quoth he) returne me this stone again, at which very moment, the selfe same stone fel from the roofe

of the house, and hitte him on the brimme of his Hatte ouer his eyes, and the stone was euidently knowne of them all, to be the very same which hee had throwne ouer the other house, so that the Magistrate with the rest of those that were there present with him, departed out of the house, with the greatest astonishment that might be; and not long after there came thither a Priest, of the little Tower of Salamanca, who through certaine coniuration which hee wrought, deliuered the house both of this throwing of stones, and all other such like molestations.</p>

               <p>In good sooth, I neuer heard of a merrier deuill: but afore you passe any farther, I will tell you of two thinges <note place="margin">A Story of a Studient and a Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuenta.</note> which both happened in this same Towne where we nowe are: the one was of a young man, that being a Studient in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanca, came thence hither to see his mother, beeing a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and was certified by the folkes of the house, that there haunted in the same a Hobgobline, vvhich at sundry times played twenty knauish pranks with those of the house, which the Studient would by no meanes beleeue, but laughed at the reports thereof, and at last, grew into choller with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they persisted in the earnest affirmation thereof: At night calling for a candell, hee went to a chamber that vvas made ready for him, and shutting to the doore, layd himselfe downe to rest, but waking within a little while, he might see vnder his bed a light, like vnto a little flame of fire: at which lifting vp the cloathes, and starting out of the bed, he began to looke whence this fire might come, but the same presently vanishing, hee turned to his rest againe, thinking surely that his eyes had dazeled, but he had not line long when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued a greater flame then the first, to his seeming vnder the bed, at which lifting the couerings of the bed fearefully vp, and bowing downe his head very lowe to looke vnderneath the bed, he was sodainly taken by the legges, and pitcht top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie turuie ouer, and throwne into the midst of the chamber, where-with striken into a great amazement, he cryed out as loude as he could for a candell, which beeing brought, and searching vnder the bed, there was nothing at all to be found: from which time forward the Studient acknowledged his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19072:85"/>
and was lesse obstinate in beleeuing that were Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins. The other was of two Gentlemen, which are nowe the <note place="margin">Another sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobline in Beneuenta.</note> chiefest in the Towne, and our especiall friends, who hearing of a Hobgobline that haunted a poore womans house, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the same for a iest, would needes goe thither one night with a certaine Priest, to search out the secret cause whence this report might arise: comming thither, and giuing no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to the poore womans wordes, of a sodaine one of them was striken a great blow vpon one of his iawes, with a clod of stinking filthy clay, of which he receaued no greater hurt, but that it astonished him a little: There fell also of this earth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon others of their company, and one of them was hitte a great blowe on the shoulder with a tile, so that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the Priest made as great hast as they could to gette thence, not without great wonder and meruaile.</p>
               <p>Not long after, a Priest exorcising a vvoman that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, the deuill that was within her, amongst other thinges, confessed that it was hee that which had handled them the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther night, and that the same clay which hee threwe at them was out of a Graue, and of a putrified body, not throughly yet conuerted into earth. But if wee will enter into speech of this kinde of spyrites, wee shall neuer make an ende: for there is nothing tolde of them, so vnpossible, but I beleeue the same, seeing it is a thing so manifestly approoued, that they canne take vppon them, what shape or forme they list: Leauing therefore this, and passing to other poyntes of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importaunce, I pray you make mee vnderstande, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">A false and ridiculous opinion that many hold touching those that are possessed</note> this opinion which many doe holde be true, that when so euer any manne is possessed, the soule of some one that is dead, should enter into him, and speake within him.</p>

And when they cannot enter into the bodies of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they enter into those of other creatures, where willingly they detaine themselues so long as they may, and through the violent strength which the body by their entry receaueth, happen these tremblings, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and forcible motions, which we see they vse that are possessed. This kinde of deuils vse the spirit of the patient as their proper instrument, and with his tongue speake and vtter what they list: but if they be of those that flie the light, and dwell in the profundities of the earth, as the last and vtmost sort of those of the earth: they make the patient deafe and dumbe, like a blocke without vnderstanding, as though hee were depriued of all his sences &amp; forces which he had before: and this is the worst sort of all, and with greatest difficulty cast out. But as for mee, I take these to be rather imaginations of those Authors, then opinions indeed to be allowed and held
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19072:86"/>
for true: for the deuils not hauing bodies, nor entryng into the bodies otherwise then as pure Spirits, they can receaue neither good nor ill of the naturall heate, conteyned in the body of the men into which they enter.</p>

And because the deuill may the better bring them to his byasse, hee discloseth vnto them some properties and vertues of rootes, herbes, and stones, and other things, which haue secret operations, mingling the one with the other, that is to say, that of naturall Magique with that of the deuill, but in conclusion, they may all be called Witches &amp; Enchaunters, which with naturall Magique (which is the knowledge of those things to whom Nature hath imparted these secret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) mingle signes, Characters, and words, vsing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though they vnderstand them not, in theyr sorceries &amp; vvitchcraftes.</p>

               <p>When I was a Student, it was my chaunce to be familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie acquainted with another young man that studied Phisick, in which he proued so excellent, that hee was preferred for a Phisition to the Emperour Charles the fifth. He and I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day in company, discoursing of such matters as these of which we now speake, he affirmed to me with great othes, that when hee studied Grammer in the Monastery of Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulupe, as he went foorth one euening to solace himselfe in the fieldes, he saw ryding on the high-way, a man in a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">A story of a student that rode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalupe and Granada in one night.</note> habit, vpon a horse so leane, and to the outward shewe so tyred, that hee seemed scarcely able to stande vpon his feete, within a while the passenger comming to the place where he walked, after salutations past of both sides, desired him of all fauour to goe vnto the towne, and to buy him somewhat for his supper, because for diuers causes he coulde not goe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, promising him not to be vnthankfull for so great a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie. The Student gently aunswered, that he was most vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe him that or any other measure he could: vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon receauing money, he departed presently to the towne, &amp; returned with speed, bringing such things as the other had required him to buy. The stranger being hungry, spred his cloake, &amp; ouer that a napkin he carried with him, vppon the grasse, and fell to his victuals with an appetite, constrayning the student to sit downe &amp; to eate with him. Where amongst other talke, the scholler asked him whether he rode that way, who aunswering to Granada, the scholler told him that if hee had beene prouided of meanes, he would willingly haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken that voyage with him, to visite an old mother of his that lyued in that Cittie, whom in many yeeres hee had not seene. That shall not be your stay, aunswered the passenger,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19072:87"/>
for if it shall please you to beare mee company, I will defray your charges thither, and withall, I will promise you to take such order, that you shall neither be anoyed nor wearied with the length of the way, but vppon condition that wee depart presently, for I cannot stay long by any meanes. The scholler beeing poore, and the onely thing that letted him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this iourney, beeing the want of money, accepted vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie his offer, desiring him onely to attend so long, till hee had taken leaue of some of his friendes in the towne, &amp; fetcht a shirt or two. The passenger beeing therewith contented, he went his wayes and returned againe with great speede, but make as much hast as he could, the night was come on, so that he requested the other to stay till next morning, vvhich hee would in no wise doe, saying that it was rather better to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile by night, and to rest by day, because beeing in the midst of Iune, the heate was most extreame: so that they began to goe onwards on theyr voyage, the one a foote, and the other on horsebacke, telling old stories, and discoursing of sundry matters, till when they had so gone a little while, the passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger importuned the student to gette vp behinde him on the croupe of his horse, at which the scholler laughing, tolde him that his horse, in respect of his passing leanenesse, seemed to be fitter for dogs meate, then to carry two men at once on his backe. Well, quoth the passenger, if you knew my horse so well as I doe, you would not say so, for I assure you, howe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauoured soeuer he looke, there is not his fellow in the world, neyther woulde I sell him for his weight in gold: and if you doubt of his ability to cary vs both, get but vp, and you shall ere it be long confesse the contrary; at which perswasions &amp; others which he vsed, the student got vp behind him on his Palfry, which carryed them away with such smoothnesse and so swiftly, that hee though hee neuer rode pleasantlier in his life, &amp; euery foote his companion askt him what he thought of his leane beast, assuring him that he would not be tyred or alter his pace, though the iourney were neuer so long. After they had ridden all night, at last the dawning of the day began to appeare, &amp; the student saw before him a goodly countrey, ful of gardens &amp; plesant trees, &amp; not far of a very great citty,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:88"/>
asking of his companion what countrie and cittie the same was, hee made him aunswere, that they were within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of Granada, and that the same was the Cittie vvhich they saw before them, instantly desiring him in recompence of his easie voyage, not to vtter this matter of him &amp; his horse to anie man liuing: and so tooke his leaue of him, bidding him to goe where it pleased him, for hee was to take another way. The Student after many thankes dispatching himselfe out of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, went to the towne the most amazed man of the world, thinking it vnpossible to finish a voyage of so many miles in one night, vnlesse there had beene some deuill within the horse, as it is most likelie there was.</p>

not aboue a quarter of a league from thence, bidding them thanke his cloake: requesting them withall not to vtter this to any man, which they promised him not without singuler astonishment, vpon which he tooke his leaue of them, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by a contrary way.</p>

I will therefore onely tell you one, which was told me for a matter most assured and approued, by infinite testimonies and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations that were taken thereof, which was thus. A certaine <note place="margin">A notable chance that happened to a learned man in Spaine.</note> man well learned, and very discreete, suspected vehemently a neighbour of his to be a Sorcerer, and through the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire he had to be assured thereof, began to vse conuersation, and to enter in a great league of familiarity and friendshippe
<pb facs="tcp:19072:89"/>
with him, couering so finely his dissimulation, that the other assuring him selfe of his secrecie, discouered him selfe vnto him, with great instance, perswading him also to enter into their society, in which doing, he should enioy all the pleasures, delights, and contentments of the world, who faining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be very desirous of the same, it was agreed betweene them, that at the next assembly of theirs, hee should goe to make his couenant and confederation with the deuill, putting himselfe vnder his baner and protection. The day assigned, being come and gone, after it was darke night, the Sorcerer tooke the learned man out of the Towne, and carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long certaine valleyes and thickets, in which to his iudgment he had neuer beene before, though hee knew the Countrey round about very well; and in short space hee thought that they had gone very farre: comming at last into a plaine field enclosed round about with mountaines, where he saw a great number of people, men and women, that went vp and downe in great mirth, who all receaued him with great feast &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, giuing him many thankes, for that it had pleased him to become a member of their society, assuring him that there was no greater happines in the world, then that which he should enioy. In midst of this field was a throne built very sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, on which stoode a great &amp; filthy Ram-goate, to whom at a certaine houre of the night they all went to do reuerence, and going vp certain degrees one after another, they kist him in the foulest part behind. The learned man seeing an abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination so great, though hee were by his companion tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly instructed, how he should behaue himselfe, could no longer haue patience, but began to call vnto God, at which very instant there came such a terrible thunder and tempest, as though heauen and earth should haue gone together, in such sort, that he became for a time, through great astonishment, sencelesse, and without all iudgement and vnderstanding, in which sort, he knew not himselfe how long he continued, but when hee came to himselfe, it was broade day, and hee found himselfe amongst certaine rough mountaines so brused and crushed, as though hee had scarcely any one sound bone in his body; and being desirous to know what this place might

The first time that they goe to present themselues before him, and to doe him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, they finde him not in the likenes of a Goate, but like a King of great &amp; royal authority: they are all brought into his presence by other deuils, in figure of Ram-goates, whom they call <hi>Martinets:</hi> Moreouer, he sayeth, that the reuerence and homage which they doe vnto him, is not like to that which wee vse vnto Princes, but in turning theyr shoulders, and bovving dovvne theyr heads as lowe as they canne, and that hee vvhich is newly assumpted into this brotherhoode, doth first vvith vvordes vvicked and abhominable, blaspheme

and renounce all the holy points and misteries contayned in our Catholique beleefe, vowing vnto the deuill his faithfull seruice for euer, with many other execrable ceremonies, vows, and oaths, which he there vseth; which being accomplished, they mingle themselues altogether, &amp; many deuils with them in likenes of young Gentlemen, &amp; some of beautifull dames, where without shame or respect they fulfill in all abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their filthy lust and beastly appetite: and of this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the greater part, or in a manner all are women, as beeing through frailty and ignorance, readiest to be deceaued by the deuill, and aptest therevnto through the lust of the flesh: and these women, saith he, are called <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Striges,</hi> for <hi>Lamia</hi> is a most cruell beast, which hath the face of a woman, and the <note place="margin">Lamia, Striges.</note> feete of a horse: and <hi>Striges</hi> is a bird that flieth by night, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great shriking and noise, the which when she can gette into any place where children are, doth sucke out their blood <note place="margin">Wee call these skriech Owles.</note> and drinke it, for which cause, the Sorcerers also are called <hi>Striges,</hi> because they worke the same effect, sucking out the blood of men, when by any meanes they may, especially that of little children.</p>

               <p>VVhether this be so or no, the matter is not great, but according to the opinion of many Authors, the Sorcerers and Sorceresses goe vnto these assemblies in tvvo manners; the one through the deceite of certaine oyles and <note place="margin">Two maner of wayes by which the Sorcerers are present in generall assemblies with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</note> oyntments, with which they anoynt themselues, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth them of their right sence, making them imagine that they are transformed into Birds or Beasts, deceauing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie themselues with this error; but oftentimes also the eyes of others that behold and view them, for the deuill with deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

apparance, formeth about them that fantasticall body, which is also practised by sundry Enchaunters, who doe dazle and deceaue our sight, as did <hi>Cyrce</hi> and <hi>Medaea,</hi> and others that vsed the Art of Magique, turning and transforming men into brute beastes, to the seeming of all those which behelde them, though in truth it was nothing so. For as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher sayeth, it is vnpossible to change one shape into another, and the Counsaile of Aquilon vseth these words. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth affirme that any creature may be transformed into any other thing better or worse, or may take any other shape, then that in which it was of God created, is an Infidell. But the Sorcerers and Sorceresses, though they finde the manner where-with they are deceaued &amp; abused, yet they take it well and giue consent there-vnto, thinking themselues in those i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations to be transported with great swiftnes, into those parts which they desire, and verily to see and finde themselues in action of those thinges, which to their fancie are represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The other kinde of going to these assemblies, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sporting them to farre places with such swiftnes, is really and truly by helpe of the deuils, vpon whom somtimes they ride, in likenes of Goates, somtimes they anoynt themselues with other oyntments, whose operation maketh them thinke that they are fowles and flie in the ayre, when in deede they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the deuils. And though vppon this matter, there be many things to say and alleadge, as both by reading and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I haue found to be true, yet for breuities sake I will omit them, onely this I will tell you, that there is no doubt at all to be made, but that the deuill can in very short space, and as it were in an instant, transport these Sorcerers into meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous farre Regions: For he which had power (speaking with feare and reuerence) to carry our Sauiour Christ out of the Desert. and to set him on the top of a pinacle on the temple, and from thence to conuey him to a high mountaine, whence he might view &amp; discouer a great part of the world, can farre more easily transport a man or vvoman through the ayre, which to the end you may by example vnderstand: I will tell you what Fryer <hi>Alonso de Castra,</hi> writeth, alleadging the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Paulus Grillandus, in his Treatise of Heretiques,

Isigonus and Nimphodorus affirme, that there is in Affrica a certaine people, whose sight causeth all those things to perrish, vpon which it is intentiuely fixed, so that the very trees wither, and the children die there-with: The selfe same Isigonus sayeth, that in the Country of the Tribals and Ilyrians, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kind of people, which in beholding any one with frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eyes, if they detaine their sight any while vpon them, doe cause them to die: and Solinus writeth the like of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vvomen among the Scythians.

<pb facs="tcp:19072:94"/>
which kind of cure, to the end you may better vnderstand the manner, I will tell you what happened to my Father when he was a young man. As he trauailed one day by the way, he was set vpon by a fierce Mastiue, by whom, make what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he could, he was bitten through the boot into the legge, of which making small account, because it went not deepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the flesh, he caried the hurt about him three or foure daies, without complaining of the same; the fourth day passing by a Chappell, and hearing the bell ring to Seruice, hee lighted off his horse, and stayed to heare the same which being done, as he was comming forth of the Chappell he was encountred by a Husbandman, who saluting him, demaunded if hee had not beene lately bitten by a mad dogge. My Father told him <note place="margin">A pretty kind of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a man that was bitten by a mad dogge.</note> he had beene indeede bitten of a dogge, demaunding of him the cause why he was so inquisitiue thereof; in good faith sir, quoth the Husbandman laughing, you may thanke God that it hath pleased him to guide and conduct you into this place, for this dogge by whom you are bitten, was mad, and if you should remaine nine dayes without helpe, there were no other way with you but death; and for the more assurance, that I tell you the truth, the dogge had such, and such markes: all which my Father acknowledging to be most true, &amp; entring into some amazement, the other bad him be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, telling him, that hee had the gift of healing that disease, and if it pleased him to stay a day or two in the Village, hee would helpe him. My Father accepting courteously his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, went home with him to his house, where hee presently <note place="margin">There is a Sect of men in Spain cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Saluda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores, who heale by such like ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies those that are bitten by mad dogs, I haue seene of them my selfe.</note> blessed him, and all that euer he did eate, with certaine words and signes, and so likewise once againe after meate; towards the euening, he tolde him that if he would be cured, he must patiently endure three pricks in the nose, to which my Father being in extreame feare, willingly consented bidding him vse his pleasure, where-vpon, in presence of many the principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest men of the Village, he tooke a sharpe pointed knife and prickt him three times on the nose, wringing gently out of each pricke a drop of blood, which he receaued in a little saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer each drop by it selfe, and then washt his nose with a little white vvine, which was also charmed, after which, entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

themselues in talke about halfe an howre, they lookt on the bloode which was in the sawcer, still remaining in theyr sight without beeing remoued, and they found in euery drop a liue worme bubling therein: which the Charmer shewing vnto my Father, sayd be of good cheere sir, for here is all the hurt that the dogge hath done you, but assure your selfe you should haue runne mad and dyed, if your good hap, or rather God had not guided you this way, giue God therfore thanks, and depart when you please. My Father requiting him in the thankfullest manner he coulde, tooke the next morning his leaue, and went on his way: As for this man that helped him, though it might be that God had giuen him some perticuler gift &amp; vertue, yet for my part, I rather mistrust that he went not the right way, because hee could so readily tell the colour and tokens of the dogge.</p>

               <p>Well, to obey you then I will begin, according to the common order, with the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fortune: which Aristotle writing in his second booke <hi>De Phisicis, Cap.</hi> 6. sayeth in this sort. It is a thing manifest, <note place="margin">Aristotles definition of Fortune.</note> that Fortune is an accidentall cause in those things, which for some purpose are done to some end.</p>
               <p>Vppon the woordes of this Definition, all the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers that haue vvrytten Glosses vppon Aristotle, doe spende much time and many reasons, vvith great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and argumentes, the vvhich differing one from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I vvill forbeare to recite, least vvith the rehearsall of them, I shoulde confounde your vnderstanding, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne an endlesse matter. I vvill therefore, onely say that, vvhich in my opinion, I iudge fittest for the purpose, and most materiall to satisfie your desire: for your better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, I vvill therefore beginne vvith that vvhich in Humanitie is helde and vvritten, as concerning Fortune, and then vvhat in Phylosophie is thought thereof: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, vvhat vvee that are Christians ought to thinke and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme in true Diuinitie in deede. Touching the first of the Gentiles, as they erred the groslyest that might be, without all
<pb facs="tcp:19072:98"/>
reason and sence in all things concerning their Gods, so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">The grosnes of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles about their Gods.</note> any foundation or ground, faigned they Fortune to be a Goddesse, dominating and hauing power ouer all things, as writeth Boetius, in his first booke of Consolation, so that as well in Rome as in other places, they builded and dedicated vnto her temples, in which she was worshipped and adored, of the which, and of the founders of them, many Authors make mention, as Titus Liuius, Pliny, Dionisius Halycarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus, Plutarch, and Seneca. The Praenestins, a people of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, held and adored her for the chiefest Goddesse and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectresse of their Common-wealth: but omitting this, as not making much to the purpose, I will tell you the diuers sorts and manners where-with they figured her forth in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Some paynted her like a franticke vvoman, standing with both her feete vppon a rounde ball: others with great <note place="margin">Sundry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and formes in which the Gentiles fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured and paynted Fortune.</note> wings and no feete, giuing thereby to vnderstand, that shee neuer stoode firme: others fashioned her with a head tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the cloudes, and a Scepter in her hand, as though shee vniuersally gouerned all things in the world: Others sette in her hand <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> or the horne of aboundance, shewing thereby that from her we receaue all, both our good and euil: Some made her of glasse, because it is a mettall so easily cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and broken; but the most vsuall manner of painting her, was with a wheele in her hand, continually turning the same vp &amp; downe, her eyes being blindfolded and mufled: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it might appeare, that hee which was in the height of all prosperity, with one turne of the wheele, might easily come vnder and be cast downe; and likewise those vnderneath, and of base estate, might easily be mounted vp into higher degree: Others thought it good to picture her like a man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made vnto him a particuler temple.</p>
               <p>Diuers also paynted her sayling by Sea vpon the backe of a great fish, carrying the one end of a sayle puffed with a full winde in her hand, and the other vnder her feet, deciphering as it were thereby the fickle and dangerous estate of Saylers &amp; seafarers; and hence as I take it, proceedeth that common phrase of speech, that when any man hath passed great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest and danger by sea, we say, <hi>Corrio fortuna,</hi> as though For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19072:98"/>
had medled with the matter. Besides these, they deuised <note place="margin">The phrase Corrio For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna, is not so proper in English, and therefore I set it in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</note> and figured her forth in many other shapes, with a thousand rediculous toyes and imaginations, the cause of which diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of formes attributed vnto her, was because shee vvas a thing onely imagined, and not knowne in the world, as vvas Ceres, Pallas, Venus, Diana, and their other Goddesses, so that they described her by gesse &amp; imagination, according to the conceits &amp; inuentions of their own fancies, some of which were passing grosse, ridiculous, and absurd.</p>

               <p>I haue not seene any picture of Fortune that pleaseth mee better, then that in a table of your inuention, where you paynt her vvith the wheele of which you spake, in her hand, holding her eyes betweene open and shut, with a most strange and vncertaine aspect, placing vnder her feete Iustice and Reason, wearied and oppressed, in poore, ragged, and contemptible habites, lamenting in sorrowful gesture the iniury they receaue in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held in such captiuity &amp; slauery: on the one side of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune standeth Pleasure, and on the other Freewill, both bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pompously attired with rich and beautifull ornaments, each of them holding in her hand a sharpe Arming-sworde, seeming with angry gesture, to threaten them some great mischiefe, if they ceased not their complaints. I leaue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particularities thereof, but it appeareth well that her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are better knowne vnto you, then they were to diuers of those Auncients.</p>

               <p>That liberty which they had in their imagination may I also haue to describe her properties and conditions, seeing she obserueth neither Reason nor Iustice in her actions, but oppresseth and banisheth them in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner out of the world, gouerning herselfe by her owne will &amp; pleasure, without order or agreement, as Tully writeth in his booke of Diuination. There is nothing sayth he, so contrary to Reason &amp; Constancie, as Fortune: and therefore the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients termed her by so sundry Names, calling her blind, fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, variable, vnconstant, cruell, changeable, traytresse, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatre, without iudgement, besides infinite other foule Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes and ignominious names, alwaies accusing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning her as vvicked, light, inconstant, mutable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that the same proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, and therfore through sacrifice and humble prayers, they endeuoured to appease, her, to the end she might alter &amp; change her determination.</p>

Chaunce is an accidentall cause which worketh in things: for seeing this words purpose and <note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Chaunce more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral then that of Fortune.</note> end cannot be but in the vnderstanding, it is manifest that the definition of Chaunce is more generall then that of Fortune, because it comprehendeth all thinges that want vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which to the ende you may the better conceaue, I will vse some examples for the plainer and more euident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration thereof.

estate or office whereby to liue, and in comming thither, the Pope giueth him a Bishoprick or a Deanry, we may say that he had good Fortune, considering that his meaning on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended to the attaining of some meane office, sufficient for his maintenance, &amp; contrary to his expectation, the Pope made him some Cardinall or great Prelate, so that wee may very well terme him Fortunate: the like may be said of one, that going with Horses or Oxen to tyl a peece of ground, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vp a stone by Chaunce, vnder which he findeth hidden some great treasure, and there-with enricheth himselfe. This mans intention and purpose, was to tyll that ground, and not to seeke for any treasure, in finding of which, we may say, that he was fauoured of Fortune: But because the examples of such thinges as haue truly indeede passed, may be better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode, we may say, that the Emperour Claudius was very fortunate, because Caligula being slaine, and hee also fearing to be killed, in that fury and vprore of the people, for that he was his neere kindsman; as hee peeped out of a corner of the house, wherein he lay hidden, to see how the world went, was espied of a Souldiour, who knowing him, and running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, Claudius cast himselfe downe at his feete, humbly beseeching him to saue his life: in which his miserable despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <note place="margin">Claudius despairing to liue, of a sodain made Emperour.</note> the Souldiour bad him be of good courage and voide of feare, saluting him by the name of Emperour, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being brought foorth before the other Souldiours, he was established and confirmed in his Predicessours roome, so that heerein was Fortune fauourable vnto him, for his peeping out of the corner wherein he lurked, quaking for feare, vvas with purpose to discouer if the coast were cleare, and to saue his life; &amp; it happened thereby accidentally vnto him, that he was chosen and elected Emperour. The like may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in matters of aduersity; as if one goe to the Court with purpose to serue the King, and by his seruice to obtaine such fauour at his hands, that he may thereby come to be rewarded with some rich estate or dignity, and it falleth out so vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily with him, that hee come in a quarrell to kill a man, and thereby to loose all his substance; wee may say that Fortune was aduerse and contrary vnto him; or if a man walking wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And if you would haue an example contrary to this former, see but what happened to Caligula, the Predicessour of Claudius, who going out of his house to solace himselfe in the Towne, <note place="margin">Caligula murdered as he went to see certaine pastimes.</note> and to see certaine youthfull tryumphs and pastimes of yong Gentlemen of Rome, was murdered by some that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired his death.

These matters also we may in generall call Chaunce, because they chaunced without any such purpose, meaning or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and likewise Fortune, because they happened to men, hauing reason &amp; vnderstanding to make choise of one thing from another: but if a Grayhound running after a Hare, or any other Beast coursing vp and downe the fieldes, should strike his foote vpon a thorne, and become lame, this cannot be properly called Fortune, but Chaunce.</p>

               <p>Your aunswer hath not so satisfied me, but that I remaine as yet in some part doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for howe can it be that the Elephant should so behaue himselfe in battaile, fighting and carrying a Tower of Armed men vpon his backe, wholy ruling and directing himselfe by his commaunders voyce, vnlesse he were endued with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, for the commaundement is no sooner out of his Gouernors mouth, but he presently executeth the same.

               <p>I confesse that all these things alleadged in your reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are true, but not that they do them with vnderstanding &amp; election of good from euil, or of that which is hurtfull, and noisom, from that which is wholsom &amp; profitable, as for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it is more then manifest that they haue thereof no vse at al, for only man is a creature resonable: neither can that of theirs by any means be called vnderstanding, though they seeme in these operations which you haue said, to haue vse thereof: for vnderstanding is so conioyned &amp; vnited with reason, that the one cannot be without the other.

               <p>I throughly vnderstand all that which you haue sayd, and the Phylosophers opinion also concerning the same: but I see that that these words are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vsed farre wide from theyr definition and opinion, for in naming Fortune, we neuer marke whether the thing be done with any purpose, or to any end, but rather the contrary, for we vse this worde so generally, attributing thereunto all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents whatsoeuer, that we make no difference of one from an other, and therefore Tully in his Offices, Great, sayth hee, is the sway of Fortune in prosperity, &amp; in aduersitie who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not her force? Whiles wee enioy her fauourable &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous winde, wee attaine vnto the fruition of our desires, when otherwise, we are afflicted and full of miseries: so that he maketh no difference what is an accidentall cause &amp; vvhat is not, neyther bindeth he her to things onely done contrarie to the purpose and pretended ende: as for example, when a Prince with a little Army, presenteth battel to another, whose Army and force is farre in number more puissant, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that his meaning is to doe the best he can, and his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firme to obtayne victory, otherwise, he would neuer put himselfe in so apparant a danger, which if hee, according to his hope obtayne, nothing hapneth therein vnto him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the purpose and meaning which he had, but hee attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the end for which hee hazarded the battaile: yet for all this we let not to say, that hee had good fortune to ouercome so mighty an Army with so slender forces: if one should goe to Rome with purpose to be made a Bishoppe, beeing of so small merrite that there were no reason at all, why hee should
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19072:104"/>
hope to obtaine so great a dignity; yet in comming to be one, we may well say that Fortune was fauourable vnto him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and so when Iulius Caesar in his warres against Pompey, being in Durazo, where he attended a supply of Souldiours, without the which, his party was not strong enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with Pompey, seeing that they came not, without trusting any man else, determined himselfe in person disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and vnknowne to goe fetch them, according to which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, putting himselfe into a Fisher-mans boate, thrust off from the shore, and began to passe the straight, but the water being rough, and the tempest violent, his Pilot the poore Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher-man feared drowning, &amp; would faine haue turned back againe, and was therein very obstinate; which Caesar by no meanes permitting him to doe, after many perswasions and threatnings, seeing him still perseuer in his feare: at last, be of good courage man (quoth he) and passe on without feare, for thou carriest with thee the good Fortune of Caesar. It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that his chiefe purpose and meaning in this ciuill warre, was, as the sequel shewed, to obtaine alone the Empire, which he afterwards did, and yet in common course of speech, wee let not to say, that his good Fortune aduaunced him to that estate: What shall we say of Caesar Augustus, who from that very instant that Iulius Caesar was slaine, had presently a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to succeed him in the Empire, employing al his thought, care, and imagination, about the compassing thereof, and at last obtayned it indeede, according to his pretence from the first, without any contrary accident, vnexpected Lucke, or sodaine Chaunce; and yet for all that, neither was he forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to giue thankes vnto Fortune, neither erre we in calling him Fortunate, for they were wont to say in an old Prouerb, that there was neuer any Emperour more vertuous then Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane, nor more Fortunate then Octauian, which was the same Augustus Caesar of whom we speake. And now daily wee see this name of Fortune so commonly vsed, that in a manner the rule and signeury of all worldly thinges, seemeth to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto her, as though it were in her power to guide &amp; direct them at her pleasure; and so saith Salust, that Fortune dominateth ouer all thinges; and Ouid, that Fortune giueth
<pb facs="tcp:19072:105"/>
and taketh away whatsoeuer pleaseth her: and Virgil attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto her authority ouer all humaine matters, bee they wrought by accidentall causes, or fall they out aunswerable to our desire, according to that which we procure and seeke.</p>

But to tel you the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, this definition of Fortune is so intricate, that I my selfe doe not throughly vnderstand his meaning, where hee saith, according to the purpose and to some end, which are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers words, &amp; may be vnderstoode in sondry sence; as those doe which glosse vpon his text, whose diuersity of opinions maketh the glosse far more difficill then the text it selfe. But I will not meruaile hereat, because perchaunce Aristotle would doe therein, as he did in the selfe same books <hi>de Phisicis,</hi> which being finished, and Alexander telling him that it was great pitty, that so high &amp; excellent a matter, should by the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing thereof, become vulgar and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon; he aunswered, that he had written them in such sort, that few or none should vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And in truth the old Writers in all their works, so delighted in compendious breuity of wordes, that they not being clearely vnderstoode of those that followed in the ages after, were the cause of an infinit variety of opinions, neither is there any one which glosseth vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who affirmeth not his interpretation to be the true sence &amp; meaning of the Author, the same being perchaunce quite contrary. But leauing this. I say, that though in this mother speech of ours, we want fit and apt words to signifie the propriety of many things: yet in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the effects of Fortune, we haue more then either the Latine or Greeke, for besides prosperous &amp; aduerse Fortune, we haue <note n="*" place="margin">Dycha, Desdycha.</note> Hap &amp; Mishap, good Luck &amp; ill Luck, <note n="*" place="margin">Ventura, Disuentura.</note> by the which we signifie all successes, both good and euill, accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our selues more vsually to these words, then to that of

as Iuuenall where he sayth: Where Prudence is, thou hast no deitie, ô Fortune, but wee for want of wisedome doe make thee a Goddesse, and place thee in heauen. According to which, S.

               <p>You haue said the truth, and so are the wordes of Lactantius to be vnderstood in his 3. booke <hi>De diuinis institutionibus,</hi> which are thus. Let not those enuie at vs to whom God manifested the truth, for as we well know Fortune to be nothing, &amp;c. Comming therfore to the conclusion of this matter, I say that we imitate the Gentiles in vsing this name of Fortune &amp; Chaunce, as they did, adding thereunto Hap, Mishap, Good luck, Bad luck, Felicity and Infaelicitie, in an inferiour degree as it were vnto them, when in pure truth, there is neither Chaunce nor Fortune in such sort as they vnderstoode them, and as yet many Christians thorough ignorance vnderstand them: but if any such Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian would set himselfe with Aristotle, to examine and sifte out the cleere reason of Chaunce and Fortune, I am assured he would come to confesse the same, as he which knewe and vnderstood, that there was a first cause, by which the vvorld was ruled and gouerned, that was the beginning and Ruler of
<pb facs="tcp:19072:107"/>
all things, and that Fortune differed not from the will of the same, which is the very selfe from which we receaue all good and euill according to our deserts, God willing or permitting the same, as it best pleaseth his diuine Maiestie: so that the good Christian ought not to say in any prosperous successe of his: It was my good fortune, or Fortune did thys for me, but that God did this, or this was done by the will &amp; permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God. And therefore, though we speake vnproperlie, as conforming our selues to the common vse, in vsing the name of Fortune in our discourses and affayres, yet let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thereby vnderstande the will of God, and that there is no other fortune.</p>

I will vse as much breuitie as I possibly may, because otherwise the matter is so ample, and so much thereof to be said, that I know you would be weary in hearing me, in summe therfore I will briefly alledge that which maketh most to the purpose, beginning first with the opinion of the ancient Philosophers hereof. The Stoyicks said, that Desteny was an agreement, &amp; <note place="margin">The Stoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks opinion of Desteny.</note> order of naturall causes working their effects with a forcible &amp; vneuitable necessity, in such sort, that they affirmed al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie and all misery, the beeing of a King, begger, or hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to proceed from the vnauoydable necessity of Desteny. Aulꝰ Gelliꝰ saith, that a Philosopher called Chrisippꝰ, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19072:107"/>
Desteny to be a perpetuall and inclinable order and <note place="margin">
                     <p>The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus.</p>
                     <p>The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seneca</p>
                  </note> chaine of things; of the selfe same opinion was Seneca, when he said, I verily beleeue, that Desteny is a strong and forcible necessity of all thinges and doings whatsoeuer, which by no means or force may be altred: so that all those of this sect at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Desteny all successes good and bad that hapned, as though they must of force &amp; necessitie so fall out, without any possibility to be auoyded or eschewed, to which opinion the Poet Virgill conforming himselfe, saith of Pallas. To e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man is assigned a fixed time and desteny, not to be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This vnineuitable order, according to many of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, proceedeth of the force which the starres and Planets haue through their influence and operation in humaine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Boetius in his 4. booke of Consolation, saith, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenie is a disposition fastned to the mooueable things, by which the Prouidence annexeth each of them with order and agreement: and according to S. Thomas, in his 3. booke <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Gentiles,</hi> by Disposition is vnderstood ordenance, which being considered with the beginning whence it proceedeth, which is God, may be called Desteny, alwaies referring it selfe to the diuine Prouidence; for otherwise we may say the same selfe of Desteny which we said of Fortune, that desteny is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but only a thing fained in the imagination of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: for a good Christian ought by no means to attribute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inclination, successe in matters, or estate of his, to desteny, &amp; truly: it is a wicked &amp; Gentilicall kind of speech which we vse, in saying when any thing hapneth, our Desteny woulde haue it so, or it was his desteny, hee could not auoyde it: for though perchance the wiser sort knowe their error in saying so, only following the common vse, yet the common people think as they speak that Desteny is indeed a thing forcible, &amp; not to be shunned, but must of necessity happen and fall out.</p>

Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one day with certain other gentlemen into the fields for recreations sake, towards the euening as we returned home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, we sawe by the Townes side three men setting vp a
<pb facs="tcp:19072:108"/>
poast, vpon a little knap close by the high-way, for one that was condemned to be strangled there the next day, of which three, the one as a Gentleman in our company told me, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him, was the Hangman, adding withall, that it was pittie, that hee had vndertaken so infamous a condition, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young man otherwise well qualified, and a very good Scholler, of which desiring to know the truth, because it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto me strange, I turned my horse, and riding neere to the place where the men were, after I had asked them for whom that poast was sette vp, and they with theyr aunswere satisfied mee, I narrowly markt and behelde the gesture and countenaunce of the young man, who was of a very good complexion, and of an honest face, hee seemed to be about the age of twentie or twenty &amp; one yeeres, his garments were not costly, but cleanly and hansome, asking him if hee vvere the Hangman, he aunswered mee that hee was, demaunding of him in Latine, if euer he had beene a student, hee aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to that demaund and many others in the same tongue very eloquently, but at last asking him of what country and place he was, he aunswered me: that hauing confest himselfe to be a Hangman, he could with no honesty reueale vnto me, any thing touching his Country or Parentage, and therefore prayed me to hold him for excused; I perceauing his shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes vrged him farther, saying: How is it possible, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing such knowledge and vnderstanding, thou hast taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thee so base, infamous, and dishonest an office: Truly thou deseruest the greater blame and punishment, by howe much more carelesly thou vsest the excellent giftes which God hath endued thee withall, as comlines of fauour &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, good capacity and vnderstanding, in vsing of which well, thou mightest doe God and thy Country seruice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now thy talent lieth hidden and buried. He hauing a while attentiuely listened to that which I said vnto him, aunswered at length with many teares, that such was his hard Desteny, by which he was thereto forcibly compelled, against the sway of which, he was not able to preuaile; of whose error and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance taking pitty, I beganne to make vnto him a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, causing him to vnderstand, that there was no Desteny
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19072:108"/>
able to force Free-will, but that euery man had liberty to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of himselfe as he pleased, and to take what way he list, so that hee could not blame his Desteny, but himselfe onely, which hauing election of so many good wayes, had suffered himselfe to be guided so ill. Vsing these and many other such reprehensiue speeches vnto him, hee fell into such weeping, and shed so many teares, that I tooke compassion of him: vvithall, he told me, that he had falne into this misery, for want of good counsaile, hauing heeretofore neuer met with any that had told him so much, whereby to lighten him out of the error wherein he was: but seeing (quoth he) that which is past may be repented, but not vndone, I will by Gods grace here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after take a new course, lesse dishonourable to my kindred, for you shall know sir, that I am borne of Parents of a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest condition: beeing brought into this miserable estate in which you now see me through play only, but God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, it is yet vnknowne to my friends, that I execute this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable office, neither dooth any man of this Towne knowe whence I am, for the place where I was borne, is farre from this Country: so that I am fully resolued to change my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, and to follow your counsaile; and heere-with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly bewailing his vnfortunate course, I brought him home with me to my lodging, in which he remained that night, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be exceeding sorrowfull, and the next morning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: vvhether hee went I knowe not, but from that time forward he was no more seene in those quarters: and truly by many signes I sawe in him, hee gaue me good hope that hee would doe as he said.</p>

               <p>This fellowe had neuer seene the authority of S.

But the best is not to vse it at all, thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
<pb facs="tcp:19072:109"/>
the error, into which the common people doe fall, yea, and a much greater, which is the deniall of free-will; for if that Destenie were a thing indubitable, and the sway thereof not to be resisted, then should neyther reward, punishment, grace, nor glory be due vnto deserts: and so diuine Plato in his Gorgias, To say (saith hee) that there is any constrayning or vnineuitable Destenie, is a fable of vvomen, which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not what they say: so that all thinges are subiect to the free-will of man, not to doe any thing forcibly, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the same vvill, for being a Free-will there can be no Destenie. But because in plunging our selues farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this matter, we should fall vpon that of Prescience &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, engulfing my selfe in which, I should not be able to finde the way out: it is sufficient onely to declare, though it be but superficially, what belongeth to this word Destenie, still vnderstanding that all proceedeth and dependeth of the Diuine will and prouidence of God; and so sayth S. Austine, in his fifth booke <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> If for this cause humaine thinges are attributed to Destenie, let him which calleth the will &amp; power of GOD by the name of Destenie, take heede and correct his tongue. And so concluding, we may inferre, that there is no Desteny at all, at least in such sence as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people vnderstandeth the same: but that by this word we ought to vnderstand the prouidence of GOD, and the fulfilling of his will, which alwayes leaueth vs in free liberty to choose that which is good, and to eschewe that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. For this word Destenie, is chiefely vnderstood and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in matters of aduersity, which when they happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, are eyther for that we seeke and procure them, or else that God permitteth them, because our sinnes and wicked life deserueth such chastisement: Let not him say, that is hanged, that his Destenie brought him there-vnto, but the small care he had to liue vertuously, to feare GOD and to flie vice, was the cause thereof: The like of him that murdereth or drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himselfe, for if such had liued well, and refrayned those vices and enormities, for punishment of vvhich, they vvere condemned by the Ministers of Iustice, or by theyr ovvne guilty desperate conscience to dye, they should neuer haue
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19072:109"/>
had any such cause to complaine. But there is so much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be sayde, that in seeking particulerly to discusse euery poynt thereof, it vvould be too tedious, especially to those, vvho desire no more then well to knowe the conclusion how it ought to bee vnderstoode, vvhich by this praecedent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I hope you doe.</p>

               <p>It is a thing notorious, that the starres haue their influences, but not in such sort as the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion <note place="margin">How the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration &amp; influence of the starres is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode.</note> maintaineth: first therfore you must vnderstand, that their influence hath no power or force to worke any operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the soules of men: but onely in their bodies, the reason whereof is, that the soules are farre more noble, and of more excellent perfection then the planets and starres, so that the constellations being vnto them inferiour in beeing and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, are vnable to worke in them any effect at all. That the soules are more noble then the caelestiall bodies: S. Thomas
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19072:110"/>
proueth in this sort, in his Booke against the Gentiles: So much more noble, saith hee, is euery effect, as it is neerer in <note place="margin">Our soules farre more noble then the caelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies.</note> likenes to the cause whence it proceedeth, &amp; so our soules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liker vnto God then the caelestiall bodies are, in beeing Spirits, as is the first cause which is God, must needs be more excellent then they, so that they can haue no influence vnto them, nor domination ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the soules remaining alwaies free: For though Dionisius sayd, that God hath so disposed the whole order of the Vniuerse, that all inferior thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath <note place="margin">Out bodies lesse noble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore subiect to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</note> should be gouerned by those that are superior and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, yet he presently addeth, and those that are lesse noble, by those that are more noble: and though by this reason the soules remaine free, yet the bodies doe not so, because they are lesse noble then the Sunne, the Moone, &amp; the other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly lights, and so are subiect to their influences, working in them diuers and contrary inclinations, some good, and some euill, which they that seeke to excuse theyr vices and vvicked life, call Destenies, as though it were not in their power to flie and auoyde them through the libertie of free-will? For if we say, that Mars doth praedominate in men, that are strong and valiant, we see that many borne vnder his Planet, are ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and of small courage. All those which are borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Venus, are not luxurious, nor all vnder Iupiter Kings &amp; great Princes, nor all vnder Mercurie cautelous and craftie, neither are all those which are borne vnder the signe of Piscis, fishermen, and so forth of all the other Signes and Planets, in manner that theyr effects are not of force and necessitie, but only causing an inclination to those things, the which by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes and meanes may be disturned, altered, &amp; auoyded, chiefely by the disposition and will of the first cause, which is <note place="margin">The influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the planets, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I confesse all this which you haue said to be true: but yet besides the inclinations &amp; appetites of men, the starres and Planets worke also in another manner, as in aduauncing some men, and abating others, making some prosperous and rich, yea, and sometimes from low &amp; base estate, enthroning them in kingdoms, as for example, King Gygas, and almost in our very time Tamberlaine the great: and deiecting others that were great and mighty, yea Kinges and Monarches into extreame calamitie &amp; miserie infinite examples whereof may be seene in the Booke called <hi>The fall of Princes,</hi> and manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, full of such tragicall disastres. And it is manifest that this proceedeth from the constellations vnder which they are borne, and the operations with which they worke, because many Mathematitians and Astronomers, knowing the day, <note place="margin">Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell future things.</note> howre, and moment wherin a man is borne, vse to giue their iudgement and censure, what shall betide vnto him so borne, according to the Signes and Planets, which then dominate in their force and vigure. And many of them doe fore-tell so trulie manie wonderfull thinges, that it seemeth scarcely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to any man but God to knowe them, which seemeth to proceede through the will of God, whom it hath pleased to place that vertue in those Planets, wherby the future successe might be knowne of those persons that are borne vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And though I could here alleadge many examples of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings and Princes, whose successes to come vvere foretold them by Astronomers truly, &amp; as indeed they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Pope Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellꝰ Father said at the houre of his sonnes birth, that he was borne to be Pope.</note> yet omitting them, because they are so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly known, I will tell you one of Pope Marcellus, who came to be high Bishop, whose Father liuing in a place called <hi>Marca de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona,</hi> where he was also borne, beeing a great Astronomer &amp; at the birth of his sonne casting presently his natiuitie, sayde
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19072:111"/>
openly, that he had a sonne borne that day, which should in time to come be high Bishop, but yet in such sort, as though he were not: which came afterwards to be verified, for after he was elected in the Consistorie by the Cardinals, hee dyed within twentie daies, not beeing able to publish or determine any thing by reason of his short gouernment. I knewe also a man in Italie, called the Astronomer of Chary, who whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he foretold, the same proued in successe commonlie to be true, so that he was held for a Prophet: truth it is that hee was also skilfull in Palmestrie and Phisiognomie, and thereby strangely foretold many things that were to come: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly <note place="margin">The Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer of Charie.</note> he warned a speciall friend of mine to looke wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe in the xxviij. yeere of his age, in which he should be in danger to receaue a wounde, whereby his life shoulde stand in great hazard, which fell out so iustly as might be, for in that yeere he receaued a wound of a Launce in his bodie, whereof he dyed. A certaine Souldiour also one day impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunating him to tell his fortune, declaring vnto him the day and howre, wherein he was borne, and withall, shewing him the palme of his hand, and because he excused himselfe, growing into choller, and vrging him with threatnings to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his demaund, he told him that he was loth to bring him so ill newes, but seeing you will needs haue it, quoth he, giue me but one crowne, and I will be bound to finde you meate and drinke as long as you liue. The Souldiour going away laughing and iesting at him, seeing presently two of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes fighting, went betweene to part them, and was by one of them thrust quite through the body, so that he fell downe dead in the place.</p>

               <p>I cannot choose but confesse vnto you, that many Astronomers hit often right in their coniectures, but not so that they can assuredly affirme those thinges which they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of force and necessity to fall out, there being so many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <note place="margin">Many causes and reasons to alter that which the signes and Planets doe seeme to portend.</note> and reasons to alter and change that which the signes and Planets doe seeme to portend: the first, is the will of God, as being the first cause of all things, who as he created and made the starres with that vertue and influence, so can he by his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will change and alter the same when it pleaseth him: Also
<pb facs="tcp:19072:112"/>
all the starres are not knowne, nor the vertues which they haue, so that it may well be that the vertue of the one, doth hinder, make lesse, or cause an alteration in the effect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so an Astronomer may come to be deceaued in his calculations, as vvas the selfe same Astronomer of Chary, which you speake of, when he fore-told that Florence being besieged with an Army imperiall, &amp; with the forces of Pope Clement, should be put to sackage and spoile of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. This Prophecie of his had like to haue cost him his life, if hee had not made the better shift with his heeles, for the Souldiours, by composition that the Towne made, finding themselues deluded, made frusttate, &amp; deceaued of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied booty, would haue slaine him, if he had not with all possible diligence made away. Besides, if this were so, there must of necessity follow a great inconuenience, and such as is not to be aunswered: for if when so euer any one is borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a constellation, that of force the good or euill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by portended must happen vnto him: the selfe same then by consequence must needs happen to all those which are borne in that instant, vnder the same signe and Planet: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the multitude of the people which is in the worlde, there is no houre nor moment, in which there are not many borne together, of which, some come to be Princes, and some to be Rogues: When Augustus Caesar was borne, it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but that there were others also borne in the very same poynt and moment, which for all that came not to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and to gouerne the whole worlde in so flourishing a peace as he did, yea, and perchaunce some of them, went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards begging from dore to dore. And thinke you that Alexander the great, had no companions at his birth? Yes without doubt had he, though they had no part of his good Fortune and prosperity. This matter is handled very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously by S. Austine, in his fifth booke <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the Mathematitians and Astronomers, which say, that the constellations and influences are momentary, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it should ensue that euery part and member of the body, should haue a particuler constellation, because the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together cannot be born in one moment, nor in many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19072:112"/>
to be short therefore, they are many times deceaued that giue such great credite to the abusiue coniectures of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy, spending their whole time about the speculation and fore-knowledge of future things, pertaining not onely to the birth of men, fore-shewing their fortunes and successes, but also to those of plagues, earth-quakes, deluges, tempests, droughts, and such like things that are to happen.</p>

               <p>If I vnderstand you well, your meaning is, that the influence of the Planets worketh not in men with any necessity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, but onely as it were planting in them an inclination to follow the vertue of their operations, which may with great facility be euited in such thinges as are within the vse of free will and Lybre arbitrement: In the rest, they may sometimes fall out, according as by the vertue and property of the signes and planets may be coniectured and iudged, yea, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also otherwise, because it may please the first cause which imparted vnto them that vertue to change or alter their property, or that there may be diuers other causes in the way, which may hinder the effect of their influence.</p>

               <p>This is a question in which the Astronomers and Philosophers doe disagree, eyther holding of them their seuerall opinions. For the Astronomers in community doe hold and affirme that all this which you haue said proceedeth <note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Planets.</note> from the constellations, and that through their causes these domages do happen vnto men, &amp; all the other euils also with the which we are afflicted, alleadging for the proofe thereof, the authority of Ptolome in his <hi>Centiloquium.</hi> The man, sayth he, that is skilfull in the Science of Astronomy, may fore see and auoide many euils to happen, according to that which the starres doe shew &amp; portend: and also they alleadge Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, in his third book of Iudiciall daies, whose words are these. Let vs (saith hee) imagine that a man is borne, the good Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets being in Aries, and the euill in Taurus; there is no doubt to be made, but all thinges shall goe prosperously with this man, while the Moone shall be in Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricornus: but when she shall possesse any signe, in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drat aspect or in Diameter, to the signe of Taurus, he shall be molested with many troubles and vexations: and hee goeth farther and sayth, that this man shall begin to be perplexed with many infirmities, when so euer the Moone shall be in the signes of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, or Aquarius; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19072:113"/>
shall enioy perfect good health while the Moone shall be in the signes of Aries, Libra, Cancer, or Capricornus. They recite besides another authority of Auicenna in his fourth booke, where he saith, the configuration of the caelestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to be sometimes the cause of pestilentiall infirmities, as when Saturne and Mars are in coniunction. And so doth Gentil exemplifie it, alleaging the selfe same place: but what should I trouble my selfe in reciting their authorities, when finally there is no Astronomer or Phisition, which holdeth not the same: but the Philosophers, as I haue said, maintaine a contrary opinion, affirming that no domage or euil can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede <note place="margin">Opinion of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</note> from the Planets, signes, or starres, into the inferiour bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and so diuine Plato in his Epynomide, I surely thinke (saith he) the starres and all the caelestiall bodies to be a kinde <note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Plato.</note> of diuine creatures, of a very beautifull body, and constituted with a soule most perfect and blessed: and to these creatures, as farre as I vnderstand, must be attributed one of these two things; eyther that they and their motions are eternall, and without any domageable preiudice; or if not, yet at the least that their life is so long, that it is not necessary for them to haue any longer.</p>
               <p>These are the words of Plato, by the which is vnderstood, that if the Caelestiall bodies haue no euill in them, as beeing diuine, pure, cleane, and sempiternall, without any preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all domage, and free from all corruption and euill, they can then by no means be causers of those domages &amp; euils which happen in the world to the inferior bodies. Going on farther in the same booke, This is, sayth he, the nature of the stars, in sight most beautiful &amp; goodly, &amp; in their moouings obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a most magnificent order, imparting to inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures such things as are profitable for them. By these authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they inferre, that seeing the starres are of such excellencie, and that from them are imparted to creatures things profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wholesome, they can by no meanes be the occasion of harme or mischiefe, theyr nature &amp; office which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie vse, being contrarie thereunto. But farther the same Author goeth on, declaring the same more plainly. Finally, saith hee, of all these thinges we may inferre this as a true and
<pb facs="tcp:19072:114"/>
conclusiue opinion, that it were vnpossible for the heauen, the Planets, the starres, and the caelestiall bodies which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare therein, vnlesse they had a soule, or vnlesse they dyd it through God by some exquisite reason, to be able to reuolue the yeeres, monthes &amp; dayes beeing the cause of all our good, and so being of our good, they cannot be of our euill. And this explaneth Calcidiꝰ vpon the same Plato in his Tymaeus, by these words, Either, sayth he, all the starres are diuine and good, without doing any euill, or some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely are euill and domageable: But howe can this agree, or howe can it be <note place="margin">Calcidius.</note> said, that in a place so holy and so full of all bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, there can be any euill? And the starres beeing repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with caelestiall wisedome, euilnes and malice proceeding of the contrary which is folly, howe can wee then terme the starres to be malicious or causers of any euill, vnlesse we shold say that which is not lawfull, that they are at one time good, and at another time euill, and that they cannot mixtly be the cause both of good and euill, the which is not to be thought or beleeued, that all the starres haue not one selfe caelestiall substance, none of them separating themselues from theyr owne nature: so that all the starres beeing good, they may be the cause of good, but not of euill.</p>

               <p>These authorities, me thinks, conclude not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the purpose of their intention, for there are manie thinges that can cause both good and euill, and therefore the caelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies also may doe the same.</p>

               <p>This is when there <note place="margin">An obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is in any thing both good &amp; euill, working effects according to the nature thereof; but there is no euill in the heauens, not in any thing therein contained, for according to Aristotle in <note place="margin">An aunswer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> his seconde Booke <hi>De Coelo,</hi> the motion thereof is life to all things, &amp; in the ninth of his <hi>Metaphisickes</hi> also he affirmeth, that in those things which are sempiternall, there can be found no euill, error, or corruption. And Auerroes entreating of this matter, vseth these wordes: It is a thing manifest, saith he, that in those things which are Eternall, and whose essence is without beginning, there can be no euill, error, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the which cannot be in any thing but where euill is, and <note place="margin">Auerroes.</note> heereby may be knowne the impossibilitie of prouing that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19072:114"/>
which the Astronomers say, that there are some of them luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie, and others vnluckie: this only may be knowne of them, that there are som better then others. By these words we may vnderstand that the starres are all good, but not in equalitie: neither haue they all equall vertue &amp; goodnes, and as in them there is no euill at all, so can they not be the cause of any harme at all, neither can wee say that their influences cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contagious or pestilentiall infirmities, &amp; so thinketh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Trismegistus in his Asclepius, Where, the heauen, saith <note place="margin">Opinion of Merc. Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus.</note> he, is that which engendreth, and if the office thereof be to engender, it cannot be to corrupt. Proclus in his booke <hi>De Anima,</hi> holdeth the same. The Heauens, saith hee, founded with a harmony in reason, containe all worldly thinges, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in perfection, accomodating them and benefiting them: which being so, how then can they damnifie, destroy or corrupt them.</p>
               <p>Auerroes also alleadgeth another reason by the testimonie of Plato, who sayth, That euill is found in those things which <note place="margin">Auerroes.</note> haue no order nor agreement, and all diuine thinges are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and constituted in most excellent order, whereby it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the starres and other caelestiall bodies haue no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in them: and hauing none in them, they cannot worke or cause any. This opinion followeth Iamblicus in his Booke <note place="margin">Iamblicus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plotinꝰ scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth at the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</note> 
                  <hi>De Misterijs Egiptiorum,</hi> and Plotinus in his tenth Booke, where he demaundeth if the stars be the causes of any thing, iesting and scoffing at the Astronomers, who affirme that the Planets with their motions are not onely the causes of riches and pouertie, but also of vertue, vices, health and diseases, &amp; that in diuers times, they worke vpon men diuers operations, And finally he will by no meanes permit that there are any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill starres, or that they can be sometimes good and somtimes euill, which opinion is also maintained by Auerroes in his 3. booke of Heauen. Where, whosoeuer, sayth hee, beleeueth <note place="margin">Auerroes.</note> that Mars, or any other planet or starre howsoeuer set in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction or opposition can hurt or doe domage, he beleeueth that which is contrary to all Philosophy. Marcilius Ficinus <note place="margin">Opinion of Marsilius Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus.</note> in his Comentaries vpon the sixth Dialogue of Lawes, sayth thus: One thing we must vnderstande and beleeue, that all
<pb facs="tcp:19072:115"/>
forces, and mouings of the superior Bodies, which discende into vs, are of their owne nature alwaies causers of our good, and guide vs thereunto: wee must not therefore iudge that viciousnes of ill conditioned men proceedeth of Saturne, or rashnes and crueltie of Mars, or craft and deceit of Mercury, or lasciuious wantonnes of Venus. Let vs see what reason thou hast, to attribute vnto Saturne that frowardnesse and vice, which thy euill custome, conuersation, exercise or dyet, hath engendred in thy body or minde, or to Mars that fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and crueltie, which seemeth to resemble that magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and greatnes to which he is enclined, or to Mercurie that subtiltie and craft, called by a better name industrie, or to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus thy lasciuious loue and wantonnesse? Hapneth it not often that men loose their sight, yea and sometimes their liues vnder the flaming blasts of the Sunne-beames, which is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely for our comfort, and to giue life and nourishment to things? And doe wee not see diuers that in open ayre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the warmenesse thereof to theyr comfort, who in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed places are with a small heate smothered, sluft &amp; choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? And euen as these men through the heate of the Sun, whose nature is to helpe, cherrish and comfort, doe receaue domage by theyr owne faulte, in not vsing the same as they shoulde doe: so may the successes of those which are borne vnder these planets, which by their nature are al good, throgh euil &amp; vicious education proue naught, though the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their planets be neuer so good and fauourable: So that by these wordes of Marsilius, the opinion of Astronomers, Mathematitians and Phisitions, seemeth not to be wel groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">The Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable by many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> but that how commonly held or allowed soeuer it be, he holdeth it to be reprouable by many and euident arguments.</p>

               <p>For all this I account you halfe partiall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> I pray you aunswere mee to one obiection, which might be of the Astronomers side opposed, the which is thus: We see that there are diuers venomous and hurtfull hearbes, and manie other Wormes, Vermins and Serpents so contagious, that they are thorough theyr poysons and infections noisome vnto men, yea, and often causers of their death: And seeing that all inferiour bodies, are ruled, receauing their forces and vertues from the influence of the heauenly and superior bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it then seemeth, that they should be cause of the domage which is wrought by the contagion of these inferior bodyes, and therfore the Philosophers party is not so freely &amp; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be maintained, without exception of some particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities: for if we will looke downe vnto the herbes, we shal find <note place="margin">The iuyce of Hemlocke giuen to drinke, to those that were conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die.</note> that the Hemlock, a kinde of weede, yeelded to our elders a iuyce, with the which they executed their sentence of death, constraining those whom they condemned to die, to drinke thereof, as Plato writeth in his Phaedon.

Cornelius Celsus affirmeth, that it healeth watry eyes, and stauncheth the bleeding at the nose: and Galene sayth, that the grayne thereof is the naturall foode of many Byrdes, namelie Stares.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19072:116"/>
Neither is the Mandragora lesse profitable and wholsome: <note place="margin">The vertues of Mandra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gora.</note> for the roote thereof moystned and tempered with Vineger, healeth the woundes made by Serpents, dissolueth the Kings euill, and cureth the disease called the Wolfe, asswageth the paine of the Goute, causeth the flowers of women to come downe, and taketh spots out of the face. All this saith Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenne, thereof in his seconde Booke. Tryacle, Escamonia, Turbit, Agarico, and other Medicines made of herbes, wee notoriously know to contayne poyson in them, and yet wee see by daily experience how wholsome their operations are to <note place="margin">No herbe so veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is some-way vertuous &amp; profitable.</note> those that are sicke, and the like is in all other herbes vvhich are venomous, of which there is not any one to be found that wanteth peculiar vertue, or that is not one way or other help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profitable. Neither is there lesse vertue to be found in lyuing things which are commonly held to be venomous, as for example, though the Snake be not without poyson, yet her skinne which she casteth, as sayth Dyoscorides, being sod in Wine, and some drops thereof let fall into the eare diseased, helpeth the paine thereof, and the same Wine beeing taken and held in ones mouth, cureth the tooth-ache, and the flesh thereof being made into a certaine preparatife &amp; eaten, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Leprosie. The Viper is most venemous and full of poyson, yet are they no small vertues and commodities which <note place="margin">The Viper yeeldeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst many diseases.</note> she yeeldeth: for as Pliny sayth in his 29. booke, the ashes of her skinne beeing burned, is the best remedy that may be, to cause hayres falne of through infirmitie or disease to grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and that shee herselfe beeing burned and beaten into powder, tempred with the iuyce of Fenell and certaine other things, cleereth the eye-sight, and driueth away Rhumes and Catarres. Dyoscorides also sayth, and Plinie affirmeth the same, that the payne of gowtie feete is taken away, by annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with her greace: and Galen in his sixth booke <hi>De virtute medicamentorum,</hi> affirmeth, that if a Viper be choked with a corde or string made of coloured Flaxe, and hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neck of him which suffereth any passion, stuffing or choaking in the throat, it shall be an admirable remedie: the selfe same affirmeth Auicenne in his 3. booke, though there be many that regard not whether the string be of Flaxe, or of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19072:116"/>
wooll, of what colour so euer, and for the most part they vse therein white: Besides, Aristotle sayth, in his third booke <hi>De Animalibus,</hi> that as the Vipers and Scorpions are knowne to be noysome and full of poyson, so haue they also many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and helping vertues, if wee could attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience of them all: And lastly, that the Viper sod in vvine, healeth those that are infected with Leaprosie: which Gallen confirmeth by an example, alleadged in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuenth booke of simple Medicines, where he sayth, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">A Leaper strangely cured.</note> Mowers brought with them into the field where they laboured, a little vessell of vvine, leauing the same vnder a hedge by forgetfulnes vncouered, within a while, returning to drinke thereof, as they poured out the vvine, there fell out of the vessell a dead Viper into their drinking boule, which hauing crept into the same, was therein drowned, so that they dared not to tast thereof: There was thereby by chaunce at that present in a little Hute or Cabbine, a man infected with a disease which they call Leaprosie, who through the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some contagiousnes of his disease, was expelled the Towne, and forced to remaine in the fields, to the end that the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his disease, should scatter it selfe no farther. The Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mooued with compassion, accounting the calamitous life of this poore man to be more miserable then death, gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him this impoysoned vvine to drinke, as a work of charity, thereby to deliuer him out of that languishing life so full of horror, loathsomnes, and calamity; which hauing done, the successe that followed was meruailous, for so soone as the sick Leaper had greedily swallowed in the wine, his disease and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines began by little and little to fall from him, and in short spacee he becam whole &amp; sound: so that I say, that all hearbs, beasts, and stones, contayning in them any poyson or thing noysome, containe also in them many good and profitable vertues, neyther are we to attribute vnto the starres the blame of the domages which they doe, but vnto our selues, vvhich know not how to vse them as we ought, and should doc for our health and commodity. For the Sunne which with his comfortable heate conserueth and cheereth our life, would perchaunce be occasion of death to him, that in midst of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

hot day, would lay himselfe naked vpon some high place to be scorched &amp; parched with the beames thereof: And as a sword or dagger which is made for the defence of man, and to offend his enemy, may be the causer of his owne death, if he wil desperatly thrust it into his owne body: in like sort those men who vse not the before rehearsed things, and such like as they should doe, in receauing thereby the profit they may, &amp; in auoyding the harme that through the vse of them ill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, may ensue, can not iusty lay blame on any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: Concluding therfore, I say that pestilentiall &amp; conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diseases, are caused by matters of the earth it selfe infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Pestilentiall diseases are caused through the corruptions &amp; putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth.</note> the ayre, as dead carrions, corrupted carkasses, sinks, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; stopt waters that come to putrifie and stink, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such other filthy &amp; infectious things: As for great inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, droughts, and famines, with the rest of such like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that offend &amp; anoy vs; they come and proceed, for our chastisement, from the wil of God, causing &amp; permitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without the which, neither can the starres haue any force or vertue at all, neither can they be the causers of any thing that may worke vs hurt, hinderance, domage, or preiudice.</p>

               <p>The opinions of those that write of this part of the earth, are so different and disagreeing, that there can be no greater confusion in the world: at which I wonder not, if they som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times erre in many things touching those parts of the worlde, distant so infinite a number of miles from vs, (and separated from vs by so many Mountaines, Valleyes, Rocks, Cragges, vnenhabited Deserts, Riuers, Lakes, Forrests, sandes &amp; seas, which barre vs from giuing assured testimony and witnesse of them) seeing wee beeing heere in Europe, which as euerie one knoweth that hath but a little smacke in Geography is the least of the three old parts of the VVorld, cannot truelie tell where she endeth her bounds and limits, and throughlie proue the same with sufficient reasons, but onely that we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heerein the opinion of the Auncients, who wrote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of according to their owne fancie, and as they list themselues: for some of them comming to distinguish the bounds of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope on the North-side, content themselues in setting the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Tanais, and the Lake Maeolis for limits therof: others the Ryphean mountaines, without vnderstanding what they say, or yeelding any reason therfore: but they neuer talke of that Land which runneth on in length by the sea coast on the left hand towards the West passing by the kingdome of Norway and many other Prouinces and Countries, for they know not what Land it is, neither whether it goeth, nor where it endeth, nor where it turneth to ioyne with those parts of which they haue notice.</p>

But let vs leaue this matter till hereafter, where I will declare it more particulerly, &amp; let vs return to entreate of som grounds and principles which are necessary for the facility of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that which wee will speake of: for otherwise, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging euery particuler, wee should bring in all the Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and cosmography of the world: and therfore ommitting to declare what thing the Sphaere is, and in what sort it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that the earth is the Center of the worlde, and then how the Center of the Earth is to be vnderstood, with infinit other the like, I will onelie alleadge that which is necessarie for our discourse.</p>
               <p>First therefore, all Astronomers and Cosmographers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide <note place="margin">The heauen is deuided into fiue Zones, and the earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as many.</note> the heauen into fiue Zones, which are fiue parts or fiue gyrdings about, according to which also the Earth is deuided into other fiue parts. The one hath in the midst thereof the Pole Artick, or North-pole, which is the same that wee see: the other hath the South or Pole Antartick, directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the other side of the Heauen. These 2. Poles are as two Axeltrees, vpon which the whole Heauen turneth about, they still standing firme in one selfe place, in the midst betweene them both is the same which we call Torrida Zona, and of the other two Colaterall Zones, the one is between Torrida Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na &amp; the North-pole, beeing the same in which we inhabite, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining Asia, Affrick, &amp; Europe, &amp; it hath not bin known or vnderstood til these our times, that any other of the Zones or parts of the earth, hath been enhabited; and so saith Ouid <note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ouid.</note> in his Metamorphosis, that as the heauen is deuided into fiue Zones, two one the right hand, and two on the left, and that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19072:119"/>
in the midst more fierie then any of the rest: so hath the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Prouidence deuided the Earth into other fiue parts, of which that in the midst is through the great heate vninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and the two vtmost in respect of their exceeding cold. The selfe same opinion holdeth Macrobius in his seconde <note place="margin">Macrobiꝰ, Virgil, and the rest of the ancients erred touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited parts of the earth.</note> booke of the Dreame of Scipio, &amp; Virgill in his Georgiques, and the most part of all the auncient Authors, whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities it serueth to no purpose to rehearse, because in these our tymes we haue seene and vnderstood by experience the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as touching Torrida Zona, seeing it is as well to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited as any of the others, and euery day it is past vnder fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one part to another, as wee the other day discoursed. And trulie the ignoraunce of the Auncients must bee verie great, <note place="margin">A great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the ancient.</note> seeing they know not that Arabia faelix, Aethiopia, the coast of Guyne, Calecut, Malaca, Taprobana, Elgatigara, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Countries then in notice, were vnder Torrida zona, beeing a thing so notorious &amp; manifest, that I maruaile how they coulde so deceaue themselues, and not onely they, but diuers moderne Writers also, which though one way they confesse it, yet another way they seeme to stande in doubt, as may be seene by the Cosmography of Petrus Appianus aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by Gemmafrigius, a man in that Science very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, whose wordes are these: The fiue zones of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, constitute so many parts in the Earth, of which the two vtmost in respect of theyr extreame cold, are vnenhabitable, the middlemost, through the continuall course of the Sunne, and perpendiculer beames thereof, is so singed, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it seemeth not at all, or very hardly to be habitable.</p>
               <p>The Greeke Commendador likewise, a man of great fame &amp; estimation in Spayne, deceaued himselfe in his glosse <note place="margin">Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dador is a Knight, of some crosse, as that of Malta or S. Iames.</note> vvhich hee vvrote vpon Iohn <hi>De Meno,</hi> wherein hee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth thys auncient opinion by these vvordes: The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematitians, (sayth hee) deuide the Earth into fiue Zones, of which the two vtmost next the Poles, through theyr great extreamitie of colde, are not enhabitable, neyther that in the midst through extreame heate, the other two of each side participating of the heate of the middle, and the colde of the vtter Zones are temperate and inhabitable. Of these two, the
<pb facs="tcp:19072:120"/>
one is enhabited by those Nations of which we haue notice, and is deuided into three parts, Affrica, Asia, and Europa: the other is enhabited by those whom we call Antypodes, of whom we neuer had, nor neuer shall haue any knowledge at <note place="margin">Antypodes.</note> all, by reason of the Torrida or burned Zone, which is vnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable, the fierie heate of which stoppeth the passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and vs, so that neyther they can come at vs nor we at them. &amp;c. Though heere the Comendador confesse that there are Antypodes, with whom wee cannot conuerse nor traffique, yet the Auncients accounting the Torrida Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na as vninhabitable, doubted whether there could be of the other side therof any people; seeming vnto them vnpossible, for any man since the creation of Adam, which was created in this second Zone of the Pole Articke, to passe ouer the burning Zone and there to generate and spred mankind. Of this opinion seemeth to be S. Austine, when he saith, Those which fabulously affirme that there are Antypodes, which is <note place="margin">S. Austins o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Anty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes.</note> to say, men of the contrary part, where the Sunne riseth when it setteth with vs, and which goe on the ground with theyr feete right against ours, are by no meanes to be beleeued: and Lactantius Firmianus in his third booke of Diuine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, laugheth and iesteth at those, which make the earth and <note place="margin">Lactantius Firmianus opinion.</note> the water to be a body sphaericall and round, at which error of his, being a man so wise and prudent, I cannot choose but much meruaile in denying a principle so notoriously known, as though the world being round, those people which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to vs vnderneath, should fall downe backwards. The grosnes of which ignorance being nowe so manifestly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, I will spend no more time in rehearsing his wordes: so that they deny that there are Antypodes, and that the world is enhabitable at all the Zones, the contrary whereof is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. Pliny handleth this matter in the sixty fiue Chapter of his second booke: but in the end, he resolueth not whether <note place="margin">Pliny tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the same.</note> there are Antypodes or no, neither can it out of his words be gathered, what he thinketh thereof.</p>

               <p>I will briefely declare it vnto you, though mee thinkes you should haue vnderstood the same, by that which I haue sayd
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19072:120"/>
before: Antypodes are they which are on the other part of the world, contrary in opposite vnto vs, going with their feete against ours, so that they which vnderstand it not, thinke that they goe with their heads downward, whereas they goe in the selfe same sort with their heads as wee doe; for the world being round, in what part thereof soeuer a man standeth ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnder or aboue, or on the sides, his head standeth vpright towards heauen, and his feete directly towards the Center of the earth, so that it cannot be saide, that the one standeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and an other downward, for so the same which wee should say of them, they might say of vs, meruailing how wee could stay our selues without falling, because it should seeme to them that they stand vpward and we downward: and the right Antypodes are as I said, those which are in contrary and <note place="margin">Who are the right Antypodes.</note> opposite Zones, as they of the North-pole, to those of the South-pole; and we being in this second Zone, haue for our Antypodes those of the other second Zone, which is on the other side of Torrida Zona: but those in Torrida Zona it selfe, cannot holde any for theyr right Antypodes, but those which are of one side thereof, directly to those that are on the other vnder them or aboue them, or howe you list to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.</p>

               <p>I vnderstand you well, but we being in this Zone which is round winding, as you say about the earth; how shall we terme those that are directly vnder vs, who by all likelihoods must be onely vpon one side of the world, for if there were a line drawne betweene them and vs through the earth, the same line should not come to passe through the Center and middle of the earth.</p>

               <p>These the Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers call in a manner Antypodes, which in such sort as they haue different places one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other, so doe they terme them by different names, as <hi>Perioscaei, Etheroscaei,</hi> and <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscaei,</hi> being Greeke wordes, by which their manner of stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is declared and signified. <hi>Perioscaei</hi> are those whose sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes <note place="margin">Perioscaei.</note> goe round about; and these as you shall heereafter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, cannot bee but those which are vnder the Poles. <hi>Amphioscaei,</hi> are those which haue their shadow of both sides <note place="margin">Amphioscaei,</note> towards <hi>Aquilo</hi> and <hi>Auster,</hi> according as the Sunne is with them. <hi>Etheroscaei,</hi> are those which haue their shadow alwayes <note place="margin">Ethoroscaei,</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19072:121"/>
on one side: but what distinction soeuer these words seeme to make, yet Antypodes is common to them all, for it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that they are contrary, though not so directly that they writhe not of one side nor other: for facility of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, take an Orenge or any other round fruite, &amp; thrust it of all sides full of needles, and there you shall see howe the points of the needles are one against another by diuers waies, of which those that passe through the sides, are as well oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site as those which passe through the very Center and middle of the Orenge: But this being a matter so notorious, and all men now knowing that the whole world is enhabitable, and <note place="margin">The whole world is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable.</note> that the same being round, one part must needes be opposite to another: it were to no purpose to discourse any farther therein.</p>

               <p>This is no small matter which you say, that the whole world is enhabitable, for (leauing aside that you should say, this generality is to be vnderstood, that there is in all parts of the world habitation; notwithstanding, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Deserts, Rocks, and Mountaines, which for some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler causes are not enhabited) me thinks you can by no meanes say, that the two vtmost Zones in which the North &amp; South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole is contained, are enhabited, seeing the common opinion of all men to the contrary.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>AN.</speaker>
               <p>I confesse that all the old Astrologians, Cosmographers, and Geographers, speaking of these two Zones, doe terme them vninhabitable, the same proceeding, as they say, through the intollerable rigour and sharpnes of the cold; of which they affirme the cause to be, because they are farther off from the Sunne then any other part of the earth: and so sayth Pliny in the 70. Chapter of his second booke by these words: Heauen is the cause of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs the vse of three parts of the earth, which are the three vninhabitable Zones, for as that in the midst, is through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame heate not any way habitable, so of the two vtmost is the cold vntollerable, being perpetually frosen with ice, whose whitenes is the onely light they haue, so that there is in them a continuall obscurity: as for that part which is on the other side of Torrida Zona, though it be temperate as ours is, yet is it not habitable, because there is no way to get into it, &amp;c. And here-vpon he inferreth, that there is no part of the world
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19072:121"/>
enhabited, nor where people is, but onely this Zone or part of the earth in which wee are; an opinion truly for so graue an Author, farre from reason and vnderstanding: That ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which I intend euidently to make manifest vnto you, is, that they were not onely deceaued in those Zones, wherein eyther Pole is contayned, but in Torrida Zona also: for as this is found not to be so vntemperate, nor the heate and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor so raging as they supposed; so also is the cold of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Zones nothing so rigorous and sharpe, as they described <note place="margin">The Polar Zones enha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</note> it, but sufferable and very well to be endured and enhabited, as by proofe we find, that all those cold Regions are peopled. But the Auncients are to be excused, who though they were great Cosmographers and Geographers, yet they neuer knew nor discouered so much of the earth, as the Modernes haue done, which by painefull and industrious Nauigation haue discouered many Regions, Countries, and Prouinces before vnknowne: not onely in the Occidentall Indies (the which wee will leaue apart) but in the Orientall also, and in the farre partes of the Septentrion: for proofe whereof, reade Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, which is the most esteemed Geographer, and to whom is giuen in those thinges which he wrote, the greatest credite, and you shall finde that hee confesseth himselfe to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of many Countries nowe discouered, which he termeth vnknowne and vnfound Landes, saying: That the first part of Europe beginneth in the Iland of <note n="*" place="margin">Ireland.</note> Hybernia, whereas there are many other farther North, that enter also into Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope: and also a great quantity of firme Land, which is on the <note place="margin">Ptolome ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries nowe knowne.</note> same part towards the North-pole, where he might haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his beginning: and in his eight Table of Europe, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Sarmacia Europaea,</hi> hee sayeth, that there lyeth of the one side thereof a Country vnknowne: and in his second Table of Asia, entreating of <hi>Sarmacia Asiatica,</hi> hee sayth the same, not acknowledging for discouered all that vvhich is forthward betweene these two Prouinces &amp; the Sea North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Of Scithia hee sayth the same, in his seauenth Table of Asia, that on the North-side it hath vnknowne Lande: &amp; in his third Table, that all that part of the Mountaynes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the North is vndiscouered; and in comming to India
<pb facs="tcp:19072:122"/>
to the kingdome of Chyna, hee hath no knowledge at all of that which is thence forwarde to the East, where is so great a multitude and diuersitie of Countries, Prouinces and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as in a manner remaineth behind on this side: yet truly there was neuer any man equall vnto Ptolomie in that which he knew, and all both Auncients and Moderns doe follovve him, as the truest Geographer, though hee were many tymes deceaued, as in saying that the Indian Sea is wholy closed and separated from the Ocean, it beeing afterwards founde, that from the Cape of Bona Speranza to Calycut, there is more then a thousand leagues of water, the which, according to his opinion, should be enuironed with firme land.</p>
               <p>Strabo also in his seauenth booke saith, that the same Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which turneth towards the Aquylon, pertayneth to the Ocean sea, for they are sufficiently known who take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the rising of the riuer of Rheyne, forth to the riuer of Albis, of which the most famous are the Sugambij &amp; the Cymbri, but the stripe that reacheth out on the other side of the riuer Albis, to vs is wholy vndiscouered &amp; vnknowne, and a little farther, Those (saith he) which will goe to the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Riuer Boristhenes, &amp; to those parts from whence the winde Boreas commeth, all those Regions are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Clymes and Paraleils, but what Countries &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple those are which are on the other side of Almania, and in what sort they are placed which are nowe called Bastarni, as many doe suppose, or Intermedij, or Lasigae, or Raxaili, or others that vse the couerings of Wagons for the roofes of theyr houses, I cannot easily say, neither whetheir their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try extendeth it selfe to the Ocean, or whether through the extreame cold it be vnenhabitable, or whether there be anie other linage of men between the sea &amp; those Almaines which are towards the part of the Ponyent.</p>
               <p>By these authorities you may vnderstande, that Strabo (though hee were so great a Cosmographer) had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all those Countries which are on the other side of Almaine towards the Septentryon or North-pole. But you must vnderstand, that they made Almaine extende it selfe much farther, then we now adayes doe, bringing within the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19072:122"/>
limits thereof, all those Countries euen vnto Scithia, in which seeing Strabo was ignorant, it is not much if the other Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographers were ignorant of that which is vnder the vtmost Zone it selfe. As for Strabo, he confesseth not only his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in those parts, but also in speaking of the Getes, There are, saith he, certaine mountaines which reach Northward, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Tyrregetes, to the knowledge of whose bounds &amp; ends we cannot attaine, the ignorance of which hath made vs admit many fables that are reported of the Hiperbores and Ryphaean mountaines: But let vs leaue these men, yea, and Pytheas Marsiliensis also with his lyes, which he wrote of the Ocean Sea: and if Sophocles saide any thing in his tragicall verses of Oricia, that she was carried of the wind <hi>Boreas</hi> ouer the whole Sea, and transported to the vtmost bounds of the whole world, to the fountaines of the Night, &amp; to the height of the Heauen, and to the old Garden of Apollo: let vs leaue him also, and come to the trueth of that, which is in deede knowne in this our age.</p>

The Arimasps being past, there are straight at hand the Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaean <note place="margin">Plin lib. <hi>4 Cap.</hi> 12.</note> mountaines, and a Country through the continuall falling of snow like feathers, called <hi>Pterophoros,</hi> the which is a part of the world condemned of Nature, beeing seated in a place of obscurity &amp; darknes: we cannot place these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains any where, then in the very rigour of Nature it selfe, and in the very seate and bowels of the Aquilon: on the other
<pb facs="tcp:19072:123"/>
side of the Aquilon, liueth (if we wil beleeue it) a verie happy people, whom they call Hyperboreans, whose life they say, lasteth many yeres, and of whom are reported many fabulous miracles: it is thought that there are the vtmost barres of the world, and the farthest compasse of the starres, it is 6. months light with them, &amp; one only day of the Sun contrary: not as som ignorantly say, from the Winter Equinoctiall to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne, only once a yere doth the sunne rise vnto them in the <hi>Solstitio,</hi> and only once a yere set in the Winter.

Death neuer ouertaketh them til being through olde age weary of liuing they throw themselues from the top of some high Rock down headlong into the sea: this they account the happiest sepulchre that may be. Some writers haue placed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the first part of Asia and not of Europe, because there are some in situation &amp; likenes resembling them, called <hi>Attacori,</hi> others haue placed them in the midst betweene either Sunne, which is Sun-setting of the Antypodes, and the rising thereof with vs, which can by no way be so, beeing so great and huge a sea between. Those who place them there, where they haue but one day in the yere continuing sixe months, say that they sow their corne in the morning, and reape it at midday, and that when the Sunne forsaketh them, they gather the fruit of their trees, and during the space of theyr night they hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in Caues. This people is not to be doubted of, seeing so many Authors haue written that they were wont to sende their first fruites to the Temple of Apollo in Delos, vvhom they cheefely adored. All this is out of Plinie, who as you see discourseth confessing and denying, for one while he sayth, if we will beleeue it, making it ambiguous, and then presentlie he turneth to say that it is not to be doubted of.</p>

This onelie amongst all other Lands, knoweth not all the courses of time, &amp; of the heauens, neither tasteth it any other thing then cruell Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and sempiternall cold. And farther, speaking in another chapter of the Hyperborean mountaines, he saith, that there was a fable of the Hyperboreans &amp; a rumor, of which to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue any thing was accounted temerity, but seeing, saith he, so many approued Authors &amp; men of great sufficiency co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme them, let no man doubt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for fabulous, being approued with such authorities: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming therfore to speak of them, they are on the other side of <hi>Pterophoros,</hi> which we haue heard say is on the other side of Aquilo, it is a blessed nation. Some will situat the same rather in Asia the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Europe, &amp; others in the midst betwixt the one &amp; th'other sun, there as it setteth with Antipodes &amp; riseth with vs, the which is contrary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, there being so great a sea, which runneth between the 2. rotundities. They are therfore in Europe, &amp; neer them as it is thought, are the bars of the world, and the last compassing or circuit of the stars, they haue one only day in the yere. There want not some who say that the sunne is not there as we haue him here, but that he riseth in the Equinoctiall of the winter,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:124"/>
and setteth in the Autumne, so that the day continueth sixe monthes together, and the night as much. The heauens are fauourable, the ayre sweet, the winds breathe gently &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, there is amongst them nothing noysome or hurtful. The woods are their houses, in the day the trees yeelde them victuals, they know not what discord is, they are not troubled with infirmities, they liue innocently, theyr will is equall, and opinions agreeing, in olde age death is welcome vnto them, which if it be tardife in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, they preuent it in bereauing themselues of life: for being wearie of liuing, after hauing banqueted with theyr friendes, they let themselues fall from the top of a high Rocke into the depth of the Sea, and this is among them the most esteemed Sepulchre. It is said that they were wont to sende by vnspotted virgins theyr first fruites to Apollo in <hi>Delos,</hi> who beeing once by the wickednes of their hostes that harboured them defiled, they since that time haue euer vsed to offer them vp within the bounds of theyr ovvne Countrie, &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:19072:125"/>
heauens are not so vntemperate in those parts or any others how cold so euer, but that they may be enhabited, yea, and in such sort that men liue there very long, &amp; in great health and strength, as by experience of those Countries we finde it to be true, which could not be, vnlesse the heauen were tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and fauourable in correcting that domage which by the cold might be caused: Afterwards handling this matter a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more at large, he turneth to say; I write not this to the end you should thinke that those who goe thither out of Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia or Aegipt, should agree so well with that climate, as those which are naturall of the same; for vndoubtedly they would hardly endure the cold, and be in great danger of their liues: vvhich may be considered by those of the Land of Babilon, for those of them which went towards the North, did not by and by penetrate into the vtmost bounds of the earth in those parts, but seated them selues in the middle thereof, and as they enured themselues to suffer the colds, so by little &amp; little they pearced farther in, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in time to be so accustomed to the cold, that they endured the Snow and Ice, as well as the hote Countries doe the continuall heat &amp; parching of the Sunne: and if there be perchaunce in those parts any thing ouersharp &amp; rigorous, Nature hath amended the same with other helps; <note place="margin">Nature hath prouided a remedy to euery mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</note> for on the Sea shore she hath ordained Caues that runne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mountains, where the fiercer that the cold is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the heate &amp; warmenes that gathereth it selfe therein, and Landward shee hath made Valleyes contrary to the North, wherein they might harbor &amp; shroud themselues against the cold; as for their Cattell and wild Beastes, she hath cloathed them with such thicke skins, that the nipping of the cold can no whit at al anoy them, &amp; therfore those furres of those parts are more precious, then those of warmer Countries.</p>

With those that are vnder the Poles and haue there their habitation, the Sunne neither riseth, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther setteth as it doth heere with vs, but verie differently: for <note place="margin">The diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the sun between vs and those that lyue neere or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Poles.</note> with vs the Sunne riseth in the East, and passing ouer our heads (or missing little thereof) goeth to hide it selfe and set in the West, and giuing a compasse about vnder the earth, turneth the next day to appeare in the same place, making in this course very little difference in a yeere: and our shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe vvhen the Sunne riseth, falleth to the West, and vvhen it setteth, towards the East: but to those who are at the Poles, which according to the rising of the Sunne, are the sides of the world, it is not so: and therefore consider, that when the Sunne is in the midst betweene them both, and from thence goeth declining to one side, the more he declineth, the more he lightneth that side, and hideth himselfe from the other, &amp; because in going and turning to the same place, he deteyneth himselfe halfe a yeere, he causeth that those which are vnder the Pole of that side, haue the day halfe a yeere long, and contrarie, vvhen returning to the mydst of his iourney, hee goeth declyning to the other side, hee vvorketh the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vvith those of the other Pole, and so they repart the yeere one with another, the one hauing mid-daie vvhen the other hath mid-night, and so by contrarie.</p>
               <p>And if you desire to vnderstand this well, and to see it by experience, take any round thing that is somewhat great, and causing it to be hanged vp in the ayre, light a Candle when it is darke, and lyfting it vp a little, bring it rounde about by the midst, and beginne thence to goe declining vvith it to <note place="margin">An example whereby it is proued, that it can neuer be very dark vnder the Poles.</note> one side, and you shall see that the more you decline, the more you shall lighten the poynt which is on that side, and the more obscure will that be on the other side, &amp; then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to turne againe, giuing a compasse by the midst, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19072:127"/>
thence discending on the other part towards the other side, the same will presenlie beginne to goe lightning, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obscuring, and if as I say it is a Candle, it were a Torch, the brightnesse vvould be greater, and though declining to one side, it obscure the other, yet should it neuer be so much, but that there woulde remaine some lyght of that which doth reuerberate from the flame and greatest brightnesse of the Torch: and so fares it with those inhabitants vvhich are at the Poles, or in the Land vnder them: which as the Sunne is so much greater then the vvhole Earth, so cannot he chuse but cast from one side some light vnto the other, vvhich though it be not with his proper beames, yet is it of the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and excellent brightnesse which dooth reuerberate from them, as we haue heere with vs an example of the like when the Sunne is going downe. Besides, the cleerenesse of the Moone and Starres shyning there, helpeth verie much that the obscuritie of the Night can neuer be there so great, but that men may see one another doe theyr businesse, and as Nature hath prouided a remedie for all thinges, so hath shee heereby taken away that tediousnesse, which otherwise the length of so long a night should haue caused.</p>

               <p>I will tell you: with vs, as I saide before, the Sunne passeth aboue ouer vs, and maketh our shadowes on one side at his rising, and on another at his setting, but if you will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand me well, you must vse attention: and first you must know that this word Orizon signified the Heauen which we see, wheresoeuer we are in turning our eyes rounde about the <note place="margin">What thys Word Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> earth, so that euery Prouince and Country hath an Orizon, which is that part of Heauen which they discouer in circling or compassing it about with theyr sight: And as in our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon we discouer the Sunne by little and little when he riseth, to take his course through the heauen ouer vs, and so at last to set himselfe in the contrary place: so with those which are vnder the Poles in his rising, &amp; afterwards his setting, in a far

different sort: For the first day that he riseth, there appeareth but a point of him, which can scarcely be discouered, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so round about their Orizon, in which going about hee sheweth himselfe alwaies in one sort, without encreasing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be a very little, casting all alike brightnes forth: At the second turne he goeth discouering himselfe a little more, and so at the third and fourth, and all the rest, encreasing from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in degree, and giuing turnes round about the heauen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in which he continueth three moneths, and the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of all that vppon which his beames doe strike, goeth round about, and is when he beginneth to rise very great, and the higher he mounteth, the shorter it waxeth: and afterward when he turneth to come downward, in which he dureth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three moneths, it is contrary, euen till hee come to hide himselfe vnder the earth, at which time, as hee goeth hiding himselfe to those of the one pole, so goeth hee shewing and discouering himselfe to those of the other.</p>

               <p>I make no doubt but that all this Land is enhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in parts, though not so populously in all places as this of <note place="margin">Whether all those parts be enhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or no.</note> ours: &amp; in this the Authors doe not so plainly declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that we may thereby receaue cleare and particuler vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding thereof, though some of them goe on setting vs in the right way to knowe the same. For Encisus following the discouery of the Coast, which goeth towards the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting, giuing a turne to the North, he goeth discouering by the same many Prouinces, amongst which, I remember hee speaketh of two, the one called <hi>Pyla Pylanter,</hi> and the other <note place="margin">Pyla Pylan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Euge Velanter.</note> which is somwhat farther <hi>Euge Velanter,</hi> in which he saith the

dayes encrease to two moneths and a halfe, and the night as much, which though it be a Land enhabited, yet through the extreame and terrible cold thereof, the Riuers and Waters are in such sort frozen, that the enhabitants haue much adoe to get any vvater: for their Ices are so thicke, strong, and hard, that they cannot be broken without infinite paine &amp; trauaile. They waite many times til the Ice be opened by certaine wild Beasts, which they haue amongst them, white of colour, and <note place="margin">Wild Beasts like vnto white Beares which digge vp the Ice with their nailes.</note> proportioned much like vnto Beares, whose nature is as well to liue by water as by land: whose feete are armed with such terrible sharpe, great, and strong nailes, that they breake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Ice how thicke so euer it be, vnder the which plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themselues, they swim along the water, and pray vpon such fishes as they finde, leauing the holes whereat they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred open, at which the enhabitants come incontinently to draw water, endeuouring with all dilligence to keepe them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, least otherwise they freeze and close together againe as fast as they were before. They hang in at them their baits and Angling hookes, with the which also they take fish for their sustenance: As for me I assuredly thinke that these Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are those which Gemma Frigius calleth <hi>Pilapia</hi> and <hi>Vila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> though he say that the dayes in them encrease no farther then to a moneth, &amp; the nights as much. But let vs not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if in such things as these so farre distant &amp; seperated from vs, we finde no witnesses of such conformity, but that they differ in somwhat. Olaus Magnus, giueth vs, though in briefe words, some neerer notice of this matter: for before he come to discourse more particulerly of the Prouinces vnder the same Pole, he vseth these words. Those of Laponia, saith he, of Bothnya, Byarmya, and the Ifladians, haue their dayes and nights halfe a yeere long a peece: Those of Elsingia, Anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania, and part of Swethland haue them fiue moneths long, and those of Gothland, Muscouia, Russia, and Liuonia, haue them three moneths long: Which Author being naturall of Gothland and Bishop of Vpsala, it is to be thought that hee knew the truth thereof: But these Countries being so neere vnto ours, I meruaile that there is no greater notice of them, and that there are not many more Authors that doe write of
<pb facs="tcp:19072:129"/>
them: Truth it is as I vnderstand, that this encreasing of daies and nights should not bee generall throughout the vvhole Country, but onely in part thereof, which may be gathered out of that which he sayth, of the Kingdome of Norway, that in the entry and first parts of the same, the dayes are as they are heere with vs: But going on forth to the blacke Castell, and from thence forwarde, there is so great a change as you haue heard before, &amp; the like may also be in other Countries. By these before rehearsed authorities, we may vnderstand the resolution of the doubt by you proposed, that all the Lande betweene vs and the North is enhabited, at least in parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of heere and there, so that it may be trauailed through ouer all.</p>

               <p>You haue some reason to doubt, but as these Lands goe alwaies downehill or slopewise in respect of the course of the Sun, so in little space the same both hideth &amp; discouereth it selfe vnto them in great quantity; this you may partly vnderstand by that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to trauailers, who hauing the Sunne in their eye, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the setting thereof, in passing ouer a Plaine and champaine place, lose presently the sight thereof in comming to the foote of a hill, as though he were sodainly set, yet if they make hast, when they get vp to the top of the hill, they finde him not fully downe, recouering againe day though but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle yet somwhat longer: But for all this, I blame you not in wondring at a thing so strange, which for the true proofe and vnderstanding whereof, were necessary to be seene with our eyes: for confirmation whereof, though there be many most sufficient reasons and proofes, yet I haue not reade heerein

any Author which auoucheth his own knowledge and sight, whereas me thinkes if these Regions were so short, as by this computation of degrees the Authors seeme to make them, there should not haue wanted curious men to discouer the particularities of them, howe great so euer the difficulty or danger had beene in doing the same, which if they had done, they should perchaunce haue found many things farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then they deemed, at least touching some particularities, of which some later Writers vaunt to haue in part experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: of which seeing we our selues are able to giue no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red testimony of sight; I thinke it best that we leaue them to those whose curious industry wil omit no paine to attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perfect searching out of things so worthy to be known: and seeing the Auncients which went sifting out these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, confesse that from the same Land came Virgins to bring their first fruits to the temple of Apollo in Delos, belike there was then some known way, &amp; the passage betweene nothing so difficill as it nowe seemeth vnto vs, which beeing to vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and the manner howe to trauaile and passe through those cold Regions beset with deepe Snow, thicke Ice, wide Riuers, painefull high Hils, fearefull low Valleyes, vnaccessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Desarts, and all kinds of cruell wild Beasts: we leaue them vnuoyaged, not seeking any way whereby we may penetrate into them, and attaine the cognition of their particulers in a manner concealed and hidden from vs, of which though some fewe of the hether parts thereof were knowne by relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some painefull and industrious men, who affirmed that they had seene them: yet the greatest part was by coniectures, considerations, and probable argumentes, though the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity of our times hath passed a little farther, because as I haue sayde, they are eye-witnesses of part of that which wee haue discouered of, as I will tell you straight, but all shall be little to giue vs such perfect and particuler knowledge of this part of the worlde, that we may discourse thereof as of the others which we know.

               <p>I vvonder not much if men haue not so good notice of those partes of which wee haue discoursed neere the one and neere the other Pole, and of that vvhich runneth out by the Coast of the North towardes the West, because besides the great sharpnes and rigour of the cold, we haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation at all with the enhabitants of those parts, nor they with vs, neither is there any cause to mooue eyther them or vs thereunto, vnlesse it be the curiositie of some that thirst after the vniuersal knowledge of all things in the world, as did Marcus Paulus Venetus, who for this cause only tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed so great a part of the worlde, as any man that euer I heard of till this day. Truth it is that some Kings and Princes through couetous desire of enlarging their dominions, as you shall hereafter vnderstand, haue entered so far as they could, conquering into these parts, which they found neyther ouer all enhabited, neyther yet so desert, but that it was in manie places and the greater part therof peopled, and not so far one from another, but that they had knowledge, conuersation, &amp; traffique together. And as in these Countries and Prouinces of ours, we finde one soyle, plaine, temperate and pleasant, and another quite contrary, sharpe, barren and vnfruitfull, subiect to boystrous winds, harsh ayres, and continuall snow, wherewith some mountaines are all the yeere long couered, so that no man will frame in them his habitation: So likewise in these extreame Regions of the North, no doubt but there are some parts of them vninhabited, as those which Pliny, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and the before remembred Authors terme condemned of Nature: yet there want not wayes and compasses in cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling about them, to discouer that which is enhabited on the other side, and though with difficultie, yet in fine, Nature would not leaue to prouide an open way, to the end that this Land should not remaine perpetually hidden and vnknown.</p>

               <p>Mee thinkes there are many that touch this matter, promising to write largely thereof without doing it, and if they doe it, it is euen as they list themselues, because there is no man to controle them: and as for Paulus Iouius himselfe, all that he wrote of this Country, was by the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Muscouian Embassadour in Rome. In one place hee saith, that the Muscouites border vpon the Tartaryans, and that towards the North they are accounted the vtmost dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the worlde, and that towardes the West, they confine with the Danske Sea. And in another place, the Muscouites, sayth he, who are seated betweene Polonia and Tartaria, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine with the Ryphaean mountaines, &amp; enhabite towards the Septentryon in the vtmost bounds of Europe and Asia, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themselues ouer the Lakes of the Riuer Tanays, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Hyperborean mountaines, and that part of the Ocean which they call the Frozen Sea. These are his wordes, in which truly he hath little reason, for the vtmost Land that the Muscouites possesse, is where the day and night continue 3. months long a peece, so that they cannot be called the last enhabitants of the earth, for those whose day and night is of sixe months, are farder North, and neerer the Pole then they, so that in fine, as I sayd before, touching these matters which cannot be seene without such difficultie, those that entreat of them, goe by gesse, coniecturing thereat by the probabilitie of reasons &amp; considerations.</p>

of this Towne are at least 200000. in number, they sildome die of infirmity, but in the Warres, wounded with stones and great staues: Iron nor steele hurtes them not, for they haue none: Siluer &amp; gold they possesse in such quantity, that they esteeme lesse therof, then we doe of Copper; Once, as he said, they determined to come conquer these Ilands of ours, and hauing past the Ocean with many thousandes of men; and comming to the Hiperborean mountaines, hearing there, &amp; vnderstanding that our people were so ill obseruers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of so wicked manners, they disdained to passe any farther, accounting it an vnwoorthy thing to meddle with so corrupt a people, and so they returned backe againe.

               <p>You haue reason, for without doubt the Land which is in those parts vndiscouered, must be very great, and containe in it many things of admiration vtterly vnknowne to vs: But comming now to particularize somewhat more of that which is now in these our times known &amp; discouered, I wil tell you what some very new &amp; moderne Authors doe say thereof, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Iohn Zygler, whom I alleadged before, who in person vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited &amp; viewed some part of these Septentrionall Countries, <note place="margin">Iohan, Zyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerus.</note> though hee passed neither the Hiperborean, neyther the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaean mountains, who meruaileth greatly at that which sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Authors haue left written of these parts, for he found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things so different and contrary, that theirs conformed in no one poynt with the truth, as well touching the situation of mountaynes and heads of Riuers, as the sundry properties and qualities of the Regions and Prouinces, for hee sayeth, that he was in that part where they all affirme the mountaines Ryphaeus to be; and hee found there no mountaynes at all, neyther in a great space of Lande round about it, but all a plaine and leuell Country: the selfe same is affirmed by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismund Herberstain, in his voyage; so that if they erre in the seate of a thing so common and notorious, as are these <note place="margin">Sigismund Herberstain.</note> mountaines, being situated in a Country of Christians, or at least confining there-vpon (for the Country where the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
<pb facs="tcp:19072:134"/>
desribing them, is nowe called Muscouia) hardly can they write truly of other thinges which are farther off, and in Countries of which we haue not so great knowledge as wee haue of this.</p>
               <p>But turning to that which we entreated of, I say that those thinges can hardly be verified which are written by the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients concerning these Northern Lands, not so much for the small notice we haue of them, as for that the names are altered of Kingdoms, Prouinces, Citties, mountaines and Riuers, in such sort, that it is hard to know which is the one, and which is the other, for you shall scarcely finde any one that retaineth his olde name, and though by signes and coniectures wee hit right vpon some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet it is impossible but that we should <note place="margin">The names of the most part of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces and Regions are changed.</note> erre in many, in taking one for another, the experience wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we may see here in our owne Country of Spayne, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall townes of which, are by Ptolomie and Plinie, vvhich write particulerly of them, called by names to vs now vtterlie vnknowne, neyther doe we vnderstand which is which, they are so altred &amp; changed. So fareth it with the auncient Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, which though there be many that do practise &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand according to the antique, yet if you aske them many things according to that now in vre with the moderns (so are things in these our times altered and innouated) they cannot yeeld you a reason thereof, &amp; if they doe, it shall be such, that thereout will result greater doubts.</p>
               <p>But leauing this, I will, as touching the Lands of which we entreate, conclude with that which some Historiographers of our time, haue made mention, namely, Iohan. Magnus Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, Albertus Cranzius, Iohan. Saxo, Polonius Muscouita, and chiefely Olaus Magnus, Archbishop of Vpsala, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue made heere before often mention, who in a Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of those lands of the North, &amp; the particularities of them, (though beeing borne and brought vp in those Regions, should seeme to haue great knowledge of such thinges as are in the same) yet is he meruailous briefe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that which is vnder the same Pole. He saith that there is a Prouince cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Byarmia, whose Orizon is the Equinoctiall circle it selfe, and as this circle deuideth the heauen in the midst, so vvhen
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19072:134"/>
the Sunne declineth to this part of the Pole, the day is halfe a yeere long, and when he turneth to decline on the side of the other Pole, he causeth the contrary effect: the night endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as much. This Prouince of Byarmya deuideth it selfe <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armya deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts.</note> into two parts, the one high, and the other low, in the lower are many hills perpetually couered with Snow, neuer feeling any warmth: yet in the valleys below there are many Woods and Fields, full of hearbes and pastures, and in them great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of wild Beasts, and high swelling Riuers, as well through the Springs whence they rise, as through the Snow that tumbleth downe from the hills. In the higher Byarmya, he saith, there are strange and admirable nouelties, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, there is not any knowne way, for the passages are all closed vp, to attempt through which, hee termeth it a danger and difficulty insuperable, so that no man can come to haue knowledge thereof, without the greatest ieopardy that may possibly be deuised or imagined. For the greater part of the way is continually couered with deepe Snow by no meanes <note place="margin">Wild Beasts like vnto Stags called Rangeferi.</note> passable, vnlesse it be vpon Beasts like vnto Stags, called <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gifery,</hi> so abounding in those Regions that many doe nourish and tame them. Their lightnes (though it seeme incredible) is such, that they runne vpon the frozen Snow vnto the top of high hills, &amp; downe againe into the deepe Valleyes. Iohn Saxon saith, that there was a King of Swethland called Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therus, <note place="margin">Hatherus King of Swethland.</note> who being aduertised that there dwelt in a Valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene those mountaines a Satire called Memingus, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed infinite riches, with many other resolute men in his company, all mounted vpon Rangifers &amp; domesticall Ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres, made a Roade into his Valley, and returned laden with <note place="margin">Wild Asses.</note> rich and inestimable spoiles.</p>

               <p>The Author expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it not, but by that which he saith a little after, that in that Country are many Satires &amp; Faunes; we may gather that hee was a right Satire, and that the Satires are men of reason, and not vnreasonable creatures, according to our disputation the other day: and in a Country full of such nouelties, such a thing as this, is not to be wondred at. But returning to our commenced purpose, I say that this superiour Byarmya of
<pb facs="tcp:19072:135"/>
which Olaus Magnus speaketh, to vs so vnknowne, by all likelyhoode should be that blessed soile mentioned by Pliny, Soline, &amp; Pomponius Mela, whose Clymate is so temperate, whose ayre so wholesome, and whose enhabitants doe liue so long, that they willingly receaue death by casting themselues into the Sea; of which Land being so meruailous, and being as it seemeth seated on the farther side of the Pole, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not so particulerly knowne, and so he saith, that there are many strange people, nouelties, and wonders: But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this, &amp; comming to the lower, Olaus saith, that the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes <note place="margin">The lower Byarmya.</note> thereof, if they were sowed, are very apt and ready to bring foorth fruite, but the enhabitants doe not giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to tillage, because the fieldes and Forrests are repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with Beasts, &amp; the Riuers with Fishes, so that with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and fishing they maintaine their lyues, hauing no vse of bread, neyther scarcely knowledge thereof. When they are at warre or difference with any of their neighbours, they sildom vse Armes, for they are so great Negromancers &amp; Enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that with wordes onely when they list they will make it <note place="margin">In steede of Armes, they vse Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> raine, thunder, and lighten, so impetuously, as though heauen and earth should goe together; and with their Witchcraftes and Charmes they binde and entangle men in such sort, that they bereaue them of all power to doe them any harme, yea, and many times of their sences also and lyues making them to dye mad. Iohn Saxon writeth, that there was once a King of Denmarke called Rogumer, who purposing to subdue the <note place="margin">Rogumer King of Denmark.</note> Byarmyans, went against them with a mighty and puissant Army, which they vnderstanding, had recourse to no other defence then to their Enchantments, raising such terrible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, winds, and waters, that through the violent fury thereof, the Riuers ouerflowed and became vnpassable; vpon which of a sodaine they caused such an vnkindly heat, that the King and all his Army were fryed almost to death, so that the same was farre more greeuous to suffer then the cold, and through the distemperature and corruption thereof, there ensued such a mortality, that the King was forced to returne: but he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that this happened, not through the nature of the Land, but through coniuration and sorcerie, came vpon them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19072:135"/>
time so sodainly, that hee was amongst them before they heard any newes of his comming: yet vniting themselues so well as time permitted them, with the ayde of theyr neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, arming themselues with bowes and arrowes, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fighting, and retiring with incredible swiftnes through the Snowes, they disconfited the King and chased him away, who in his dayes was accounted a puissant Prince, and had triumphed of many warlike Nations. Comming out of these Prouinces of Byarmya, there is presently another which hee calleth Fynlande, of which a great part was according to the Author before named in times past, subiect to the King of <note place="margin">Finmarchia or Finlande.</note> Norway. This Land, though very colde, yet is in some parts laboured, and yeeldeth fruites of all sorts vnto the enhabitants, who are in proportion of body mighty and strong, and in fight agaynst theyr Enemies of great valour and courage. Though the ayre be cold, yet it is pure and well tempered, in so much that their fishes cutte vp onely, and laide in the ayre, doe endure many dayes without corrupting: In Sommer it rayneth with them very sildome or neuer; theyr day is so long, that it continueth from the Kalendes of Aprill, till the sixth of the Ides of September, which is more then fiue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and the night againe as much: the darknes of which is neuer so great, but that you may well see to reade a Letter in the same: it is distant from the Aequinoctiall in threescore degrees: There are no starres seene from the beginning of May, till the beginning of August, but onely the Moone which goeth wheeling round about a little aboue the earth, resembling a great Oake, burning and casting out beames of fire, with a brightnesse somewhat dimme and troubled, in such sort, that it causeth great admiration and astonishment to those that neuer sawe it before: and which is more, hee sayeth, that shee giueth them so light the most part of theyr night, though it continue so long: and as for that little time in vvhich shee hideth herselfe, the brightnesse of the starres is so radyant, that they haue lyttle misse of the Moone, vvhich starre-light, at such time as the Moone shyneth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh them, whose brightnesse is the cause that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not, though I cannot but beleeue that they appeare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb facs="tcp:19072:136"/>
somewhat, though not so cleerely at one time as at an other, seeing in these our Countries we see them shine neere the Moone, though she be at full, yea, and sometimes at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day we see starres very neere the Sunne.</p>

               <p>It is likely that it should be as you say in Byarmya and those other vnknown Countries which are vnder the Pole or neere there abouts: and it may be inferred also that the dayes goe encreasing and decreasing, till they come to the full length of a halfe yeere; for being in this part of fiue moneths, they are in some places more and some lesse, and seeing it is enhabitable as you say, where it endureth fiue moneths, it cannot but be better where it is of foure, and better then that, of three, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of two and one, whereby there is no doubt to be made, but that the whole Land is enhabitable.</p>

As touching the Moone, and the manner in which she lightneth those Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I haue not seene any Author that handleth the same but onely Olaus Magnus, though by good reason it seemeth, that where the Sunne turneth about the heauens in course and compasse so different from that which hee doth with vs, the Moone should doe the like in such sort as wee haue sayde.</p>

               <p>You say true, it hapneth so heere indeede oftentimes, but you must consider that the force of nature is great, which where she createth those things that are most full of difficulty, there also createth and ordaineth she remedies and defences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as you may before haue vnderstood by the words of Iohn Zyglere: but I will giue you another reason, then the which in my iudgement nothing can be more euident and plaine, which is, that to all things the same is proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in which they are bred and brought vp: As for example, a man who from his child-hood is accustomed to eate some things that are venomous afterwards though he eate them in great quantitie, they hurt him not at all; and of this I haue seene the experience my selfe: in the like sort a man brought vp in the cold, the greater he waxeth, the lesse he feeleth the inconuenience thereof, so that it commeth in time to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vnto him, euen as to the fish to liue in water, the Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to nourish himselfe in the fire, and the Camelion to maintaine himselfe onely by ayre. And euen as a Moore of Guyney, should hardly fashion his body to endure the colde <note place="margin">Things to which men are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med becom naturall vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in time.</note> of these Northeren Landes, so likewise one of these men brought into a hote Country, would finde as great difficultie in enduring the heat. Besides this, Nature hath framed the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these Regions more sturdie and strong, and against the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the weather ordained them warme Caues vnder the earth, to harbour themselues in. They haue wilde beastes in great quantitie whom they kill, of whose skinnes they make them garments, turning the hairie side inward. Their woods and Forrests are many and great, so that in euery place they haue store of fuell to make great fires, in fine, they vvant no defensiuenes against the cold, which is so far from annoying them, that they liue in better health, &amp; many more yeeres then we doe, for their ayres are delicate &amp; pure, &amp; preserue them from diseases, making theyr complexions more robust and

               <p>I stande considering with my selfe the great and lothsome tediousnesse, that mee thinks those Countrymen should sustaine through the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risom length of their nights, which in my opinion were alone sufficient to make them wearie of their liues.</p>

While theyr day endureth, they sowe and gather in their fruites, of which the most part, the earth plentifullie affordeth them without labour. A great part of that season they spende in chasing of wilde Beastes, whose fleshe they powder with salt, and preserue as wee doe, and their fish in like sort: or else they dry the same in the ayre as I said before: neither are their nights such or so darke, but that they may hunt and fish in them. Against cold they haue as I said deepe Caues, great store of wood, and warme furres in great plentie, when light fayleth them, they haue Oyle of Fishes, and fatte of Beastes, of which they make Lampes and Candles, and withall, they haue a kinde of wood contayning in it a sort of Rozen, which beeing cleft in splinters, they doe vse in steed of Candles, and besides this as I haue sayd before, the nights are during the time of theyr continuance so light, that they may see to doe their busines &amp; affayres in them, for the Moone and perticuler starres shine in those Regions, and the Sunne leaueth alwayes behind him a glimmering or kind of light, in so much, that Encisus speaking of these Landes in his Cosmographie, sayeth, that there is in them a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or Clyffe so high, that hovve lowe soeuer the Sunne discende vvhen hee goeth from them to the Pole Antartick, the toppe thereof alwayes retayneth a light and brightnesse with vvhich through the exceeding height thereof it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipateth.</p>

               <p>All may be possible, but let vs returne thether whence we came, I say therfore that seeing Nature hath endued this people with the vse of reason, assure your selfe that they want not manner and meanes to seeke out such things. as are necessarie for the sustentation and maintenaunce of their liues, yea perchance with greater subtiltie and industry then we thinke for, neither want they discretion to deuide their times to eate, drinke, and sleepe at an howre, to minister iustice, and to maintaine their Lawes, and to make their alliances &amp; confederations, for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they haue warres and dissentions one with another, it is to be thought, that either partie will seeke to founde theyr cause vpon reason, &amp; procure to haue Chiefes and Leaders to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they obey: and if that which the Auncients say be false, that they shoulde be Gentiles, and that theyr cheefest God whom they adore should be Apollo, then it is likely that they lyue <note place="margin">There is nowe no known part of the world out of which the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cien feyned Gods is not banished.</note> by the Law of Nature: for in this time of ours there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowne part in the world, out of which this adoration of auncient Gods is not banished, at least that manner of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them which the old Gentiles obserued.

Apollonius disporting himselfe one day in the fieldes vnder the shadow of certaine trees, as wee doe at this present, there setled ouer his head a Sparrow, chirping and chyttering to other Sparrowes that were vpon the same trees, the which altogether beganne to make a great chyrping &amp; a noyse, and <note place="margin">A pretty iest.</note> to take theyr flight speedilie towards the Cittie, whereupon, Apollonius bursting into a great laughter, and beeing by his companions earnestly intreated to declare the cause thereof vnto them, he saide, that the same Sparrow that came alone, had brought newes to the rest, that a Myller comming on the high way towardes the Towne with a burden of Corne charged vppon his Asses backe, had by chaunce let one of his sackes fall, the stringes whereof breaking, the Corne fell out, which the Myller coulde not so cleane scrape vp and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together againe, but that a great deale thereof remayned tumbled in the dust, which was the cause of the great myrth that the other byrdes demeaned, who in thanking him for his good newes, flewe away with hym to eate theyr part of the same Corne. His companions hearing this, smyled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, thinking it to be but a iest, till in returning to the Towne, they found the place where the sack had been broken, &amp; the Sparrowes scraping verie busilie about the same.</p>

               <p>I would that I were therein so instructed, that I could entreate so particulerly and plainly thereof, as it were requisite I should: but though the fault be mine, in that I vnderstande little, yet I want not an excuse where-with to wipe away some part of the blame: For the great confusion of the Authors both Auncient &amp; Moderne that write thereof, as yesterday you vnderstoode is such, that it maketh me also confuse and wauering, in whether of theyr opinions I should follow. Trust me it is a world to see theyr disagreements, and he had neede of a very Diuine iudgment, <note place="margin">The disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of writers tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the description &amp; situation of Countries</note> that should conforme himselfe to the vnderstanding of Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomaeus, Solinus, Stephanus, Dyonisius, Rufus, Festus, Auie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Herodotus, Plinius, Anselmus, Strabo, Mela, and diuers other of the Auncients, some of the which in reckoning vp of Nations and Prouinces, name onely one, saying forth others aboue this and others aboue that beyond, of the one side and of the other: some declare the names particulerly of each one, but in such sort, that comparing them with these by which we now know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are not to be discerned which are which, for with great difficulty can we know who are the right Getes, Massagetes, Numades, Scythians, and Sarmates, but onely that we goe gessing according to the names which they now haue; for there are Authors that giue to the Land of the Scithians onely 75. leagues of widenes, and others will <note place="margin">Diuersity of writers tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Scithians.</note> needs haue the most part of all those great Countries North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be contained vnder them, so that Pliny not without cause, speaking of these Septentrionall parts, termeth them to be so vast and of so farre a reach, that they may be accounted an other new part of the world, yet he then knew nothing of the interiour part thereof towards the Pole which is now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. But leauing this, there is no lesse difficulty and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the description of those parts which we now know and vnderstand, yea, euen those which are neere vs, and with
<pb facs="tcp:19072:141"/>
whom we haue traffique, as Norway, Denmarke, Gothland, Sweueland, and the Prouinces which we call Russia &amp; Prus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, of which they write so intricatly, especially in some points, that they hardly giue resolution to those that reade them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which difficulties, seeing there is no part of the world in which there are not some thinges, though to them common, yet rare and strange to those that haue not seene them, but newly heare them spoken of; I will tell you some particularities recorded by the Authors, that make mention of these Regions, with which we may passe in good conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation this euening, as we haue done the rest. And first to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with their men, they say that they are of great stature, their lims &amp; members wel proportioned, and their faces beautiful: Amongst which, there are many Gyants of incredible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which as you enter farther into the Lande, so shall you <note place="margin">Sundry Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull force &amp; puissance.</note> finde them greater. Of these make mention Saxo Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, and Olaus Magnus, chiefely of one called Hartenus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Starchater, and two others, Angrame, and Aruedor, who were endued with so extraordinary a force &amp; puissance, that to carry an Oxe or a Horse vpon their shoulders, though the way were very long, they accounted nothing. There are also women nothing inferiour to them in strength, some of which haue beene seene, with one hand take a Horse with a man Armed vpon his back, and to lift him vp, and throw him downe to the ground: and of these and others sundry Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors write many notable thinges worthy of memory, which seruing nothing to our purpose, it were in vaine heere to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse. Leauing them therefore, I say that the continuance of the Snow in all these Septentrionall Lands is such, that the high eminent places and toppes of mountaines, are couered there-with all the yeere long, and many times the valleyes and low places also, notwithstanding all which extreamity of cold they haue very good pastures, both for Beasts wild and tame; for theyr fodder and grasse is of such quality, that the very cold nourisheth and augmenteth the force &amp; verdure therof: The greatest disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity they haue, is through the wind <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> which the greater part of the yere blustreth in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, <note place="margin">North, North-we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne wind.</note> and that with such raging fury &amp; violence, that it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

vp the trees by the rootes, and whirleth whole heapes of stones from vp the earth into the ayre, wherby those that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, are often in great danger of their liues; the remedy they haue, is to hide &amp; shroud themselues in caues &amp; hollow vauts vnder the mountains; for somtimes the tempests are so incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly raging &amp; terrible, that there haue ben ships in the Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyk <note place="margin">The strange violence of the tempests in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> Sea, (which though it be neere the frozen Sea, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding is nauigable) hoised vp into the ayre, &amp; thrown down violently against the maine Land; a matter scarsly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, but that it is verified by so many &amp; so graue Authors; at other times you shall see waues of the Sea resembling mighty mountains raised in height, &amp; then with their fal, drowne and ouerwhelme such ships as are neere; somtimes the tiles, yea, &amp; the whole roofs of the house taken away &amp; blown far off; &amp; which is more, the roofs of their churches couered with Lead &amp; other mettals, haue ben torn vp &amp; caried away, as smoothly as though they had been but feathers: neither haue men Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and a Horseback more force to resist the violence of this wind, then hath a light reed, for either it ouerthroweth them, or else perforce driueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against some hillock or Rock; so that in diuers places of Norway which lie subiest to this wind, there grow &amp; encrease no trees at all, for they are straight tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp by the roots. For want of wood they make fire of the bones of certaine fishes, which they take in great quantity: the bleetenes of this wind (for sildome in those parts bloweth any other) is cause that the most part of the yere, the Riuers, ponds, &amp; Lakes are all frozen, yea, &amp; the very waters of the Springs doe no sooner com out of them, but they are presently conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into Ice, &amp; when the heat of the Sun thaweth or melteth any Snow, the same presently turneth into so hard an Ice ouer that which is vnderneath, that they can scarcely pearce it with Pickaxes; so that euery yeere their yong men in plaine fields make thick wals of snow, like vnto those of a Fortresse, in som such place that they may receaue the heat of the Sun, melting through which, they conuert into a hard Christaline Rock of <note place="margin">Certaine warlike pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes that their young men vse.</note> Ice; and sometimes of purpose after they haue framed this edifice of snow, they cast water vppon the same to make it freeze and become more hard and cleare: vsing the same in
<pb facs="tcp:19072:142"/>
certaine warlike pastimes they haue, in steede of a Castell of lyme or stone, one troupe entereth there-into to defende the same, and another bideth without to besiege, assault, or surprize it, and this in most solemne sort with all engines, stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and manners of vvarfare, great prices being ordained for those that shall obtayne the conquest: besides, the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph wherein the conquerours doe glory ouer the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Who so amongst them is found to be fearefull, or not forward in executing that which he is commaunded, is by his companions stuft full of Snow vnder his garments, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tumbled starke naked in great heapes of the same, enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them therby better to abide hardnes another time. These Septentrionall Lands haue many Lakes and standing waters of great largenes, som of the which are a hundred miles long. These are at somtimes so frozen, that they trauaile ouer them both a foote and horsebacke: In the Countries of East and Westgothland, there are Lakes vpon which great troupes of horsmen meete and runne for wagers, their horses are in such <note place="margin">Troupes of horsemen skirmishing and fighting vpon frozen Lakes.</note> sort shod, that they sildome slide or fall in time of warre, they skirmish often vpon these frozen Lakes, yea, and sometimes fight maine battailes vpon them. At sundry seasons they hold vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them also certaine Faires, to which there resorteth a great concourse of strange Nations, the beginning of which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome was ordained, as saith Iohn Archbishoppe of Vpsala, Predicessour to Olaus, by a Queene of Swethland, called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, who being a woman of great wisedome, commaunded her <note place="margin">Disa queene of Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> Subiects on a certaine yeere in which her dominions were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with extreame dearth &amp; scarsity of graines, to goe vnto the bordering Regions, carrying with them such merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize as their Country yeelded, and to bring with them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change thereof Corne and graine, &amp; withall to publish fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize to all such as should bring thither any victual to be sold, where-vpon many strangers repairing thither at such time and season as the Lake was frozen, she appointed them that place, for holding of their Faire, from which time till this day that custome hath continued. Northward of these Regions there are many great and meruailous Lakes, such as scarcely the like are to be found in any other part of the world that is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19072:142"/>
peopled: of which leauing apart one that is neere the Pole, &amp; is called the white Lake, which is in maner an other Caspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">The white Lake.</note> Sea, yeelding great commodities of fowle and fish to the adioyning Prouinces, part of the same reaching out euen to the Muscouites. There are in the Regions of Bothnia, Lakes of 300. &amp; 400. miles long, where there is such quantity of fish taken, that if they could conueniently be carried about, they would serue for prouision to halfe the world: Thereby also are many other notable Lakes, of which the three most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, are as the Authors write, Vener, Meler, and Veher. Vener containeth in length 130. miles, which are about 44. <note place="margin">The Lake Vener.</note> leagues, &amp; as much in breadth within it, it hath sundry Ilands well peopled with Citties, Townes, and Fortresses, Churches, and Monasteries: for all those three Lakes are in Country of Christians, though we haue heere little notice of them: Into this Lake enter 24. deepe Riuers, all which haue but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly issue, which maketh so terrible a noyse amongst certayne Rocks, falling from one to another, that it is heard by night six or seauen leagues of, making deafe those that dwell neere there abouts, so that it is sayd there are certaine little Villages and Cottages thereby, the enhabitants of which are all deafe. They call the issue of these Riuers in their Country language <hi>Frolletta,</hi> which is as much to say, as the deuils head. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Lake called Meler, is betweene Gothland and Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <note place="margin">The Lake Meler.</note> hath in the shore thereof many mynerals of mettals both of siluer and others, the treasures gathered out of which, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth greatly the Kinges of those Countries. The third also called Veher, aboundeth in mines on the North side <note place="margin">Zhe Lake Veher.</note> thereof: The waters thereof are so pure &amp; cleare, that casting there-into an egge or a white stone, you may see it lye in the bottome, though it be very deep, as well as though there were no water betweene. Within this Lake are many peopled I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, in one of which wherin are two great Parish Churches, Olaus writeth, that there happened a thing very meruailous and strange. There liued in this Iland, saith hee, a man called Catyllus, so famous in the Art of Negromancie, that in the <note place="margin">A strange History of a Negroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</note> whole worlde his like was scarcely to be found: Hee had a Scholler called Gilbertus, whom hee had in that wicked Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:19072:143"/>
so deepely instructed, that hee dared so farre presume as to contend with him being his Maister, yea, and in som things seeme to surpasse him, at which shamelesse ingratitude of his, Catyllus taking great indignation, (as alwayes Maisters vse to reserue vnto themselues certaine secrete points) with onely wordes and charmes, without other band, fetter, or prison, he bound him in an instant, both body, hands, and feete, in such sort, that he could not wag himselfe, in which plight he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed him into a deepe Caue vnder one of the Churches of the same Iland, where he remaineth till this day, &amp; according to the common opinion, is alwayes liuing. Thither vsed dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to resort many, not only of that Country people, but stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers also to see him, and to demaund questions of him. They entred with many Torches and Lanternes, and with a clew of threed, of which they fasten one end to the dore whereat they enter, vnwiding the same still as they goe, for the better assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of finding their way out, the Caue being full of many deepe pits, crooked turnings and corners. But at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the moisture &amp; dampish cold thereof, with a lothsome stench besides, anoyed so much those that entred, that some of them came out halfe dead; they made a law, that on greeuous paine, none of the Countrimen should fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time forward resort nor enter into that Caue, neither giue counsaile, aide, or assistance to strangers, which for curiosities sake shold atempt the same.</p>

To such as sailed to their country for traffiques sake, and had the wind contrary at their departure, they vsed to sell for mony or merchandize such &amp; so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious wind as they themselues desired. They vsed to knit in a cord three knots, of which vndoing the one, there followed presently a moderate wind, out of what Coast so euer they desired, vndoing the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the wind began to bluster somwhat more furiously; but vpon the losing of the third, there arose such raging stormes and tempests, that the shippes miscaried oftentimes and were drowned: And therfore such strangers as traffiqued thither, procured to entertaine friendship with them, imagining their happy and vnhappy successe, the raging and calmenes of the Sea, to be at their pleasure and disposition: for in this the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils were to them in great subiection and obedience. Besides, when any man desired to know news fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forraine parts, there were amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers that would vndertake to giue them true aduertisements, of such things as they required to know, being wel paid for their paines. They enclosed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues into a chamber, taking with them their wiues, or som other person who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they especially trusted, &amp; then smiting vpon a figure of mettall which they kept, made in fashion of a Toade or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, after whispering some words, &amp; making certaine signes, they fell downe groueling on the ground in a traunce, most straightly charging and enioyning him or her that stoode by, to take great heed, that no flye, vermine, or beast, should touch them while they so continued: Returning to themselues, they
<pb facs="tcp:19072:144"/>
aunswered to such thinges as they were enquired of so truly, that they were neuer found to be false in any one point: And this they publiquely vsed, till they receaued the faith of our Sauior Christ; since which, if they vse the same it is with great secrecie, and most seuerely punished if it be knowne. There are as yet in certaine Prouinces that confine vpon them, and are somewhat neerer vnto vs, many notable Negromancers, famous by the writing of many Authors. Amongst the rest, there was euen almost in our time Henry king of Swethland, <note place="margin">Henry King of Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancer.</note> who had the deuils so ready and obedient at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he caused presently the wind to turne and change into what part so euer hee pointed with his cap, in so much, that of the common people, he was called by no other name then Windy Bonet. He had a Sonne in lawe called Reyner, <note place="margin">Reyner King of Denmark.</note> King of Denmarke, who conquered on the Sea coast many Countries by force of Armes, neuer at any time hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wind, when hee went to Seaward, beeing therein by his Father in law alwayes assisted, to whom hee succeeded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards also in the Kingdome of Swethland. Many write of a woman called Agaberta, daughter of a Gyant in those Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentrionall <note place="margin">Agaberta a notable Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceresse.</note> Lands, whose name was Vagonostus, that she was so skilfull in Negromancie, that she sildome suffered her selfe to be seene in her proper figure; somtimes she would resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an old withered wrinkled Crone, sometimes a most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and goodly Mayden, somtimes she would seeme so fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and faint, and yellow of colour, as though shee had beene consumed with a long and languishing Ague: another time she would be so high, that her head should seeme to reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the clouds, changing when she listed with such facility her shape, as did Vrgand the vnknown, of which old fables make such mention, the strange force of her enchauntments was such, that she could darken the Sun, Moone, &amp; Starres, leuell high Mountaines, and make plaine champaine of sauage De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, pull trees vp by the rootes, and dry vp running Riuers, with many the like, as though shee had had all the deuills of hell ready at a beck to fulfill her commaundements. The like is written of an other called Grace of Norway. Yffrotus the <note place="margin">Grace of Norway.</note> mighty King of Gothland and Swethland, walking for recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19072:144"/>
along the Sea-shore, was runne at by a Cow, and hurt <note place="margin">Ifrotus K. of Gothland, slaine by a Witch.</note> with her hornes in such sort, that hee died presently vpon the same: afterward it came to be knowne and proued, that the same Cowe was a Witch disguised in that forme, which for some griefe conceaued against the King, had vsed that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge <note place="margin">Hollerus a Negroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</note> vpon him. There was one called Hollerus, so incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly surpassing the rest in this detestable Science, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people supposed him to be more then a mortall man, &amp; honoured him as a God, though at length they founde theyr error, for notwithstanding his fained immortalitie, his heade was cut off, and his body torne in peeces by his enemies: for commonly the deuill though hee helpe them for a while, yet euer in the end he leaueth them in the myre. Othinus, which <note place="margin">Othinus by his Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the K of Denmark to the Crowne,</note> was held for one of the greatest Negromancers that euer was, brought Hadignus king of Denmark to his kingdom out of farre Countries into which he was banished, on horsebacke, or rather on the deuils backe behind him, through thicke and thinne, yea, and ouer the Sea it selfe, bringing it by his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntments so to passe, that the King was receaued &amp; esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in his gouernment: afterwardes, in a battaile against Haruinus King of Norway, he caused such a clowdie showre of hayle to strike on the face of his enemies, that not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the violence thereof, and beeing on the other side furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously charged by the Danes, they turned theyr backs &amp; were discomfited. But it were time lost to entreate any farder of this people, beeing the deuils disciples, dwelling and dailie dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling so familiarly with them. There are amongst them often seene visions and Spirits, deluding those that trauaile, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to them in likenes of some of theyr knowne friends, and suddainly vanishing away, so that the deuill seemeth to haue in those Septentrionall Countries, greater dominion &amp; more libertie then in other parts.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19072:145"/>
trees, so thicke and high, that a farre of they seeme to touch the Clowdes. There is within the same continually hearde so great &amp; hideous a noyse, that no man dareth to approch neer it by three or foure leagues. The shyppes keepe alwayes a loofe of, fearing and flying that Coast as death it selfe. There is seene amongst those trees such an abundance of great black fowles, that they seeme in a manner to couer them, who ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vp into the ayre doe make so great a clowde, that they obscure in a manner the cleerenesse of the Sunne, theyr cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or rather roring, is so horrible and fearefull, that such as heare them, though verie farre of, are constrayned to stoppe theyr eares.

               <p>These are matters, the secrecie of whose causes are not to be sifted out, like vnto that of the Mountaines of Angernamia, one of the farthest of those Northerne Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">A strange noyse heard in certaine mountaines of Anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namia.</note> which are so high, that they are seene a farre of by those that sayle on the Bothnycke Sea, and by them with great care and diligence auoyded, through a wonderfull secret in them contayned, which causeth a noyse so hideous, violent, feareful, and full of astonishment, that it is heard many leagues of, and if that by force of tempest driuen, or otherwise through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce vnwitting, any ship passeth neere thereunto, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror thereof is so great, that many die presently: through the penetrating sharpnes, and vntollerable violence of the same, many remaine euer after deafe, or diseased, and out of theyr wits. Neyther are they that trauaile by Land, lesse carefull in auoyding these Mountaines. Once certaine young men of great courage, beeing curious to discouer the cause heereof, stopping theyr eares as artificially as they coulde deuise, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in little Boates to rowe neere these mountaines, and to view the particularities of them, but they all perrished in

that attempt, by theyr desastre leauing an example and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to others, not to hazard themselues in like danger. That which we may hereafter imagine is, that there are some clefts or Caues within the Rocks of these Mountaines, and that the flowing and ebbing of the water, striuing with the wind, and hauing no aspyration out, causeth that fearefull rumbling and hideous noyse; and this is vnderstood, because the greater the tempest is at Sea, the greater is the noyse in those Mountains, the same being in calme and milde weather nothing so loude and violent.

the shoare, which was about halfe a league of. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his seruaunts being a good space farder inwards vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lake, imagined the poore man to be some theefe that had stolne this Cattell, and the cause of his running away, to be the feare he had of being discouered by him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: and therefore putting spurres to their horses, galopt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, as fast as they coulde to take him.

For in Frize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Denmarke, and other cold Countries also, both men and women doe vse much to trauaile on the Ice, though after a different sort: for they weare in the soles of their shooes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine plaine Irons, with a point turning vp forward, they call them Schouerdins, and with these in short space slyding vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Ice, they transport themselues very farre: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth them to be skilfull in their Art, or otherwise they fall very often.

               <p>It is most true, and as I said before, chiefely those of Fylandia, haue fame to excell in agility and lightnes. When they are to passe ouer the Snow, they bind vnder their

               <p>They haue also an easier kinde of artifice to trauaile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Snow, much like vnto those slide-Wagons of which <note place="margin">Rangifer is a Beast in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner like vnto a Stagge.</note> wee spake before, to drawing of which, in steede of Horses they vse Rangifers: then the which there is no one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them of greater vtility and profit. They are about the bignes of a Horse, or little lesse, in fashion, making, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, they are like vnto Stagges; they haue on their heads three hornes, two like vnto those of a Stag, with many points, branches, and brow-antlers, &amp; betweene them two, one som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lesse, hauing also many braunches, some of the which are round and clouen, their backe is somwhat hollow, so that the saddle is very sure and fast vppon them, for they are in steede of Horses to those peoples. When they put them in Coaches, Carts, or Wagons, besides the ordinary gyrths and peutrals, comming ouer their breast and belly, they tye one fast to the little horne in the midst, which causeth them to drawe with greater force. They are wonderfully light and swift, insomuch that when neede requireth, they trauaile twenty leagues in a day. They tread so light, that you can scarcely see any tracke of their feete, so that when the Snowe is any thing frozen, the enhabitants feare not to passe vppon their backes ouer any place, howe deepe so euer it be. They knowe by experience at what time they may aduenture this dangerous kinde of ryding with security, by the stifnesse of the Snowe. Commonly they are drawne by these Rangifers in such slide-Wagons, as I spake of before; and if they see themselues in any daunger, presently they vnspanne them, and leaping on theyr backes, doe saue themselues with great facilitie.</p>
               <p>They haue great aboundance of these Beastes, both wild

               <p>Hee was iustly punished according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. But it is not onely of late dayes, that the deuill exerciseth thys Arte among those Nations, for Solinus, Plinie, Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Mela, and many other learned Authours, in theyr wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings make mention thereof. But leauing thys, seeing it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth so well to our purpose of VVoules, I will tell you what a man of verie good credite tolde mee not long since, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the same to haue happened in a Towne on the vtmost boundes of Germanie, vvhich we may also terme to be a land Septentrionall.</p>
               <p>Thys Towne, sayde he, was so neere a great wilde Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ouer-growen vvith Trees and bushes, that of one side the Trees shadowed the Houses. Thys Mountaine vvas so pestred with VVolues, that raging through hunger, they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to come in mightie troupes euen to the very Towne it selfe, though it vvere great and well peopled. Theyr crueltie and fiercenesse was such, that no man dared stirre out of the Towne alone, no nor three or foure together, if they vvent not verie well prouided both of courage and weapons, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they woulde bee torne in peeces, and deuoured of the VVolues. Neyther did the Women and Maydens dare goe <note place="margin">Howe three young men destroyed a number of vvolues that greatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed the towne wher they lyued.</note> vnto the Riuer that ran thereby for vvater without a strong Conuoy of Armed men. Finallie, the domage they dailie receaued was so great, that for theyr last and onelie remedie, they determined to abandon the Towne, and to seeke some other habitation: vvhich theyr deliberation beeing knowne, three young-men amongst the rest of great force and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, determined to put theyr liues in ieopardie, rather then to leaue the place of theyr natiuitie defert, to become the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of vvilde Beastes. VVhereuppon, making each of them a light Armour, complete at all peeces, full of short sharpe gaddes or Bodkins, they Armed themselues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, pulling ouer the same a blacke garment, least other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19072:151"/>
the Wolues might discouer theyr Armour, and so sette forwarde to the Forrest, hauing in each hande a strong sharp poynted ponyard: and least they shoulde breake or leese them, foure others in a readines vnder theyr gyrdles. They vvent not farre a sunder, that they might succour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when neede required.</p>
               <p>They had not so soone endred into the VVood, but they were presently espyed by the VVolues, who very raueningly with open mouth assayling them, they made no semblance of defence, but suffred them freelie to come on: Who vvith open mouth thinking presently to deuoure them, what vvith the sharpe Bodkins on the Armour, vpon which they smote theyr iawes, and the stabbes bestowed vppon them with the ponyards, had quicklic theyr bellies full. In this order they they dispatched very many that day, helping still one another when they were in danger: And continuing the same many dayes together, penetrating daily farder into the mountaine, they made such a slaughter and hauocke of VVolues, that in short space they cleered the vvhole Coast of them, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered theyr towne from desolation.</p>

The hurt he did was so great, that those of the Countrey, with a generall consent, laying dailie wayte to catch him, surprized him one day so by chaunce at vnawares, that they tooke him aliue, and finding him to be a man, they imprisoned him, and afterwards layd him on the torture, but they could wring no matter at all out of him, for all that hee spake was fantastically, like vnto a madde man. Hee vvould eate nothing but rawe flesh, and in the end dyed before hys time of execution.</p>

But leauing this of theyr Wolues, they haue besides manie other beastes both wilde and tame, amongst the which theyr Hares haue a propertie farre different from these of ours, for as the Winter commeth on, and the snowe beginneth to fall, <note place="margin">A strange property of their Hares.</note> they shead all theyr old haire, in place of which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth newe as white as anie Lilly, which as the Sommer approcheth, they change againe, returning to theyr old colour, being the same which ours haue here, wherby it may be inferred, that in those Countries which are farder North, and where the snow is in a maner continuall, the Hares should be alwaies white, though it is doubtfull whether the Snow or the naturall propertie of the Land, causeth this alteration in the colour of theyr hayre. Whensoeuer they are taken in the Winter theyr skinnes are excellent, and accounted to be one of the best Furres that may be.</p>
               <p>There is another mistery also very strange, written by the Historiographers concerning these Hares, which is, that what woman soeuer eateth theyr flesh, during the time of her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, the vpper lippe of the childe of which she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to be deliuered, is in the midst clouen in two with a slitte, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vp to the verie nostrels, for which they vse this remedie. The Midwife or Phisition taketh the brawne of the breast of a Chicken newlie kilde, and layeth it vpon the slitte, and ouer that the warme bloode of the same Chicken, with which it closeth &amp; ioyneth together, though neuer so well but that the marke and token thereof remaineth. There are also in those Countries certaine other Beastes called Gulones, about the greatnes of a Mastiue Curre, proportioned like a Cat, with <note place="margin">Beastes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gulones.</note> long and sharpe clawes, hauing a bushie tayle like a Foxe, vvhose nature is, hauing kilde any Beast, to eate so much as his belly can holde, which beeing swolne so great as though it would euen presentlie burst, hee goeth to the Woode, and seeking out two Trees that growe verie neere together, hee strayneth himselfe betweene them in such sort, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to vomite and cast vp all that which hee had eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thence hee returneth to eate anewe, and thence to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite againe, and so still, till hee haue deuoured the vvhole Beast. The skinne of this Beast is accounted very precious:

In taking him the Hunters vse this pollicy: They lay neere <note place="margin">The maner of taking the Gulones.</note> the place where he vseth, the carkasse of some dead Beast, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in the meane time, til his belly be as full as a tun, within the thickest of some bush, and then they shoote at him with their Crosbowe, otherwise their fiercenes and cruelty, &amp; withall, their swiftnes is such, that they would put the Hunters to great ieopardy, if they should chaunce to descry them while their bellies are empty. They haue also great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tygers, whose skins they apply to many vses chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Tygers.</note> in respect of their exceeding warmth to garments and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlets of beds. Their most esteemed furre is that of Martres, which we heere call Zibellinas, to which also there is an other <note place="margin">Furre of Martres.</note> Beast very like, and little differing; the flesh wherof they eate not, because it is very dry and vnpleasant: their skinnes onely is that which they seeke and hold in estimation.

               <p>But let vs now come to say somwhat of the fishes that are fouud in those parts, seeing of their Beastes we haue sufficiently discoursed. Notwithstanding that we all knowe that the Sea is the Mother of Monsters, and that therein are contained so many kinds and sorts of fishes, as there are Beasts on the earth or Fowles in the ayre: Yet seeing there are some very strange, and of which the Authors &amp; Historiographers make particuler relation, I cannot but say somewhat of them: Amongst the rest there is one to whom for the horrible and
<pb facs="tcp:19072:153"/>
hideous forme thereof, they giue no other name then Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. <note place="margin">A kinde of fish called Monster.</note> His length is commonly fifty cubites, which is but little in comparison of the greatnes and deformity of his proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and members, his head is as great as halfe his body, and round about full of hornes, as great and long or rather more, then those of an Oxe: The greatnes and manner of his eyes is meruailous, for the onely apple is a cubite in length, and as much in breadth, which by night glistereth in such sort, that a farre off it resembleth a flame of fire: His teeth are great &amp; sharpe, his tayle forked, containing from one point to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fifteene cubites, his body full of haires, resembling the wing-feathers of a Goose beeing stript, and his colour is as blacke as any Iet in the world may be: The violence &amp; force of this Monster is such, that with great facility in a trice, hee will ouer-turne the greatest shippe that vsually crosseth those Seas, neither can the resistance of the Marriners, though they be many in number, auaile. The Archbishop of Nydrosia, <note place="margin">Henry Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chendor Archbishop of Nydrosia.</note> and Primate of the Kingdome of Norway, called Henry Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chendor, writing a Letter to Pope Leo the tenth, sent him withall the head of one of these Monsters, which was a long time kept for a wonder in Rome. There are other Sea-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters called Fisiters, no lesse dangerous to those that saile then <note place="margin">Another kinde of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes called Fisiters.</note> the other: their length is commonly 200. cubits, the head and mouth proportionable to the same: The tayle is also forked in the midst, and containeth from one point to another a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth feete, their belly is exceeding great and wide: nosthrils they haue none, but in steede thereof, two deepe open holes aboue the forehead, out of which, they spout out such a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, that shipps haue beene many times through the violent fall thereof, in danger of drowning, vvhich, if that suffice not, they throw halfe their body vpon the sides of the shippe, ouerwhelming it with the waight thereof: neyther is their tayle lesse dangerous with which they giue so mighty a blow, that it is able to smite any ship in peeces. The domage were infinite, that these deformed Monsters would doe, but that it hath pleased God, that a remedy should be found out to preuent their mischiefe: for they flie the sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and the thundering of Artillerie, as death it selfe; and this
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19072:153"/>
is the onely meane which the Marriners doe vse in driuing them away. There was one of these Fisiters found on the way towards India, with which happened a notable chaunce, in this sort. A Galley in which Ruynas Pereyra went for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <note place="margin">A strange miracle.</note> sayling neere the Cape of Bona Speransa, with a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable good winde, and all her sayles out, stoode of a sodaine still, so that the Marriners thought she had stroken a ground, and were in great feare of their liues: But dooing their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to redresse the danger in which they were, they percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Galley to haue water enough, onely that she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned by one of these Fisiters, which had clasped himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her keele, thrusting vp of a sodaine certaine finnes that reached aboue water, euen to the mizzen sayle, vpon which many of them layd their hands, and some would haue striken him with their Iauelins, others would haue shot at him with Muskets, or discharged a peece of Artillery; to neyther of which counsailes the Captaine would by any meanes consent, least through the strugling and tossing of the Monster being wounded, the Galley should be in hazard of drowning. The onely remedy therfore that he had refuge vnto, was to desire the Chaplain of the company to reuest himselfe in his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habite, and with humble Prayers to beseech the Maiestie Diuine, to deliuer them from that imminent danger: In the midst of whose deuotions, it pleased God that the fish by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little vnwound himselfe, and diued downeward into the water, the last that was seene of him was his head, being of an incredible greatnes, out of the holes of which, he launced out so much water and so high, that the same in falling resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a mighty cloude dissolued into rayne; and there-with he went his wayes, those of the ship infinitely praysing God for this their miraculous deliuery. There is also in the West part of this Northerne Sea, a great number of VVhales, which though they be hurtful &amp; of great terror, yet are they nothing so much feared as the others before named. There are of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two kinds, of which the skin of the one is couered with great <note place="margin">Two sorts of Whales.</note> &amp; thick haires: these are far greater then the other, in so much that there haue been of them taken 900. or 1000. foote long: the other whose skinnes are smooth and plaine, are nothing
<pb facs="tcp:19072:154"/>
so great. But seeing there are many of them in this Sea of ours, and their shape and proportion is so well knowne vnto vs, it were time lost to describe particulerly the manner of them. Onely I will tell you what Olaus Magnus writeth, of one taken in those Countries, which seemeth a thing if not <note place="margin">A Whale of admirable greatnes.</note> incredible yet passing admirable, the which is, that his eyes were so great, that twenty men sitting within the circle of one of them, did scarcely fill it vp: according to which, the other parts of his body carried full prorortion and conformity. The greatest enemy they haue, and of greatest courage in daring to assaile them, and by whom they are many times conquered and slaine, is a fish called Orca, though not great and huge, <note place="margin">The fish cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Orca, is enemy to the Whale.</note> yet passing fierce and cruel, and extreamely swift and nimble; his teeth are long and sharpe as Sizers, with which comming vnder the Whale, being heauy and sluggish, he rippeth vp his belly. Of all others, this fish the Whale dareth not abide, and oftentimes in flying him, lighteth amongst shallows &amp; sands, where being not able to swim for want of water, he is slaine of the fishers: of whom great numbers comming in small boats, strike him with hookes, giuing him alwayes the lyne at will, till they perceaue that hee is dead, and then they pull him a Land, and make great commodity of the oyle &amp; other things which they take out of his body. Many doe affirme a thing, which in my opinion seemeth hard to beleeue, which is, that the great Whales when the weather is any thing tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, plunge themselues with such violence from out the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, that their back appeareth aboue water like an Iland of sand or grauell: insomuch that some sayling by Sea, imagining the same many times to be an Iland in deede, haue <note place="margin">A strange thing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Whale.</note> gone out of their ships, &amp; made fire vpon it, through the heat of which, the Whale plunging himselfe into the water, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the men deceaued, and in extreame great perril of death, vnlesse they could saue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by swimming to their ships. This is written by many Authors of great estimation, though to mee it seemeth a thing incredible, and against all reason.</p>

Sea fishes called <hi>Rayas,</hi> of exceeding greatnes, whose loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Rayas.</note> men is passing strange and admirable: for if any man chance to fall into the sea, neere where any of them is, hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derproppeth him presently, bearing him aboue the water, and if any other fishes com to anoy or hurt him, he defendeth him as much as he may, euen to the death. There is also another called <hi>Rosmarus,</hi> whose propertie is very rare and strange, he is about the bignes of an Elephant, he is headed in maner like <note place="margin">Rosmarus.</note> an Oxe, his skin is of darke &amp; obscure colour full of stubbie haires, as great as wheaten strawes, he commeth often a shore, where chauncing to see a man any thing neere, he runneth at him with open mouth, and if he catch him, hee dismembreth him presently. Hee is meruailous swift, &amp; delighteth much to eate grasse and sedge that groweth in freshe water, for which cause hee haunteth often to little riuers &amp; plashes that are on maine land, wherewith when he is well satisfied and filled, he climeth vp the Rocks by the help of his teeth, which are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing sharp &amp; strong, where he layeth him downe to sleepe so deeply &amp; profoundly, that it is not possible with any rumour how great soeuer it be, to awake him: at which time the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners <note place="margin">The maner of taking him.</note> &amp; peasants thereabouts, boldly without feare binde great ropes to each part of his body, the other ends of which they fasten vnto trees, if there be any neere, if not, as well as they can to some place of the Rock, and when as they thinke they haue entangled him sure enough, they shoote at him a far of with bowes Crosbowes &amp; Harguebuzes, chiefely at his head. His strength is so great that awaking somtimes &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing himselfe to be wounded, he starteth vp with such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, that he breaketh all the cordes with which he is faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but commonly he hath first his deaths wound, so that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little strugling, hee turneth of the Cliffe downe into the Sea, and dieth incontinent, out of which they draw him with hookes and yrons, dispoyling him cheefely of his bones and teeth, which the Muscouites, Tartarians, &amp; Russians esteeme to be so good and true Iuorie, as the Indians doe that of theyr Elephants.</p>

But to our first purpose, there are also founde in this Seas sundry kindes of fishes, or rather beastes, which liue both by water and land, comming often a shoare to feede in the pastures thereby, bearing the likenesse of Horses, Oxen, Hares, Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, <note place="margin">Sundry fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes like to Horses, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, &amp; &amp;c.</note> Rats, and of sundry other sorts: which after they haue well fedde on the Land, turne backe vnto the Sea againe, the one being in a maner as naturall vnto them as the other.

Domingo, a little after the conquest thereof by the Spaniards. Being in which fresh water, in short <note place="margin">A strangt tale of a Dolphin in S.

The boyes, among other sportes and pastimes they vsed with him, woulde sometimes gette vp vppon his bace, and hee swimme all ouer the Lake with them, without euer dooing harme, or once dyuing vnder the water with any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. One day certaine Spanyards comming to see him, one of them smote him with a pyke staffe which he had in his hand, from which time forward, hee knewe the Spanyards so vvell by theyr garments, that if any one had beene therby when the other people called him, hee woulde not come ashore, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise still continuing with those of the Country his vvonted familiaritie. Hauing thus remained in this Lake a long space, the water vpon a tyme through an extreamitie of raine, rose so high, that the one side of the Lake ouerflowed and brake into the Sea, from which time forward he was seen no more. Thys is written by the Gouernour of the fortresse of that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in a Chronicle which he made.</p>

Leauing them therefore, now I will briefely speake of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine notable Fish coasts from the West of Ireland forwards, winding about towardes the North: For it is a thing notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that many Kingdoms, Regions &amp; Prouinces, haue their prouisions of Fish fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, of which our Spaine can giue good testimonie, the great commodity considered that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth yeerely thereby. To beginne therefore, the farther forth this way that you goe, the greater plenty you shall finde of fishe, many of those Prouinces vsing no other trade, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Merchants bringing into them other necessary thinges in exchange thereof. The chiefest store whereof is founde on the Coast of Bothnia, which deuideth it selfe into three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, <note place="margin">Bothnia deuided into 3. prouinces.</note> East, West, and North-Bothnia. The last whereof is different farre from the other two, for it is a plaine Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine Land, seated as it were in a Valley betweene great and high Mountaines. The ayre thereof is so wholesome, &amp; the Climat so fauourable, that it may be well termed one of the <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the Climat of North Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> most pleasant and delightfull places of the world, for it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hote nor cold, but of so iust a temperature, that it seemeth a thing incredible: the Countries lying about it beeing so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously cold, couered with Snow, &amp; congealed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Ise. The fields of themselues produce all pleasant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of hearbes and fruites. The woods and trees are reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Birdes whose sweet charmes &amp; melodious tunes, breedeth incredible delectation to the hearers: but wherein the greatest excellencie and blessing of this Land consisteth, is that amongst so great a quantitie of Beasts and Fowles, of which the Hilles, Woods, Fieldes, and Valleyes are full, it breedeth not, nourisheth, or maintaineth, not any one that is <note place="margin">It nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or hurtful beast</note> harmefull or venemous, neyther doe such kindes of Fishes as are in the Sea hurtfull, approach theyr shoares, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise abound with Fishes of all sorts, so that it is in the fishers handes to take as many and as few as they list: The cause of which plentie is, as they say, that diuers forts of Fishes flying the colde, come flocking in multitudes into these temperate waters. Neyther bapneth this onely on theyr Sea-shoare, but in theyr Lakes &amp; Riuers within the Land also, which swarme as thicke with fishes great and little of diuers kindes as they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19072:156"/>
can hold. The enhabitants liue very long, neuer or sildome feeling any infirmity, which surely may serue for an argument (seeing it is so approouedly knowne to be true) to confirme that which is written concerning the vpper Byarmya, which <note place="margin">Byarmya su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.</note> though it be seated in the midst of vntemperate &amp; cold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, couered and frozen with continuall Snow and Ice: yet is it selfe so temperate and vnder so fauourable a Climate and constellation, that truly the Authors may well call it as they doe, a happy and blessed soile, whose people hauing within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues all things necessary for the sustentation of humaine life, are so hidden &amp; sequestred from other parts of the world, hauing of themselues euery thing so aboundantly, that they haue no need to traffique or conuerse with forraine Regions. And this I take to be the cause that we haue no better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of some people that liue vppon the Hyperbores, who though they liue not with such pollicy as we doe, it is because the plenty of all thinges giueth them no occasion to sharpe their wits or to be carefull for any thing, so that they leade a simple and rustique life without curiosity, deuoyd of all kind of trouble, care, or trauaile: whereas those who liue in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where for their substentation &amp; maintenance, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to seeke needefull prouisions in forraine Landes, what with care of auoiding dangers, &amp; well dispatching their affaires, and daily practising with diuers dispositions of men, they cannot but becom industrious, pollitique, and cautelous. And hence came it, that in the Kingdome of China there was a Law and statute, prohibiting and defending those that went <note place="margin">A strange Law in the Kingdome of Chinay.</note> to seeke other Countries, euermore to returne into the same, accounting them vnworthy to liue in so pleasant and fertile a soile, that willingly forsooke the same in searching an other. But returning to our purpose, in this North Bothnya, which is beyond Norway, is taken incredible store of fish, which they carry some fresh, some salted, to a Citty called Torna, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in manner of an Iland betweene two great Riuers that discende out of the Septentrionall mountaines, where they hold their Fayre and Staple, many and diuers Nations resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thither, who in exchange of theyr fish, accommodate them with such other prouisions as their Country wanteth;
<pb facs="tcp:19072:157"/>
so that they care not to labour or till their grounds, which if at any time they doe, the fertillity thereof is such, that there is no Country in the worlde able to exceede the same. The people is so iust, that they know not howe to offende or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer iniurie to any man: they obserue with such integrity the Christian fayth, that they haue him in horrour and destenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that committeth a mortall sinne. They are enemies of vice, and louers and embracers of vertue and truth. They correct and chasten with all seuerity and rigour those that are offendours, insomuch, that though a thing bee lost in the streete or field, no man dareth take it vp, till the owner come himselfe.</p>
               <p>There are also other Prouinces maintayned in a manner wholely by fishing, as that of Laponia, in the vvhich, are manie Lakes, both great and little, infinitelie replenished with all sorts of excellent fishes; and that of Fylandia, which is very neere, or to say, better vnder the Pole. The greatest <note place="margin">Filandia.</note> part of this Prouince obeyeth the King of Swethen, vvho hath in the frontyers thereof, one of the best and strongest <note place="margin">Newcastle belonging to the King of Swethen.</note> Castels in the worlde, called Newcastle, which is situated vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a high Rocke, accessible onely of one side, and that with great difficulty. At the foote of this Rocke runneth a great and deepe Riuer, in such sort, that in some places it is hard to sound any bottome, the waters of which, and all the fishes therein are so blacke, that it is therefore called the blacke Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: it discendeth from the Aquilonar mountaynes, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth along through such desert and craggie Landes, that no manne knoweth where the head thereof riseth, onely it is thought, that it commeth out of Lacus Albus, waxing black, by reason of the soile through which it commeth. There is in this Riuer great aboundance of Salmons and of other fishes, of such excellent relish and pleasing tast, that there can in no part of the world be found any better: They serue not onely for prouision to the Country it selfe, but are carried thence into many farre places. Amongst the rest, there is found a <note place="margin">A strange property of the fish Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius.</note> fish called Treuius, which in the Winter is blacke, and in the Sommer white, whose meruailous property is such, that bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him fast with a corde, and letting him downe into the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19072:157"/>
bottome of a Riuer, if there be any gold in the sands thereof, the same cleaueth fast to his skin; which how great soeuer the peeces be, fall not off from him, till they be taken off, so that some vse no other occupation to winne theyr lyuing with, then this. It is sayde for an assured certainty, that sometimes there is openly seene a man goe in the middle of the streame, playing most sweetely vppon an Instrument like a trebble Viall, which at such time as men beholde him with greatest delight, of a sodaine sinketh downe into the water: There are also often heard vppon the shore, Trumpets, Drummes, and other loud Instruments, without seeing those that sound them: vvhich when it happeneth, they holde the same for a signe or presage of some harme or disastre, that is to ensue to some principall person of the gard of this Fortresse, which they haue often found true by experience. But leauing to speake of the great plenty of fish which is in these Countries; Now I will come to say somewhat of the Birdes and Fovvles which are in these parts, of which there are many kinds farre differing from those which we haue heere, &amp; among the rest, some as great or rather greater then Patridges, whose feathers are diuersified with beautifull colours, chiefely white, blacke, and yellow, called Raynbirds, because towardes rayne they <note place="margin">Rainebirds.</note> cry, otherwise holding continually their peace. It is held for a certainty that they liue by the ayre, for being very fatte, they are neuer seene eate at any time, neyther when they kill them doe they finde any sustenance at all in theyr belly or mawe. Theyr flesh is of a very sauourie taste, and much esteemed. There are other Birdes found on the high and rough moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, such as are for the most part continually couered with Snowe, somewhat bigger then Thrushes, which are in the Sommer white, and all the Winter long blacke: Their feete <note place="margin">Snowbirds.</note> neuer change culour, which is a most perfect yellovv. They sleepe and shroude themselues for the most part alwayes in trees: But when they see any Hawke or Fowle that lyueth by pray, they choppe dovvne into the Snovve, fluttering the same ouer them with theyr vvinges, in such sort, that they leaue no part of them vndiscouered, preseruing thereby theyr lyfe. Of all other Fovvles they are hardlyest taken,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:158"/>
they hide themselues so artificially in the Snow, and therefore they call them Snow-birds. Of Falcons there is passing great <note place="margin">Faulcons of diuers sorts.</note> store ouer all these Northerne Countries, and of many sorts. At such time as the day lasteth, the whole Sommer long in those Regions neere the Pole, fewe or none remaine in the bordering Lands, but flie all thither, returning thence againe when the night commeth about. Amongst these, there are certaine white, which pray both on fowles and fishes, which <note place="margin">I take this to be that which wee call heere an Ospray, of which I haue seene diuers.</note> Riuers for their pleasure doe reclaime, taking with them both fish and fowle. Their two feete are of sundry and seuerall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions, the one with long sharpe talents with which they seaze their pray, the other like vnto a Goose, the talents whereof are nothing so long. The Rauens in these Lands are so great and harmfull, that they kill not onely Hares and Fawnes, but also Lambs and Pigs; of which they make so great spoile and destruction, that there are Lawes made, by the which there is a reward appointed to such as shall kill them, so much for the head of euery one. About the Sea shore and Lakes, there are many which they call Sea-Crowes, and of diuers kindes; some are great, and haue sawes in their beakes in manner of <note place="margin">Sea-Crowes</note> teeth, with which they sheare the fishes asunder. Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal foode is Eeles, which if they be not very great, they swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in whole, and many times slice them out againe behind, afore they be fully dead. There is an other sort of them som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat lesse, otherwise of small difference, which in seauen dayes make their nests, and lay their egges, and in other seauen dayes hatch their young-ones. There are other Birdes called Plateae, which are alwaies houering also ouer Lakes &amp; Ponds; they haue mortall warres with the Crowes, and with all other <note place="margin">Plateae.</note> fowles that liue by fish, of which, if they see any haue in his beake or talent any pray, they make him let it goe, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they kill him; for they haue of them a great aduantage through the sharpnes of their beake and talents.</p>
               <p>Of Ducks wilde &amp; tame there is such infinite abundance in these prouinces, that they couer the Lakes and waters, no <note place="margin">Duckes.</note> other foule being any thing neere in so great quantity, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where there are any veynes of warme water, which keepe the Lakes longer without freezing, &amp; where when they doe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19072:158"/>
freeze, yet the Ise is so thin that it may easily be broken. They are of diuers colours and sizes, otherwise all of one making. Certaine Authors which write of these Countries, affirme, that one kinde of these Duckes, is of those which are bred of the leaues of certaine trees in Scotland, which falling into the <note place="margin">Ducks bred of the leaues of a tree in Scotland.</note> water take life, as in manner aboue saide, becomming first a worme, then getting winges and feathers, &amp; at last flying vp into the ayre. Olaus saith, that he hath seene Scottish authors which affirme, that these trees are principally in the Ilandes called Orcades. They affirme also that there are Geese bredde and engendred in the same manner, betweene whom and the <note place="margin">Geese.</note> other there is great difference, both in colour &amp; many other particularities. And seeing this wonder is by the testimonie of so many Authors confirmed, I see no reason but that vvee may well beleeue it without offending: and that also vvhich they write of a towne in the vtmost parts Northward of that Kingdome, the commoditie rising to which through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of Duckes is so great, that I cannot ouerslip the same. There is neere this Towne a mighty great and craggy <note place="margin">A Towne in Scotlande that recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth great commoditie through Duckes.</note> Rocke, to which at breeding time, these Fowles come flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such quantities &amp; troupes, that in the ayre they resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mightie darke clowdes rather then any thing else. The first two or three dayes, they doe nothing else then houer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe, and flie vp and downe about the Rocke, during which time, the people is so still and quiet, that they scarcely styrre out of theyr houses, for feare of fraying them: so that seeing all things silent and still, they settle themselues boldlie, and fill the whole Rock with nests. Their sight is so sharpe and pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that flittering ouer the sea which beateth vpon the same Rock, they see the fish through the water, which incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie plunging themselues into the same, they snappe vp vvith such facilitie, that it is scarcely to be beleeued but of him that hath seene it. Those that dwell neere thereabouts, and know the passages and wayes to get vp into this Rock, do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie sustaine themselues, by the fishe which they finde in the nestes of theyr young ones, but carry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also to other townes to sell. When they perceaue that the young ones are ready to flie, to enioy this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of the fish the longer, they pluck
<pb facs="tcp:19072:159"/>
theyr wings and entertaine them so many dayes (as men vse to doe young ones of Eagles) and then when the ordinarie time approcheth, in which they vse to take theyr flight away, they take and eate them, theyr flesh being very tender, and of good smack. These Ducks differ much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the other sorts, and are neuer seene in that Region, but at such time as they breed, (euen as the Storkes are in Spaine) &amp; though they kill many of them, yet the next yere they neuer faile to come, as many as the rock can hold. Their fat &amp; greace is much estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; applied to many medecines, in which it is founde to be of meruailous operation &amp; vertue. There are ouer al these Northerne Regions many other fowles, farre different from these which we haue heere, the varietie of whose kinds, seeing they haue no notable &amp; perticuler property or vertue, it were in vaine to recite: And though as I said, the Climat be cold, yet there are founde many kindes of Serpents of such as are wont commonly to breede in hote Landes. There are Aspes <note place="margin">Serpents. Aspes.</note> three or foure cubites long, whose poyson is so strong and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, that whosoeuer is bitten by one of them, dieth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the space of foure or fiue howres, if he haue not presentlie such remedy as is requisite, which is Treakle of Venice if they haue it, if not, they stampe a head of Garlick, and mingle the iuyce thereof with olde Beere, giuing it the patient to drinke, and withall stamping another head of Garlicke, they apply it to the place bitten. These Aspes are so cruell and fierce, that in assayling any man, they stretch out theyr head with great fiercenesse, a cubite aboue the earth, and in finding resistance, they dart out of theyr throates an infinite quantitie of poyson and venom, whose pestilent contagion is such, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is touched therewith, swelleth and dyeth as I sayde, if hee be not presently remedied. There are other Serpents called <note place="margin">Hyssers.</note> Hyssers, whose cheefe abyding is among herbes that are hore and dry. They runne exceedingly swiftly, but they are easie to be auoyded, because the noyse and hyssing they make is so great, that they are heard and descried a farre of, and thereby easily shunned and auoyded. They vse to giue a leape tenne or twelue foote high when they cast out theyr venome, the nature of which is such, that if it fall vpon any mens garments
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19072:159"/>
it burneth them like fire, hauing doone which they run pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie away. Theyr poyson representeth to our sight sundry and strange colours.</p>
               <p>There is another kinde of Serpent whom they call Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisbosna, <note place="margin">Amphis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosna.</note> hauing two heads, one in the due place, annother in the tayle, they goe and turne aswell one way as another, &amp; doe appeare &amp; are seene as well in cold weather as in warme. Gaudencius Merula vvryteth, that there are manie of these in Italie and other parts. In the Spring-time, there are found at the feete of Oakes and other trees, many little Serpents, <note place="margin">Serpents that haue a King.</note> which haue a cheefe Ruler or King amongst them, as the Bees haue by whom they are gouerned. Hee is knowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the rest, because hee hath a vvhite crest, which if it happen that he be killed, the whole Armie of them presently breaketh and scattereth.</p>
               <p>All these and many other Serpents, which are there, are so as it were enameled with sundry bright and glistring colours, that they arrest often the eyes of the beholders, as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a most beautifull worke of Nature: neyther doe they onely liue on dry Lande, but there are also of them about the Sea, liuing both within &amp; without the same, feeding vpon fish, nothing lesse hurtfull then the rest: of this kind there is at this present one most notable &amp; of wonderfull greatnes in the prouince of Borgia, which is within the limits of the Kingdome of <note place="margin">A huge and terrible Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the prouince of Borgia.</note> Norway, whose terrible shape, crueltie, and horrour is such, that there were doubt to be made thereof, vnlesse it were by the testimony of many witnesses which haue seene him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. In the place vvhere hee lyueth, are certaine Rockie Mountaines, rough and verie high both Seaward and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, couered in many places with desert thickets and wilde bushes and trees. Heere was bred this horrible, dreadfull, and deformed monster, whose length, according to the gesse of those which haue seene his manner, making and proportion, is aboue two hundred cubites: his breadth from the backe to the bellie, at least 25. from the neck downward to the fourth part of his body, he is full of great haires, at least a cubit long apeece, from thence downeward he is bare and plaine, except his loynes, which are couered with certaine great sharp scales,
<pb facs="tcp:19072:160"/>
or rather shelles: His eyes are so bright and shining, that by night they seeme to be flames of fire, so that by them he is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be discouered a farre off, at such time as hee rangeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade to seeke his pray, which is commonly of Oxen, sheep, Hogges, Stagges, and other Beastes both wilde &amp; tame, such as he can find: but if in the woods and fieldes he cannot light of enough to satisfie his hunger, hee getteth him to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, and there filleth himselfe with such fish as he can catch. If any ships chaunce to approch neere that shore, eyther by tempest or ignorance, he putteth himselfe presently into the water, and maketh amaine at them: hee hath beene seene at times to reare himselfe of an exceeding height aboue the decke, and to take men out of the shippe with his teeth, and to swallow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a liue: a thing truely to be spoken or heard, full of amazement &amp; terror; what is it then to them that find themselues present at a spectacle so fearefull, horrible &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell? And if this Monster were not in such a desert place, farre of from those parts which are by the people enhabited, hee were able to dispeople and bring to desolation the vvhole Country, for yet as it is, those that are neerest, liue in great feare and dread of him.</p>

               <p>But nowe turning to our former discourse, I say it is a thing strange and meruailous, that in so great an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of cold as that of the North, there should breede so many venemous Serpents, the number of which is so great, that the people is with them miserably afflicted, especially the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, whose trade of life being most in the open field, meet with them oftenest; and therfore they neuer goe vnprouided of necessary remedies, to apply presently when neede requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.

               <p>To tell you truth, I know not my selfe, but that which I imagine and holde for certaine, is, that they are some parts or corners in the Sea, of those Septentrionall Prouinces, of which wee haue spoken, which those that goe hence through ignorance, doe terme by new names: As for <hi>Tierra del Labrador,</hi> it is not yet throughly discouered whither it be firme Land; marry the most part and to which I giue greatest credite, affirme that is an Iland: The same beeing so farre Westward, that by all likelihood the Septentrional peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had little knowledge thereof. Those which haue beene there, say, that the enhabitants doe liue after a barbarous and sauage manner. But in fine, you must vnderstand that it is in a manner vnpossible throughly and exactly to know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct particularity of the Regions that are in those parts, not so much for the impossibility of discouering them, as for the diuersity of the names of the Prouinces, Countries, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Ilands, Hils, and Riuers, which are euery day changed and diuersly in different names termed by such seuerall Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as finde them; whose languages differing each of them, speaketh and writeth of them, by such names as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue imposed vnto them: insomuch that sometimes when we speake all of one Country, yet through the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of names, we imagine the one to be distant from the other many miles: And hence commeth so great a confusion, that though we know these Countries to be amongst those North and West Regions, of which we haue spoken, yet we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not which of them they are; and in like maner of those of the East: For as some Cosmographers giue them one name and some another; those that come after them interpret thereof, euery one as he pleaseth, yea, and many times differ
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19072:162"/>
in the very principall poynts, and of this is the varietie of the worlde cause: for euen as euery yeere the trees, plants, and hearbes, sprout forth in one season their leaues and fruites, in another do fade, wither, and decay, and then the next yeere renewe againe: and euen as of men, one dies and another is borne, and the like of all other worldly creatures, beastes, fowles, and fishes; so doth it happen and fall out in the verie names of things, which with time also doe change, alter and loose their selues, leauing one, and taking another. Take for example the olde Cosmographers, which doe most particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly entreate of Spayne, the Prouinces, Citties, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities thereof, as Ptolome and Plinie, and you shall not find sixe names conforming and agreeing to those which we now vse, and perchance within a thousand yeeres, if the world last so long, they will haue lost these which they nowe haue, and taken others: For without doubt, as the worlde hath such an vnstable varying, so it will not leese the same vntill it come to be ended and dissolued: Neither onely in this, but in the Languages also I warrant you there will be in tract of time such alteration and change. For though at this present it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that we speake in Castile, the most pure and polished speech that may be, yet those that shall come some space of yeeres after vs, will speake the same so differently, that such things as are written in this our time, will seeme vnto them as barbarous, as doth vnto vs the olde prose which we finde in stories of auncient time: For there is no thirtie or forty yeres, but there are diuers and sundry words, worne out of vse and forsaken, and others new inuented and had in price, vvhich though they be not good, yet vse maketh them to seeme so, as in all other things it vsually happeneth, that onelie custome is sufficient to make that which is euill, seeme good, and that which is good, seeme euill.</p>

And in all the other bordering Prouinces rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these, they are most ready and willing to conuert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: but the greatest pitty of all is, that they are lost for lack of Preachers and learned Pastours to preach vnto them, and to perswade and instruct them in the right way: manie good men haue not wanted will to doe the same, but theyr bodyes haue not beene able to suffer and endure the extreame colde of that Climat: but I trust in God, that of his mercie he will one day put this in some good mens harts to goe through withall, and endue and strengthen them with forces suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the accomplishing thereof: especially seeing hee hath already so enclined the peoples harts to embrace his vvorde: for it is a thing most assuredly knowne, that on the Frontires of Norway, Bothnia, and Fynland, at such time as the vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breaketh, and that the snowe and Ise giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> passage, there come men and women thirty &amp; forty leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">The deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the North peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> the Land, bringing theyr young children, those that haue meanes, vpon horses and beasts backs, those which haue not, in little Baskets made for the nonce vppon theyr owne shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to be baptized, some of which are foure months, some sixe, and some a yeere old: and there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Priestes and Pastours, they desire to be instructed with rules and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts

howe to leade a Christian life, and as opportunitie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, they bring dulie vnto them theyr Tythes. When they are ignorant of any poynt, howe they shoulde deale therein like Christians, then conforming themselues with the Lawe of Nature, they doe that which seemeth good and vertuous, and leaue that vndoone which seemeth wicked and vicious: and it is to be supposed, that those of the Prouinces adioyning to the dominion of the great Muscouite doe the like.</p>
