            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRACT OF PRAYER.</head>
            <head>An Introduction.</head>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What Prayer is.</note>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rayer, is nothing else but a powring foorth of the soules-sense ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the instinct and motion of GOD his holy Spirit. And herevpon it is, that <hi>Moses</hi> is sayd to <hi>cry</hi> (<hi>Exod. 14. 15.</hi>) though he vttered no worde: and <hi>Hannah</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> (<hi>1. Sam. 1. 12.</hi>) though she spake onely in her hart. And this is called Prayer <hi>Mentall</hi>; as that which is by mouthes vtterance, is called Prayer <hi>Vocall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I say this speach of the Soule
<pb facs="tcp:25417:4"/>
must be according to the motion of God his Spirit: it is, because no vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraunce <hi>mentall</hi> or <hi>vocall</hi> is true Prayer, otherwise then it is vttered by the Holy Ghostes direction: For his office it is to teach vs what to pray. And herevpon it is, that the Apostle teacheth, not onely that God sendes foorth his Sonnes spirit into our hartes vpon the very first action of our Adoption, (<hi>Gal. 4. 6. 9.</hi>) for teaching vs to <hi>Cry</hi>; that is, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to Pray: but also to deny, that the most learned is able to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the direction of that Spirit. For thus he sayth: <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what to pray as we ought, but the Spirit it selfe maketh request for vs, with sighes which cannot be expressed. Rom. 8. 26.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And least any should obiect: Alas, we speake imperfectly, or sigh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly; he addeth: <hi>But he that sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb facs="tcp:25417:4"/>
the hartes, knoweth what is the meaning of that Spirit: for he maketh request for the Sainctes, according to the will of God.</hi> So that no wordes or sighinges are heere reputed Prayer, otherwise then they receiue their character of <hi>Christes</hi> Spirit.</p>
            <p>Which obserued, it conuineeth the <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Brownist</hi> (two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames) of extreame ignoraunce. The <hi>Papist</hi> thinkes,<note place="margin">The Papists errour for Prayer.</note> if so he say ouer some certaine forme of wordes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in his <hi>Iesus</hi> or <hi>Ladyes Psalter</hi>; or her etofore drawen by <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> or some other idolatrous <hi>Woorthie,</hi> he hath done very well; though (God knowes) he is so farre from follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the instinct of <hi>Christes</hi> Spirit therein, as ordinarily he Apishly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth some brutish inuention: and (if it be Latine) his owne Spirit (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a common <hi>Papist</hi>) ignorant what his lippes vttereth. For the <hi>Brownist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes error for Prayer.</note> 
               <pb facs="tcp:25417:5"/>
hee thinkes on the other hand, that if he haue vttered a number of words, not according to any <hi>written forme,</hi> but of the abundance of his owne hart, then he hath performed a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie worke: for no wordes borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed from else where, he holdes can be deliuered for Prayer. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is, that he denyeth to vtter the words in<note n="*" place="margin">Namely, Our Father which art in Heauen, &amp;c</note> 
               <hi>Mat. 6. 9. &amp;c.</hi> for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: as if the same wordes could not bee vsed for <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> Thus condemning all the Worlde for ignoraunce in Prayer, he shewes himselfe to be ignoraunt what is <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> (as before) receiues not his <hi>Beeing</hi> from Wordes: for one can pray truely that is dombe with <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi>: but be they words or sighes, or Soules breathinges; they be then true <hi>Prayer,</hi> when God his Spirit is one with our Spirit in the vse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb facs="tcp:25417:5"/>
And therefore to impute any thing to Wordes in that manner as they do, is flat <hi>Merit-mongry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because in <hi>vocall</hi> Prayer, the selfe same words may againe be vsed in the same and like case, our Sauiour (who had more varietie of wordes then any <hi>Brownist</hi>) hee repeated the <hi>same wordes</hi> againe,<note n="*" place="margin">Namely, Abba, Father all things are posible. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Marke. 14. 39.</hi> And the Apostle againe and againe in the entraunce of his Epistles,<note n="*" place="margin">Namely, Grace be with you &amp; peace from God. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Rom. 1. 7. 1. Cor. 1. 3. 2. Cor. 1. 2. Galat. 1. 3. Ephess. 1. 2. Philip. 1. 2. Coloss. 1. 2. 1. Thess. 1. 2. 2. Thess. 1. 2. 1. Tim. 1. 2. 2. Tim. 1. 2. Philem. 3.</hi> Thus farre was <hi>S. Paul</hi> from acquaintaunce with <hi>Brownisme.</hi> And yet I could prooue vnto them, that some of themselues both publiquely and priuatly, haue vsually vsed a flat <hi>Forme of Prayer</hi> cond by hart. But who will easily dispute with Spirits of priuate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation?</p>

               <hi>Prayer</hi> consisting in Sighes new or accustomed: in wordes olde or new (<hi>Etiamsi nihil dictum quod non dictum prius</hi>) prouided the same be formed by the Holy spirit. Some ignorauntly (it may be) will inferre: Then the vnsanctified (with <hi>Iudas Iscariot</hi>) pray not truely, seeing the Holy Ghost is not giuen them. I answeare: the vnsanctified person praying with and for others, may (as did <hi>Iudas Iscariot</hi>) pray truely; and may haue glorious effectes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the same, (as followed <hi>Isca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots</hi> ministerie, so well as the others, <hi>Mark. 6. 13. and Luk. 9. 10.</hi>) and this, because he prayeth according to the motion of the Holy spirit, though he enioy not the same Spirit. For great is the difference betweene being <hi>Acted by him,</hi> (as <hi>Balaam</hi> was in his ministerie) and hauing the Spirit dwelling in one; as he doth in
