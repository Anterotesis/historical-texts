            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as the Learned and prudent <hi>Plutarch</hi> declares, that man had life given him from his Maker for Knowledge ſake, the which doth as well procure Renown to his Name, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Vertues into Action: ſo daily Experience doth evince, that the Induſtrious hands, and unwearied La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of men of worth and Learning, have been of great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, uſe, and benefit to all ages. And may we not well grant the ſame of Chirurgery? where we may with pleaſure and admiration view and behold, how variouſly man, being either wounded, inciſed, pricked, battered, contuſed, or the like, is brought into a good form and ſhape by this excellent Art. It is he alone that can check fear in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and baniſh danger by his Judgment; foretell Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, and prevent accidents: he is as well the Comfort in the Field, as a Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the City. It is by his practice and Art that divided parts are united, it's his Skill that keeps them thus united. And as <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, we ſtand as much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59608:6"/>
in need of his help as we do of Water or Fire, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And for this reaſon was it, that the Ancients taught their Scholars this Art of Chirurgery in their Schools, from whence alſo they learned their firſt rudiments and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
            <p>And ſince my preſent task wholly relates to Wounds, I ſhall divide them into general and particular Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. To theſe alſo have I adjoyned Gun-ſhot Wounds, and a particular diſcourſe of all kinds of Wounds of the Head, thence accompanying this Treatiſe with Wounds in particular, <hi>(viz.)</hi> ſuch as in their order may be ſaid to fall from thence to the Foot. And as every of theſe do carry with them many differences, forms, ſhapes, and habits, it ſhall be my preſent endeavour to acquaint the Young Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, how to provide and arm himſelf againſt theſe, and with what neceſſary Inſtruments he may perform this task, and to conquer and cure the direfull Symptoms which attend many Wounds, which may inflict or accompany ſome parts of the Body. And that I may place him in his right Tract, which may conduct him to the true and well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of theſe: theſe four things will neceſſarily fall under our Confideration, being very proper engins in their places to be uſed in Wounds, and theſe are <hi>Ligatures, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, Bolſters</hi> and <hi>Pledgets,</hi> of each of which a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reſpect is to be had, for they all require a right Order in their applications, both as touching their long or ſhort continuance at the part, a ſlight paſſing by of which, doth very often prove detrimentall.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ligature</hi> and its two Species.</note> And firſt as touching <hi>Ligature,</hi> of this there are propoſed two contrary Species, the one to be made more ſtrict, whilſt the other may be made more looſe. And theſe two have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of parts allowed them, ſome parts being property ſaid to be thick, and others called thin or rare. That part is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thick which is covered both with <hi>Bolſters</hi> and <hi>Roulers,</hi> theſe appointed both for keeping the part warm, and alſo for making it more firm: that called or ſaid to be rare or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59608:6"/>
looſe, which onely bindeth, not covereth. And theſe alſo are to be conſidered according to the Times of the year, in which they are uſed or ſaid to be applyed. Thus Winter time does generally allow to make more uſe of theſe then the Summer. Three fingers breadth for them is a very good allowance. Thoſe <hi>Ligatures</hi> are generally accounted beſt which are made and applyed moſt naturally, and thoſe do for the moſt part expreſs the greateſt honour to the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon which are moſt exquiſitely performed by him. This made Wiſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirm, that good <hi>Ligature</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the eye, as well as give the Patient ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The next two ſhall be <hi>Section</hi> or <hi>Inciſion,</hi> and <hi>Cautery</hi> or <note place="margin">Inciſion <hi>and</hi> Cautery.</note>
               <hi>Aduſtion;</hi> theſe alſo in ſome caſes are very uſefull and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and being either made ſooner or later do carry an equall praiſe and eſtimate: for in ſome caſes <hi>Inciſion</hi> is ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and in theſe, delay may bring pain and other bad Symptoms, and theſe fix or place a new fear on the Patients front: But where many <hi>Inciſions</hi> are to be made, a more deliberate care is to be had and uſed, granting and allowing the Patient ſome Intervalls of reſt: and theſe are to be ſo performed, as that they bring no pain to the Patient. To the well doing of which, the prompting of convenient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Medicines do much conduce, every one of which is to be diſpoſed in its proper Orb and Sphere, not hindring or detarding one another. Then are theſe to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in their right method and form. The length and ſhortneſs hereof ought alſo to be conſidered; and what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments are moſt proper for the performance hereof: for ſome parts of the body are of a ſpeedy flux, and upon the ſlight touch of a thin and ſmall Inſtrument ſheweth it ſelf, as Veins and Arteries, the which are not readily obſtructed or ſtopped: theſe parts require ſmall <hi>inciſions,</hi> and for this uſe the <hi>Lancet</hi> or <hi>Inciſion</hi> Knife are the beſt Inſtruments. In places which are not ſo perillous, where the veſſels lie deep, and the bloud not ſo apparently contained, we may venture on larger Inſtruments. But of theſe afterwards.</p>

               <note place="margin">Cupping glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> And becauſe <hi>Cupping-glaſſes</hi> are generally reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Chirurgeons Inſtruments, I ſhall diſcourſe of theſe here alſo. Theſe although they operate not as other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe, yet in many caſes they are of great uſe. Theſe are called <hi>Concave</hi> Inſtruments, generally uſed for Revulſion, to be applied with, or without flame, by the benefit of which Inſtruments, the humour is fetcht from many parts of the body, and drawn to the part to which they are applied, and ſo is drawn forth. Theſe alſo are ſometimes applied with or without Scarification. When there is occaſion to make uſe of Scarification, begin your <hi>Inciſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> from the lower parts, and ſo paſs upward, for thus the bloud of every Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified part will be apparent; the which on the contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made firſt in the upper part, the bloud thence iſſuing will choak and obſcure the ſmall <hi>Inciſions</hi> which are made down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, towards the lower part of the circle. Here alſo are we with <hi>Galen</hi> to conſider the differences of <hi>Inciſions,</hi> thus properly to be made, for they ought to be either thin, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall and ſlender, or deep and large, or of a ſize between both. Now ſuch as are made ſuperficiall cannot draw from the remote parts: theſe are neither ſaid to revell nor derive, but do only extract that humour which is cutaneouſly lodged within. Others that are made more long, do educe much humour, as <hi>Orobaſius</hi> witneſſeth of himſelf, who upon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Thigh ſcarified when he lay ſick of the Peſt, had drawn from thence by the benefit of the <hi>Cupping-glaſs</hi> near two pounds of bloud, for this fetcht it from the remoteſt parts of his body, and at length perfectly recovered him. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cupping-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in three Reſpects.</note>And for theſe three cauſes they are accounted very uſefull Inſtruments, becauſe they do both Derive, Revell and Expurge the redundancy of humours which are lodged in the body, and do diſcharge the ſame by the ſmall <hi>Inciſions</hi> opened by the Circle of the Glaſs, the which doth both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend them and force the bloud to run more freely.</p>
            <p>And becauſe Extraction of Weapons, Splinters, Arrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, Darts, Bullets, ſuperfluous Fleſh, Rags and the like, are a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59608:7"/>
very neceſſary point and Intention in Chirurgery, eſpecially in curing large and Gun-ſhot Wounds, I ſhall in the next place give you the names of ſuch Inſtruments as are moſt in uſe with us for the ſame purpoſe, <hi>(viz.) Crows Bills, Cranes Bills, Ducks Bills, Terebellum, Forcipes,</hi> and the lile. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe will appear more properly in their places of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot Wounds, where alſo their figures are preſented, I will ſpeak no more of them, onely here alluding this Caution, That there be not uſed too much violence in Extraction of <note place="margin">Obſervat.</note>theſe extraneous Bodies, and to give and grant a juſt time for the execution of this Intention. Knowing that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ſometimes allowed as advantagious, as remiſneſs or inconſiderateneſs granted inſucceſsfull: and in ſome caſes it is not requiſite to extract theſe bodies through the Wound, they being ſometimes fixed in a bone, or between bones; ſometimes nature will lend her aſſiſting hand to your work, if you give her time; and this, various Hiſtory makes good, and both former ages and our latter times have experienced the ſame. <hi>Albucaſis</hi> writes of a Woman who having an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note>ſhot near her Belly, and lodged in her body, ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of her Wound. Ofttimes, after they have been lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many years, they frame a way for themſelves and there diſcharge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by making Abſceſſes for their Exition: and this you may ſee confirmed by theſe following Hiſtories. <hi>Alſaharavius, Theoric.</hi> Tract. 6. cap. 1. writes that he ſaw a <note place="margin">Another.</note>man who had an Arrow ſhot into his Back, the which after ſeven years made its way out. <hi>Gilbertus Anglicus</hi> lib. 5. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. writes of a man who having an Arrow ſhot into his Guts, <note place="margin">Another.</note>had it drawn forth with the Excrement, and that the man eſcaped: but of theſe expect more plentifully, in Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot Wounds. Sometimes it is alſo requiſite that the Wound it ſelf be dilated, for the more ready making way for its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition: and then if you perceive the Extraneous body which is to be Extracted to be perfectly looſe, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it the firſt dreſſing. But if it be only looſe at one end, and fixed at the other, ſtrive not too much for its removall,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59608:8"/>
leſt hereby you purchaſe ſome ill accidents you cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily overcome and abate; as ſuch a flux of bloud as is not ſpeedily to be ſtopt, and therefore in ſuch caſes are we to wait Natures leiſure. Having thus ſhown you what large Inſtruments are beſt and moſt in uſe in Gun-ſhot Wounds, you will find it a great advantage to gain the ſigns of theſe infixed Weapons; for thoſe being once known, there can be no place left of doubt which may terrify the Patient, or queſtion the Chirurgeon; for it is the true Knowledge of Signs which do haſten and promote the cure. Here alſo is to be conſidered the frequent differences of Weapons, and theſe are carefully to be obſerved, and with theſe the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the parts into which they are infixed, for on theſe two does the difficulty of the cure and Extraction chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, as ſhall elſewhere more at large appear. Now the <note place="margin">Differences of Weapons.</note>differences of Weapons are taken from their matter, being made either of Wood, Glaſs, Iron, Steel, Braſs, or the like; from their Figure, being either Round, Triangular, Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare, having ſharp Points, Bearded; from their Magnitude, being either large, ſmall, or of middle ſize; from their number, being either one or many, Simple or Compound; from their habit, ſome of which being ſharp pointed with Iron heads, others Concave; ſome firmly fixed to the Wood, others more looſely ſet; and laſtly they differ much in their Quality and Vigour, ſome being venomed, others not. As to the parts affected, theſe are evident enough from the property of accidents, which they ſhew: and where all theſe are found out, the Cure goes on with ſpeed and ſucceſs; for <hi>Galens</hi> Proverb is very true, <hi>Dimidium facti, qui bene coepit, habet.</hi> And he that thus ſoweth the ſeeds of his Art may well expect to reap a plentifull Crop of Honour and advantage to himſelf, as well as Eaſe and Comfort to his Patient.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What a Wound is.</note> IT is and hath been the current Opinion of all Ages, and amongſt all Authours, that a Wound does take its Definition from ſolution of Continuity or divorce of Parts. And although by Quacks and ignorant men there is made no great difference between a Simple and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Wound yet that there is a very vaſt difference, no man that ever practiſed his Art with Judgment can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The truth is, the Scale ſtands in this caſe, as in others, with ſuch kind of ſluggiſh Droans and ignorant Pretenders, whoſe Cures may more properly be called Corruptions, and whoſe pretended Judgments may as conſentaneouſly be owned onely as Ignorance plumed out and ſet forth with the beſt advantage of Impudence. But to leave thoſe as Idle Companions, we fall to our preſent Task.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a Wound.</note> A wound is called a recent divorce, or ſolution of Unity; or a diviſion of Parts formerly united, without

Matter. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Tagaultius</hi> offereth it to be a new Cruent Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Matter or Putridneſs, happening in the ſoft parts by ſome outward cauſe. <hi>Haliabbas</hi> declares, that a Wound may be made by an animate or inanimate Body. <hi>Pareus</hi> writes, that it may happen from a blow or a fall. <hi>Aquapendens,</hi> by or from ſome outward Inſtrument: this offering it ſelf with ſome violence in the ſoft parts. But there are other Solutions in other parts as well as in theſe ſoft parts, and every of theſe have allowed them their proper Names; the which I have already ſet down in my general Diſcourſe of Wounds. And after theſe be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take this as a true definition of a Wound, <hi>That it is a Solution of Continuity bloudy or cruent, and recent, made newly in the Fleſh by ſuch an Inſtrument as hath a power to occaſion a divorce of parts formerly united.</hi> There are ſeveral differences of Wounds, and theſe are either taken from their cauſes by which they are occaſioned, or from their accidents wherein they are ſcituated. The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may be allowed to be with, or without life: with life, as occaſioned by the biting of ſome venomous Beaſt, or other ſuch like Creature; without life, happening by ſome Sword, Stone, Blow, Arrow or the like. The Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation doth afford and allow various Differences, as ſome Wounds happening in the Simple parts, others in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick. Under the Simple parts may be reckoned both the Sanguine and Spermatick, and to theſe do relate Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles, Nerves, Veins and Arteries. Thoſe we more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call the Organick parts, which are nearer related to the whole bulk. Others thereof belonging more directly to ſome particular Member thereof. Now Wounds of the whole Trunk are generally allowed theſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> as being of the Head, Neck, Breaſt and Belly. Wounds of the Articulations are thoſe which are of the Joynts, or Shoulders, Arms, Thighs and Legs. But this you ſhall have more largely ſet down in this following Chapter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>GAlen, Avicen, Guido,</hi> and others when they write of the Differences of Wounds, they either draw them from the Parts, and theſe are either Similar or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick; the Similar being either ſoft as Fleſh and Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, or hard as Bones and Cartilages; or between both, as Nerves, Veins, Ligaments and Arteries: thoſe called Organick, as being made in the Principall parts, as in the Head, Hand or ſo forth; and of theſe ſome are Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, others Compound; the firſt we have already ſhown, the laſt may appear either mild or malign; the firſt being cured with eaſe, as a ſmall Wound happening in the Fleſhy parts, the other being of greater danger, being complicated with malignity, as occaſioned by a venenate Weapon, or poyſonous Bite; and theſe are perillous, conſidering either their Impreſſion, Time, Figure, or Parts wherein they are made and fixed, as falling in ſome noble part, being made either ſooner or later; with, or without loſs of Subſtance; in a large, middle or ſmall Figure and the like: theſe alſo are to be diſcovered either by Sight or Probation.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Wound and an Ulcer.</note> And having proceeded thus far: we next come to view the difference between a Wound and an Ulcer. And that both Wounds and Ulcers may ariſe from Externall and Interiour Inſtruments, ſhall be made good in my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>A Wound, as is already laid down, is a Recent and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Solution without Matter; an Ulcer hath Matter joyned to it: And as a Wound is occaſioned by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Inſtrument, having in it an Inciſive power allowed to cauſe this breach: ſo alſo is an Ulcer purchaſed by an inward Eroſion or eroſive Humour. The Differences of Wounds, as <hi>Avicen</hi> offereth in <hi>ſecund. Fenn. prim. Canon.</hi> are taken from their varieties of Solution.</p>
               <p>The Diſcriminances of Wounds are taken either from the reſpect of the Subject, as <hi>Galen</hi> writes 3 <hi>Art. parv.</hi> as ſome Wounds happening in a Homogeneous, others in a Heterogeneous part; or from the Eſſence, in which reſpect it is called a Simple Wound; as he alſo obſerveth <hi>Tertio Method.</hi> to which neither Diſeaſe nor any other Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome is complicated. On the contrary he alloweth that to be a Compound, to which ſomewhat is connexed or adjoyned: as you may ſee in 4 <hi>Method.</hi> Or they are taken from the quantity which is ſolved and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but of theſe more at large in their proper places. Wounds alſo may be made either by Puncture, Inciſion, Ruption, or Contuſion. Thoſe called Punctures, which are made by Thruſts with Swords, Pikes, Knifes, Daggers, and ſuch ſharp pointed Inſtruments. Thoſe Inciſions, which are made lengthwaies, either by Knifes or Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwords: (the Rapier being a very proper Inſtrument for making Punctures) or any other Inſtrument having a ſharp cutting Edge. Thoſe do cauſe Ruption, which by an egregious and violent Motion, can divel and divide the parts. Thoſe allowed to Contuſe, which are of a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Exiſtence: as Wood, Stone, Lead, Iron, Steel, Braſs, and the like.</p>

And as it is one of his fair Graces and Ornaments to know well and underſtand what Wounds are incurable: ſo ought it alſo to be his greateſt reaſon and prudence not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch, as he juſtly muſt acknowledge he hath no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or encouragement from Art to be concerned with: and were theſe much practiſed, the Art of Chirurgery would not fall to that low degree as it appears now in.</p>
               <p>To know the events of Wounds, and to preſage the good or bad tidings of the Patient wounded, is a thing abſolutely neceſſary for the Chirurgeon to underſtand; for in this caſe does the life of Man very oft conſiſt and depend.

And thus as Art does remove the Impediments, Nature her ſelf does aſſiſt towards the Cure of the Diſeaſe, which of her ſelf ſhe cannot readily perform, where her native Heat is weak, the Bloud vitiated, or the Flux large; every of which are to be corrected and amended. As the native <note place="margin">Generall Rules.</note>Heat is to be preſerved by a good Diet, and well ordering the Body. Where the Bloud is vitiated, this is to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and corrected by Purging. Where it flows too much, this is to be repelled, revelled, or derived, and the like.</p>

                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> does propoſe two ſorts of Wounds: the one he calls Simple, the other Compound. The Simple he calls Solution of Continuity, having no other Affect joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it, perplexed with no Fluxion, not abounding with any ill Juice, or undermined with any <hi>Intemperies,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent Cavity or Loſs of fleſh. A Compound Wound, on the contrary, hath the repute of Loſs of fleſh,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59608:20"/>
an adjunct Cauſe, Affect, or Symptome. A Simple wound taken therefore in its prime ſenſe does onely require De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccation. A Compound, to which may be annexed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, hath alſo a mixture of Inflammation; and this hindreth Union and Agglutination. In this caſe therefore the Chirurgeon is firſt to cure the Inflammation, then to proceed to the Wound. Green wounds, and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts, are but ſmally inflamed, if Matter may be procured: for Wounds do onely then inflame, when they do not ſuppurate. For they ſuppurate by a ſtrange Bloud, and Heat, untill the putrefying Wound occaſioneth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matter. And if Exition be not made for this Matter, it being ſuppreſſed, it excites Inflammation about the wounded part, and breeds and begets an ill Habit therein, and rendreth both the Wound and its neighbouring parts ſordid and corrupt.</p>
               <p>The chief Intention in curing a Simple wound is Deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, this being moſt proper for the purpoſe: and whereas the whole Body does abound with moiſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, theſe alſo in ſome meaſure are to be dried up by Abſtinence, and a thin Diet. Where any part of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> is inciſed, no Oleaginous medicine can take place: for this eaſily penetrates and entereth the Pores of the skin, and does there create a Moiſture, in ſtead of Deſiccation or Drineſs; and may therefore be allowed rather to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then ſet forward the Cure. But this chiefly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to a Simple wound, and ſuch as is ſuperficiall: but our Diſcourſe doth moſtly tend to other Wounds, where the chief Scope and Intention is to unite thoſe Parts which are divided; which thing is performed by theſe ſix Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>(viz.)</hi> by Stopping the Flux of bloud, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Inflammation thereby; Removing all ſtrange and extraneous Bodies; Bringing the Lips of the Wound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Maintaining their Union; Keeping their Subſtance and Temper entire; and Preventing all future Accidents.

The Wound which we intend to treat of in this place is not of the large Veſſells, being either inciſed or lacerated: but when the ſmaller Veins are inciſed, this Flux is to be ſpeedily ſtopped, unleſs it ſpontaneouſly and timely do reſtrain and check it ſelf.</p>

               <p>And as touching the Firſt; The Temper, Conſtitution, Time, Complexion and Habit are to be conſidered. For if the Patient be of a Sanguine Complexion, corpulent Habit, having large Veſſells, and it be Summer-time, here the Patient may be permitted to bleed plentifully, both for preventing Inflammation, and Fluxion, and Fever.

Take care alſo that the Ligature be not made too ſtrict; for this is a ready way to cut and divide the Veſſells aſunder, and hereby create a new Flux.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Removing extraneous Bodies.</head>
               <p>THE next duty and Intention of a Chirurgeon is to remove all extraneous Bodies, which may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to hinder Union and Conjunction of the parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. And that every thing herein may be acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Reaſon, Judgement and Art, we are firſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Shape and form of the Inſtrument which is thus lodged: and this may be collected and gathered from the Contemplation of the nature and diverſity both of the hurt Parts, and alſo of the Matters therein fixed. And theſe two being conſiderately weighed and underſtood, the third thing, which next doth offer it ſelf, is the true method of Extracting theſe. And becauſe the Matter and Subſtances hereof may be various, as being made either of Wood, Iron, Glaſs, Bone, Braſs, Lead, or the like; and their Figures as diverſe, being ſaid to be either Long, Round, Square, or Flat; and whereas their Number is different, being One or Many, Simple or Compound; and their Magnitude is various, being Greater or Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; beſides theſe, their Habits being as ſtrange, ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows made with ſharp Iron heads fixed to them, others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Inſtruments, and theſe alſo differing in their vigour and faculty, ſome being ſent with, others without poiſon: Theſe and every of theſe ought to be well conſidered. But expect more hereof in <hi>Gunſhot-wounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> lays this down as a Maxime, That he who would deal with Wounds aright, ought well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Diagnoſtick part of his Art, before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the Therapeutick; and alſo to be well skilled in the nature of the Parts, before he preſcribes a Reaſon for a Cure: it being one of his greateſt Ornaments, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59608:22"/>
which Wounds are curable, which are incurable, and which are difficult to cure. I ſhall ſhew the Inſtruments, and farther diſcourſe of them, at the end of this Chapter; and proceed for the benefit of the young Chirurgeon.</p>
               <p>He is to obſerve and take notice, that in Extraction of extraneous Bodies, he well conſider the Shape and figure of the Inſtrument or other Body which is to be extracted, and how deep it hath penetrated; and being well skilled in Anatomy, he may eaſily underſtand the frame of the Parts wherein the Weapon is infixed: that hereby he may with more pleaſantneſs, and leſs fear, wiſely undertake the Patient, to his own credit, and the Patient's eaſe and comfort. And to every of theſe he is to underſtand that he hath theſe four things adjoyned: as firſt, to know when it is moſt fit to extract theſe Bodies; next, what way is the beſt for their Extraction; then, what Figure is moſt proper; and then, what Inſtruments moſt requiſite for the performing of theſe. I ſhall enlarge a little upon each of theſe, they being very materiall for the young Chirurgeon.</p>
               <p>If the pain be intolerable, and the infixed Weapon may commodiouſly and with ſafety be drawn forth, if it be ſo looſely fixed as by a ſmall moving it will ſeparate from the Part, draw this forth at the firſt, for hereby you will both eaſe pain, and procure reſt to your Patient. If the Weapon be poiſoned, deferre not Extraction, for this bringeth the whole Bulk into diſſolution: and therefore though you are forced through Nerves, Veins, or Arteries, to cut your way, yet this is not to be delayed. And that the young Chirurgeon may not miſtake herein, he may know the Fleſh poiſoned by a Weapon thus; it is of a ſtrange co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, it appears pale, ſublivid, and as it were dead: in theſe caſes he ought to ſcarify untill he meeteth with freſh bloud; and this he is to do untill the Poiſon be removed. After which he is to apply a Cupping-glaſs, which is the beſt Inſtrument for the calling of this forth. Beſides the former token, you will find it attended and accompanied
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59608:23"/>
with extraordinary Pains, with Inflammations and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Girdings, eſpecially about the wounded parts, with a Heavineſs and <hi>Torpor</hi> of the whole Body, and with <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope</hi> and Alienation of mind. And beſides theſe, the Wound hath an odd Smell with it: and the Weapon that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, (if poyſoned) when drawn forth, and after caſt into the fire, doth upon its burning turn black, and ſend forth a foetid Smell. And therefore in theſe caſes, where Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of life is ſo much threatned, we ought to uſe all our Experience and Reaſon to ſtorm the force of this Enemy, and batter down and overcome with convenient Medicines the vigour of its virulency. But of this expect more alſo in <hi>Gunſhot-Wounds.</hi> Beſides this alſo, in the caſe of a large Flux of bloud, which may alſo put the life of man into jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy, here are we to ſtop our hands: if horrible Pain, <hi>Syncope</hi> or Convulſion appear, delay your Extraction.</p>
               <p>As touching the way and method how to doe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all theſe; That in the eye of all men muſt be allowed to be tranſacted the beſt, which is done with moſt eaſe.</p>
               <p>And as to the Figure; If poſſible, gain the true figure of its Entrance, for this does make the Extraction more eaſy.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch other matters as may more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be here preſented ſhall appear in <hi>Gunſhot-Wounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince I have already declared to you how the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man may be variouſly aſſaulted by diverſity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, I have here alſo expreſſed in this following Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure how his Parts may be contuſed, punged, inciſed and lacerated, by Clubs, Stones, Swords, Pikes, Faulchions, Arrows, Shot, and the like: againſt which, on the contrary ſide, I have alſo delineated ſuch commodious Inſtruments, as are and have been allowed as moſt proper for the Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſcharging of the ſame out of the wounded parts. And that every thing may be done and performed according to Reaſon and Art, as touching the Extraction of Weapons or any other extraneous Bodies out of the Body; We are firſt to enquire after the Inſtruments which are to execute
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59608:23"/>
this: and theſe ought to be accommodated to the Part, the which does require their aptneſs for the occaſion, both as touching their Figure and Shape. And becauſe, as we have already noted, it is requiſite for theſe Inſtruments to be of various and ſundry Shapes, we ought to ſtudy a moſt exact Form of them for compleating this Intention. And here amongſt the reſt I ſhall preſent you with theſe following, whereof in the next Leaf you have the true Shapes and Forms. And the firſt which does offer it ſelf is <hi>Terebellum,</hi> this being an Inſtrument, as you may ſee, let into another, the which having a thin and pointed Screw at its end, may take hold of a Bullet, Splinter of Wood, Bone, or the like; and having once entered it, it brings it away with it. This is marked at the Letter <hi>A.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is a Hook to draw forth any Matter or Bone which lies ſuperficially. This is marked at <hi>B.</hi> The third is a large pair of <hi>Forcipes</hi> with Teeth, hollowed in the middle, the more apt for catching hold of any Bullet, Shot, or any other ſuperfluous matter. This is marked with <hi>C.</hi> The other pair of <hi>Forcipes</hi> are made without Teeth, but hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low alſo; and this is a very ready Inſtrument for laying hold of a Bullet, having both allowed them ſtrong Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for the more prompt extraction of any Body. And this is marked with <hi>D.</hi> The laſt is called a pair of dented Cranes-bills, being bent or bowed, accommodated chiefly for deep Wounds; and being more ſlender then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, may with more eaſe enter into the Orifice of the Wound. And this is marked at the Letter <hi>E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Weapon being extracted, what your next Intention is, ſhall be more at large declared in my Diſcourſe of <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot-wounds,</hi> this being but as a part and abſtract thereof.</p>
               <p>And having thus ſhown you how to remove extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodies, my next Intention ſhall be, to declare how Parts which are thus ſeparated are to be joyned, and how the Divorce of Parts thus made is to be brought into a mutuall Contacture, according to Art.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Joyning of Parts ſeparated.</head>
               <p>OUR next Intention is, the Uniting and Joyning of the ſeparated and divorced Parts: and this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by bringing the Lips of the Wound together, which were formerly diſunited. If it happens to be a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Wound made in the fleſh, with which neither Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome or any other evill Accident or Affect is complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this may be united by Ligature, leaving the reſt to Nature. But if the Wound be ſo large, as that it is not to be brought to Union by Ligature, here are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red agglutinative Aſſiſtents, the which are to have in them a drying quality, hereby conſuming and drying the moiſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements and Humidities, and prohibiting their Influxions. And therefore in this caſe give me leave to premiſe, that in large Wounds, Purgation is very proper, and that in theſe three reſpects; both as touching the Excellency of the Part, the greatneſs of the Affect, and the Malignity of the matter, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes. Oyl here ought not to be applied to theſe Wounds, for it does both humect and relax: Sarcoticks and Driers being moſt proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines here to be uſed. Beſides this, Oyl rendreth the Wound more ſordid and putrid. After this, we are to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the naturall Temper of the Part; and where it is once eſtranged by Air, Meats, Drinks, Evacuation and Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sleepings and Watchings, and the like, theſe are to be corrected and amended. As for example, if a Wound do prove very moiſt and ſordid, and ſendeth forth much Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, here are we to ſtudy its Alteration, drying this up by a ſlender Diet, Purging, and the like.</p>
               <p>To this alſo belong the diverſity of Excrements which do uſually accompany Wounds; and theſe are of three

ſorts, <hi>(viz.) Ichor, Pus, Sordes. Ichor</hi> is a thin indigeſted <note place="margin">Three ſorts of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Wounds.</note>
                  <hi>Lympha:</hi> and this iſſueth either from the Veins, or the wounded Part. If from the Veins, it is thin and wateriſh, and hath no bad Smell; and according to its Colour you may gueſs of what Humour it does proceed. If it arifeth from the wounded Part, its Smell is unpleaſant, and this is called <hi>Sanies:</hi> and according to the degrees of its Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſendeth forth a greater or leſſer quantity of its ill ſmell and ſavour. The ſecond is called <hi>Sordes,</hi> being a viſcous Excrement firmly adhering to a Wound: and the cauſe of this thickneſs is aſſigned to a dry Conſtitution of body; ſometimes to the errour of the Chirurgeon; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo to the Air. The third is called <hi>Pus.</hi> This is generally ſmooth, white, equall, having no ill Smell, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> deſcribeth it. The cauſes which generate theſe three are held to be the naturall or unnaturall Heat; the firſt being the cauſe of Digeſtion, whereby a laudable Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is generated, the unnaturall heat working up moiſture with it, ſo cauſeth Putrefaction, and that ill ſmell we generally do perceive.</p>
               <p>And having thus deſcribed to you the unnaturall and unkind Subſtances which do hinder Union, I next proceed to Pain and Fainting: the firſt being purchaſed in the moſt ſlender Wound, the Skin being the Inſtrument of Touching: and as for Fainting, this is as common in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Wounds, and frequent in ſimple Wounds. And that this is true, how oft have we ſeen your delicate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies faint at the cut of a Finger or the like, and the ſturdy Plow-jogger to faint at Bleeding? But of theſe in their proper places: and to our preſent Task, as touching the Uniting of Wounds disjoyned.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">As touching Ligature.</note> This may be performed by Ligature, or Suture, or Dry ſtitch. Ligature is moſt proper in Wounds made lengthwaies, being ſuperficiall. And this ought not too ſtrictly to be applied, nor yet too looſely; making them of a convenient breadth to take in the whole Wound. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59608:26"/>
                  <note place="margin">As touching Suture.</note> is performed by Needles, or a Dry ſtitch: and the Stitching-needle is as convenient an Inſtrument as any the Chirurgeon does carry in his Plaiſter-box: for with it he may eaſe Pains, free the Wound from Inflammation, and himſelf from Inconveniencies. In the uſe hereof, care is to be taken that the Lips of the Wound be brought to an equall diſtance, not violently, but gently bringing them together, not extending one more then another, equally to anſwer each other in its ſuperficies. The Dry ſtitch is moſtly uſed when exteriour Beauty does ſeem to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; <note place="margin">As touching the Dry ſtitch three things to be obſerved.</note>as a Wound happening in the Face, &amp;c. And herein are we adviſed, according to <hi>Ambroſe Parrey,</hi> to obſerve three things; as the Preparation of the Cloath, the Method which makes the Wound joyn, and then the Form. As to the firſt, the pieces of Cloath muſt be ſtrong, anſwering each other alike, hemmed about the Wound, and looſe at the other ſides. It is Emplaſticks which makes them agglutinative. As for their Forms, they are to anſwer the Shapes of the Wounds, moſt fit for the bringing them cloſe together. Now if the Wound be deep, you are to take up a pretty quantity of fleſh with the Needle; and if in this caſe you ſhould make a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall apprehenſion, and the Wound hereby be ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally agglutinated, in the bottome of the Wound may be left remaining ſuch a <hi>Sanies</hi> or Collection of Matter, which may frame an Abſceſs or hollow Ulcer.</p>

                     <hi>Guido</hi>'s three ſorts of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> 
                  <hi>Guido</hi> propoſeth three kinds of Suture. The firſt he calls the Agglutinative Suture, commonly called the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnative Suture, the which does make beſt for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe. Suppreſſion of the bloud, which is done by the Needle drawn through either Lip in form of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's Suture, is by ſome called <hi>Sutura continuata:</hi> by this the Bloud is eaſily depreſſed. This is generally uſed in Wounds of the Guts, or when any large Veſſell is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The third is called the Retentive Suture, the which is moſt proper in lacerated Wounds in which the Fleſh is loſt.</p>

                     <hi>Guido</hi>'s five methods of Suture.</note> Of the Incarnative Suture <hi>Guido</hi> propoſeth 5 kinds. The Firſt is done by the Needle being drawn through each Lip by the right hand, holding and placing the ſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Quill with the left, hereby making the Lips of the Wound equall. The Second is performed by taking divers Stitches, ſome diſtance from each other, through the length of the Wound, bringing the Wound to a proportionate evenneſs: and in every of theſe Stit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the ends of the Thread are to be cut off near to the Knots. The Third ſpecies is performed by drawing the Needles through each Lip, and then by the ſame Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice drawing them back again, and ſo by degrees bringing the Lips of the Wound cloſer, by annexing them to ſome ſmall ſubſtance, the which by twiſting the Silk thereon may by degrees cloſe up the Lips of the Wound. But this is the worſt of the reſt. And in all Sutures take this Obſervation with you, that before you make any Suture, <note place="margin">Obſervar.</note>you do deterge all the concreted Bloud in the Wound, both for preventing Inflammation, and furthering Agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination. The time of leaving the Sutures off, is, when Union is perfected, or Agglutination made: the which do vary, according to the largeneſs of the Wound, and in reſpect of the Habit of the body. In great and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Wounds they are generally kept for eight days; in ſmall Wounds, not above three in ſome.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this Chapter, with acquainting you of the three Uſes of Suture. For it is uſed either for Agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination of Wounds; and this is called the Incarnative Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: or to keep the ſuperficial parts of the Wounds in a reaſonable diſtance from each other; and this is called the Retentive Suture: or to ſtop the Flux of bloud; and this is termed the Suppreſſive Suture. Thus have I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon the Joyning of the Parts ſeparated and divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. We next proceed to the Eighth Chapter.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of keeping the Parts joyned, and preſerving their Subſtance entire.</head>
               <p>WE come now to the Fourth and Fifth Intentions: and becauſe it oft falls out that ſome Heterogene Subſtance does happen within the Lips of the Wound, as Hair, Dirt, Oyl, and the like, the which do hinder Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination, this with care is to be prevented; and that we may truly ſtudy the defence of the wounded Part, and keep it from harms, there is required much care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. For we may wiſh Union in Wounds, which is Nature's work; but may miſs of our aim, if the Temper of the Part be not ſound. The Body alſo being weak, Nature does very readily throw down her Excrements to the wounded Part; whence doth ariſe a Dyſcraſy both of temper and humour. Beſides which, the Part being it ſelf much weakned, there cannot in any reaſon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a good Nutriment, and hence muſt follow Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the which not being well driven out from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Part, there muſt conſequently be created a moiſt Intempereity therein. And beſides theſe, by reaſon of this Intempereity, expect no fair cloſure of the Lips of the Wound, this Matter inwardly lodged creating a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of <hi>Sanies,</hi> which hath force and vigour enough to create a Dyſcraſy.</p>
               <p>And that we may therefore be armed againſt all theſe troubles, theſe Sarcotick and Incarnative Medicines ſhould be of a cold faculty, that they may repell the Matter which flows; alſo drying, and that in the ſecond degree,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59608:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſuck up theſe inward Humidities; and alſo ſtiptick, for ſtrengthening the weak parts. And here <hi>Guido,</hi> after his Sutures made, does ſprinkle this Powder on the wounded Part: ℞ <hi>Pulv. Thur.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>Sangu. Dracon.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. <hi>Bol. armen.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. <note place="margin">Powder.</note>mix them, and apply them either in powder, or made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cataplaſm, by mixing them with the White of an egge, a little Vinegar, and powder of Bean-meal. And this he orders to remain on for four days. We of late, according to a more modern practice, do uſe this method after the Suture, firſt ſprinkling on the reſtrictive Powders, then covering them with ſome drying and agglutinative Empl. as <hi>Diapalma, De minio,</hi> and the like: upon which we apply convenient Boulſters, and conclude the dreſſing with convenient Rowlers.</p>
               <p>Now of this ſort of Colletick Medicines we have very many, both ſimple and compound, ſet down for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Amongſt the Simple may be reckoned theſe, having in them a drying and binding quality, and void of all ſharpneſs: <hi>(viz.)</hi> Bolearmen. Red roſes, Maſtick, <hi>Olibanum,</hi> Sanicle, Plantane, Betony, Agrimony, Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, <hi>Veronica, Gum. Elemn.</hi> Sage, <hi>Lap. calaminar. Lap.

Baſilicon, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reum, Fuſcum, Nicotian. De Panac. Colon. Linimentum Arcaei, Deſiccativum rubrum, Diapompholygos:</hi> all theſe generally allowed Sarcoticks. And how much their dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality is required, is to be collected from the time of the year, and the ſtrength and conſtitution of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Thus a Simple wound does onely require a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Dreſſing; whereas a Compound and deep wound does as neceſſarily requeſt the uſe of Tents and Doſſils, to be armed with ſome of the former Medicines.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Removing of Symptoms and Accidents.</head>
               <p>WE are now come to the laſt Intention, which is the Correction of Accidents: and theſe are very various, and do as diverſly happen in large and deep Wounds, and do keep up Solution of Continuity. And theſe are allowed to be nine in number: as Pain, Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Haemorrhagy, <hi>Delirium,</hi> Fainting, Fever, Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Palſey, and Convulſion. And theſe as they are Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms in reſpect of their greatneſs and vehemency, ſo alſo in many caſes do they threaten Death. The Correction of theſe Symptoms is to be as much regarded as the Cure of the Wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">I. Pain.</note> And Firſt therefore, as touching Pain, this by <hi>Galen,</hi> 2. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 12. <hi>Meth.</hi> is allowed to be a ſad and heavy ſenſe of change, following a Diſeaſe as a ſhadow doth a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. This moſt generally is the cauſe of Fluxion, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Faculties, be the temper and habit of the Body formerly never ſo good: it being Pain's chief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to attract Inflammation, by ſtirring the Humours into a Combuſtion: and it falls here as in other caſes, the weakeſt is ſeen to go by the wall. For generally the wounded Part is forced to ſee whatſoever Pain puts to it. And therefore is it accounted a great Intention in the Chirurgeon, to allay the fury of this Enemy, and quell this troubleſome authour of Fluxion. And here ought he alſo to remove his Medicines very often, leſt by their too
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59608:29"/>
long ſtay Pain be excited. Then is he to enquire into the cauſe and occaſion of this Pain; and the Species and way of the Humour by which it paſſeth, and which way Nature intends it; and here with her to join his adjutant helps for its remove.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The Second enemy we meet with is Inflammation: and this ofttimes is occaſioned by Pain, and ſometimes by the Unadviſedneſs, Neglect and Ignorance of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, when by too ſtrict Ligatures he maketh a great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Pain, creating an interception of Spirits, and an extinction of native Heat, purchaſing hereby a fair way for a Gangrene and <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> Inflammation alſo is most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be feared in Wounds of the Nerves, Cartilages, and the like; or where but a ſmall Flux of bloud does follow the Wound. In which caſes the Chirurgeon is to breath a Vein, and to take away a plentifull quantity of Bloud: for hereby he doth repreſs the Heat, and extinguiſh the Flame. If Cacochymy offend, correct and amend this by convenient Purgings, and lenifying Medicines, a good order of Diet, and ſuch as may temper the Bloud, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Patient to ſhun all manner of Perturbations, which may create or ſtir up any Paſſions within him. If Inflammation happen by the puncture of a Nerve, or an inciſion thereof, wholly divide it; for it is better that Part ſhould loſe its motion, then that the whole Body ſhould be robbed of its life, as well as of its ſenſe and motion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">3. Haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> I have been very plentifull in the Third already, and ſhall therefore remit you thither for this. Save onely by the way, when you come to Wounds of the Veins and Arteries, I ſhall there enlarge ſomewhat more thereon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. Fainting.</note> As touching <hi>Syncope</hi> or <hi>Lipothymia, Galen,</hi> 12. <hi>Meth. cap.</hi> 5. does thus define it; that it is a principal Lapſe of all the Spirits, happening by ſome hurt of the Heart, or injury done to it, when it is quiet in its procreation and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59608:29"/>
diſtribution of its vitall Spirits. For then, as <hi>Gordonius</hi> doth expreſs it, both ſenſe and motion are taken from the whole Body, the Pulſe becomes flat and dull, and Death appears in the face. And in theſe caſes the Patients are ſeen to fall down without either ſenſe or motion. This <hi>Syncope</hi> which does moſt commonly intervene in Wounds is for the moſt part from an Haemorrhagiall cauſe, the which does make this diſſipation of Spirits; or Fear, the which does make a ſpeedy revocation of the Spirits to the Heart, whence followeth that every Part is forced to leave work, whilſt this Diſturbance is thus in action. A <hi>Syncope</hi> does ofttimes happen, as <hi>Galen</hi> does obſerve, from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenate and putrid Vapour paſſing to the Heart through the Arteries, and to the Brain by its Nerves. And hence by moſt Authours are granted theſe three cauſes of <hi>Syncope.</hi> The firſt is made by the diſſipation of the Spirits and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heat, as in a large Haemorrhagy: then by oppreſſion or obſtruction of theſe Spirits, as in Fear; for thus the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are called back from the Circumference to the Center: and thirdly by Corruption, as in Cacochymick bodies, and venenate Wounds. The firſt of theſe are cured, if conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Medicines be ſpeedily applied and adminiſtred; as by ſprinkling cold water on the face, laying him on his back, and ſtopping his Flux. The ſecond by good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls, by cheriſhing and reviving his Spirits, by clapping ſweet Smells to his noſtrills, frictions of his Temples. But if a venenate Quality does occaſion this, cure this by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate, <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, Actuall Cauteries, application of live Pigeons cut in the middle, Cupping-glaſſes, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation and interception of this Matter which is to be fetched out.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5. <hi>Delirium.</hi>
                  </note> Neither is <hi>Delirium</hi> in Wounds leſs dangerous, which is a perillous Affect ariſing from ſome principall or noble Part, as the Nerves, Brain, Heart, <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and the like, theſe, or any of theſe, being wounded. For this <hi>Delirium</hi> is nothing elſe but a deprivation of Motion, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59608:30"/>
an alienation of Senſe, contained in the wounded Brain by eſſence or conſent. Hence is it, that we ſo oft ſee in ſuch as are bit by a mad Dog, that venomous Vapours do aſcend upwards into their Heads, and fill the poroſities of the Brains, which makes them ſo frantick and idle. It does ariſe from a vehement Pain and Inflammation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Medicines as may cure Pain and Inflammation are very proper here. If it ariſeth from Poyſon, Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmicks are the beſt engines to remove it. For deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interception of the matter which doth excite this <hi>Delirium,</hi> alterant and evacuating Clyſters are here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Phlebotomy, Cupping-glaſſes, Actuall and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Cauteries are here moſt requiſite. Setons and Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinells are fair Orifices for letting out its venome. Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, Emulſions and good Decoctions may defend it from the Heart. Hordeaceous and Papaverall Decoctions may baniſh it, by procuring Reſt. And as it is a deprivation of the principall faculty of Motion, ſo are we to take care of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6. Fever.</note> But becauſe this more properly does belong to a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to examine and adviſe about, I ſhall briefly ſhut up this Symptome, onely acquainting you, that <hi>Avicen, fen.</hi> 1. does call that a Fever, which is an extraneous, adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, accenſive heat in our Heart, by which the Veins and Arteries therewith ſharing, it's carried through the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of our whole Body, and hurteth its actions. Neither is there any Fever allowed where the Heart is not affected, either primarily, or ſecondarily, being a Diſeaſe in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempereity.</p>
               <p>But to come to that which more properly does relate to large Wounds: and here, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> offereth, untill a good Digeſtion be procured, both Fever, Pain and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation do attend the Part: for whilſt the Matter is making, the Heat does increaſe. Sometimes a Fever does ariſe from the Bite of a venomous creature; and therefore as it does carry this poyſonous quality to the Heart, there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59608:30"/>
endeavouring to infect its Spirits, it very readily runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fever and Inflammation. Now where this happens, cool the body by Phlebotomy: if ill Humous do joyn in the combate, diſpatch theſe by convenient Catharticks. And in reſpect of the Poyſon, you muſt uſe Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks: for the Pain and Inflammation, prepare Anodynes; ſhunning all things which may procure a vehement motion, diſturbance and perturbations of the mind; and uſe your greateſt induſtry to bring every part to its due order, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and habit.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">7. Crudity.</note> Crudity alſo is a great enemy to the healing of Wounds; for it does afford no laudable Matter, without which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no good new Fleſh. And this by many Authours is allowed to happen by theſe ſix means: by a continuall <note place="margin">Six things cauſing Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</note>Flux of bloud, where no good Digeſtion is; by an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contuſing the Part, as happens in Gunſhot-wounds; by the nature of the Part, ſuch as deep Wounds in the Joynts; by coldneſs of the Air; by applying of unfit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; and laſtly, by too ſtrict Ligature. As for the firſt, this you have already ſhown. The ſecond is to be digeſted as contuſed Wounds. Aſtringent Medicines are to be applied to the Articulations, to preſerve their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The Air is to be corrected; the Part to be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with convenient Medicines; and the ſtrict Ligature to be relaxed. And thus may you cure theſe ſix Cauſes of Crudity. The other two remaining Symptoms I ſhall ſpeak of a little more largely, they being of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Palſey.</head>
               <p>A Palſey by the generall Conſent of Authours is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Reſolution or Relaxation of the Nervous parts, with Deprivation both of Senſe and Motion, on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, or both ſides of the Body, or in ſome part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this moſt properly is called a Palſey. Now the Nervous bodies are reſolved, in that the animall Spirits do not act in them, neither are they filled or enlightned with vigour and briskneſs. The cauſes whereof are referred to the Obſtruction of the paſſages, the which does hinder their Tranſpiration. In a Palſey, Motion, or Senſe, onely, or both may be hurt together. And this may be acted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Completion, Compreſſion, or Solution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity. For either their Ductures are filled up with ſome extraordinary Matter impacted in them, or compreſſed by extravaſed Bloud or ſome Tumour, or Solution of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity made by ſome Wound or Concuſſion: and every of theſe may imprint their ſeverall reaſons and cauſes for a Palſey. And as our Countryman Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> does obſerve, as often as an univerſall Palſey or <hi>Hemiplexia</hi> does ſucceed a Lethargy, a <hi>Caros,</hi> or Apoplexy, it's very eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this change of the Diſeaſe does happen from a <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> or Tranſpoſition of the morbifick matter. And if it may be enquired why that Senſe and Motion are not alwaies equally inhibited in a Palſey, either of theſe is perfected in their proper Nerves and Fibres, and either Faculty is as the averſion of each other. Juſt as the Light caſteth its beams through a Glaſs, when the Wind is excluded: ſo ofttimes Motion is aboliſhed, the Senſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſafe and ſound. For Senſe is as a Paſſion, a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59608:31"/>
impreſſion, the which by the continuity of the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous proceſs is carried from the Organ to the common Senſory; without which the faculty of the Spirits is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by courſe and ſtrength. Now Motion is a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and difficult action, to the which is required the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion or exploſion of Spirits, not onely in the motionall Organs, but chiefly in the Parts where the beginning of Motion and its firſt affection does draw its Origination. For from hence floweth its whole conduct of its exploſive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, the which it acteth through all its Nervous parts. In the Spinall marrow an Interception of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or Cohibition thereof, making a Palſey, very oft doth happen, by reaſon of Compreſſion, or Solution of Continuity. The extravaſed Bloud, or Matter paſſing forth from the diſrupted Abſceſs, does very oft ſhut up and obſcure the paſſages of the Spirits. Hence Wounds of the Head, Concuſſions or Inciſions do not onely fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pervert or lacerate the Medullary tracts, but alſo by their coldneſs do conſtipate and bind up their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall paſſages.</p>
               <p>The next thing we propoſe is, whether this Diſeaſe be accidentall, or habituall. The firſt may be ſaid to come from an evident cauſe, as being procured by Wounds, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, Concuſſions, Exceſs of cold or heat: beſides which it hath no other then a Compreſſion and Solution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity. An habituall Palſey hath its dependence from a procatarctick cauſe, the which is an extraneous Matter, and as it were vitriolized, ſuffuſed into the Organs of Senſe and Motion, profligating the Spirits by contaction. A Palſey does much differ from a Convulſion, in that in the <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey and a Convulſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cauſes of a Palſey.</note>firſt, Reſolution and Relaxation is its proper quality; in the latter, Contention and Contraction.</p>
               <p>We come now to the Cauſes of this Palſey, which are generally allowed to be both inward and outward. The inward obſtructing the Ventricles of the Brain, ſo as the animall Spirit, which ſhould be conveyed to the Nerves of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59608:32"/>
Senſe and Motion, is wholly aboliſhed. The externall Cauſes being Wounds, Concuſſions, Percuſſions, Inciſions, Compreſſions, or Conſtrictions, or violent Colds occluding the Spirits. From what Humour a Palſey may be ſaid to proceed, is hard to tell. For Melancholy drying the Nerves cannot be the Humour. Choler, having allowed it a drying quality alſo, and having an acrimony joyned to it, may rather be allowed to create Convulſion, by contracting and convelling the Nerves. And therefore it muſt either proceed from the Bloud, or Phlegm. It very rarely happens from Bloud alone, unleſs by accident. It's therefore granted by a generall conſent, that it is bred from thick Phlegm, bordering upon the Nerves. But I rather preſume that it happens from thin Phlegm, which flows from the Brain, and therein does create an Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through its whole ſubſtance, making it more ſoft, out of which ſoftneſs there follows an exploſion of the Nerves. A ſubſtance very contrary to its naturall Conſtruction, the which does wholly aboliſh the motion of the Nerves where it is inſerted. Thus if the whole ſpinall Marrow be affected, there does ſucceed a Reſolution of the whole from the Head; if onely one part, that part onely bears the loſs. Thus have we given a brief diſcourſe of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, and its inward and outward cauſes: let us now come more cloſely to that which chiefly does belong to our preſent diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>When therefore a Nerve is wounded or amputated, there muſt neceſſarily follow a Palſey upon the part, becauſe both Senſe and Motion in the action are loſt and baniſhed; and being thus divided, it's impoſſible to fetch them again: for being once cut, they do gather towards their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls. Therefore when any Nerve is either inciſed, cut or punctured, Pain being hereupon a very ready atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, Anodynes are here moſt proper, defending the Wound from cold and all ſharp things, and uſe comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and ſtrengthening Medicines. But of theſe more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59608:32"/>
                  <note place="margin">Signs of a Palſey, and Cauſes.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> does give all good Chirurgeons this Caution, that he ought to underſtand the primary Affect hereof and its place, and from whence this miſchief ariſeth, and its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And he who is ignorant of theſe, may not be allowed skilfull enough to cure thoſe Parts whoſe Senſe and Motion are vitiated. The firſt we do fetch from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy, which is an excellent Schoolmaſter, the which perfectly learneth us how to know the Nerves which are ſprinkled about the Face, ſent thither from the Brain. If ſome of theſe with the whole Body be reſolved, it cannot in reaſon be allowed, that this diſpoſition of Reſolution ſhould conſiſt in the Brain it ſelf, whereas the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Face do remain unhurt and ſafe. If all the parts of the Head being ſound, either of its ſides be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repted with a <hi>Paralyſis,</hi> the cauſe is in one of the ſides of the ſpinall Marrow. If the Arms be onely paralytick, the cauſe is in the fifth, ſixth, or ſeventh <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck. If the Legs, draw the cauſe from the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and its <hi>Vertebrae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Preſages.</note> To preſage and judge of a Palſey, and every occaſion which may cauſe and produce it, and every affect of the Nerves, as touching their ſickneſſes or cures, this moſt properly does belong to the Prognoſtick part. And thus according to <hi>Hipp.</hi> we may preſage that a Palſey is hard to cure in old men, becauſe their native Heat is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extinguiſhed. And <hi>Galen</hi> does affirm, if Fever and Trembling have ſupervened a Palſey, it's a good ſign: for Fevers do partly diſſolve the ſuperfluous Humours which are in Reſolution of the Nerves, and do partly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt their coldneſs. A Solution of the Nerves, as <hi>Galen</hi> does worthily declare, is never perfectly cured. A Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey proceeding from an inward cauſe is not eaſily found out, or eaſily cured. A Palſey following an Apoplexy is ſcarce curable, the cauſe being vehement, and the Parts weak. Where Senſe and Motion do appear to be both loſt, this does prove very dangerous. If the Paraliſed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59608:33"/>
member do change its colour, expect no Cure, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heat is extinguiſhed, and the animal Spirits aboliſhed. If it happen from an evident cauſe, as by a Blow, a Wound, or the like, if it do not quickly amend, or give way to Medicines, it does prove for the moſt part incurable. Such as are once cured of a Palſey ariſing from an evident cauſe, are not readily troubled therewith a ſecond time. And to conclude the Preſages, if Palſeys happen in Aged peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or in Cacochymick or Scorbutick bodies, and in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempereities, theſe are very hard to remove.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> And ſince, as I have already propoſed, we ſee that a Palſey does conſiſt of manifold Types and divers Cauſes, its Cure is alſo to be performed after a various manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a proper method to every ſpecies of the Diſeaſe. And as there are generally allowed three kinds or ſorts hereof, ſo ſhould there be propoſed three kinds of Cure. Firſt, for Reſolution, this being the main Agent, this is to be cured, Secondly, if it happen by Wound, Inciſion, exceſſive Cold, or a Fall from a high place, this alſo muſt have allowed it its way of Cure. Thirdly, as it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catarctick and primary Diſeaſe of it ſelf. I muſt leave the firſt and third, and onely take the ſecond for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>And whereas we here do grant, that this Palſey does happen by ſome Accident, produced by ſome vehement Hurt, there will not be required many Intentions for this, ſave onely the Conformity of the hurt Part to be made into its priſtine frame. And that no Affect, as Bloud or affluent Humours, may bring detriment to the affected Part, Phlebotomy in this caſe is very ſpeedily to be made uſe of, if nothing hinders it; and the Body is to be kept open by lenifying Purgings, and a good order of Diet, keeping your Patient in a moderate Sweat in his bed, ſo as all Superfluities may be exhaled and called back from the hurt Part. And for this Uſe <hi>Pulvis ad Caſum</hi> is granted a good Medicine, to be given in White wine, to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59608:33"/>
the quantity of a Drachm or a Drachm and a half. A common Decoction of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> is alſo much commended here, for this does both digeſt and diſcuſs the Matter and Cauſe.

                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> I conclude this Chapter with this Hiſtory of a young Gentleman, who being of a ſanguine Conſtitution, after eating a large Supper, did drink very plentifully of Wine. As he ſat in his chair, he was ſuddenly ſurprized with a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59608:35"/>
Stupidity in his Right hand, ſo that the Glove which did cover his hand did involuntarily fall of. He endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ariſe thence and walk, did perceive a Reſolution in his Thigh and Leg on the ſame ſide. A ſmall while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, falling into a Drowzineſs of mind, and a Sleepineſs, without an Apoplexy, being asked ſeverall queſtions, he very aptly anſwered them, yet ſlowly, and as it were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed. A worthy Phyſician being ſent for, Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Purging and Vomiting being in their orders uſed, and Cupping-glaſſes, Frictions, Scarifications and Liniments being with care adminiſtred, yet the Palſy did creep ſo faſt on that ſide, that the Member had almoſt wholly loſt its motion: with which he loſt the ſight of his Eye on that ſide. And all proper Medicines taking no place, the animall Faculties daily decayed; ſo that about the ſeventh or eighth day falling into a <hi>Delirium,</hi> and afterwards into a Convulſion, he was within a ſhort while forced to ſhut up his laſt minute, his Spirits being diſſolved. The dead Corps being opened, the anteriour Cavity of the Brain was ſeen filled partly with an Ichorous, partly with a concrete and grumous Bloud, accompanied with plenty of <hi>Serum.</hi> Hence (as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> does conjecture, who was the Authour of this Hiſtory) in reſpect of this <hi>Illuvies</hi> compreſſing one Striated body, and conſtringing its pores and paſſages, it hindred the afflux of Spirits paſſing into the Nervous appendix of that ſide; and hereby a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being excited in the reſpective Members, and alſo a Compreſſion, by reaſon of the <hi>Thalamus Opticus</hi> to which the Striated body is inſerted, the ſight of the Eye on this ſide was wholly divided.</p>

               <p>AMongſt all the preternaturall Affects which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent in Solution of Continuity, and which do bring danger of Inflammations, Watchings, <hi>Delirium,</hi> and Convulſion, Wounds of the Nerves and Nervous parts are moſt dangerous: for theſe ſeldome do goe without their Symptoms. This Convulſion in Wounds is a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Symptome, for it is an involuntary Contraction of the Parts towards their Originall, proſternating their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Pain, aboliſhing all voluntary Motion, without which Life is but a troubleſome thing. And that it is a morbifick cauſe may from hence be collected, in that it does deprive the Parts of their proper Motion. For as when Deglutition is hindred, there does follow an Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all parts, ſo conſequently a Conſumption. Even thus while the Urine or Excrements are detained, Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are made in the Cavities: and alſo in Intempereity, Magnitude, and Solution of Continuity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion is.</note> The Nature therefore of a Convulſion is diligently and carefully to be minded and conſidered, and its Cauſes, that we may better find out the way of its thus happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Wounds. We allow therefore that a Spaſm is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Motion happening in the voluntary moving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and is a nervous Diſtempereity, by which contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Muſcles they are altogether made incapable of extention; and it is a principall affection of the Nerves, which do obey a voluntary command. And that this deſcription may the better be underſtood, we may much enlarge in our knowledge hereof by Anatomy. All Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59608:36"/>
being procurated and procured by the animall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which are exerciſed and performed by the Muſcles and their Tendons, as by their proper Inſtruments; whilſt theſe Muſcles do contract their Beginning and <hi>Radix</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their End, they alſo do draw with them their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed Members, as Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments. For no proper animall Motion can be made in any living creature without Muſcles, and theſe do take their moving Faculty from the Brain. For although the Brain it ſelf be not fibrous, the body of its Nerves is fibrous: and theſe are the meſſengers which do convey this Spirit into the Muſcles, and through them, which do give them both their ſenſe and motion. Now therefore, when by any preternaturall affect the Nerves or Tendons are pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, inflamed, or otherwiſe hurt, they do recede from their priſtine vigour, and do prove incapable Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and hence follows Convulſion, or that contractive motion we call a Spaſm. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 39. writes, a Convulſion to be a hurting of the voluntary Function, becauſe herein the moving quality is as it were tied up from acting in its proper ſphere; and thus Motion is hindred, the Inſtrument thereof not being wanting, but hindred in its action by being girt up by the Diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity of the Inſtrument. And therefore Spaſm or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion by <hi>Johan. Andr. à Cruce</hi> is deſcribed as a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of a Diſeaſe, not of a Faculty.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion.</note> There are allowed generally to be three ſpecies of a Spaſm. If the Affect do ariſe in the Anteriour part, this Convulſion by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <hi>Emproſthotonos:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is all one with <hi>ante</hi> in <hi>Latine.</hi> By ſome it is called <hi>Convulſio domeſticalis.</hi> This is made, when not onely the Neck but the other Parts of the body are drawn forwards. If it poſſeſs the Back-part, it is called <hi>Opiſthotonos,</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the ſame to <hi>retro</hi> in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> And this happens when the Muſcles which do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect the Body are hurt backwards. By ſome this is called
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59608:36"/>
                  <hi>Convulſio Scapuloſa.</hi> The third is <hi>Tetanos,</hi> or <hi>Totum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſum:</hi> and this Convulſion is made, when all the fore and back Parts of the body are equally contracted, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them as it were at a ſtay, and making them very ſtiff. <hi>Celſus</hi> does declare, that there is no Diſeaſe more outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, cruell, and acute, then that which by a <hi>Rigor</hi> or Stiffneſs of the Nerves and Sinews does annex the Head to the <hi>Scapula's,</hi> the Chin to the Breaſt, and maketh the Neck right and immovable. In which Diſcourſe he hath both briefly and elegantly ſet down the three differences of Spaſm, which we have been diſcourſing of. He hath alſo a fourth Species there of a Spaſm, which he calls <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmus Cynicus;</hi> as when the Mouth is pulled awry, or one or both Hands be contracted.</p>
               <p>All the chief cauſes which do produce theſe Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are by him reckoned as three: <hi>(viz.)</hi> Plethory, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anition, and Sympathy. Of theſe in their Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Plethory.</note> I begin with Plethory, ſo called from its copiouſneſs and plenitude of divers Humidities, the which do replete and poſſeſs the Inſtruments of voluntary Motion; as the Body being thick and fleſhy, the Veſſells full, the Pulſe ſtrong, the Age ripe, the Complexion ſanguine, and the like. Thus by Plethory or Plenitude Convulſion may be ſaid to be made, when the Nervous bodies and their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres are nouriſhed with thick and glutinous Matter, and are therewith alſo repleted: by which Repletion they are diſtended; and hence, as they fill out in bulk, they do ſhorten in their length: hence do they become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and abbreviated, and ſo are they run into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Inanition.</note> The Second is Inanition: and this is made for want of naturall Moiſture; the Nerves being hereof deſtitute, do ſoon grow dry and ſhort. For they muſt needs grow ſhorter, as does a Cord, when once being wet, and dried again, it ſhrinks and ſhrivells up: ſo alſo do the Nerves being corrugated. The Diſeaſe therefore which does fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59608:37"/>
a Convulſion is a perverſe figure of the Muſcles, in which they are made ſhorter by Inanition as well as Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus every humourall Matter which may be ſaid to fill the Fibres, may alſo be allowed to create a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion. And this may be confirmed of Inanition, that every thing which hath power to make this, hath alſo ſtrength enough in it to frame a Spaſm. And hence ſometimes immoderate Evacuations or Vomitings, which are allowed to dry very much, do ſo ofttimes bid fair to a Convulſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sympathy or Conſent.</note> A Third Cauſe is called Sympathy: and this is ſaid to happen by malign Vapours offending the Originations of the Nerves, as it is ofttimes ſeen in poyſoned Wounds. Another is ſaid to be made by Pain attracting the Nerves from their Originations. A third which may offer it ſelf is from immoderate Cold, cauſing in them a great Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>What remains in the Cauſes of Convulſion is, to ſhew how this may be made in Wounds. And here may we ſee how this may be made out of Plethory, the Nerves being filled with purulent Matter, or other Excrements, generated either in the wounded Part, or ſent thither from other Parts, and ſo ſucked up by the Nerves; as it oft happens when a Nerve is half divided or cut: or by reaſon of Inflammation, the Part being filled with a large Flux of bloud, and ſo diſtending the Nervous parts; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if this Diſaffection be communicated to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of them, or the Nerve it ſelf be primarily offended. And hereby the Muſcles become ſhorter, and ſo forced to contract towards their Originall, neither by Heat alone, but alſo by immoderate Cold in Wounds of the Nerves and Nervous parts, hereby ſuffering Convulſion, this prohibiting the Excretion of Excrements, and ſhutting up and condenſing the Porous bodies. Out of Inanition may alſo be made Convulſion, and this alſo by Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and this moſt generally happens in Wounds of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59608:37"/>
Nervous parts. For thus the inflamed Part is convelled, and anſwers directly to Convulſion, and hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates it ſelf to ſome principall Part, the which being there received, does communicate of its Diſtempereity through the whole Body. Convulſion does ofttimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Wounds of the Nervous parts, in reſpect of exſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wounded Part, which does ſend forth its ill habits to the Brain, the Origination of them, by which the Brain it ſelf is vellicated and irritated: and being thus concuſſed, that it may clear it ſelf from the miſchief this portends it, and give a <hi>quietus</hi> to this unhappy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there muſt neceſſarily follow Convulſion upon this combate in the ſubject Parts. But ſuch motions as theſe do prove generally univerſall, even as the ſpirituous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is carried to the Brain through the affected Nerve, being either prickt, cut, or hurt, containing a putredneſs in it.

The greater is the Pain when made by Repletion: and this Affect hereby is ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, when it is communicated to a principall Part. This you may collect from theſe Signs: in that the Throat is narrowed, the Teeth conſtringed, the Mouth is not to be opened, the Lips contracted, the Neck and Back pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Eyes and whole Face perverted; and after theſe the Patient does breath with difficulty, and his Breath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercepted, he parts ſpeedily from his Life. If by reaſon of a Wound <hi>Tetanos</hi> or Diſtention does happen, the Patient's Mandibles are conglutinated, he cannot open his Mouth, his Eyes are filled with tears and contracted, his poſteriour Parts are convelled, and his Body is bent backwards. Hence do ariſe vehement Pains, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

the Patient cannot either contract his Thighs, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Hands. In <hi>Emproſthotonos</hi> the Body bendeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together forwards, and the Parts are contrarily diſpoſed to the former. And this is to be underſtood of thoſe Parts which could bend either way. The Leg cannot be bent forwards, or the Thigh backwards.</p>

Being carried in this condition to her Father's houſe, he viewed the Wound, which was almoſt in the middle of her Back, to which he applied himſelf; the which he conjectured was occaſioned by her Fall. Upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her upper parts, finding no harm or defect there, the lower parts remaining ſtupid, dull and reſolved, the Chirurgeon immediately did apply hot Stupes to her feet, by which was ſuſcitated ſomewhat of Heat. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called in to adviſe, examined the whole occaſion of this miſchief, and inquired into its cauſe from the Patient. She replied, the hearing a Piſtol ſhot off unawares by one riding by her in the road ſo affrighted her, that ſhe fell from her horſe; upon receiving of which Fall ſhe felt a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59608:40"/>
grievous Pain in her Back: growing faint herewith, and coming to her ſelf, ſhe complained of her Back being wounded and reſolved. Upon examining the Wound, which was on the right ſide of her Back, near the eighth and ninth Ribs, coming downwards obliquely towards the Spine, he found it exactly round: and whereas in its Circumference there appeared no ſign of Contuſion, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting it to have happened by the force of the Shot, he ordered her Cloaths to be examined, in which he alſo found a hole made by the Bullet; upon which he fairly conjectured, that this Wound was made by this Shot, and that it had penetrated the Spinall marrow. Divers Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons being called into Conſultation, they all did judge the ſame, and by a generall conſent, a Probe being ſent into the Wound, part of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> was found to be lacerated. Ten daies being expired ſince the hurt, ſhe grew worſe, and troubled with Vomiting and a great Heat in the upper part of her Spine, with pain of her Head, and Spaſm about her Neck.

And becauſe a great diſpute did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe at her death, what might be the occaſion thereof, whether the Fall or the Shot, upon Diſſection, and by dilating of the Wound, ſome part of the Spine being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the leaden Bullet did ſhew it ſelf lodged, the which had lacerated the Spinall marrow.</p>

               <p>WE ought to deal with all Wounds ſo as they may anſwer expectation: and now coming to Caver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Wounds, we may as readily account that a Hollow Wound, which hath not onely loſt a part of its Fleſh, but that alſo which happeneth by a ſimple Inciſion, without loſs of Fleſh, the Lips of which Wound, by reaſon of the greatneſs and large diſtance, cannot be aptly united in the bottome, whence there does remain a Cavity therein. And as for the Cure hereof, we are firſt to mind the Flux, for avoiding of Inflammation. And if occaſion ſerve, and the time of the year does require it, we may breath a Vein, and preſcribe cooling Syrups and Decoctions, and order Purgations, and ſuch a thin Diet as may keep the Body in good temper. And becauſe in ſuch large and hollow Wounds there is generally ſeen ſome preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Matter to lodge in their bottomes, the which the Part of it ſelf is not capable to diſcharge; we here ought in the firſt place to uſe Digeſtives, hereby to digeſt the Matter, and to bring it into a laudable ſubſtance, that is, ſuch a Matter as is both white, ſmooth, equall, and void
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59608:42"/>
of all bad ſmell. And theſe are to be applied no longer, then while this laudable Matter is made, and all Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be removed, keeping and preſerving the naturall Temper of the Parts. And herein Nature is very ready to aſſiſt in this Operation: for as the Part is fleſhy, this is ſuddenly renewed, and reſtored by Bloud lodged in the Muſcles, out of which is generated a new Fleſh.

               <head type="sub">Of a Contuſed Wound.</head>
               <p>WE have already ſhewn how a Simple wound is to be cured; but when any other Affect is joyned to it, this Affect is firſt to be cured, and then the Wound. <hi>Galen</hi> doth adviſe, if any <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> Contuſion, <hi>Ecchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59608:43"/>
                  <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> or the like, ſhould happen upon a Wound, theſe are firſt to be removed; for they onely do adde fewell to the fire. And this is held a certain rule amongſt all Authours, that we muſt never expect to cure a Wound, untill we have conquered the Symptoms. For as the Wound of it ſelf doth onely require Deſiccation; ſo having Contuſion joyned to it, this is readily to be turned into Putrefaction, and that to be converted into laudable Matter. And becauſe the ordinary entrance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cure of this Wound is ofttimes intercepted by the importunity of Accidents, let it be your firſt care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe, and then proceed to the Cure it ſelf. If the Accident be Pain or Tumour, allay the Pain by ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodyne Medicine; of which ſort are <hi>Ol. Aneth. Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. Lilior. Roſarum, Crocus,</hi> and the like. Abate the Tumour by removing both its antecedent and conjunct Cauſe; the firſt being the Humour firſt flowing, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being that part of Humour which hath already made its flux. As to the firſt, if it proceed of Bloud occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fluxion, this is to be let out or diſcharged by the place from whence it floweth, or by the place to which it floweth. This Paſſion is curbed and bridled by Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy, and a cooling Diet: and to keep it from flowing further, Revulſion and Repulſion are two proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to effect this; the firſt withdrawing and courting the Humour into another part, the other repelling it when it is once ſent. If other Humours do occaſion this Fluxion, then diſcharge theſe by Catharticks, and ſuch as may anſwer the nature of the Humour.</p>
               <p>We come next to the Wound it ſelf: and here are we chiefly to conſider theſe two Intentions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Suppuration, and then to generate a new Fleſh. And becauſe, as <hi>Galen</hi> preſcribes, every Suppuration is to be procured by Putrefaction, and every thing that putrefies is affected with a hot and moiſt Humour, the chief Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore here is, to apply ſuch Medicines as may

               <head type="sub">Of <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> or Contuſion.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ECchymoſis,</hi> or an Effuſion of bloud coagulated under the Skin, is allowed a Solution of Continuity, the which is generally accompanied with ſome Contuſion and Ruption. The Cauſes of which, whether procured by ſome Fall, Stroke, or other Accident, you will beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the Patient's own diſcourſe. This <hi>Ecchymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> does ſometimes happen by the Apertion of the mouth of ſome Veſſell, and then this is called <hi>Anaſtomoſis:</hi> the which is procured in reſpect of the Weakneſs of ſome Veſſell in that part where this plenty of bloud is ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59608:44"/>
or by ſome inward ſharp Matter which is allowed to have an inciſive quality; or by <hi>Diapedeſis,</hi> the which is a Tranſcolation or Exilition; this alſo ariſing from the Coat of the Veſſell being made rare and thin, and the Bloud being alſo thin. But our preſent diſcourſe does onely reach that which is made by Contuſion.</p>
               <p>This therefore is allowed a Solution of Continuity; and in reſpect of its profuſion of bloud it produceth Pain, and hence ſometimes do follow Abſceſſes, the which by Tranſpiration are to be digeſted. A large Contuſion is not without danger, for this does very often not onely procure Corruption of the Part it ſelf, but alſo of the whole Body. This is generally reputed an <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of an <hi>Ecchymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>
                  </note>in the which there is both a ſeparation and dilaceration of the Muſculous parts, whilſt Attrition is allowed to be in the head and tail of the Muſcle. It taketh its diverſity of figure from its variety of cauſe: the Parts about it are black, the Bloud being ſhut up therein, and cannot be diſcharged by inſenſible or ſenſible Tranſpiration, but by Suppuration. According to the greatneſs of the hurt may you judge of the danger; for great Contuſions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying large Wounds do run the Part into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, that obtuſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the moſt proper engines for Contuſion and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, the moſt proper Medicine for the cure of this ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Suppurativum:</hi> the which ought to be temperate in heat and humour, Emplaſtick, and obſtructing the Pores, and ſuch as may generate Matter.
It ought alſo to ſecond the nature and ſubſtance of the native Heat, and by degrees to encreaſe it. Hence is it, that in creating of Matter the Humour is ſomewhat alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and if this Contuſion does happen in any Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous parts, that Part onely does maintain the Bruiſe which received the Blow or Hurt, whilſt the circumjacent Parts do retain their own proper nature. For the Bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59608:45"/>
out of its proper Cavity, does force it ſelf into ſome other; and being in its motion hindred, does change its firſt rudiment. And hence was it that <hi>Philalethus</hi> ſaith, that Bloud, Seed, and Milk, being out of their proper places, do ſoon run into knotty lumps and putrefy. Now in Converſion of this Bloud into Matter, there is made a Pulſation in the Arteries lodging in the Fleſh, the which Pulſation the ſound man does not perceive, it lying there without Pain; and alſo in reſpect of the great ſpace which is allowed them for their operation. But where there does ariſe Inflammation, <hi>Ecchymoſis, Eryſipelas,</hi> or Abſceſs, with Pain, the Wounds are alſo inflamed, when they tend to Suppuration; becauſe this putrefying Bloud does ſoon grow hot and fiery, and in this Ebullition and Fervour of the Bloud Vapours are raiſed, the which alſo are communicated to the neighbouring Parts, and therein do alſo generate an Inflammation. And this is done by Conſent of Parts. The Heart taking its ſhare of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation does create a Fever, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> offereth, <hi>cap.</hi> 47. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. Whilſt Matter is making, it occaſioneth more Pain, and does more readily ſubject the Patient to Fevers, more then when it is accompliſhed. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Matter does fetch its origination from ſtrange Bloud, over-heated, untill putrefying it is turned into another ſubſtance.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In an <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> therefore are we ſpeedily to procure Suppuration: and whereas Fluxion is chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſtudy its Evacuation, by diminiſhing its ſtore which maintains it, by Phlebotomy, if nothing may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, by Revulſion to change its courſe; and then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this concreted Bloud, the which if it be in the Body, is to be ſcattered by inward Medicines, by ſuch as can both diſſolve the concreted Bloud, and alſo ſtrengthen the Parts.

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds made by the Biting of mad Dogs.</head>
               <p>WE arrive now at ſuch Wounds as do happen by the Biting of mad Dogs, and of other venomous creatures: and although other creatures, as Wolves, Cats, Foxes, and the like, may be mad; yet moſt who have writ of this ſubject do give the firſt denomination to the Dog, as <hi>Antiochus, Paulus Aegineta, Oribaſius, Cornelius Celſus,</hi> and others. The generall repute of the Biting of Animalls is allowed to come under a double difference; for ſome are venenate in their proper nature, and others are leſs venenate. Thoſe are reputed venenate, which are lodged in venenate and virulent Beaſts; and amongſt theſe are reckoned the mad Dog, Serpents, Adders, Scorpions, Baſilisks, Vipers, Waſps, and the like. Others are ſaid to be leſs venenate, which have not in them this virulent ſpirit; of which ſort may be reckoned Man, a Dog that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59608:47"/>
is tame, a Monkey, Horſes, Swine, and the like. The Signs of either do declare their nature. Thoſe which are venomous are moſt dangerous, and great care not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had, they do commit their Venome to ſome noble Part, and there implanting the poyſon, do ſoon cauſe a ſpeedy Death. <hi>Gordonius</hi> reporteth, that the Biting of a mad Dog is moſt dangerous; for although the Patient do not feel it at preſent, yet this lurking Poyſon ſome while after makes its appearance. I have read of a Boy, who being bit by a mad Dog, and being well after it for ſix weeks, after this died of the Bite he received.</p>
               <p>Seeing the danger is great, and how it aims at the Principalls of life, let us conſult a while the reaſon of this Poyſon, and how it does communicate it ſelf. <hi>Read</hi> tells us it is communicated theſe two waies; by Biting and Slaver, and by Slaver without Biting. This is ſometimes received by the thick Skin of any Part. And this <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeus</hi> makes good, <hi>Conſ.</hi> 82. where he affirms of one putting his hand into a mad Dog's mouth, that within few daies after he became mad himſelf. It ſooner ſeizeth on ſome Parts then on others, and is alſo more readily taken by ſome Perſons then others. For it hath ſhewn its rage in ſome ſpeedily, whilſt in others it hath had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies and weeks to act its envy and malicious terrour. And hence may we collect, that this Spittle is pernicious which is contained in the Mouth, and thus agitated, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and elaborated into the form of Froath, the which does carry an acrimony and venenoſity with it, by reaſon of Choler which moves it, and this Tyrant does make this ebullition; the which being once made, is ſent into the Wounds by the Teeth; by which impreſſion it is carried into the Body and its circumſtantiall Parts; the which if they happen to be nervous, theſe are preſently ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the venenoſity of the Humour, and hereby oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Spaſm and Convulſive motions are created. If it enters either the Veins or Arteries, it ſpeedily doth ſend
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59608:47"/>
its venenate Vapour through theſe to the Heart, and doth there tyrannize, ſtirring up Fevers, and exciting <hi>Syncope's,</hi> ſometimes running the Part into a Gangrene and <hi>Sphace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> by overcoming the naturall Heat by its venomous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the knowledge of the Dog, whether mad or not, you may well gueſs at it by the Wound: for, as <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Rhaſis</hi> write, if we rub the Wound with a piece of Bread, ſo as it may ſuck up the Bloud and Matter which cometh out of the Wound, this being offered to a Dog, if he refuſe to eat it, or to ſmell to it, it declares much of the Dog's being mad. Let theſe Signs ſerve for Madneſs confirmed; the Patient becomes <note place="margin">Signs of a mad Dog's Bite.</note>troubleſome, and foameth at his Mouth, he hateth water and all liquid things, theſe being the cauſe and occaſion of his Madneſs, his Pulſe is ſmall and inordinate, his Members dull and heavy, his Voice hoarſe, and his Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing difficult. If he dies of his Bite, he is troubled with <hi>Syncope's,</hi> and a little before his departure you will meet him Convulſive.</p>

The Patient not underſtanding where this and how perniciouſly it lodged, it at length made way to his Heart; the which when it had ſeized, it there fixed its moſt implacable impreſſes of ſorrow and pain, ſo as he could neither ſtand, goe, or lie in quiet, but like one diſtracted ſteered a very diſorderly courſe, growing very thirſty: and that which heightned and added to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, he could not endure the ſight of any liquid things, and had rather yield to death then to take any Cordialls or Juleps, were they never ſo advantageous. Hence did ariſe a foaming at his mouth, his eyes being ſtrangely fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and within a few daies after theſe direfull Symptoms made him yield to the grave.</p>

So ſoon as he was bitten in the Hand, he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Wound with his lips, hereby thinking to mitigate the pain, and extract the poyſon: but ſo ſoon as his tongue had touched the Wound, it ſwelled ſo big, that it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his ſpeech; beſides which, his Arm even to his Shoulder ſo tumefied, and cauſed ſuch ſharp pains, that he twice fainted away. In this miſerable condition being undertaken by him, he waſhed his Mouth with Treacle diſſolved in White wine, adding to it <hi>Aqua vitae;</hi> the Arm was ſcarified with many and deep Scarifications; and the Bloud, which was both wateriſh and full of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> was permitted to flow plentifully from the inciſed Parts, the which were afterwards well waſhed with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate and Treacle diſſolved in <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was after this committed to his warm bed, and there cauſed to ſweat, not to ſleep, leſt hereby the Poyſon might be drawn to the inward Parts. By this method all the malign Symptoms ceaſed, and the Wound was kept open for a long while, for the diſcharge of the peccant Matter, and waſhed with Treacle and Wine: and within a ſmall while after he recovered. (By the way, ſuch people who do make it their trade to catch Adders, do apply the Powder of them to the affected Part, if they be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and do take the ſame inwardly.)</p>

This onely I ſhall aſſert, it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not as do Frogs, but creepeth ſlowly; partly by reaſon of its ſhort legs, and partly in reſpect of its dull body.

               <p>I will conclude this with two remarkable Hiſtories. <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note>The firſt is of <hi>Johannes Boccatius,</hi> who while he was ſporting with his Beloved in his Garden near a bed of Sage, by rubbing his Teeth and Gums with ſome of the Sage-leaves, he ſpeedily died. His Wife was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Judge, who enquiring of her how her Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poyſoned, ſhe carried with her ſome of the ſame Sage-leaves to ſhew him, and taſting thereof in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, died alſo, to the great admiration of all the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders. The wiſe Judge conſidering of which, did much ſuſpect this Sage, and ordered it to be pluckt up from the roots, and commanded it to be committed to a workman's care to clear the ground: upon the doing of which, there appeared a great black Toad, which had harboured at the bottome of the Sage, the which by its poyſonous Vapour and tabifick <hi>Illuvies</hi> did infect the whole Plant with its venomous <hi>Saliva</hi> or Slaver; theſe two taking whereof, it did occaſion the loſs of both their Lives. And hence may be collected, although Toads have no Teeth, yet have they heard Gums, and the parts to which they adhere they do ſo cloſely conſtringe and cloſe, that they compell and force their whole Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into the whole part, and thereby do infect the whole Body by their faſtning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:59608:50"/>
                  <note place="margin">Another.</note> I have alſo read from a very Worthy Friend, of two Merchants, who while Dinner was providing, took a few turns about the Garden which belonged to the Houſe, wherein they delighted themſelves with the beauty and ſhape of the Sage-leaf; of which they pluckt ſome, and theſe being unwaſht they put them into a Glaſs of Wine. They had ſcarce dined, but by drinking of this Wine they were taken with a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> all things ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to their view to turn round: and being thus blinded, they both fell into a <hi>Syncope,</hi> and were ſpeedily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards overtaken with Convulſion; their Tongues and Lips grew black, with a horrid Aſpect, accompanied with cold Sweats, and their whole Bodies were raiſed into a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour by this Venome; whereupon both very ſuddenly died. It being generally reported that they were both poyſoned, the man of the houſe and his ſervants were all convened before a Judge, for ſuſpicion of poyſoning theſe two Gentlemen; who upon their Examination declared by a generall conſent, that themſelves putting ſome Sage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves into their Wine were herewith poyſoned. The Judge hereupon ſending for a Phyſician, and enquiring of him whether Sage might be infected with Poyſon, he preſently aſſerted it might. He further enquired of the Maſter of the Garden, whether any virulent Slaver, Froath, or Matter, was upon the Sage. To which they all readily anſwered, There was. And upon making a Cavity at the bottome of the Sage-bed, there was found a great Toad, the which then was conjectured to poyſon the Plant at the root by its Slaver and venenate Liquor. And hence may we collect how imprudent all ſuch men are, who do readily eat Herbs and Fruits newly plucked, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either waſhed or wiped.</p>

that is, <hi>Pharmacum homicidum quaerens, ut ei eſſet unde ſagittas oblineret.</hi> But as touching Poyſon it ſelf, it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally allowed a compound ſubſtance, not naturall, the Heart's great enemy, and that treacherous Invader which does corrupt the whole Body, and does overthrow the naturall Temper thereof. And as touching this, there are various Opinions extant: for ſome there are who write, that it may be ſo made, that it cannot inflict its cruelty in ſome in a moneth; in others in the ſpace of a year,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59608:51"/>
in ſome in a greater time. And that it may be ſo made, as to kill ſooner or later, is out of doubt. Now that which it chiefly aims at is the deſtruction of the native Heat and radicall Moiſture, endeavouring both to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and corrupt them. It hath various ſubjects on which it hath its dependance, as a Vapour, Juice, or a terreſtriall ſubſtance: and theſe three do comprehend all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophraſtus, lib. Plant.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. writes, that the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> did anoint their Arrows with a peſtiferous Root. Lead alſo is very ready to take the impreſs of Poyſon: for both Nature and Experience do make good, that as Metalls are purged by the Fire, and ſo forced to leave their terrene and faeculent ſubſtance and impurities; ſo although the Fire does perform this very exactly, yet theſe Metalls may imbibe a ſtrange ſubſtance by their nature. As for example, take Vinegar, Soot, Salt, and the Juice of Horſe-Radiſh-root, and mix them together, and let them dry, and you will find them make the ſubſtance of Iron. And Iron it ſelf, being ofttimes infuſed herein, will ſoon harden at that rate, that unleſs you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the ſame, you can ſcarce give credit to it: and on the contrary, being oft extinguiſhed in the Juice of Hemlock, Soap, and Marſh-mallows, it will ſpeedily grow ſoft. Tin and Lead being ofttimes extinguiſhed in the Juice of Squills, do ſo affect theſe, that they do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath their outward coat, whilſt the other thereby is made black and ſoft. The which could not be, if they retained not in them ſome of its ſpirit and virtue. And although the Fire doth diſmiſs and purge theſe, yet they may be granted with eaſe to imbibe another kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Thus how oft have we ſeen Copper tinged and grow yellow by applying to it ſpirit of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> and Tutty; and again to grow white, by the ſpirit of Arſenick, Orpiment, and the like? Whence we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that Metalls, out of which theſe Inſtruments of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59608:52"/>
are made, as Shot, Bullets, and the like, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſpirituous ſubſtance anſwering their nature, out of which, as out of ſo many various mercuriall, foetid and lethiferous waters, they ſeem to be framed, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Juice of Wolfsbane, Squills, <hi>Apium Riſûs,</hi> or <hi>Herba Sardonica,</hi> and the like, and of venomous Beaſts, which by reaſon of their contrariety of ſubſtance do hurt and corrupt our ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>As thus, for example: <hi>Apium Riſûs</hi> does infect by Laughing; of which <hi>Apuleius</hi> ſaith, that if one take thereof in the morning faſting, it kills him with Laughing. <hi>Tragus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 159. writes of a Woman gathering an Hemlock-root amongſt Parſnips, and boiling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and eating thereof, that it made her as it were ſo intoxicated, that ſhe endeavoured to climb up the houſe, and did think ſhe could fly. But by taking a draught of Vinegar ſhe was recovered hereof. A man having the Juice of Wolfsbane mixed with his Bread died the third day, with a great company of formidable Symptoms which attended him. This is reputed to have in it that venome that is ſcarce to be overcome by the beſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexipharmicks. Nightſhade alſo hath allowed a veneni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick quality, as <hi>Tragus</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Hiſtor. Stirp. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 43. <hi>Mercurialis.</hi> writes, that the Mandrake-apple, called by ſome <hi>Bella Donna,</hi> being eaten by ſome Children, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to feed on it by its fair and beautifull looks, it hath ſpeedily killed them. <hi>Lemnius</hi> declares, <hi>Herb. bib. cap.</hi> 12. that having in Summer-time careleſly gathered a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drake-apple, he did hang this fair and ſpecious fruit in his Cloſet, where ſitting a while he grew ſo ſleepy, that he could ſcarce ſhake it off, forgetting his Apple did hang over his Head. Waking on a ſudden, and conſulting with himſelf what was or might be the cauſe of this his Sleepineſs, and caſting his eyes upwards, he eſpied this Apple hanging over his Head, and removed it: the which being removed, he began ſpeedily to grow freſh and brisk
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59608:52"/>
again. <hi>Ponzettus, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. <hi>de Veneno,</hi> writes, that he ſaw a man, who had taken a drachm and a half of Hellebore, to die preſently. <hi>Matthiolus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 141. writes, that a preſent Poyſon being made out of the Juice of white Hellebore, and Arrows or Shot being herein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated and illinated, they do cauſe ſpeedy death to that perſon wherein they are lodged, or in thoſe Parts through which they do paſs.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhewn you, that a venenate Mixture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of any of theſe, and Weapons made either of Wood or Iron macerated therein, and then ſent into the muſculous Parts, they do there ſpeedily ſhew their veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous qualities; the which if they be not ſpeedily fetched out, they do leave their pernicious marks of Venome, which does prove a perfect deſtroyer of the whole. And as daily experience does teach us, many peſtiferous and venenate Mixtures are and have been of late invented and found out. And if Bullets or the like Inſtruments be herein dipped, tempered, and tinged, and ſhot into any Part, occaſion a Wound, although it be not adherent, yet in its quick paſſage this Poyſon hath that ſubtile, nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and peſtiferous quality, that it does ſpeedily creep from the ſmall Veſſells to the greater, untill it hath got advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the principall Parts; and having once got footing therein, it ſpeedily does there exerciſe that furiouſneſs, that it does contract the Life of man into a ſmall compaſs of warmth and heat. And hence let no man doubt, that Wounds thus made by Shot, or any other kinds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments which have power enough in them to receive Poyſon, but that they may be made poyſonous. And by how much theſe are made of very ſubtile parts, by ſo much the readier may they penetrate: and their malign Vapours being ſent through the Veins, Nerves and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, do at once infect both the naturall, animall, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Faculties, in which conflict they do ſuffocate by their contrary preternaturall mixtures. As often therefore as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59608:53"/>
any thing of Poyſon is dreaded in a Wound, we are chiefly to have a reſpect to its dangerous attempts: and becauſe ſuch Wounds as are made by poyſoned Weapons are for the moſt part mortall, not ſo much in reſpect of the quality of the Wound, as in reſpect of the quality of the Poyſon; we are therefore firſt to leſſen its vigour, and that becauſe it aims altogether at the Heart, the Fountain of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure. Two Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> In this Cure theſe two Intentions do chiefly offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; firſt, that we ſtrengthen the Heart againſt its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that we ſpeedily draw forth the Venome the ſame way and by the ſame Orifice it was taken in. And though in other Wounds Solution of Continuity does onely require Union; yet here, having Poyſon adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as a grand enemy to our Nature, this is firſt to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and diſcharged. And this is to be done by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Wound open. In other Wounds indeed it muſt be our greateſt care, to avert Fluxion and all other Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms from the affected Parts by Purging and Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy: but in poyſoned Wounds, ſo long as the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon urgeth, we are here contrarily to endeavour the Attraction of this Poyſon to the affected Part, and by that to diſcharge it.</p>
               <p>And here, that we may not run our ſelves upon the rocks of Miſtake and Unadviſedneſs, we are firſt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in what part this Wound happeneth. For if it hath happened in the Nervous parts, it is very dangerous: for hereupon by applying of ſharp and biting Medicines or Cauteries, Convulſion does ofttimes ariſe. If the Wound happeneth in that Part where we may not with ſafety ſearify, nor apply theſe ſharp Medicines, we muſt here apply ſuch Medicines as may fetch forth this Poyſon by their own propriety and ſubſtance. We are with all ſpeed to fetch out the Poyſon, and to leſſen its vigour. Thus if the Fleſh of the Wound be livid, and its colour contrary to that of other Parts, accompanied with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59608:53"/>
Pains, Inflammations, and Debilitation of the whole Body, or Alienation of the Mind, and theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen without any manifeſt cauſe, theſe in every reſpect do declare Poyſon to be preſent.</p>
               <p>In theſe caſes the Chirurgeon is to arme himſelf with Bole-Armeniack, <hi>Smaragd. Bezoar.</hi> Scorzonary roots, <hi>Scord.</hi> Rue, <hi>Angelica,</hi> Gentian, Tormentill, Biſtort, Balme, <hi>Veronica,</hi> St. Johns-wort, and the like, being made either into Decoctions, Syrupes, or the like.

As to the affected Part, this may be evocated either by Cupping-glaſſes with much flame, if to be permitted, or to ſcarify the Part ſo as the bloud may come out plentifully. After this it is to be waſhed with warm Vinegar, in which Mithridate or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> Treacle hath been diſſolved. For this purpoſe Chalk alſo mixed with Honey and Treacle is very good. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Onions beaten with ſome <hi>Carduus benedictus</hi> is by ſome much commended.

               <p>When the Poyſon is all drawn forth, fill up the Wound being well digeſted and deterged. And here, according to <hi>Celſus</hi> order, are we to make a good Bandage over the Part, but not too ſtrict. And if the Poyſon have onely ſeized ſome ſmall extreme Part, if there be no good to be done at the firſt, amputate the Member; for delays do here prove very dangerous: hereby taking care that the Venome do not ſpread any further, for this remaining ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the beſt of Medicines of ſmall effect.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> To conclude; <hi>Cteſias,</hi> an old Authour, in <hi>lib. de Rebus Perſicis,</hi> writes of a Woman who through her whole life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time dreaded Poyſon, and made it her greateſt care to eſcape it. She invited another woman to dinner; who ſeeing her Knife lie on the Table, the which ſhe for many years before never parted from her ſide but at dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, took up this Knife, and poyſoned it at the end. She cutting her victualls therewith was ſoon diſpatched of her life. The other parts of the meat which were untou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the Knife were void of all Poyſon. Hence alſo may we learn, that all ſuch people as do dread Poyſon
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59608:54"/>
muſt not let other people be their Carvers.

               <head type="sub">Of Gunſhot-Wounds.</head>
               <p>SUch Maſters of Art who have dwelt many years in the Wars, and have hazarded their Lives as well as their Fortunes with their experience therein, will cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly grant, that every young Chirurgeon, who intends to doe his King ſervice and his Country a kindneſs, his Art right, and his Patients pleaſure, ought well to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Therapeutick part of his Art, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the Practick. And when they enter the ſtage of Gunſhot-Wounds, they ought ſo readily to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Knowledge of them, and the Inſtruments which do occaſion them, that they may make their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy addreſs to their Entrance, Form and Shape, and from thence derive their firſt Intention. This part of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery does not ſo particularly belong to the City-Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon or Countrey Practicioner, Domeſtick Wars not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo frequent: yet to every one it is very uſefull and profitable, as upon Accidents, or Duells, and the like. But as to theſe Wounds, as they are artificiall, ſo ſhould they meet with a man of Art to undertake them. For hereto do belong many weighty Conſiderations; as the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe Weapons, and the Places whereinto they penetrate. And out of theſe two do ariſe two Intentions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of Cure, and Extraction. The Weapons Shapes, Form, and Make, are alſo to be conſidered; and their ſubſtance of which they are made, being either of Wood, Iron, Steel, Lead, Braſs, Glaſs, or Bone; with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of their Forms, being either long, triangular, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangular, round, obtuſe, ſharp, and the like; theſe alſo
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59608:55"/>
being either large, or ſmall: reſpect alſo is to be had to their Number, being one, or more. And having of every of theſe given you a ſlight draught, being conducted by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the Maſter of the Ceremony, I here do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the Figure, which does relate how the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body may receive the impreſs of many kinds of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Inſtruments, no Part being ſhot-free from the Head to the Foot. The Figure is preſented you before, near the beginning of my diſcourſe of Wounds in generall; and alſo in that of particular Wounds.</p>
               <p>Before I enter upon the generall Treatiſe of Gunſhot-Wounds, let us take a ſmall view, and ſee what Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder and Shot are made of. And here may we find, that a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryer, called <hi>Bartholdus, Anno</hi> 1380. being an Alchymiſt, was the firſt that found out the true Compoſition of Gunpowder, which is now in uſe. <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> 1284. does make mention of Gunpowder, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall others before him; but it never came at its due perfection of Compoſition till the time of the aforeſaid Fryer. Which Compoſition we may find framed out of <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Gunpowder not veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</note>theſe Simples, Salt-peter, Sallow or Willow-coal, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> This therefore in its eſſence muſt not be allowed venenate, daily experience evincing the contrary, by ſhewing and declaring the contrary effects. Thus Sulphur (which is the firſt) is ſo far from Poyſon, that it is accounted a moſt excellent Medicine for Affects of the Lungs, and not for theſe alone, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, 9. <hi>Simpl.</hi> 36. It is an admirable Medicine againſt the Itch, and a thing at this day uſed much for the ſame. Its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ofttimes inwardly preſcribed in Juleps for the allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fevers. And in this place, being of an Oleaginous ſubſtance, it retaineth the fire longer then the Coal being once kindled. Salt-peter is alſo uſed in Burning-fevers, cooling and allaying the Patient's thirſt. And as all Salts have a Communion with each other; ſo this, being of thin and ſubtile parts, is very free from any Venome.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59608:56"/>
For take it from its Habitation, where you may ſee for the moſt part how and where it dwelleth, it cannot be allowed to have any dealings with Poyſon; for it is made out of a fatty Subſtance, forcing it ſelf through the Walls of ſome old and cold Cellars. As to Sallow or Charcoal, which is the third Ingredient, the which does ſpeedily take fire, this alſo is void of all Poyſon. And for the Wine or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> how far this is different from Poyſon, every boon Companion and Good fellow will ſufficiently acquaint you. Thus have I preſented you with a brief deſcription of Gunpowder, and its eſſence, and touching its tranſmutation into a fiery quality. Experience and reaſon will fairly contradict its having any commerce with Poyſon. And if any be deſirous to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Wounds made by Gunſhot do generally look black; I anſwer them, that it is not the effect of Heat brought with the Bullet, but the force of Contuſion, which does diſcolour the fleſh. The which I am ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſatisfied in, being made an Example of the ſame in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars 1665. and 66. where being Chirurgeon of one of his MAJESTIE's Ships, I was wounded by the wind of a 24 pound Bullet, by which my Arm was miſerably fractured and contuſed. But to proceed; this Contuſion cannot but be great in reſpect of its violence it is ſent with.</p>
               <p>And this brings me to the ſecond thing, the Shot or Bullet: and theſe are made of Lead for the moſt part in pitched Battels aſhore, as in Armies; although at Sea chiefly of Iron. This is very currant alſo, that theſe of their own nature do carry no Poyſon in them. For Lead being beaten to powder is good for old Ulcers; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in its own metallick form and beaten thin, it does depreſs the lips of old ſordid Ulcers, and ſtop the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Scirrhous Tumours. Beſides this, have we not ſeen many Bullets ſhot into the Body, and there to have remained for ſeverall years, without any hurt or detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to the Patient? Lead therefore of its own ſimple quality we ground to be void of all Poyſon: but how ready this may be made to take its impreſs, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared.</p>

                  <note place="margin">As touching the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot-Wounds.</note> We now therefore come to the Wound it ſelf. And he that will accurately underſtand the difference of theſe Wounds, muſt well conſider the Nature of the Parts which are thus wounded, their ſubſtance, uſe, action, poſition, ſenſe, and figure; the eſſence of the Diviſion or Solution of Continuity, and its proper differences: all which are the true rules which muſt direct him to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative method. To this knowledge alſo does conduce the right underſtanding of their proper differences, being either large or ſmall, ſuperficiall or deep, long or ſhort, thick or thin, and the like. Some of which are moſt proper for deſtruction of the whole Body, others more apt for taking off a Part; ſome moſt fit for paſſing through the Center, others onely lacerating the Nervous and Muſculous parts; ſome having in them power to break Bones, others warrant onely to lacerate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe the Fleſh; ſome of theſe made of their own metalls, others having added to them ſtrange bodies: every of which carry with them force enough to cauſe Solution of Continuity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signs of a Gunſhot-Wound.</note> The Signs of theſe Wounds are alſo taken from their Figure, or Colour, for they are generally round, and of a livid Colour; from the Senſe being there inflicted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or cauſing an obtuſe ſenſe in the Part, or Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Part chiefly ſuffering an <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> by reaſon of the Bullet. If theſe appear, they declare a Gunſhot-Wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Preſage.</note> Come we next to the Judgment and Preſage hereof. Theſe are generally allowed dangerous for three ſeverall reaſons, regarding either the Excellency of the Part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the Hurt and the vehemency occaſioned by the greatneſs of the Weapon, and then its Malignity. Thus
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59608:57"/>
if the principall Parts, as the Brain and its ſubſtance, be wounded, we do judge the Wound to be lethiferous. If the Lungs, <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> Ventricle, Spleen or Kidneys be hurt by ſhot, every of theſe aſſuming the names of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Parts from their Office, they are for the moſt part deadly. Of the ſame kind may be reckoned Wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Inteſtines or Bladder; theſe being Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Membranous parts, denying Agglutination. If the Fleſhy parts onely be wounded, and the Conſtitution good, theſe may with eaſe be cured. Wounds of this kind are harder of cure then others, by reaſon of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion. Wounds by how much the larger and deeper they are made, with dilaceration of the Nerves and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts, and fracture of the Bones, are accounted the more dangerous. Wounds alſo in the Joynts have their variety of Symptoms, the which they do fetch from their greatneſs. Thoſe Wounds which have Venome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with them are very dangerous. In the moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate caſes we are not perfectly to deſpair, for Nature does ſometimes play that happy part which Art could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. And hence <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> does adviſe, to uſe our beſt skill and judgment even in the moſt deſperate caſe, rather then to leave the Patient void of all help.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> As touching the Cure of theſe Wounds, becauſe they are complicated with various Indiſpoſitions, they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">Five Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>a diverſity of Intentions. And hence, as a generall Maxime, are we to take our Firſt Intention from that Symptome which is moſt direfull and urgent, not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Wound. Hence therefore, if any preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, as Bullet, Arrow, Splinter, or the like, do accompany this Wound, this is firſt to be extracted, as being its chief Cauſe; the which being removed, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect does ceaſe: and without a regard to which, the Wound is not to be cured. For this does bring Pain and Inflammation with it, the which are firſt to be corrected and abated. The Second is, to eaſe and aſſwage Pain,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59608:57"/>
which is a great enemy to theſe Wounds; for Fluxion does proceed hereby, and this does raiſe the Wound into a Tumour, the which is known by its colour, heat, and dimenſion. The Third is, to bring the Contuſed and Wounded parts into a fair Digeſtion. The Fourth is, to mundify and cleanſe the Wound from all filth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and to fill it up with Fleſh, and skin it. And the Laſt is, to correct all Symptoms which may happen. Of each of theſe in their order.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Second In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> Come we therefore to the Second, as touching the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging of Pain: and of this alſo I have fairly touched. But becauſe in theſe Wounds there is generally a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Pain attendant on them, which does weaken the Patient, hindreth Nature, cauſeth Fluxion, proſternateth the Faculties, and produceth the moſt direfull Symptoms, I muſt here a little enlarge thereof. For if this be not removed, expect no happy proceeding as to your Cure. To this Symptom ought we to make a ſpeedy application for its overthrow, by changing the Temper of the whole Body, and making uſe of ſuch Topicks as may challenge its removall. Amongſt ſuch Engines may be accounted Cataplaſms and the like, ſuch as may both abate Pain, and intercept Fluxion: and theſe may be made of Bean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, Barley-meal, with Powder of Roſes, Myrtills, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and the like, boiled in Milk.

In theſe Wounds we are alſo to reſpect Ligature, being neither to be applied too ſtrict nor too looſe: the firſt occaſioning Pain and Fluxion, and ſo Inflammation; the latter making a ready way for the falling off of the Dreſſings. And if there be fear of Inflammation, which does generally attend till the ſeventh day, uſe the ſame Remedies, and change them twice in a day.

                  <note place="margin">Another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hiſtory.</note> A Souldier alſo being ſhot into his Thigh about its middle, upon ſearch by the Probe for the Bullet, it was found to lodge upon the Thigh-bone. The <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellum</hi> being applied before any Tumour appeared, the Inſtrument catching hold thereof drew it forth; and by following the ſame method which I have ſet
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59608:61"/>
down in the former Hiſtory, the Patient was perfectly cured.</p>
               <p>Hence may the young Chirurgeon collect, that in any Wound made either by Shot, Splinter, or Bullet, if any part thereof do remain in the Wound, this is to be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily extracted, while the Parts ſeem as if they were ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefied or benummed, no Inflammation at preſent appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: for ſhould this be deferred for ſome daies, we may well fear a new Inflammation, Pain, or Haemorrhagy to ſupervene. And let him obſerve (by <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> direction) that he gain the ſame Poſture of the Patient, if poſſible, as he was in when he received the Wound.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Arrows, Splints or Bullets may be left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Body for ſome ſeaſon, without doing much detriment thereto. As <hi>Albucaſis</hi> writes of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that having an Arrow ſhot near her Belly, and lodged in her Body, ſhe recovered of her Wound, and performed all her functions very readily without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it hath been ſeen, after many years being lodged, that they do make a way out for themſelves, by framing Abſceſſes for their Exition: as we may ſee by theſe following Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Severall Hiſtories.</note> 
                  <hi>Alſaharavius, Theoric. Tract.</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. writes, that he ſaw a man who had an Arrow ſhot into his Back, the which after ſeven years made its way out with odour. <hi>Gilbertus Anglicus, lib.</hi> 15. <hi>Compend.</hi> writes of a man, who having an Arrow ſhot into his Guts, had it drawn forth with Excrements, and yet he eſcaped. <hi>Paraeus</hi> writes of a Souldier, who received a Gunſhot-wound in his Belly, between his Navell and his Loyns, and the Shot remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therein not extracted, (becauſe, although the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt care was uſed, yet the Bullet could not be found out) hence the Patient began to be afflicted with intolerable Pains. At the ninth day he was diſcharged of his Shot
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59608:62"/>
by Siege, and within three weeks after he became well. We ought to know, as I have already ſhewn, that if Extraction of Weapons cannot be performed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with eaſe, that we are not to attempt it, if we judge the Patient may live without it. And therefore ſhould a man have very many Shot lodged in his body, you are never to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their Extraction: for how many hundreds are there in health at this day which have them remaining in them? <note place="margin">Hiſtories.</note>
                  <hi>Fallopius, lib. de Vuln. cap.</hi> 22. writes, that he extracted a Leaden Bullet, which was received in the Groyn, five years after its reception, in which time it had fallen near the Knee, at which place it was drawn forth. Another Example he hath of a Noble Gentlewoman, out of whom was drawn a piece of Iron, which lodged in the Cavity of her <hi>Thorax</hi> for the ſpace of nine months. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Camerarius, cap.</hi> 45. writes of a Country-man, who finding a broken piece of a Knife, did thruſt it ſo forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly between the right Clavicle into the Breaſt, that the domeſtick Chirurgeons could not draw it forth. Within a few daies the man grew well, and the Wound was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and he thus lived ſome years without Pain; ſave onely a dry Cough perplexed him, and between times a ſmall Pain about the affected Part. After fourteen years he felt a pricking Pain reaching from the hurt place to the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and this for ſome time together did every day encreaſe, untill a Tumour appeared, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turned into an Abſceſs, the which being opened, this piece of old Iron was extracted: after which the Wound was conſolidated, and the Patient recovered; and the piece of Iron <hi>Camerarius</hi> writes he hath in his Cloſet. Whence we may learn, if Wounds are inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heal, we are to ſtudy their healing without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
               <p>Thus have I run through the generall Symptoms and Diſcourſe of Wounds in Generall. My next Task will be, to uſher you in my remaining Diſcourſe, how to deal

               <head type="sub">The Generall Diſcourſe of Wounds of the Head.</head>
               <p>THE Head is ſuch an admirable Syntax of diverſity of Works, made and framed out of ſtrange pieces, that he who undertakes to ſail through all its Parts, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and Qualities, had need to be a good Pilot, who beſides his knowledge of well Trimming his Veſſell, ought to have annexed an exact acquaintance with the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Site, and Connexion of its Parts, to defend him from the Rocks and Shelves of Errour and Ignominy; and may well account himſelf happy, if while he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſhun <hi>Scylla,</hi> he falls not upon <hi>Charybdis,</hi> and ſo miſcarries before he arrives at his intended Port or Haven. For here he muſt expect many Reaches to tack about, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may be ſaid to make any freſh way, and will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject to run aground, unleſs he keeps Sounding with the Plummet of Reaſon, and ſteers by the Compaſs of Judgment and Experience. And becauſe Man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Judgment, Underſtanding, and Reaſon's ſake, fit to receive the Impreſſes of ſenſible things, and to apply himſelf to the diverſity of Objects, he ſtands much in need of Locall motion. And had this been framed of one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59608:63"/>
Bone, nothing might he appear more like to, then a Trunk of Wood, or Lump of Clay. Nature therefore, the good and kind Miſtreſs of Form and Beauty, ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to accompliſh him for tranſaction of the variety of his upper Motions, hath with wonder framed his <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium;</hi> it being appointed as the Guard and Defence of the Soul, the Tower and ſtrong Arch of the Brain, the outward Guard, Palace, and Helmet of the Animall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: which we may ſee framed of variety of Bones, diſcriminated and diſtinguiſhed with a ſtrange appearance of Sutures, the which receiving through them the ends of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> do form and eſtabliſh a thin Inveſture, with which the Skull is cloathed and furniſhed. By the advantages of which, although one part of the <hi>Cranium</hi> ſhould be fractured, yet it ſhould not paſs through the whole. And becauſe this Part of my Book is chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and dedicated to men of Knowledge, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is taken form Learning, and dwells upon the Study of doing publick good and ſervice, whoſe Heads are furniſhed with naturall Wit, and endowed with a great quantity of Senſe and Reaſon; not to the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who conſider little, and underſtand leſs; That I may quit this Diſcourſe freely, and free it from off the Stage fairly, before it acteth its Tragick part in the Scene of Wounds, I ſhall preſume to preſent all the Parts of the Head in their proper order, which does chiefly belong to our preſent Task: both becauſe the Knowledge of the Parts affected is very neceſſary for the underſtanding of the Affects, Preſages, and Cure, we being by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> commanded firſt to gain an exact Knowledge of theſe; and alſo in reſpect of the great Advantage and Light they bring to thoſe who well do underſtand them. And ſince I have entered the diſcourſe of this noble and beautifull Subject, I could willingly wiſh my poor Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us might herein anſwer a generall expectation: and ſince this is a difficult Task which I have undertaken, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

the variety of Wounds both Simple and Compound, be pleaſed to accept my kind votes, where my abilities may ſeem wanting, and dreſs with kindneſs every lapſe of Pen, and deficiency of Judgment. But to quit this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already aſſured of having our Sails filled with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Gales of our Friends and all kind Artiſts, we intend to ſteer the Veſſell of our preſent Diſcourſe by the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope of Anatomy, which will give us the true reſemblance of every Part as it lies in its order. In which place we firſt meet with a <hi>Membrana Carnoſa,</hi> or Hairy Scalp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it planted two thin and membranous Coats; and then ſhall we arrive at the <hi>Cranium</hi> it ſelf.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Hairy Scalp, and Pericrane.</head>
               <p>AND firſt, as touching the Hairy Scalp; here we may find, although the Skin of Man is allowed in all other parts to be very thin, yet upon comparing this of the Head with that of the other Parts, we ſhall, I ſay, find it much thicker then that of the <hi>Thorax</hi> or <hi>Abdomen.</hi> And as this is the thickeſt of the reſt, ſo <hi>Galen</hi> writes, <hi>lib. De Temperament.</hi> it is alſo by ſo much the drier, by how much it is the harder. It hath Veins allowed it from the exteriour Branch of the externall Jugulars, the which do variouſly expand themſelves on both ſides, and are united in the front: and theſe do bring its nutriment. Arteries alſo hath it from the exteriour Branch of the <hi>Carotides,</hi> derived to the roots of the Ears and Temples: and theſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59608:64"/>
do bring it its vitall Spirits. It receiveth ſome ends of Nerves from the firſt and ſecond Conjugation of the Neck, to give it Senſe, having no proper Nerve allowed <note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note>it, as have other Muſcles. Its Uſe is, as we ſee, to inveſt and cover the Skull. If this be onely wounded, this Wound requireth onely Deſiccation, as other ſimple Wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pericrane.</note> Next come we to the Pericrane; and this is held by ſome to be as a <hi>Perioſteum</hi> to other Bones. This ariſeth from ſeverall Proceſſes of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> like thin Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, the which in proceſs of time, by their expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, do meet with and unite to one another; and theſe are ſo firmly tied together that they form this Membrane, which is thin, ſoft, firm, and endued with an excellent Senſe allowed it from the Nerves, diſperſed through it to the <hi>Occiput</hi> and Temples. <hi>Lindanus</hi> and ſome others will have it to ariſe from the Tendons of the Muſcles of the Front, Temples and <hi>Occiput,</hi> being variouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded <note place="margin">Perioſteum.</note>over the <hi>Cranium.</hi> To this is generally allowed and granted as annexed a <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> being a moſt thin Membrane, of a quick ſenſe, by the benefit of which the Head is ſaid to feel, its roots being herein implanted. And this is ſo cloſely annexed to the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly on the other ſide joyned to the Pericrane, that it appears but as one: which made <hi>Fallopius</hi> miſtake, when he thought that onely one Pericrane covered the <hi>Crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> but upon a curious ſearch you will find it double, inveſting the Head. To theſe Exteriour Membranes the bloud is conveyed for their nutrition from the ſmall Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifications of the outward Jugulars, and the Spirits which they receive they have from the externall Branch of the Carotidall Arteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three things worthy note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Theſe being wounded are thus to be treated: becauſe they adhere cloſely to the <hi>Cranium,</hi> being divided or lacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Skull it ſelf hereby muſt ſuffer detriment in ſome meaſure; and in this caſe the <hi>Cranium</hi> is to be deraded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59608:64"/>
Secondly, the Pericrane being inciſed, the Bone is made bare, and may ſpeedily be altered by the air, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſuſpected. Thirdly, if the Bone be not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon raſed, no good Fleſh can be made to generate, or adhere, the which upon its deraſion does ſpeedily grow: for thus the mouths of the ſmall Veſſells are opened, and the Bloud which iſſueth thence is a very proper Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſet forward the Cure, by being readily brought to Suppuration for the generation of Fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> In Simple Wounds of the Head, we may cure with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagmatick and Cephalick Medicines, being by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſed to apply no moiſt Medicines here; but rather, by how much the Skull and its parts are drier then others, by ſo much are we directed to uſe a more drying method. The moſt proper Medicines here to be uſed are to be of Deterſive, Digeſtive and Drying Qualities. Of this ſort may be reckoned Myrrh, Aloes, Ireos, Gentian, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, Comfrey, Powder of red Roſes, Maſtick, <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocolla,</hi> Dragons bloud, Bolearmeniack, and the like: and of theſe, or any of them, may be made Powders which are to be ſprinkled into Wounds. Wine alſo for <note place="margin">Of Wine in Wounds.</note>Wounds is an excellent Medicine, as <hi>Galen, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. cap.</hi> 4. writes. And as a Wound does chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Drying medicines, Black wine for this purpoſe is a moſt excellent Receipt; for it dries both of it ſelf and <hi>per accidens,</hi> and of its own naturall quality does dry up by Repulſion: and the Humours being repelled, the Part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected is half cured. And whereas alſo a Simple Wound does require Agglutination, Wine for this alſo is the beſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for by its Aſtrigency it does joyn and unite the disjoyned Parts. And if you be to procure a new Fleſh, here firſt procure a good Digeſtion, either with <hi>Reſina Terebinth.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>Vitell. Ov. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> j. <hi>miſce;</hi> or in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with this, ℞ <hi>Terebinth. Venet.</hi>

For in Children we ſhall daily find in their <hi>primo Intuitu,</hi> theſe are more cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous then boney, and it is onely time and age that gives and bequeaths them their ſolidneſs and drineſs: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may come under the name of Simple Parts, having no proper Figure allowed them, as have the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicks; yet conſider the rare Uſe appointed them, their particular Shapes and Forms; and in theſe alſo, were not a certain Articulation and Commiſſure granted them, all Animall motion muſt neceſſarily periſh. Some of theſe we meet with accompanied with Protuberancies; others are like Valleys, giving way and ſhrowded under them: and hence do they aſſume their variety of names. And here alſo may we ſee how Nature, the rare Miſtreſs of Curioſity and Art, endeavoureth to keep this Fabrick
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59608:65"/>
entire and trim, who, by her kind Invention and curious Cunning, hath to theſe hard Subſtances added a middle matter, both for their better motion, and action. And ſince alſo this Queen of Order and Form hath granted Man the Divine ſparks of Reaſon and Action, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the Majeſty of Government, ſhe hath not nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly confined his Animall faculties to a ſtrict Room, but hath allotted him a large Compaſs to exerciſe the ſame; and to guard theſe hath appointed this <hi>Cranium,</hi> as their beſt defence and ſecurity: and this brings me to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe it ſelf. And becauſe Infants and young Babes, who have not arrived at a good age, cannot be granted to have in them a true and juſt Symmetry and Proportion of Bones, theſe I at preſent pretermit, and ſhall onely treat of ſuch who have gained theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">As touching the Head.</note> And here we do grant, and generally allow, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the Head, which is ſet and fixed upon the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, does divide it ſelf into a <hi>Cranium</hi> and a Face; the Head being that Part which containeth the Brain, as we have already ſhewn. It is called <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Galea.</hi> As touching its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Uſe, more afterwards. In young people it is ſeen to conſiſt of fourteen Bones, ſome of which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly proper to it, others common. The proper are the Frontall bone, two of the <hi>Sinciput,</hi> one of the <hi>Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi> two Temple-bones, in each Ear planted, three Bones named <hi>Incus, Stapes, Malleus.</hi> The common are, <hi>Os Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neiforme,</hi> and <hi>Spongioſum,</hi> and two of the Mandibles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Teeth. But to paſs theſe at preſent, we ſhall particularly treat of thoſe of the Skull, which are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereto belonging, and its Sutures. And here, as the Brain is the moſt noble Veſſell of all others in the Body, Nature hath placed this on the Top, being as the Prince of the reſt, and covered it with a Skull, for keeping in its own dominion the Seat of Reaſon, the Treaſure of Judgment, the Regiſter of Memory, the Shop of Senſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59608:66"/>
and Motion, and the Royall Order of Contrivance and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. This being planted as the Angelicall part of the World, having allowed it Reaſon to invent, Memory to retain, Judgment to execute, and Counſell to adviſe. Neither hath ſhe framed theſe alone with Curioſity; but viewing its Front and exteriour Veſture, we muſt grant that ſhe hath ſo wonderfully lockt up this Treaſury un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the particular Keys of her Connexions, that it is paſt the proudeſt Judgments of men to frame any one thing to compare with it. And conſidering its Sphaericall Figure, and the Connexion of parts, it might well make poor Man fall into an humble adoration of his Maker, who hath thus guarded this Treaſury, which contains in it the whole Life, Senſe, and Reaſon of mankind. It is not made of one Bone, but framed of many; which may be accounted an admirable piece of Contrivance: and ſo ſtrangely faſhioned, that no other Part of the Body dares compare with it.</p>
               <p>And that it may not glory or boaſt of its fair and ſtrong <note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note>Structure, embracing onely the name of a Helmet of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, you may find that it is allowed a proper Office granted it by the Divine Artificer. For you may ſee it ordained as a ſtrong foundation for the maintaining, keeping and propagating the intereſt and priviledges of other Bodies, planted both in it, and under it. Thus the Brain, by the benefit of its Sutures, tying its Membranes to this Skull, is kept in a fair <hi>Aequilibrium:</hi> and had it not been thus faſhioned, thoſe frequent Concuſſions or violent Motions occaſioned by jumpings or leapings would herein ſoon create a great diſturbance.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their Uſes.</note> The Sutures alſo are of much benefit to the Brain: for as it is placed in the upper houſe, many Fumes and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours do aſcend hither from the Kitchin of the Body, which are not ſpeedily to be diſpatched by theſe. What an ill condition are thoſe poor people in, what ſtorms of troubles and tempeſts of diſtempers are ſuch people aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59608:66"/>
with, who have theſe wanting in them? Hence is it, that thoſe that want theſe are ſo frequently accompanied with Pains of the Head, and other Perplexities; which trouble not ſuch as have theſe expulſive Paſſages. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit hereof is, that one of theſe being obſtructed, the other do ſupply its place: and though in this caſe it is not capable to give ſo quick a diſpatch, yet by degrees it performeth its office very promptly.</p>

                  <note place="margin">As touching its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> The Subſtance of the Skull does vary much in reſpect of age, being in an infant Membranous, and in one of riper years of a more Boney ſubſtance.

                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> does ſet down four Figures of the Head; two of which he ſaith are preternaturall. For in one hereof there is found no Prominency in the <hi>Occiput,</hi> and then there remain two Sutures, the Coronall, and Right; the Lambdoidall vaniſhing. In the other there is no Projecture about the Front, and then onely theſe appear, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lambdoides,</hi> and <hi>Recta;</hi> and the Coronall is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. And theſe two Figures in their Sutures do form the Letter T. The third is naturall, and is of a Sphaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Roundneſs, carrying with it the naturall <hi>Idea</hi> and Reſemblance of the Head: but this being depreſſed, it expreſſeth an anteriour and poſteriour prominent part; and being on either ſide depreſſed, theſe three Sutures do remain in the form and conſtitution of the Head, <hi>(viz.) Coronalis, Recta, Lambdoides,</hi> and being placed together exactly do make H. The fourth Figure is, when either Prominency is loſt, which is contrary to the naturall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59608:67"/>
of the Head; then the Sutures do thus appear, X, and the Head is very round and ſphaericall.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Its Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> The <hi>Cranium</hi> is light both outwards and inwards, that it may neither ſeem troubleſome to the Pericrane, nor <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> It hath and muſt have allowed it its Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities, framed according to the bodies of the two Brains. It is framed of two Bones, thin, but hard, the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the other outward, not much unreſembling a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice-ſtone: and theſe by Anatomiſts are called <hi>Laminae Calvariae,</hi> or the two Tables of the Skull; the outward hereof being more thick and hard, the inward more thin and ſoft: and hence is it, that the outward, by ſtout and hard blows being given it, ſuffers not much; whilſt the inward may be rent and divided. And becauſe alſo man's Head is very various, as touching both the number and poſition of its Bones, in their thickneſs and thinneſs, hardneſs and ſoftneſs, denſity and rarity, equality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality; and becauſe of the Veins and Arteries allowed them, for conveying their nutriment and ſuſtenance, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing between theſe; I ſhall afterwards enlarge on theſe for our better knowledge, and at preſent ſhut up this Chapter with a brief diſcourſe of the Sutures.</p>

The firſt is made in the right Orbit of the Eye, proceeding outwardly from the end of the fifth Suture, and is common to the firſt Bone of the Front, and upper Mandible. The ſecond appears in the lower and laterall ſeat of the Eye. The third aſcends outwards to the uppermoſt part of the Noſe obliquely from the inward ſide of the Eye. The fourth proceeds ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely through the middle of the Jugal bone, and joyns to the Temporall bone. The fifth is in the breadth of the Noſe, and in the amplitude of the Noſtrills, and the bridge of the Noſe.

               <p>THE Bones of the Head are of two ſorts, ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly proper to the <hi>Cranium,</hi> others chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing <note place="margin">Six proper Bones.</note>to the upper Jaw. Thoſe properly belonging to the Skull are Six.</p>

It conſtituteth the whole Front, and the more elate part of the Eye-lids. Its figure is ſemicircular. In Children it appears double, but in Aged people this is worn into one: and is circumſcribed with a tranſverſe Suture. In this Bone
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59608:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is to be obſerved a large Cavity, being between either ſide of the Noſe, from whence are expanded two Cavities to the Cavity of the Noſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Two Sinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalls.</note> The Bones of the <hi>Sinciput</hi> or <hi>Vertex</hi> are placed in the upper part of the Head, ſquare in figure, onely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extended in length, not plain, but concave, ſo framed by reaſon of the ſphaericall figure of the Head to which they are accommodated. They are joyned to the forward lines of the Frontall bone, Coronall Suture, and to the back-part of the Occipitall bone, and Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bdoidall Suture. Their ſubſtance being in young people hard, but ſofter then other Bones and thinner, both for the more ſpeedy and eaſy tranſition of Vapours: and hence were they made with many ſmall Cavities on the inſide, with many Inſcriptions where the Veſſells run: and theſe eſpecially in young Children, by reaſon of their great plenty of moiſture, are rather ſoft and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous: and as they creep up to a riper age, theſe alſo do exceed both in their drineſs and hardneſs: and, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, theſe ſeldome begin to harden untill Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do begin to ſpeak. The outward Superficies is thin and ſlender, inwardly aſperate and rough, through whoſe paſſages ſome Ramifications of the Jugular veins are inſerted. And hence may the young Chirurgeon <note place="margin">Note.</note>learn, that he do not lacerate the Veins when he uſeth the Trapan or Trafine.

It is alſo called <hi>Baſilare,</hi> and <hi>Os Pyxidis,</hi> or the Nowl-bone, conſtituting the poſteriour and lower part of the Head. It hath a Triangular figure, inwardly concave, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly convex. It is of a hard, thick and denſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59608:69"/>
ſtronger then any of the other Bones of the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> the better and more ready to defend any Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blows, and ſuch Hurts as may happen in the back-part of the Head. It is connexed to the Bones of the <hi>Sinciput</hi> and Temples, and ſometimes to the <hi>Sphenoides.</hi> It hath two large Proceſſes at the ſide of the Medullary paſſage, which do receive the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> planted at the <hi>Baſis</hi> thereof, which are articulated to the firſt <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, and do ſerve for the motion of the Head, and for its flexion and extention. It hath a round Cavity placed between theſe two Protuberancies in its <hi>Baſis,</hi> through which the <hi>Medulla</hi> does deſcend from the Head to the Back. This is an excellent guard againſt all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and aſſaults which may be inflicted on the back-part <note place="margin">Note.</note>of the Head. And it is a principall Maxime, in Wounds of the Head, to prohibit Inflammation: which is chiefly occaſioned by the Veſſells being lacerated, and the Bloud thence iſſuing, and there corrupting, by whoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Parts alſo are corrupted; and hence cometh Pain, and a ſuperfluous Heat, out of which two is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Inflammation: and therefore we are to procure a ſpeedy Suppuration. And Wounds happening in theſe Parts are of greater danger then thoſe happening on the Fore-parts, and more ready to putrefy in the Summer then in the Winter, the Cold not ſo readily being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cauſe Putrefaction.

                  </gap>, being received on either ſide of the Head, or poſſeſſing the laterall Region thereof: theſe are the ſmalleſt of all the Bones of the Head. In the upper part they are almoſt ſemicircular; but in their lower parts, by reaſon of their inequall Aſperities and Extuberancies, with their Proceſſes ſubſiſtent with their Cavities, they do carry a manifold figure and form. There are two
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59608:69"/>
Cavities worthy our obſervation in this Bone. The greater is accompanied with a Cartilage, between the Auditory paſſage, and the Proceſs of the Jugal bone, the which does receive the head of the lower Mandible. The inward is leſs, and common to the Occipitall bone, ſeated at the ſame Proceſs backwards. And in this Part <note place="margin">Obſerver.</note>alſo it is worthy obſervation, that the Muſcles peculiarly appropriated to theſe Bones are covered with the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crane, and the ſubjacent Bones are alſo deſtitute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; no other part of the Body being thus ſtrangely framed.</p>
               <p>The chief of the Bones I have already named; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two are <hi>Sphenoides,</hi> and <hi>Ethmoides.</hi> The former <note place="margin">Os Cuneś<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</note>Bone is by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the Wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, which it much reſembleth. It obtains a various figure; and by ſome it is called <hi>Os Baſilare.</hi> In Infants it conſiſteth of many Bones united together by a Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and theſe generally are in them allowed to be four. The firſt thereof does ſcarce recede the latitude of a finger from the fore-parts of the <hi>Occiput.</hi> The ſecond comprehends the <hi>Sella Equina,</hi> and the Proceſſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Viſive nerves. The third and fourth are plain Proceſſes. In Children if this Bone be carefully examined, you will find it conſiſt of three Bones; one conſtituting its <hi>Baſis,</hi> which does frame the <hi>Sella Equina,</hi> and does expand it ſelf forwards towards the ſides like two Wings; and the other like leſſer joyned to theſe: all which in proceſs do run into one. It is ſeated in the middle of the Head, encompaſſing and enwrapping the proper Bones of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and ſometimes the Bones of the upper Mandible every way, thereto annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the mendoſe Sutures, the which are altogether ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated by age and growth. It is allowed both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward Proceſſes: four outward, two placed forwards near the ſeventh of the Bones of the Noſtrills and Palate, in which cohering with the upper Mandible,

This is boared with very many ſmall Cavities, much like a Sieve, amongſt which thoſe are the largeſt which are nigheſt the <hi>Criſta Galli.</hi> It is covered with the <hi>Dura Menynx,</hi> the which in this part is very porous and perviated with many <hi>Foraminula's,</hi> through which does iſſue out that tough and viſcous Phlegm which does deſcend from the Ventricles of the Brain. And as you <note place="margin">Its Uſes.</note>ſee the Parts of this Bone are various, ſo alſo are its Uſes. One Part maketh way for Air and Odour, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of the Brain, this being breathed into it for the generation of animall Spirits. And hence is it, that thoſe that be troubled with a <hi>Coryza</hi> (the which we commonly call a Poſe) cannot ſmell, becauſe theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forations are ſtopt up with Rheum. <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi> do adde this farther Uſe thereof, that by theſe Perforations, when need requireth, a plenty of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be ſpeedily and together diſcharged. But others on the contrary do write, that nothing can this way be brought to the Brain, becauſe theſe ſpongious Fleſhes are ſo placed, that nothing can penetrate through them from the Noſtrills to theſe little Pipes, much leſs be conveyed this way to the Brain it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given you an account of all the proper Bones of the <hi>Cranium:</hi> I ſhall here preſent you with a Figure of the Head, how it may variouſly be wounded;

               <p>Having thus preſented you with the Scheme and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Head, and of the variety of its Bones, their Nature, Site, Temper, and Connexions, with their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the like; we arrive now at the diſcourſe of Wounds in generall, where we may meet both with Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Compound: the firſt of which I have already paſſed; the latter remains. And herein alſo are we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by wiſe <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the Father and Patron of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59608:72"/>
and Experience, that we do well underſtand the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and the Praeſage thereof, before we undertake the Cure: and this more particularly in Wounds of the Head, where no evident Signs are made apparent, in the firſt daies, of danger; which whilſt they appear under mean ſhapes to the ignorant Chirurgeon and as Trifles, are ſpeedily undertaken by him; but within few daies they procure ſuch a Troup of bad Symptoms, as oft hurry the poor Patient and diſpatch him into another world. And although of the Brain and Heart the Heart is counted the moſt noble; yet its <hi>Thorax</hi> being wounded, by which it is guarded and defended, even into the Cavity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Heart it ſelf being kept inviolable, or not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched therewith, the Patient thus wounded, if skilfully dealth with, is ſcarce ſeen to come under the verge of danger: whereas we ſee by daily experience, Wounds happening in the Head, although the Brain be not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or its Membranes, do very often occaſion Death. And hence is it, that he in the beginning of his Book <hi>De Vulnerib. Capit.</hi> does adviſe the Chirurgeon, not to contemn or ſcorn the leaſt Wound happening in the Head, but adviſedly to undertake it with Art; leſt by an inconſiderate dreſſing, (as too oft happens by the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Practiſer) for want of well expurging the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is inwardly lodged, there follow a ſordid Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. And in many caſes the beſt of Chirurgeons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due reſpect and inquiry, may herein fail. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the differences of Wounds are generally taken from their Cauſes, being either Pungent, Contuſing, Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, or Inciſing; every of theſe have their proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to perform or effect their deſigns: as Swords and Rapiers to prick or ſtab; obtuſe Inſtruments, as a Stone, Club, Fall from a high place, and the like, for lacerating; and for inciſing, Knifes, Daggers, Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions and the like Inſtruments.

Of which ſort of people I am afraid we have too many at this day in our Nation; and it were to be wiſhed our renowned Art might not be rent into ſo many pieces by them, and divided into more parts then ever I believe God Almighty intended.

               <p>WE come now to the Operative part of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery required in the caſes of Wounds of the Head; And becauſe the heads of Children are tender, looſe, ſoft, and thin, having in them much blood, not hard, thick, and firm; and becauſe alſo a more ſpeedy Purulency of matter happens in theſe more than in ſuch who have arrived at a greater Age and ſtronger Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: Theſe being, like ſoft Wax, very capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Impreſſions which any Inſtrument may inflict. Theſe Bones alſo in theſe young Children, in relation to their plenty of Heat &amp; Moyſture allowed them, are very ſubject to receive Putrefaction. Conſidering alſo their Imbecillity and Rareneſs, with the weight of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hurting, and capable to occaſion herein a Wound and Fracture, and how ſpeedily it may communicate its affects hence to the Brain and its Membranes, and where either a Fiſſure, Colliſion, or Sedes is here made, how careful ought we to be, and well to conſider and caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to weigh how we are with theſe to deal: Some of theſe in reſpect of the largeneſs of the wound, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the Brain, do ſoon and ſpeedily diſpatch the Patient of its life. Others not imprinting their Cruel Darts untill the 4th or the 7th day.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Four Kinds of ill Symptomes pronounced by <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> like a Wiſe Judge does pronounce theſe are Four dangerous Sentences in Wounds of the Head happening in Children or Men: As firſt, Wounds of the head being neglected, or ſlenderly examined, do oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring an unexpected Death, there being no good reſpect or care taken in the right ordering the Body:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59608:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus by the imploy of ignorant Pretenders to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Art, too oft are the King's Liege People Cheated of their Lives, by procuring miſchiefs to the ſubjacent Membranes, applying of a <hi>Trepan</hi> to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſharp Medicines hereupon: Theſe being more proper for exciting of pain, and this drawing inflamation with it; who like people half diſtracted are at their Wits ends, fearing the Coldneſs of the Air, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding how to temper or correct it, who upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to eſchew the danger of the one, make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſplit themſelves upon the Rock of Unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the other. A Third alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> brings in ſmall and ſlender Wounds, the which not being at firſt well treated, prove ſuſpitious beyond the expectation of their narrow Genius; who by ordering their Patients thin Broaths, <hi>Ptiſans,</hi> and the like, do give way for their Patients to drink Wine, to eat and drink at pleaſure, and if poſſible to any Exerciſe, not forbidding Venery, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the greateſt enemy to Wounds in the Head, nor prohibiting any paſſion, all which to a Judicious man appears as idle as any one thing in the World, Knowing that theſe will create Choler in the body, and raiſe feuds in the humours, cauſing that Intemperiety which in time committing and communicating it ſelf to the head, hereby inflameth the Animal ſpirits. A Fourth may be attributed to ſuch, who are ſo unhappy as at the firſt view to pronounce ſpeedy Death, acquainting both Patient and Relations that there are no hopes left either of Cure or Life. And what power; force, and vigour this may have have in any man, no Judicious or Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious man is ignorant of: For if by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Rules and Aphoriſme we are Ordered to hope well, and to think the beſt, and give comfortable aſſurances to the wounded Patient, this being as an Exact Rule and Maxime as touching Health; ſo on the Contrary to create Deſpair, and diſcompoſe the Patient with the unhappy thoughts
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59608:78"/>
of a ſuddain Surprizal and a ſpeedy Change, muſt as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently make dull and flat the muſical ſtrings which are the vigorous and nimble Inſtruments of Man's Life, Senſe, and Motion. And to conclude this Diſcourſe, how oft have we ſeen men dye of ſmall and ſlight Wounds in their Heads, not by reaſon of the Brain being hurt, or the Skull ſuffering a fracture, or the like, but chiefly by hidden cauſes happening either by Accident or Nature, having their Bodies overcharged with bad humours, macerated by Venery, ſwelled up by Dropſies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to other inward Diſpoſitions and Tempers: Several alſo are the Intentions of divers Authors as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Solution of Continuity in the Head, but theſe do not make much for the relief of the Patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Wound with a Fracture in Childrens Heads.</note> But to proceed; <hi>Franciſcus Arcaeus</hi> adviſeth us, That when a Wound happeneth with a Fracture in Childrens heads, without any bad Symptome attending it, not to remove any Bone if the parts of it cleave together; but onely to be anointed with his Liniment which he hath Chriſtned by his own name, by having ſome ſmall Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dipt therein, and ſo applying it warm to the part affected. But if any bad Symptome appear, as Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Vomiting of Choler, Fever, or Palſie, and the like, then to dilate the Skull as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> does order, <hi>Cap.</hi> 47. <hi>lib. de cap. Vulnerib.</hi> And being once opened, they are to be dreſt as we dreſs other men. But let this ſerve for Advice. We come next to the perſon affected, who is the Object of our preſent Diſcourſe, in whom both oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and neceſſity commands the Uſe of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And here are we to conſider, that we make an Artificial ſeparation of the ſoft parts about the Skull, having hereby a more ready way made for our dreſsing. After this are we to prevent all Accidents, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all evil Symptomes; and then to conſider whether it ought to be done, and might be performed with ſafety, and what parts it is to be made in, and what is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59608:79"/>
after this; all theſe being as the general Rules and Maximes which are to be obſerved as touching the Operation. <hi>Hippocrates lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Vulnerib. Capit.</hi> teacheth us it is to be done both by Authority, and upon Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and then in that daily Experience declaring for want and Omiſſion of theſe Operations, the Death of ſundry People have followed, which by a timely uſe hereof might have been prevented.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Where Section may be made, and where not.</note> Next by <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Rules alſo, Section may be made in any part of the hairy Scalp, except the Sutures and Temporal Muſcles; the Reaſons for either of which I have already ſhown. The Inciſion being tranſverſly made, you are to ſeparate the <hi>Pericrane</hi> from the <hi>Cranium</hi> in every part, inſomuch that it be cleared on every ſide both for Prevention of Fever, Inflammation, and the like; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, <hi>Cap.</hi> 38. <hi>lib. de Cap.

Cap.</hi> and this ſo to be kept for 24 hours. Thus having ſhewn the things that are to be done, we are in the next place to give you the Reaſon of its doing, and this may contain in it theſe <note place="margin">In 4 caſes the Head to be Opened.</note>Heads: That the pieces of Skull or Weapon may from thence be removed, or that a depreſſed part of the Skull may be reduced into its proper place; That Matter or coagulated Blood collected between this and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane <hi>Dura Mater</hi> may be diſcharged; And that we may apply proper Medicines for the Wound and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: All which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> directs in <hi>Cap.</hi> 31. <hi>lib. de Vuln. Cap.</hi> The time alſo of its apertion is ſet down by him, <hi>Cap.</hi> 34. it being to be done before the fourth day, and may be done after this too, if bad Symptoms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; and ſo the ſeventh or ninth day may ſerve.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59608:79"/>
We next are to ſhew you how this is to be done, and with what Inſtruments; and amongſt theſe may be reckoned the Capital <hi>Saw, Raſpatories, Levatories, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 Inſtruments required in <hi>Trepanning.</hi>
                  </note>and <hi>Heads.</hi> The Figures of which you ſhall have exactly delineated at the end of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>I will only touch upon the uſe of every of theſe, and ſhall come to the <hi>Trepanning</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Raſp</hi> is generally uſed in a Fiſſure, and Foul Bone, and when you uſe them, place your Patient in a good poſture, let him have his Ears ſtopped with wool, cover the Wound with Linnen Cloath, that the Patient may not have the lips thereof touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The next is <hi>Levatories,</hi> theſe uſed chiefly for the raiſing up of a depreſſed Skull; when you uſe theſe, take care that an even hand be kept. Thirdly, we come to the <hi>Capital Saw,</hi> this chiefly uſed in a depreſſion or Fracture on one ſide of the Bone, uſed alſo to remove away the diſtance of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> left after the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Trepan,</hi> and this brings me to the <hi>Trepan</hi> it ſelf; wherein we may enquire its uſe, and in what <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Trepan</hi> and its uſe.</note>places it is to be applied, and what method uſed after it. Of each in their order:</p>
               <p>And becauſe Perforation, Trepanning or Trafining is of great uſe when the Bones are extreamly foul, but of moſt uſe in theſe Diſeaſes of Fiſſures, Fractures and Contuſions of the <hi>Cranium;</hi> and ſince the Uſe hereof is of great moment, and the Operation of great danger, how much ſhould the young Chirurgeon make trial of his Art upon dead Skulls, which is a ready way to bring his hand in ure to practiſe upon the living? Wherein he ought alſo to be very cautious in what caſes he is to apply this; for neither a Fiſſure or Fracture do abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require this Inſtrument, as without which they were not to be cured: And Nature, we may ſee in many caſes in ſlight Contuſions, uſeth her endeavours very happily for the diſcuſſing of the extravaſed Blood, without the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59608:80"/>
aſſiſtance hereof; except the innate heat be much leſſened by extream cold. But indeed in ſuch caſes as where the extravaſion of the Blood doth occaſion Putrefaction, this is to be applied with all ſpeed; for this Putrefaction doth bring a great company of ill Symptoms with it, and oft-times Death it ſelf. It helps to raiſe the depreſſed Bones from the two Membranes, and helps all thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies as Splints and the like, by making way for their exition; and hereby alſo have we brought a fair method to give us to ſee our work before us: This is not to be applied upon the Fracture if the bones be ſevered; not upon a Suture, becauſe hence the Nerves, Veins and Arteries by which the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is annexed to the <hi>Pericrane,</hi> might hereby be lacerated: Neither is it to be applied to the Temples, both in reſpect of the Temporal Muſcle, and alſo of the Squammoſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The manner of <hi>Trepanning.</hi>
                  </note> Theſe being premiſed, the hair being ſhaved, and the Skin and <hi>Pericrane</hi> divided in form of a Croſs, and the <hi>Cranium</hi> made bare and fit for your Operation, let the Patient be well placed, and his head firmly held, his Ears being ſtopt with Cotton, then ſet on the <hi>Trepan</hi> with a Pin, which I have already acquainted you muſt neither be upon the Fracture or Suture. The Chirurgeon hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inſtrument in his left hand, and with his right gently turning about the ſame until he have fixed it; this once being fixed, let him take out the Pin, and apply the <hi>Trepan</hi> again without it, ſtill keeping it in its motion, and if you perceive any ſmall filings of the Skull appear, remove your <hi>Trepan,</hi> and wipe them away; this <hi>Trepan</hi> is ſometimes to be dipt in Oyl, both for its more ready and eaſie performing its Office, and ſometimes in Water that it grow not hot. If any Blood appear, it is a certain ſign that it hath penetrated the firſt Table, and this directs you to be very careful how you proceed, leſt you hurt and wound the <hi>Menin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>

When you perceive the piece of Bone is looſed by the <hi>Trepan,</hi> you may with a fine Levatory or ſmall Inſtrument free it by degrees from the other parts of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> ſo as you may without danger take it up with your <hi>Forcipes,</hi> if any ragged pieces appear, which may hurt the <hi>Meninges,</hi> you are to remove them; all being removed, apply a piece of white Taffaty or Satten dipt in <hi>Mel Roſarum &amp; Oleum Roſarum</hi> until the 7th day, after which uſe the Oyl of Roſes &amp; <hi>Ol.

                  <note place="margin">2 Differencies of Contuſion.</note> In Contuſion, theſe two Differences are generally obſerveable, the Bone being either wholly contuſed, ſo as that the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is forced to flee from the <hi>Cranium;</hi> or, not wholly Contuſed, but Superficially. Theſe do generally happen in Children, whoſe Skulls are thin, and more properly allowed to be Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous than Boney. Suddenly after the blow is given, or hurt occaſioning this Contuſion, it doth not appear; nor yet the hurt which is contracted in the Bone: but within a few days after, the colour of the <hi>Cranium</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and will appear whitiſh without redneſs; and if it be carious, it will appear livid or blackiſh; and where this appears, you are by your <hi>Raſpe</hi> or Scraping Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take away ſo much of the Bone until the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is quite extirpated, and then to heal the Wound by Incarnatives. And becauſe it oft-times happeneth that Children and Infants by reaſon of the weakneſs of their Heads and Legs are oft ſubject to fall from high places, being left alone, and hereby do receive very ſad and miſerable Contuſions in their Heads. And here according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Aphoriſm, the Blood being praeternaturally transfuſed into ſome Cavity, doth there corrupt: That we may preſcribe a right Curative me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, we are to take notice, that this putrifying Blood be not permitted to deſcend to the <hi>Dura Mater:</hi> And therefore ſometimes opening the <hi>Cutis</hi> for the diſcharge of this matter, the Patient is brought into great danger. And that this effect may more accurately be treated, we are to abſtain from Section or Inciſion; for by the reaſon of this copious efflux of Blood, the Spirits become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and Fluxion excited by occaſion of this Inciſion; and Children hereupon alſo being diſturbed and vexed, by crying, and the like, the Veins of the Head become tumified, and Inflammation follows, and very oft Death it ſelf: And therefore for a more ſafe method to be uſed, Take this:</p>

                  </gap> that which hath the Bone exalted. But this Species of a Fracture doth much differ from a Fiſſure, becauſe in this is an Introceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but none to be found in a Fiſſure, the Bone in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in its proper ſtate and nature: from a Contuſion alſo; for although the Bone do introceed in it, yet the Continuity thereof is not ſolved; whereas in a Depreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Introceſſion, the Bone is fractured into many ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And here alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his obſervation may be well applyed; as we daily ſee, hard things do rather break than bend, whereas ſoft things we ſee do more readily bend than break: But in a Wound happening with a depreſſion of the Skull, we ſee apparently, that there is not only made a Divorce of Parts in the <hi>Cranium,</hi> but fractures them ſo, that they are ſeen to lodge upon the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> there compreſſing it, the which lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Parts here thus happening, do hinder the motion of the Brain, and are oft-times ſeen to appear fixed, like ſo many Splints or Shivers upon its Membrane, terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perplexing it. And the caſe lyes here parallel with the Heart; for as the body of the Heart doth attract and expel its Subſtances, by its extending and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality in its proper times and circuits, ſo alſo doth the Brain, in which is ſeated the animal Spirit contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its Ventricles, tranſmit the ſame to every Part,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59608:90"/>
being thereto incited by a fit and proper motion, and thereby doth diſtribute and elaborate the ſame. But when this motion is intercepted by a compreſſion of the Bones and Splints, and the like falling thence, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution and elaboration muſt neceſſarily be violated, which motion doth evidently appear in wounded people, whoſe Heads are detected, and in new born Children. Without doubt therefore the Parts being thus fractured, the Membranes muſt hereby receive much prejudice; and in theſe dangerous caſes, the Chirurgion hath left him but ſmall ground to build any hopes for a Cure. In ſuch matters therefore which carry ſuch evident peril with them, the buſineſs is chiefly to be left to Nature, the beſt and moſt ſafe Miſtreſs for preſerving her Parts in form, ſave only we are to aſſiſt her with our beſt skill and endeavour, to prevent all evil Accidents and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which may intervene before the fourth day, if you come at the firſt, and ſo from the fourth to the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>And as to the Cure hereof; Thoſe Splints or Shivers which are quite looſe, raiſe up with your <hi>Elevatory,</hi> and take them away: But if you meet with a Fracture, that is only looſe at one end in the Bone, adhering in the other, here are you to uſe the <hi>Trepan,</hi> to be applied as near to the fractured Part as may be, and then to take away a ſmall part of the <hi>Cranium</hi> with it; and if you cannot reduce the depreſſed Bones to their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeparate and take them out by Art, and uſe that care, that you may happily conclude your Cure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> or its ſubjacent Parts.</p>

he fell upon the ground like a dead Man, with the loſs both of ſpeech, ſight and hearing; beſides which, he was correpted with a Palſie in the oppoſite ſide: the <hi>Cranium</hi> being in few days elevated, and reduced into its natural ſite, he recovered his ſpeech, and the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms began to grow remiſs; and at length was reſtored to his priſtine health.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
                  </note> On the contrary alſo he writes of a young Man of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of Age, who falling from his Horſe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was ſo ſmitten by him, that it occaſion'd an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in his Skull; but in reſpect little or nothing of evil Symptoms appeared at the firſt, the Wound alſo being but ſmall, the Patient was neglected, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſmall time after, being beyond expectation ſurprized with terrible Symptoms, beyond all methods and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, he was correpted with a Fever, pain of his Head, and inquietude of his whole Body; the Wound grew inflamed, ſinuous and full of Matter, and the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> found to be depreſſed, and in few days he ended his Life.</p>
               <p>By theſe two Examples we may apparently find, how neceſſary it is at the firſt to reduce the depreſſed <hi>Cranium</hi> into its natural ſite, and how dangerous in the contrary the Neglect hereof may prove, as we ſee in the latter of theſe two Hiſtories; for in ſmall and ſlender Depreſſions of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> the motion of the Brain may be hindred, and eſpecially if they happen upon or near the Sutures.

deſperate Wounds in his Head; The firſt happening in his Front, two tranſverſe fingers above the eye, paſſing thence to the <hi>Zygoma,</hi> dividing the Eye in its middle; the ſecond in the left <hi>Bregma,</hi> entring even to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> two fingers in length, and one finger in breadth; The third, the worſt of the reſt and moſt dangerous, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in the <hi>Occiput;</hi> this being four fingers long, and two fingers wide: hence followed very direful Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, on the ſeventh day a Fever ſeized him, with a ſtrange numbneſs and ſtupidity; his courage failed, with loſs of Memory, an involuntary inteſtinal Flux ſeconded theſe, no Matter iſſuing from any part of the three Wounds, the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> appeared immoveable and black, all which did attend him even to the 30th day, ſo as there was little hopes left of any recovery, yet he was perfectly Cured.

The firſt two whereof we have already treated on. We come now to the third. And here may we premiſe, That Fractures happening upon the Sutures, are harder to cure than to find out: For here are we neither to Derade or Open with a <hi>Trepan,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which upholds the Brain, being tyed to theſe parts alſo, upon every ſlight occaſion being ſubject to Inflammation; but how few daily ſtudy theſe Precepts, and bear them in their Memories! And as I have already ſhewn in my Diſcourſe of Sutures, no Inciſion is to be made here, they being both weak, and eaſily perforated, hereby ſubjecting the Brain to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs: Becauſe alſo through theſe the Veins and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes do paſs, the which being but lightly touched by any ſharp Inſtrument, are made ſpeedily to flee thence. And then thirdly, becauſe a <hi>Callus</hi> being here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, doth hinder Tranſpiration. Hence alſo Worthy <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, That there's nothing more difficult in the undertaking of Wounds of the Head, than firſt to preſcribe a true Method as touching Section or Inciſion, when, and where to be made or done, neither ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially nor diminutely. And becauſe he would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit thoſe places which are dangerous and will not admit Inciſion, here as he propoſeth the Temporal Muſcles, ſo alſo doth he bring in the Sutures, to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59608:92"/>
places to make any Inciſion in. Yet becauſe it ſo happens, that a Colliſion doth happen in the brims of a Suture, and the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> which paſſeth through it occaſioned by a violent Compreſſion, ſuffers detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe direful caſes, where a Troop of fearful Symptomes doth accompany them, as Fever, Vomiting, Convulſion, and the like, and having no other hopes of ſaving your Patient but by your uſe of the <hi>Trepan,</hi> you are adviſed upon this neceſſary Point to apply your <hi>Trepan</hi> on either ſide of the Suture ſo carefully, that your Inſtruments do not touch it; hereby preventing thoſe horrible Symptomes which happen on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

That in all glaſſen Bodies or Veſſels which are hollow, being ſmitten in one part, they generally do crack or break in the other; and this may as well happen in the Head, as in any other Part: And the Reaſons which he brings are theſe; The Air contained in theſe glaſſen Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which do receive the Blow, being hereby contuſed and illiſed, doth carry the ſame to the Back-part, and there force a diviſion. And why the Air hath force enough alſo to do this, is ſufficiently evident, whenas we ſee it hath vigour and ſtrength enough to divide Mountains, and ſeparate Hills; and hence may it be granted much more readily, to have power enough in it to break a Glaſs in the contrary ſide; and when this Fracture doth happen by reaſon of any included Air, the Greeks do call this <hi>Apochema.</hi>

               <p>But to enlarge a little further; In every Percuſſion which is made in the Body, is there perceived or felt an

Impetuoſity and Agitation in the Spirits contained therein; and this is a ſpirituous Subſtance, which doth exhale continually from the Body: And hence is it that Bodies in Exhalation are diſſipated; and this doth inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in the inward Parts of the Body; and therefore in every Percuſſion we ſhall meet with a ſpirituous Habit agitated.</p>
               <p>Again, Many have been ſeen to have their Heads fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured in the back-part of their Skulls, and yet by a large Flux of Blood through their Noſtrils hereupon happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have been perfectly cured and recovered; and whence ſhould this Blood flow but from the lacerated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Veſſels? but you read not of many cured, who being ſmitten on the fore-part of their Heads, have their Veſſels rent in the back-part thereof, becauſe the Blood here hath not any paſſage allowed it for its diſcharge. This Fracture is ſometimes ſeen to happen on the ſame Bone, and then this falls out either to be laterally or perpendicularly, the firſt having in it a Wound given in the right ſide, and a Fracture hereby purchaſed in the left; or from the upper Part to the lower, and here both Tables are generally allowed to be fractured. Or it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in many Bones, and theſe alſo do communicate the Blow to the oppoſite Part, where meeting the <hi>Cranium</hi> in its violent motion; as two Men readily upon a quick motion meeting each other, doth make them give way and fall back: Thus the Skull receiving a Blow, doth communicate the ſame very ſpeedily to the other Part thereof, and there doth frame a Fracture, being denied a ſpeedy paſſage through it.</p>

                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in theſe kinds of Fractures, will admit of no Remedies, or the undertaking of their Cure, the affected Part not being eaſily found out: Yet he further adviſeth us, That where any ſuſpition of a Fracture doth offer, although it be a matter of difficulty to find it out; yet he lays down this as a Method for undertaking the

And ſince this is ſo difficult, the Fiſſure lying ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure under the <hi>Cutis,</hi> and without any notice thereof being taken, at firſt how cautelouſly and conſiderately had a Chirurgeon undertaken ſuch a matter of danger, wherein he is adviſed both by Rule and Authority to gain its true knowledge, before he undertake any Cure: For having attained its artificial conjecture, upon dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſound Part the Patient doth oft-times miſcarry, and what miſerable calumny this may bring upon his head, any rational Creature may eaſily judge. And as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> allows, may well be called <hi>Infortunium;</hi> for on the contrary ſide, if Section and Inciſion be not made in this caſe, the Part affected runneth into an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſs; and this alſo is aſcribed to the Chirurgeon's neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; ſo as we may behold, being concerned herewith, how ſubject he is to Calumny and misfortune, and an unkind apprehenſion. And ſince as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, we cannot arrive here at the true place, and ſo thence diſcharge the Matter inwardly lodged; for want
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59608:94"/>
hereof the Part ſuddenly doth ſuppurate and inflame, and hence throwing it ſelf upon the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> through the Fiſſure, doth at length reach the Brain it ſelf. And hence are we by his Directions either not at all to undertake this Cure, or be therewith concerned; or if being thereto allured by perſwaſion of Friends, we are to uſe our greateſt endeavour to gain its Knowledge; the which once having arrived at, you are, if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table be fractured, the firſt remaining whole, come to the application of your <hi>Trepan,</hi> both for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Splints and Matter. And if upon acting your part with Judgement added to your Art, it ſo happens your Patient miſcarry or die, you ſhall have theſe four Excuſes to defend you: As the <hi>Cranium</hi> being depreſſed by a violent Contuſion, and then doth preſently return to its proper place; if the Fiſſure be only Capillary and Superficial, and hard to be found out; when the ſecond Table is fractured, the firſt remaining entire; and when a Fiſſure on Fracture doth happen in an oppoſite Part to that which was wounded; any of theſe four being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to deceive the beſt and moſt wiſe of Chirurgeons.

                  <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi>
                  </note> The firſt of theſe immediately planted under the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> is the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> the which by <hi>Falloppius, Bauhine,</hi> and many other accurate Anatomiſts, is ſaid to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of two Membranes; it receives into it Veins, and a few Arteries, theſe being conſtituted not only for the ſafety of the Brain and its Nerves, but alſo for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of the two Brains, dividing alſo the medullous Matter into a right and a left ſide, and into an anteriour and poſteriour Brain, the one being properly called <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebrum,</hi> the other <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> the two ſides thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided by a <hi>Falx,</hi> the which hath allowed it four Cavities for the tranſition of its Veſſels.

                  </gap>, the which he had from <hi>Hippocrates in lib. Epilepſ.</hi> where he ſaith, That <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59608:97"/>
ſcatterings of the Sperm, and doth immediately adhere to the Brain, containing the Veins and Arteries of the Brain in it; it's ſubſtance is thin and ſoft, framed thin, that it may with eaſe inſinuate it ſelf into the Brain and its Cavities, and that it may expand its Veſſels through its Body; it is ſoft and of exquiſite ſenſe, becauſe it communicates a tactive virtue to the Brain and its Nerves. Nature placed this, as <hi>Galen</hi> writes, 8 <hi>lib. de Uſu part.</hi> between the Brain and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> leſt the Brain might be offended by ſo hard a Neighbour; and as <hi>Plato</hi> writes, even as a Medium between Fire and Earth; theſe being of a contrary Quality, the Almighty hath interpoſed Water and Air. Even thus the Brain and the <hi>Cranium</hi> being of a different nature, mould and ſubſtance, Nature hath put theſe two Membranes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; and that we may admire the ſagacious foreſight of Nature in her operations, we may ſee how admirably ſhe hath wrapt up the Brain in this <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and how ſhe hath incompaſſed this with a thicker Membrane.</p>
               <p>And having thus given you the brief Diſcourſe of the Anatomy of theſe two parts, we are now to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what prejudices theſe may be brought, for they may ſuffer both Pain, Inflammation, Apoſtemation, Blackneſs, and the like.</p>
               <p>Where therefore the Membranes of the Brain are hurt, there generally attend thereon great Pain, after which follows a Vomiting, ſometimes <hi>Delirium,</hi> Convulſion, Redneſs of the Eyes and Face, and as <hi>Galen</hi> writes, the Stomach doth ſhare with the Head in its griefs, and the Head with the Stomach, by a conſent of the deſcendent Nerves being placed at its mouth; and hence doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a loſs of Appetite, and a weakneſs both of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive and expulſive Faculty; a redneſs of the Eyes muſt follow, for their Coats have their Originations from the Membranes of the Brain; a Fever alſo ſucceeds, by reaſon of the exagitation of the animal Spirits lodged
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59608:98"/>
in the Brain, and theſe accidents are greater or ſmaller, according to the greatneſs or parvity of the hurt. And becauſe the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is ſeldom hurt alone, but the Brain doth ſhare and communicate with it in its harms, hence doth oft-times follow an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> loſs of Voice and Reaſon; for the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> being hurt, the Brain it ſelf doth ſoon decay, it being chiefly made of Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, through which are carried the vital Spirits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> or according to thoſe which are made animal; and theſe do not only cover the Brain, and nouriſh it, but alſo paſs into its Venters, and by or through its Orifices are its vital Spirits conducted into the body of the Brain; and hence happens loſs both of Speech and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>If therefore you perceive that there is an immoderate Flux of Blood upon the Membrane's being wounded, you are ſpeedily to prohibit it, that you may come to the Membrane it ſelf. And becauſe Pain is here a very troubleſom Companion, allay and abate this next, both for prevention of Inflammation and Convulſion: And for this may you uſe Oyl of Roſes, Oyl of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, Oyl of Myrtils; theſe or any thereof to be applied warm to the Membrane. <hi>Foreſtus</hi> doth order, That in Wounds of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> for the firſt 4 or 6 days the whole Head is to be anointed with Oyl of Roſes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time to apply <hi>Unguentum Matriſilvae,</hi> thus made: <note place="margin">

On the third day an intolerable Pain ſeized him, with Vomiting, Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a redneſs of his Eyes and Face: Hence was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Matter to be contained between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> or between that and the <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Cutis</hi> and the <hi>Pericrane</hi> being ſeparated from the <hi>Cranium,</hi> with the capital Saw ſome part of the Bone was taken out, ſo much as neceſſity required; the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> was dilated (not with the <hi>Trepan,</hi> becauſe the Wound and Fracture happened near the Sutures) and nothing of hopes of any recovery appeared; but the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Mater</hi> ſeemed to be elated into a Tumour, the which with a dextrous hand, and a crooked Inciſion-Knife, was dilated, not hurting the <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> Which done, much Matter iſſued out, which was inwardly collected, and to the Part affected was applied this following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine: ℞ <hi>Syr.

the which was continued, until the Matter was wholly diſcharged, both out of the capacity of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and alſo out of the lips of the Wound: Then by applying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnatives and Epolonticks, he was perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

But contrary to their verdict and preſage, without any ill Symptom happening, within 50 days the Patient was

                  </gap>, becauſe it is contained <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in the Head. It is generally allowed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Body, proved both by its ſituation, figure, and defences; and alſo in reſpect of its uſes. As to the three firſt of theſe, I have already diſcourſed; and as to its uſe it's moſt excellent: For as <hi>Varolius</hi> ſaith, The Soul of Man being not tyed to any bodily Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot apprehend thoſe outward things which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59608:100"/>
are without it ſelf, unleſs it be by the mediation of a Corporeal Organ, into which the Species of forms of material ſubſtances may be tranſmitted, by which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they may be exhibited, and in which place they may both be apprehended and contemplated. Hence therefore who will deny that the Brain is the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the Members, ſeeing it is the Seat of all the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Faculties, Imagination, Senſe, Diſcourſe, Reaſon, and Memory? And hence <hi>Aphrodiſaeus</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the <hi>Heaven;</hi> hence coming all Senſe and Motion which is beſtowed on the ſubjacent parts. It is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Head as in its Caſtle; and in the Upper part as being the Palace of the Soul. As to its Magnitude and Connexion, it is generally found in Man of a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, becauſe it being the Inſtrument of his Reaſon, it is neceſſary it ſhould require and contain in it a plenty of ſpirits: It's knit to the <hi>Cranium</hi> by Veins, Arteries and Nerves, with the reſt of its parts: As to its Subſtance, it is made of Sperme and the maternal Blood; and out of theſe two is generated this glandulous matter. It is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally white from its ſpermatick matter furniſhed with many ſpirits: It is ſoft, being the Original of the ſoft Nerves; in its <hi>Cerebellum</hi> it's not ſo ſoft, this being the Origination of Nerves which are more hard: It is of a cold and moiſt temper; and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>de Carnibus,</hi> calleth it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or the chief Seat of cold and glutinous moyſture, framed thus to hold and contain the ſubtile animal ſpirits; and cold, for tempering their heat. I ſhall pretermit the diviſions of the Brain, and its Coats, and come to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, where we may meet with it furniſhed with a callous body, two ſtriated bodies, a <hi>Thalamus Opticus Nervorum, Natiformal Prominencies, Medullary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, Glandula Pinealis, Orbicular Protuberances,</hi> called <hi>Nates,</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> an <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> and a <hi>Cerebellam</hi> with

its ſubſtance and ſubſtracted Cavities. All which may be ſeen at large in Dr. <hi>Tho. Willis,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Anima Brutorum:</hi> To which I recommend you.</p>

Wounds of the Brain if they have not reached the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, they are curable, although the ſubſtance of the brain it ſelf be wounded; but theſe being wounded, the caſe will be dangerous. Beſides theſe, upon the brain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded, you will find your Patient have a foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his mouth, a cloudineſs overcaſting his ſight, a <hi>Delirium</hi> accompanying theſe, with a Convulſion, Fever, Vomiting of Choler, loſs of Reaſon, Dumbneſs, a Palſie, and laſtly ſee him correpted with an Apoplexie.</p>

of the part, and its neceſſity of motion, with its moyſt nature, and the conſent of the Nerves which it brings into miſery and calamity with it. All theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered with the not eaſie paſſage or entrance of Medicines to Wounds here received, may well grant theſe Wounds not eaſily to be Cured, nor yet to go without danger. Yet Hiſtory makes good, that large Wounds ſometimes being here inflicted, have been cured, as you ſhall ſee more at large at the end of this Chapter; and that chiefly in theſe three caſes; As when they happen in a ſound &amp; ſtrong body, meeting with an artificial dreſſing of this Wound; and laſtly to the true Providence of the Almighty, who can as well lengthen the Lives of ſome, as ſhorten the ſame of others.

Hereupon the Patient fell to the ground, and there lay near half an hour, and was given over for a dead man, being ſenſleſs, and was thence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to his Houſe; and hence followed commotion of his <hi>Brain,</hi> and for three whole days he not only loſt his Speech, but Motion too; a great part of his bones of his Head were depreſſed, and laid upon the <hi>Brain,</hi> and blood flew both out of his Eyes and Ears; his Head and Neck was tumified, and looked of a black colour. After the 8th day, the Head opened ſpontaneouſly, both from the <hi>Sinciput</hi> and <hi>Occiput,</hi> and alſo in either ſide; and then three Apoſtemes brake forth, the Bones being reſtored to the proper places.

               <p>Of theſe Nervous Bodies are reckoned by <hi>Galen</hi> three kinds <hi>(viz.)</hi> Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments. Of each of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An Organick Part.</note> It's called an Organick Part, being an Organ convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animal Spirits; it's made of a white Subſtance, ſpun and wrought out of many ſmall ſpermatick Fibres, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted with moſt ſubtil Pores, for tranſition of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59608:110"/>
animal Spirits; it is made of a threefold Subſtance; the firſt being medullary and white, ariſing from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Brain; the ſecond and third gives it its dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Membrane, inveſting this Subſtance: And conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Nerves do take their Originations of and from the Brain, and as <hi>Picolhominus, Bauhine,</hi> and other expert Anatomiſts do write that from the medullary Part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, doth paſs hence through the Cavities of the <hi>Cranium</hi> and Vertebres, and ſo deſcending forwards. And as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome of theſe Nerves are ſoft and others hard, as I have already ſhown, ſome being moſt neceſſary for conveying of the animal Spirits, ſo by their ordinary Influx a Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition doth follow, and by this Influx the Parts ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſenſe and motion may the better be moved, and more exquiſitely be allowed to receive their ſenſe. And becauſe they are the proper Trunks and Channels, by which the animal Spirits are carried and conducted to the inſtruments of voluntary ſenſe and motion, their Membranes being the inſtruments of theſe ſenſes, the which by how much they receive a greater quantity of Nerves, and ſo conſequently animal Spirits, they moſt exactly and exquiſitely receive and obtain a more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral plenty and freedom of motion and ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is.</note> 
                  <hi>Caſpar Bauhinus</hi> will have a Tendon to be a ſimilar Part, continued from the beginning to the ending of a Muſcle, being of the ſame kind and nature with that of the Nerves, and bred out of ſeed, as are the other ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Parts, which opinion is continued by many at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andraeas Laurentius,</hi> with <hi>Galen,</hi> and others, are of a contrary opinion, allowing this to be a diſſimilar Part, framed and intertexed out of the concourſe of moſt thin Fibres, Ligaments and Nerves interwoven together; it aſſuming its greateſt bulk from Ligaments, and a leſſer from the Nerves and their Fibres. And becauſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Nature being careful to leave no empty ſpace
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59608:110"/>
between theſe Fibres, ſhe hath planted a fleſhy Subſtance between their Series, where we may meet with its empty ſpaces filled and ſtuffed up therewith.</p>
               <p>To conclude this, A Tendon is nothing elſe than the fibrillous Subſtances of Nerves expanded and exploded, made and framed much in form of your <hi>Indian</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks, which are interwoven of fine Thread or Silk, whoſe middle Part although expanded and filled up by the intertexture of their woollen Parts, yet are contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in either end, and brought into a ſmaller and ſlenderer Subſtance, by the advantage of ſo many fine Chords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven and brought to one point.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</note> A Ligament is the 3d; and this by the Greeks is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>Vinculum,</hi> both by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle;</hi> from its figure and colour it is called <hi>Nervus,</hi> it being a cold, dry, firm, and ſimilar Part, yet looſe and flexible, collected out of many Parts; it gains its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the ſeed, as do the two former, bred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Membrane and a Cartilage; harder than a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, that it may not eaſily break, and ſofter than a Cartilage, for a more prompt motion of the Muſcles; it is not nouriſhed by Marrow, as <hi>Columbus</hi> conjectured, but with blood paſſing through the capillary Arteries, this being either large, narrow, plain, long, or ſhort, in figure according to the variety of the Parts; it ariſeth from the Bone, and is inſerted therein; its Uſes are chiefly two, that hereby the Members may obtain a good and proper motion, and alſo in their motions that they do not recede from their places, or that in a violent motion they may be kept in their proper places.</p>
               <p>And ſince we have preſented a ſhort view of theſe three, we may fairly by a brief Diſcourſe expreſs their annexions: For as every Muſcle hath allowed it a Nerve, ſome having more, as the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Muſcle three. <hi>Galen</hi> therefore doth nominate that Part wherein the Nerve is inſerted, the Head of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59608:111"/>
Muſcle; the middle Venter is the fleſhy Part thereof, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into many tendinous Interſections, the Tayl thereof being tendinous, annexed to the moving Part thereof, the which do much vary, according to the ſtrength or ſmall motion of the Parts, both in Form and Magnitude, being either narrow or broad, long or ſhort, thick or thin.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the Hurts of theſe Parts; and theſe are generally accounted Four, as Puncture, Inciſion, Contuſion and Diſtortion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Puncture of a Nerve.</note> We begin firſt with a Puncture of the Nerve: And here may we ſee theſe little Bodies, being endued with an exquiſite ſenſe, they being hurt, muſt neceſſarily <note place="margin">Preſages.</note>threaten danger; for ſlight and ſlender Hurts here do produce Spaſmes; and theſe happen by Pain, the which doth lead the whole Body into intemperiety and paſſion. Fiſſures of the Nerves are hard to cure, by reaſon of their cold nature, being in ſubſtance both cold and exſanguial, their Humidities admitting no digeſtion. Such as are tranſverſly wounded, are more dangerous than thoſe which are hurt in a direct line; for hereby both Senſe and Motion are deſtroyed at once, and therefore are to be ſuſpected. Contuſion happening here doth produce its effects alſo, by reaſon of its thick and viſcous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which doth repleniſh them, and makes them fit for putrifaction, they being denied their native heat; and hence follows Inflammation and Putrifaction at the beginning.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure of Nerves in general.</note> As to the Cure of Nerves in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here is chiefly to be ſtudied the removal of Pain and Inflammation: And for theſe a good order of Diet, a ſubſtraction of the antecedent Matter, that it flow no further to the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part, and application of convenient Topicks for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging of Pain, educing of Excrements, and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Parts from Convulſion; theſe are good and proper Engines to work with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59608:111"/>
But to come to each in their order; and to begin with a Puncture of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The wounded Nerves do require very drying Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, having an attractive quality in them, being of thin Parts. Now whereas this is an accident, which doth moſt commonly happen to them, by the ignorance of the Chirurgeon ſometimes, as well as by the aſſault of ſome violent Thruſt, Puncture, or the like; here are two ſcopes to be preſcribed: The firſt of which toucheth the Part affected, which is to be treated with ſtrong dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines, and ſuch as may eaſe Pain; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to hinder Inflammation. The Nerve therefore is to be opened, and its thin and humid Subſtances to be dried up, which do procure the inward injury; and for this Uſe you are to apply hot Medicines, for the educeing theſe Vapours, attracting of the Humidities about the affected Part. And here be ſure before you undertake any application, that you remove and extract all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Bodies, which may lodge in the wounded Part, if any remain therein, as Needles, Glaſs, Bone, Splints of Wood, or the like, hereby taking care that we add no affliction to the afflicted Part. Hence are we by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s Authority here directed for Women, Children, and the like perſons who are tender and ſoft, to uſe Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine by it ſelf, or to mix therewith Sulphur or <hi>Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium.</hi> And to hinder Inflammation, is a great intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Punctures of the Nerve; and this is to be conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Phlebotomy, once or more times to be made uſe of, as occaſion may require, hereby to diſcharge a good quantity of the Blood, both for prevention of Fever and Inflammation.</p>
               <p>Next may we ſtorm this by Catharticks, which have power to baniſh it by ſiege, by firſt preparing the Body with <hi>Mel Roſarum, Syr. de Betonic. Oxymel,</hi> or the like; then to preſcribe a convenient Cathartick, made either of <hi>Caſſia, Manna, Rhubarb, Senna, Confectio</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59608:112"/>
                  <hi>Hamech. Diacatholicon, Elect. è ſucc. Roſar. Pil. Coch. Rudii,</hi> or the like. And here alſo as to the affected Part, we are here to conſider both the breadth and narrowneſs of the affected Part, and its Wound; for if the Wound be ſo narrow, as that the Matter cannot have vent for its exition, and the ſtrength and force of the Medicine cannot reach the Puncture, here are we to dilate, and make the Wound wider, by cutting it ſo wide, as the Nerve may well appear; if the Wound be large enough, we are here to view the Symptoms which attend and offend; and here if Pain offers, this is to be abated: And for this purpoſe <hi>Galen</hi> propoſeth Oyl warmed, and with this to foment the Part; and hence is it alſo that we always uſe hot Oyls in Punctures of the Nerves, for this doth ſpeedily make Pain ceaſe and vaniſh. But ſome may ſeem here to quarrel with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who writes, That Oyl is humecting and mollifying, and ſo an enemy conſequently to the Nerves, which do require drying Medicines, and therefore how to be approved of in theſe caſes? It's true it is ſoftning and humective; yet we find that a punctured Nerve being kept for 2 or 3 days in Oyl, hath not received any injury thereby, but hath hereby rather gained a large mitigation of Pain, and therefore in reſpect of the Symptoms is advantagiouſly here to be uſed, the Pain being abated. Next indeed in reſpect of the nervous Subſtance being cold and dry, we are authorized to uſe hot and dry Medicines; dry, that they may keep up and maintain the proper temper of the Nerves; and hot, that they may take off all cold from them; the true temper of theſe Medicines are to be very drying, and moderately hot. In a punctured Nerve we may alſo note, That the Nerve which is thus punctured, can endure the moſt hot Oyl, which the Finger cannot. Whence I collect, That a Nerve hath not in it a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe, but only an exquiſite ſenſe; and therefore all ſuch Medicines which are here to be applied, ſhould
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59608:112"/>
be freed of all aſperity and ſharpneſs; and the ſubſtance of the Nerve being hard, the temper of the Medicine ſhould be thin and penetrating.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> Another thing herein worthy note, which I muſt not pretermit, is, That if any Matter remain at the bottom of the wounded Nerve, it is as bad as poyſon, executing there its traiterous venomous qualities, procuring for its companion, Pain.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we are further to note, That the proper Medicines which are here to be uſed and applied, ought not only to be hot and drying, but to have in them an educeing and extracting quality. And theſe Medicines are either ſimple or compound; amongſt the Simples may be reckoned Roſine of the Fir-Tree, Turpentine, Gum Elemni, Oyl of Turpentine, and Oyl of Fir; theſe being both thin bodied, and having in them an educeing and extracting quality, to fetch every ichorous Matter from the bottom of the Wound. Stronger than theſe may be reckoned Liquid Pitch, <hi>Ol. Petrol. Sagapen. Opoponax, Sulphur vivum, Euphorbium,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> Another thing remarkable in theſe Wounds, is, That no Lint is here to be applied, for this doth choak up the Matter, and hinder its exition, and hence follows into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Falloppius</hi> doth much commend <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> as the beſt and chiefeſt of Medicines for theſe kind of Wounds, and calls it his <hi>Sacra Anchora,</hi> it never deceiving him that uſeth it, but doth further anſwer expectation; yet he makes a vaſt difference between <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> the beſt being neweſt, and appearing like black Reſin at its ends; the old is yellow and reddiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Unguent.</note> Now having ſhewn the Simples, it's time to come to Compounds, of which take theſe; ℞ <hi>Sagapen. Opopanac. an. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij.

               </head>
               <p>HAving run through all the Wounds of the <hi>Head,</hi> We next come to thoſe which may happen to the Front or <hi>Forehead,</hi> called <hi>Frons à ferendo,</hi> becauſe it carries in it the lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Heavineſs, Cheerfulneſs, Sadneſs or Moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And that which makes it ſo moveable, is the two Muſcles of which it is compoſed; the which <hi>Riolanus</hi> doth call the Membranous fleſhy Muſcle, it begins from the Eye-lids, and ends where the hair begins; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of a <hi>Cuticula, Cutis,</hi> a little fat, and a <hi>Membrana Carnoſa;</hi> it hath two ſorts of Fibres allowed it, for help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwards the elevation of the Eye-lids. If a Wound happens here, and that with hurt of the frontal Bone, here are we to ſtudy ſecurity of the parts, more than their beauty, becauſe theſe Wounds are dangerous; for here the Wound is to be dilated, and the Bone to be deraded, and the ſame method to be uſed as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn you in Wounds of the Skull: But where
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59608:118"/>
Wounds happen here without any hurt to the Bone, here are we to ſtudy their Cure to be performed with the leaſt of Scarr or Deformity: And as a Wound may happen here, without loſs of ſubſtance, here are we to Cure as we do other Wounds; yet with this reſpect to regard the habit of the Body. Hence alſo if a Flux of Blood be preſent which may hinder union, this is firſt to be minded, then are we to proceed to the uniting of the parts. And becauſe Sutures here do leave their marks, we are to abſtain from theſe, and to apply ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as may unite the Lips of the Wound; the which being conjoyned are ſo to be kept: and for this uſe a ſmall and narrow Ligature is very proper, applying ſome agglutinative Medicine to the Wound before you uſe the Ligature: As hereto adding the white of an Egg well beaten, to which may be added Dragons blood, Maſtich, Frankincenſe, Sarcocolla, and the like, to be made into the Conſiſtence of Honey; this way may you prevent an ill Cicatrice. In a tranſverſe Wound of the Forehead, no Ligature is proper; but here we are advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come to the ſtitch, and the ſecond dreſſing to cut off the ſtitches, and to apply ſome agglutinative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; theſe only to be uſed alſo where the lips of the Wound are at much variance, the which are by Suture to be brought to a mutual Contacture: For agglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Empl. Barbarum</hi> is very good, and <hi>Diapalma</hi> will do it; and where a good union is purchaſed, the place is to be anointed with <hi>Axungia Humana,</hi> the which by its natural property doth effect a fair Cicatrice. In theſe caſes, where you intend to procure a Cicatrice, <hi>Unguent. Tuthiae</hi> is very good, or <hi>Unguent. Ceruſsae</hi> in Summer time. And thus much of theſe Wounds.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Eye-lids</hi> being appointed by Nature as the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges to lift the Eye up and down, are ſometimes wounded: Theſe are framed for keeping out dirt and ill vapours from the Eye, and keep back all injuries from aſſaulting or coming near the Eye; they conſiſt of a thin <hi>Cutis,</hi> having no fat allowed them; inwardly wrapt up with a thin and light <hi>Pericrane,</hi> for the more eaſie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: each Eye hath two, one whereof we call the lower, in man not of much uſe, the other the upper, being of great ſervice to Mankind, endued with two Muſcles, the firſt being right, ſeated in the upper region of the Orbit, within the <hi>Thalamus</hi> of the Eye: the other ſaid to be Orbicular; but this by <hi>Riolan.</hi> and <hi>Spigelius</hi> is taken for two: <hi>Julius Caſserius, Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>de Orig. Viſ. Cap.</hi> 18. writes, That hence may be taken theſe Indications, ſuch as have an elated upper Eye-lid, are proud and fierce; and ſuch as have them depreſſed, are humble and mild. But to come to their Wounds: If the Ligaments of the Muſcles be not diſſected, uſe no Suture; for this doth bring intolerable pain and abſceſs: but if theſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, ſtitch them up with a deep and firm ſtitch. Now a Wound of the Eye-lid may happen either by a ſimple Inciſion, or with Inciſion with loſs of ſome of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In caſe of a Wound cauſed by a ſimple Inciſion lengthwayes made, according to the Series of the Fibres, here are we to uſe Cephalick and Agglutinative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſuch as have no ſharp quality in them. If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion be tranſverſe without loſs of ſubſtance, here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an exact agglutination, ſo as the lips of the Wound may fairly and evenly anſwer each other: The Sutures
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59608:119"/>
or Stitches that you make here muſt be deep, for taking faſt hold. If a Wound happens here with loſs of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſtudy the diſcharge of Matter, and procure a good Conſolidation; and for this Uſe Sarcoticks are the beſt Medicines, as <hi>Balſam.

               </head>
               <p>I Shall continue my Diſcourſes with a brief Anatomy of the Parts, as I treat of them, being very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the young Chirurgeon, to direct him in his handling of them, if wounded. And in this place of worth we muſt make a ſtop, to admire the wonderful Fabrick of the Eye, of what Parts it conſiſts, and how variouſly theſe may be hurt and wounded.</p>
               <p>But to begin with the Ancients: See how <hi>Laurentius</hi> and <hi>Spigelius,</hi> and <hi>Bauhine</hi> ſpeak of it. That whereas the Soul of Man, although it be ſimple, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet it cannot make its entrance into the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtulum</hi> of the Body, or arrive at underſtanding, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and ſpeculation into Fancies, without the help of Senſes. As therefore the Head is the Seat of Senſes, and Houſe of Reaſon, ſo alſo are theſe Senſes as Guards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Soul, and are planted as <hi>Internuntij</hi> in its Region. And although there are allowed 5 Senſes, yet the chiefeſt and principal of the reſt is Seeing, and that in theſe three reſpects; for this declares and ſhews to us the variety of Objects, and their differences. 2dly, Their ways and methods of operation are moſt noble, and do exceed the reſt, for viſion is made in an inſtant. It's theſe that give us our ſight and light alſo, the which the ancient Stoicks called the Divine Viſion; <hi>Heſichias</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Oculi, ab oculendo:</hi> They are lodged under the Eye-lids as under a Veil; they are the two Lights of our Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm, appearing as our bright Stars, being as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes of the Mind, and moſt inducing to ſweetneſs and comfort of Life: to paſs their admirable figure, ſite, connexion and temper, we come to its rare compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus may we ſee it framed of ſix Muſcles, thus called, <hi>Superbus, Humilis, Bibatorius, Indignatorius, Amatorij,</hi> or two circular Muſcles; having theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Membranes allowed it, the which I ſhall only name, <hi>Adnata, Innominata, Cornea, Sclirotis, Uvea, Choroides, Arena, Retiformis.</hi> It hath alſo theſe 3 Humours, as a Wateriſh, Vitreous, and Cryſtalline Humour granted it, with an Optick Nerve, Veins, Arteries, Fat, and Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules: Of each of theſe you may read more at large in <hi>Laurentius Spegelius,</hi> and <hi>Demerbroke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ſhewn how the Eyes are the Organs of Sight, we may alſo ſee how they may be affected, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, punctured; and theſe Parts having their Nerves and Membranes immediately ariſing from the Brain, this declares them to be of an exquiſite ſenſe, whoſe Coats are very thin, and perpetually in motion; hence are hereby Fluxions eaſily received into them; and theſe do require both an artificial and careful method to be uſed. In theſe Parts we are alſo adviſed by <hi>Galen,</hi> That we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain <note place="margin">Note.</note>from all oleaginous things, theſe here both infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and cauſing Pain: 2ly, To keep the Eye from the light, for this weakens it.

If therefore the Wound be a ſimple Wound, only penetrating and inciſing the <hi>Cornea</hi> or <hi>Conjunctura,</hi> and this happens, without any exition of its interiour Body or Humour, this is to be united. And for the performance hereof, we muſt be very careful and have regard to the Eye, for it's irritated by every ſmall thing; hence therefore if Pain afflicts it, remove it by Revulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if the Wound be deep, the weapon which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it, muſt paſs through the broad and long chink about the Orbits: If the Wound paſs into the Brain, it is mortal; if it reacheth not ſo far, but only doth enter the aqueous Humour, and makes that fly out, or the vitreous or Cryſtalline Humours; in theſe caſes Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are moſt proper, and theſe are to be uſed in very fine Powders, of which I have been very plentiful, they being made of <hi>Terra ſigillata, Bol. armen.

But if the piece doth cauſe pain, and a continual gleeting, and hurts the Eye-lids, this is thus to be dreſſed with <hi>Unguent. de Betonica,</hi> with which the Tent is to be arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, over which may be applied <hi>Oxelaeum:</hi> Or for the ſame Uſe this is excellent; ℞ <hi>Ol.

               <p>IN the foregoing Chapters I have ſhewn you the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Parts of the Head, and thoſe Parts which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with long Hairs: We come now to that Part which by ſome is called <hi>Vultus, à voluntatis Indicio,</hi> it being turned every way forwards and to the ſides accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our wills: It is alſo called <hi>Facies,</hi> becauſe it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the difference between Man and Beaſt. And here might we look into its Beauty, and conſider in every reſpect its fair compoſition: We may well admire its Maker; for although the treaſuries and ſtore-houſes of Judgment, Senſe and Reaſon, are placed in other Parts, yet for Beauty this doth ſurpaſs them: For in this may be eaſily ſeen the ſtorms and tempeſts of Anger and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſilver ſtreams of Love, the ſigns of Health, and the attempts of Death: Here may we lively ſee repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Idea's of Joy, Anger, Sadneſs, Melancholy, repreſenting the obſcure Parts of Man, as by a glaſs; ſome of its Parts are containing, others contained. The <hi>Cutis</hi> hereof hath in it this one remarkable thing, the which as it is variouſly perforated in the Eyes, Noſtrils, Ears and Mouth; as it is wholly nervous in the other Parts of the Body, in this it is muſculous and fleſhy. And becauſe I intend to treat of all its Parts in their ſeveral orders, I ſhall not give you any further trouble to read more hereof, but fall upon its Diſcourſe of being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And here although ſuch Medicines as are already ſet down, may ſerve for the curing of Wounds of the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59608:123"/>
Face, yet becauſe it's the comely Part of the Body, and beauty of its Front, affording a wonder to its Spectators, here ought it to be our greateſt care that we leave no ſcars, or foul Cicatrice. If the ſoft Parts be only wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cloſe the lips of the Wound with evenneſs, by a fair Ligature, and agglutinative Medicines; and herein are we directed to make uſe of narrow Rowlers, theſe being moſt proper for performing this Intention. As for ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative Medicines, I have already preſented you with a plentiful quantity; theſe may be made of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſence, <hi>Bol. armoni.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59608:124"/>
other, and by applications of good and proper Medicines the Wound was healed, and the Patient reſtored to his former health.</p>
               <p>He writes another Story of the ſame Man, who being ſmitten under the Chin even to the upper Mandible by a Bull's Horn, opened part of the Face therewith, and diſ-joyned his left Eye from the Noſe with the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the place being ſtitcht up with a Needle, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible was reſtored as you ſee in the former, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly was cured; his Mouth was inwardly waſhed with a Decoction of Barley, Roſes, Balauſtians, and honey of Roſes; and thus he was in a ſhort time recovered, many pieces of Bones coming forth by his Palate, which were broken by the Horn, and left remaining in the Cavity of the Palate.</p>

Hence did the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in their <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> ſignifie a wiſe Man by his Noſe, who could thereby ſmell other mens politick ſtratagems. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth call it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, becauſe through its noſtrils do paſs the Excrements of the Brain. <hi>Cicero</hi> writes, that it is placed above, for the better reception of Odours, and Nature placed it in a ſtraight line, that Reſpiration may not be interrupted, but paſs freely. It is divided into two Cavities by a partition, the odoriferous Spirits, or Air, do generally ſwim in them. This diviſion alſo is generally believed was thus made, for the more perfect receipt of the Senſe of Smelling; for we ſmell even in our breathing. It conſiſteth of a <hi>Cuticula, Cutis,</hi> Muſcles, Bones, Cartilages, and an inward Coat, all which have their proper actions.</p>
               <p>But becauſe many worthy Authors of Anatomy have fully and plentifully enlarged on theſe, I ſhall not trouble you further therein, but fall to our preſent task, where we may meet with it wounded either in its ſoft Parts only, or alſo in its hard Parts. We ſhall firſt begin with its ſoft Parts.</p>
               <p>Where by the way we are to note, That as the Noſe is Boney in the upper part, ſo is it Cartilaginous in the lower part. If the <hi>Cutis</hi> be only wounded, a dry Stitch may ſerve, not to come to Suture, but rather to uſe ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative Medicines, endeavouring to our utmoſt to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59608:126"/>
procure a fair and even Cicatrice. A ſmall skar here very evidently appearing, hence ought we to ſtudy to preſerve its Beauty, by curiouſly joyning the lips of the Wound together. In theſe caſes ſuch Medicines which are here to be uſed, are to be of a ſoft conſiſtence, and yet having in them an aſtringent and drying quality, hereby cloſing the lips of the Wound with that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that ſcarce any mark may be ſeen; and for this Uſe <hi>Unguent. Deficcativum Rubrum, Album Camphoratum,</hi> and ſuch as I have already mentioned, may do well here.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Wounds of the Bone of the Noſe.</note> The ſecond ſort of Wounds which may be allowed to happen here, muſt either reach the upper and boney parts, or the lower and Cartilaginous parts. Now if the upper part be wounded ſo as the Bone be fractured, the firſt Intention here is to reduce the Fracture, then joyn and unite the Wound: And for the performance of this, according to <hi>Aquapendens</hi> his advice, <hi>cap.</hi> 29. <hi>de Vuln. fol.</hi> 895. we are to put into the Noſe a fit piece of Wood, wrapt about with ſoft linnen Cloth, ſo as it may eaſily enter thereinto, outwardly ordering the Noſe with your fingers, for the true confirmation of it; this being done, we are to put in a Quill or ſmall Pipe into the Noſe, made of Reed, or the like, theſe not being exquiſitely round, but ſomewhat ſharp above and flat below, to preſerve its natural figure: For this Pipe hath theſe 3 Faculties allowed it; as that it keeps the conformation of the Part, and doth hinder the falling of any of the Bones into the Noſtrils; then it makes a free paſſage for breathing, keeping the Noſtrils open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and laſtly, makes the way free for the diſcharge of all Excrements from the Brain; here alſo take notice, that this Pipe be not put too high, leſt it doth occaſion ſternutation, and hereby do diſorder the reduced Fracture, and conſolidation of the Wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:59608:126"/>
The Bones being thus reduced, we next come to the uniting of the ſeparated Parts; which may be done by the dry Stitch or Agglutinatives; and as to ſay, <hi>Epolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Bol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> armeny, Dragons blood, Terraſigillata,</hi> and the like, being beaten into fine powder, and mixt with the white of an Egg, to the conſiſtence of Honey, is very good.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Wound.</note> If a tranſverſe Wound happeneth here, you are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to each ſide of the Noſtrils a fine linnen Boulſter, moiſtned in red Wine, and preſt out, over which to apply a Rowler, having a hole made in the middle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for a more free breathing, ſowing this to the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Head.</p>

If the Cartilaginous part of the Noſe be wholly cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Wound is incurable: But that the beauty of the Face may not be thus deformed, you may frame a new Noſe for it out of the skin of the Arm, or any other Part; but this is both a laborious, difficult, and long Work; it's made by ſcarrifying the pin of the Noſe, and cutting the skin of the Arm, anſwering that part of the Noſe which is loſt; and the skin being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to applied, and ſown with the ſcarrified part of the Noſe, the Arm is afterwards to be tyed to the Head, ſo as it be not any ways moved, for this would hinder Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination: Agglutination being made, the Noſe is to be ſcarrified with deep Scarrifications, ſo as the fleſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear red; then the neighbouring part of the Arm is to be cut, and put to the Noſe, and ſown; and this is ſo often to be repeated, until the whole Noſe be cut out, and the skin of the whole Arm be almoſt ablated, and agglutinated to the Noſe.

                  </gap>, in Engliſh, Ears, from Hearing. They are framed of many Parts, the which do as well ſerve for the reception of found, as alſo for the intenſion thereof. They are the inſtruments of Hearing, but not the principal Organs; for if theſe be loſt, as we ſee it inflicted as a puniſhment upon perjured perſons, yet the Senſe of Hearing doth continue, as well as the Senſe of Smelling, if the Noſe be amputated. Theſe Senſes being lodged within the <hi>Cranium,</hi> they gain a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircular ſhape; on the inſide excavated, Nature hath made them two, that one being injured the other may perform the Work. <hi>Veſalius</hi> compares the whole Ear to a Fan. <hi>Gaza</hi> calls this <hi>Pinna,</hi> being much like a broad Cartilage, or Fin of a Fiſh. By ſome it is called a Wing, broad, for the better embracing the ſound, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doth deſcend by the inward Compaſs unto the arched Cavity that guides it to the Head. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumference is called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But as touching the outward parts of the Ear, theſe being the proper Subjects of our preſent Diſcourſe: And here may we ſee a <hi>Cuticula,</hi> as the common covering of this part as well as of the reſt; next a Skin, enwrapping both the outſide and inſide of the Ear; it hath Veins diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed on either ſide from the external Jugulars; Arteries
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59608:128"/>
it hath from the inward <hi>Carotides,</hi> which do paſs to the backſide of the Ear; two ſmall Nerves it hath backward, and two from the ſides of the 2d Conjugation; they have both proper and common Muſcles allowed them, found out by <hi>Ealloppius;</hi> two others they have alſo; in all, four. The outward ſubſtance of the Ear is neither boney nor fleſhy, but moderately hard, yielding a ſound, an Eccho being as it were framed without, and ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried inwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its Cartilage ariſeth as it were out of the Temples; it's tyed to the petroſe Bone by a Ligament, which is ſtrong. There are many other parts belonging to the inward Ear, but Anatomy doth ſufficiently ſhew theſe, therefore I pretermit them. If the Ears be hurt by outward Cauſes, the danger is not great; yet if part thereof be quite cut off here, it never groweth again; and if they are only wounded, they require a right Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and agglutinative Medicines; and as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, the dryer any part is, the more drying Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines doth it require. If the Wound be to be ſtitched up, here are two things to be obſerved: That you only bring together the parts of the Skin on each ſide of the Ear, without touching or hurting the Cartilage: And then 2dly, If the Wound doth reach to that Cavity we call commonly <hi>Meatus Anditorius,</hi> you are to keep a ſpongy Tent in it, to prevent the growth of a ſpongy fleſh, and that no Matter may fall into it, which may exulcerate the inward parts; both which are ſet down for our inſtruction by <hi>Aqua pendens, fol.</hi> 904. <hi>cap.</hi> 33.</p>

               <p>WE are come now to ſpeak of our good or bad Friend, called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being tyed within the pale of the Teeth, or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned between the two barrs of the Teeth and the Lips. It's the notable Inſtrument both of Taſte and Voyce; its Baſis doth reſt upon the Bone <hi>Hyois;</hi> in Man it is ſomewhat long, and ſometimes ſeen to be longer in ſome Men than in others. It is ſoft, broad, and looſe, that it may be conveyed, dilated and variouſly diſpoſed; it is tyed to the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and to the <hi>Os Hyoidis,</hi> upon which its Roots do reſt. It's made of proper fleſh, a coat, Nerves, Veins, Arteries, Muſcles, and a Ligament; and this is very ſtrong, membranous and broad: and ſo had it need, for the keeping up of the Tongue ſometimes, and is as the bridle of the Tongue ſometimes to curb its unrulineſs. It receiveth its Coat from that which doth alſo inveſt the Mouth, Palate, <hi>Aeſophagos</hi> and <hi>Larynx.</hi> It's ſpun and made of fine and thin Fibres, for the better reception of ſavours. Its ſubſtance is ſoft and rare, much like a ſponge, for the more ſpeedy moyſtning with the humour which doth carry this ſapor in it; its fibres are expanded through the length of its muſcles: Which is not ſo in the Tongue it ſelf, It receiveth two Nerves from the third and fourth Conjugations. It hath two Veins called <hi>Raninae,</hi> iſſuing out of the inward branch of the external Jugular Veins. It doth receive its Arteries from the ſleepy Arteries; it's framed of many Muſcles, and hath many Muſcles allow'd it at its thick end, and theſe do help forward its functions of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59608:131"/>
ſpeaking, and rowling of the meat, and its taſting. Its muſcles are in number five pair, thus called, <hi>Stylogloſsi, Mylogloſsi, Geneogloſsi, Ypſiogloſsi,</hi> and <hi>Ceratogloſsi.</hi> And this Tongue, although it be but a little member thus furniſhed, is of great uſe, Expreſſing our Minds, and yielding us our taſting quality, being as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, the meſſenger of the Brain; and is alſo very uſeful as touching life, for this helpeth forward Maſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or chewing, aſſiſting alſo deglutition, by turning the meat over it, towards the Gullet: all which good turns it doth to Mankind.</p>
               <p>Now as touching its Wounds. The Tongue being thus guarded with a Sett of Teeth, and lodged within the Mouth, might ſeem to be defended againſt all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Injuries, yet this is ſometimes ſeen wounded: for when the Cheeks and the Jawes are wounded, the Tongue alſo may take ſhare of the Wounds. And it may be ſo wounded, that even a part of it may be cut off, and here the loſs is irreparable: If a part hereof doth adhere to the ſound part, here it is not to be cut away, but rather to be ſtitched up. Wounds happening here are dangerous for theſe two caſes, becauſe here we can neither uſe dry ſtitch nor Ligature; and then becauſe Emplaſtick Topicks have no power to hold on here. In every Wound of the Tongue, in which the ſound part is cut or divided, the Lips are to be adjoyned; and this is to be performed by Suture, as <hi>Aquapendens</hi> teacheth it: which is thus to be performed; The Tongue is to be drawn forth out of the Mouth, being holden by the Hand by a piece of Cloath between, you are to make ſo many and ſo deep ſtitches as are to be taken, for the true unition of the divided parts. The Wound being well ſtitcht up, we are to cut off the thread near the Knot.</p>
               <p>Next are we to uſe agglutinative Medicines, which may be made into Powders to be ſprinkled into the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59608:131"/>

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds of the <hi>Neck.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving run through all the Parts of the Head, We come next to the Neck, where we may meet with that part ſo properly called the Rock, which lyes juſt under the Head and Face, and upon the Breaſt. It obtains a round Figure, and becauſe in theſe parts are found various bodies, and this wrought out of their diverſity of works, theſe may ſhew diverſity of Species in theſe Wounds. For beſides its Muſcles and <hi>Cutis,</hi> which it hath beſtowed on it, in its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it hath planted the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> or Wind-Pipe, under which is placed the <hi>Aeſophagus</hi> or Gullet. At its Sides are put both the Jugular Veins and Arteries; in its back-part may we ſee the Spine; forwards and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Throat and <hi>Larynx;</hi> under it the Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>It ſhall therefore be Our preſent Task to Treat of theſe in their Order. And as from the Heart the great Artery, and from the Liver doth ariſe the great Vein, ſo from the Brain is produced a great Trunk extended through the whole Spine, which may either be called <hi>Spinal, Dorſal, Cervical</hi> or <hi>Lumbary</hi> Marrow. And hence the Neck, being as the Vicar of the Brain, or the <hi>Medulla,</hi> which is kept in the Spine, if this be cut or wounded in the middle, the Nerves are ſoon reſolved and diſtended, the ſenſes flagg, and the Senſifying Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity doth periſh: and hence we do ſee the Patient to avoid both Urine, Seed, and Excrement voluntarily.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:59608:132"/>
Theſe Wounds are to be treated with the ſame Care as thoſe of the Brain; for a deep and penetrating wound happening here, doth produce direful Symptomes, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hereby both loſs of Senſe and Motion. Now if the Neck be wounded in the fore-part, the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> and Gullet can onely be hurt; if in the fore-part above the <hi>Larynx,</hi> the Jugular Veins and Arteries; if in the back-part, the Spinal Marrow; and if none of theſe be hurt, no Wound here happening can be allowed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>And in all theſe caſes we are to ſtop firſt the Flux of Blood, then to bring the Wound to a good digeſtion with this, ℞. <hi>Terebinth. Lot.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>vel ejus loco Ol. ejuſd.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>IF a Wound doth happen in theſe Parts, as in the Throat or <hi>Larynx,</hi> theſe are the Signs; the upper part of the Neck, loſs of Voice and Air happens: But when it reacheth the Wind-pipe, it is more dangerous, both in reſpect of the exquiſite ſenſe wherewith theſe Parts are indued, the <hi>Aeſophagus</hi> hereupon tumifying, and ſo hindring Deglutition: Hence follows a decay of Nutriment, and danger of Suffocation; and alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Veins and Arteries herein lodged and inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their perpetual motions; for it's hereby that the Air is conducted into the Ventricle, the which being hindred in its inſpiration, doth ſoon occaſion an exſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence therefore may we account theſe Wounds dangerous, and yet not to be left unattempted without help, the Wind-pipe being the proper Inſtrument for Voice, outwardly being Cartilaginous, and inwardly Membranous and fleſhy. When this is wounded, it is generally known by the Senſes; oft-times the Wound is occult, and the rather becauſe here is no large Flux of blood follows theſe Wounds, but ſometimes Pain, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is perceived a ſtinking Breath, hoarſeneſs of Voice, a dryneſs of the <hi>Fauces,</hi> and in proceſs of time the Patient doth become Empyemated. When Wounds only reach the outward Parts, theſe may eaſily be cured; but when the Cartilages are divided, theſe are rarely cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, theſe Parts being both hard and exſanguial, and continually in motion, and accompanied with frequent Diſtillations, theſe being ſufficient impediments to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59608:133"/>
hinder Agglutination. Beſides which alſo, if any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour do accompany this Wound, it ſhuts the paſſage, and doth make a fair way for Suffocation, the <hi>Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> being hereby compreſſed. But to treat of every of theſe a part, beginning firſt with thoſe of the Throat. <note place="margin">Cure of Wounds of the Throat.</note>

               <p>If any one be ſtabbed with a ſharp-pointed Inſtrument, as by a Pen-Knife, Dagger, or the like, and the Wound hath not touched the Wind-pipe, you are here, if a large Flux of blood follow, to ſtop this by ſuch proper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, as I have already propoſed for performing the ſame. The next Dreſſing may you apply to the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part, a mixture of Myrrh and Aloes diſſolved in Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-wine, with which the Part wounded is to be dreſt; after this digeſt, incarne, and procure a Cicatrice, as you have Directions in the former Cures.</p>
               <p>As for the Cure of Wounds of the <hi>Larynx</hi> or Wind-pipe, <note place="margin">Cure of Wounds of the <hi>Larynx</hi> and Wind-pipe.</note>if the Wounds be made tranſverſly, let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bend himſelf forwards; if it be ſtraight, according to the length of the Pipe, here the Patient is to hold up his Head, hereby bringing the lips of the Wound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; then ſtitch up the Wound artificially; and for this Uſe, ſuch Pins as you uſe in the Cure of hair Lips are beſt here.

Inwardly here alſo may you order the Patient to drink warm Milk by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or ſome magiſterial chalybeated Decoction, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereto Comfrey, Centaury, Betony, or the like; <note place="margin">Eclegma.</note>or ſuch an <hi>Eclegma</hi> as this: ℞. <hi>Rad.

               <p>Wounds happening here are very perillous, becauſe both Meat and Drink do paſs through it, which do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Agglutination.</p>
               <p>Wounds here happening may be known by their Site, ſometimes by the Senſe of Feeling; for this is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a direct and ſtrait Line all along, under or beneath the Wind-pipe, and when this is wounded, either Blood or Matter is vomited, and the indigeſted Nutriment doth ſometimes paſs through the Wound. When the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lyes down, he feeleth much pain between his Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula's, but upon ſtraightning his Neck he feels ſome eaſe. When any Tumour doth ariſe here, it doth narrow the paſſage, and doth occaſion a Fever, and a great ſenſe of Inflammation. Hence therefore in theſe dangerous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Celſus</hi> adviſeth the Chirurgeon, to ſtudy and conſider which of theſe Wounds are curable, which hard to cure, and which are incurable; and not to undertake the laſt, but with honeſty to acquaint the Patient's Relations and Friends of the deſperateneſs of the Hurt, left he by his improvidence and inconſiderateneſs gain the diſcredit of being either ignorant or deceitful.</p>

               <p>NExt arrive we to Wounds of the Spine, or the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone ſeated in the back-part of the Neck; if the Wound do not paſs the Spine, it then doth divide the Muſcles, and in this caſe are you to dreſs this Wound as you do thoſe of the fleſhy parts, as <hi>Aquapendens</hi> orders, <hi>fol.</hi> 913. <hi>De Vuln.</hi> If the Bone be injured by the Wound, dreſs this as you do a Fracture in <hi>Cranio.</hi> If the <hi>Spinalis Medulla</hi> be wounded, it is either wholly or in part di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. <note place="margin">Preſage.</note>If it be wholly divided, it occaſions a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Body, cauſing here a deprivation both of Senſe and Motion: If it be but cut or divided in part, hence followes Convulſion, and oft-times death. In theſe caſes therefore are to be applyed ſuch Medicines as may eaſe Pain, ſtop or prevent Convulſion, and cure the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. Wounds here happening, are of no leſs danger than thoſe of the Brain; for the Spinal Marrow hath its Origination from thence, and has its Coats covered with the ſame Membranes as do cover the body of the Brain. It hath Nerves allowed it for yielding it much Senſe; and its Motion and Senſe it hath from the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals: And ſince Topicks can ſcarce reach it, and the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Symptomes which attend theſe Wounds, as Palſey, Convulſion, Deprivation of Senſe and Motion, and the like, theſe Wounds may be well reckoned dangerous.</p>

               <p>HAving already finiſhed the firſt Part of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which treats of the Upper Parts, let me in this bring in an Anatomical Diſcourſe of this middle Region of Life, and that with a more chearful ſpirit, by how much it is more noble and excellent than the former. For as Coſmographers do in a ſmall Map com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Circuits, Regions, Iſlands, Promontories, Fields and Valleys of the World, ſo may we in this our ſecond Diſcourſe, comprehend the Greatneſs, Structure, Site, Figure, and all exteriour and interiour Parts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and containing in this Region, the which Region doth come under the Name of <hi>Thorax;</hi> ſo called either <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is <hi>Salio,</hi> the Heart herein being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a leaping motion; or as the Stoicks affirm it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Quod mentem Divinam animi partem denotat.</hi> This deſcribeth the whole Trunk of the Body, and whatſoever is extended from the Jugulars to the Xy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoidal Cartilage and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> comes under the Name of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> It is circumſcribed in its upper parts with Clavicles, in its lower part with a <hi>Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> in its fore-part with a <hi>Sternon,</hi> in its back-part with the Vertebres of the Back, in its right and left ſide with 12 Ribs. Its Figure is beautiful and capacious, partly boney, partly fleſhy; boney, for the ſtrengthening of its moſt noble veſſel the Heart; fleſhy, for the more eaſie motion of its <hi>Diaſtole</hi> and <hi>Syſtole.</hi> It obtains a Cavity between the upper and lower middle Region, for the more equal diffuſion of its native heat into all the ſimple parts. It's framed of parts containing and contained;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59608:139"/>
the containing parts are ſome of them Proper, others Common: The Common are 5, <hi>Cuticula, Cutis, Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Carnoſa, Adeps,</hi> and <hi>Nervoſus Panniculus.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are brought under theſe 3 heads or diſtinctions, as ſome being ſoft and fleſhy, others boney and Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and the third Membranous. In this are locked up the vital Inſtruments and Wheels of Life, the rare Organs of Muſick, whereby the Voice is ſo diverſified, called by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Cittern, making here its Muſick. Here may we ſee the Heart diſplay and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate its vital ſpirits; how theſe do quicken and ſtrengthen the natural heat of the whole Body; how the Lungs as freſh Fans do cool its heat, and by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as Bellows blow it up again, if occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>But to fall upon its harms; before we enter upon the Diſcourſe whereof, be pleaſed to conſider what noble Parts it containeth in it, and enwraps. It's outwardly guarded with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Intercoſtal Muſcles, interwoven between the Ribs, and filling up the Diſtances between them; and theſe by ſome are reckoned to be in all 44, theſe alſo being of great uſe, being formed obliquely; for we generally ſee that they help Dilatation; for every thing retcheth which is obliquely made or obliquely drawn; theſe Muſcles, by the general opinion and conſent of all Anatomiſts, do ſerve for Conſtriction and Dilatation of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> Next may we meet here with a <hi>Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> which ſignifies to diſtinguiſh, this diſtinguiſhing the Inſtruments of Nouriſhment, from thoſe of Life and Reſpiration, or is as an overthwart partition. After this appears a <hi>Pleura,</hi> ſo called from the Ribs, which by the <hi>Greeks</hi> are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this being ſtretched under them all, excepting the 12th. This Membrane doth incloſe the whole Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and doth anſwer its Figure and Magnitude. This is all over dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, partly becauſe of the hardneſs of the Bones, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59608:139"/>
partly becauſe betwixt both the Membranes, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Veſſels might more ſafely paſs. Next this is <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaſtinum,</hi> ſo called from dividing the Cheſt in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. <hi>Columbus</hi> doth call it <hi>Interſepimentum,</hi> being as a Hedge dividing two Paſtures. This holds up the Heart, and ſerves as a ſecurity for the paſſage of the Veſſels. After this may we ſee the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> by the <hi>Latines</hi> called <hi>Capſula Cordis,</hi> enwrapping the Heart, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it its Pyramidal Figure, ariſing from its Baſis, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Coats which the <hi>Pleura</hi> doth afford the four Veſſels, which do iſſue out of the Heart. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Parts are double, as Veſſels and Bowels: The Bowels are two, the Heart and the Lungs: The Veſſels are the Branches of the great Vein, and the great Artery, born up into the hollow part of the Throat with a glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Body called <hi>Thymus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe I intend not to trouble you with theſe twice over, I ſhall as I diſcourſe of theſe Parts being wounded, give you a brief Deſciption of every of them as they fall in their Order.</p>
               <p>And firſt as touching Wounds which may happen in the outward part of the <hi>Thorax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wounds here happening are either allowed to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate or not penetrate the <hi>Thorax;</hi> and ſuch as do pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, may either be made with or without offence; and this offence may be manifold, as either wounding the Heart, Lungs, <hi>Pericardium, Diaphragma,</hi> great Artery, or aſcendent Vein.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signs.</note> To know a penetrating Wound may be by theſe Signs manifeſted: If the Wound penetrates far, the ſending in your Probe or ſearching Candle will give ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction hereof; or if it penetrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cotton or Wool be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the Wound, you ſhall ſee it give way to the Breath which comes out of the Wound. If the Patient doth ſhut his Mouth and keep in his Breath, the Wind will break through the Wound with a noiſe, ſo as a

                  <note place="margin">Preſage.</note> Wounds happening in the back-part of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> are moſt dangerous, becauſe in this Part are planted moſt Nerves and Tendons; and as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, Every Wound of the <hi>Thorax</hi> goes not without danger, in reſpect of the Matter which falls down into the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof.

                  <hi>Arcaus cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de Curand. Vuln. fol.</hi> 71. writes, That he hath ſeen many pretend the curing penetrating Wounds of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> the which they either ſcarce obtained, or elſe ſpeedily after procured the death of their Patients, although theſe Wounds were not of their own nature lethal. And whereas it is the general opinion of all Authors, Wounds deeply penetrating the Breſt, are for the moſt part incurable, and that ſuch who have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ground of theſe Wounds, do generally labour under a <hi>Phthyſis,</hi> or a perpetual Fiſtula; yet ſome have been cured hereof without either of theſe. And for curing theſe Wounds, let this be your Method: In not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Wounds, the ſame Cure is to be uſed here as you are directed in a ſimple Wound. In a penetrating Wound the ordering of the whole Body is to be regarded, both for the evacuating and diſcharging of Blood, Humours, Matter, or Excrements, which may fall from the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part into the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> leſt being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in left, they corrupt and putrifie, and ſo bring death in the end: And theſe may be 3 ways diſcharged; as either
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59608:140"/>
by the Orifice of the Wound, by the Mouth and Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by Urine. Now when Blood or Matter is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cervated in the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> it is attended with pains of the Sides, and a heavineſs about the falſe Ribs, accompanied with purulent Spattles, a fetid Breath, and a troubleſom Cough, and a Fever moleſting the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. And hence becauſe the outward Air being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unprepared, doth ruſh and paſs hither, it doth much offend the inward Parts, and the inward Air paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out hereby, doth both weaken, hurt and diſſolve the ſtrength and vigour of the Parts. And another ill Symptom which attends theſe Wounds, is, they cannot outwardly or conveniently be deterged, and hence they degenerate into Fiſtula's and Empyema's, exciting there their purulent Collections, and hence death follows. And ſuch who upon receiving a Wound here, have annexed therewith a Vomiting and Syncope, or Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, death is ſure to catch hold of theſe.</p>
               <p>But to return to the 3 former propoſed Intentions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning firſt with the diſcharge by Urine. And in theſe <note place="margin">The Firſt.</note>caſes the Medicines here to be uſed are called <hi>Diureticks:</hi> And <hi>Gal. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Loc. affect.</hi> writes and affirms, That thoſe things which are lodged in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> are to be carried off and expurged by Urine. And hence he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that the Matter is firſt carried into the Branches of the <hi>Vena Azygos,</hi> hence into the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> to the right Ventricle of the Heart, and paſſing thence down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the deſcending Trunk of the <hi>Cava</hi> to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to come to the Emulgents. But this is a great way about. But <hi>Nicol. Novocomenſis</hi> an excellent Phyſitian ſaith, That it paſſeth from the <hi>Vena ſine Pari</hi> near the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and is carried by a direct ducture through the Spine to the Emulgents, and doth give us this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, for the better crediting of the former:</p>

penetrating, becauſe in reſpect of the narrowneſs of the Orifice, no great part of the Probe did enter into the Wound; the fleſh alſo ſtopt the Cavity thereof, ſo as neither ſpirit or breathing might paſs through it; yet out of the ſupervening accidents the Wound was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured to be penetrant; for above the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> was felt a heavineſs, he ſpit blood, with Coughing, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Fever, Watchings, and ſometimes the Part appeared blewiſh about the Ribs, wherein was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Matter. And for this diſcharge, they conſulted to open the <hi>Thorax</hi> between the 6th and 7th Rib; the day before which this ſhould have been done, it happened, that the Patient let forth about an ounce and a half of bloody Matter, by which he was freed from all his pain, Fever, and other Symptoms; in which caſes were uſed theſe <hi>Diureticks.</hi> Theſe being preſent, was preſcribed him a Decoction made of Maiden-hair, Parſly-roots and Betony; and if no Fever was preſent, to the former was added Smallage and Fennel. In his Diet is to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That in theſe Wounds all Inflammation be abated, and for this was given him <hi>Ptyſan,</hi> with cold Seeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The 2d Way.</note> The 2d way is the diſcharge of this Matter by the Mouth; and for this Uſe <hi>Poſca</hi> being taken lukewarm, is good; Vinegar doth wonderfully diſcuſs and diſſolve the concrete Blood; and <hi>Galen</hi> ordereth to obtund its Acrimony, by adding much Water to it; in this caſe cooling Syrups do well, and do work by Urine. Here alſo are we adviſed to obſerve, That if the Patient do cough much, to make it more eaſie to him, we may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him Syrup of Lyquirice, Oxymel, or Syrup of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The 3d Way.</note> The 3d is performed by the Orifice of the Wound, the which ſome will have ſpeedily to be ſhut up, leſt hereby the vital ſpirit might expire and ſpend it ſelf, and the outward Air paſſing in at the Wound may corrupt the inward Parts. Yet this is contrary to Senſe, Reaſon
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59608:141"/>
and Experience; for the Wound is to be kept open, for this Matter is not eaſily or readily to be diſcharged by Urine, nor yet emptied out by the Mouth, the Orifice of the Wound being the beſt and moſt ready way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſame; and this is to be performed by Tents or Pipes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Intentions.</note> But to come cloſe to the genuine Intentions herein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and afterwards ſhew you how this is to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</p>
               <p>And herein are 6 Intentions which offer themſelves: As firſt, To ſtop the Flux of Blood. 2dly, To prevent all Fluxion. 3dly, To diſcharge the contained Matter. 4thly, To deterge and dry up the Wound. 5thly, To order the inward Parts aright. And then laſtly, To prevent all other Accidents.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, I have ſufficiently already enlarged. But becauſe here ſome of the concrete Blood may be lodged in the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> this is both neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and ſpeedily to be ſuppurated. And hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Wounds of the <hi>Thorax</hi> are preſently to be aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, or kept open, being conſentaneous in a Cut where the great Veins and Arteries are untoucht, and when no Flux of Blood doth appear here to ſpeed Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination, either by Suture or Ligature, or any other ingenious method; for thus the Parts may be united, and the innate Heat preſerved, and the Matter diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Mouth. But if there be any ſuſpition of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated or concreted Blood, the Wound is to be kept open, for the diſcharge of all Matter and Excrements: And for this Uſe ſome do make uſe of leaden Pipes, which they have made for the ſame purpoſe, to convey and draw forth this Matter, called by the <hi>Greeks Piuleus,</hi> or <hi>Eductorium;</hi> the Matter being diſcharged, the Parts are to be united and dried up.</p>
               <p>But a little further, as touching the coagulated Blood, it being a matter of great concern in this place: Here are
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59608:142"/>
we not to ſtudy too ſpeedy an unition of the Parts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til every ill Juyce or Matter be expurged and diſcharged. The Wound therefore, as I formerly have writ, is to be kept open by Tents, both for the preſerving the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ignoble Parts entire. Hence ought the careful Chirurgeon to examine well the affected Parts, and then to the diſcharge of the Matter; this is to be done by its proper places; the Blood being ſuppreſſed, the Wound is to be roul'd up.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The 2d Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The next Intention here required, is, in great and deep Wounds to hinder all Humidities or Humours, coming from any other Part of the Body to the affected Part; and this is to be performed by breathing a Vein, and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Cupping-glaſſes, Ligatures, and the like, as I have already ſhewn.</p>

If the fleſhy part of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> as we have already offered, be wounded, it may be cured with care; and here are we firſt to ſtop the Flux of blood, and to prevent Inflammation by well regulating the whole Body, and to agglutinate the Wound with all convenient ſpeed; yet not untill all Blood and Matter be diſcharged; hence breathing of a

               <head type="sub">Of the <hi>Lungs</hi> Wounded.</head>
               <p>THeſe being the Inſtruments both of Voice and Breathing, are by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Pneumones,</hi> upon reception of the Air, which they call <hi>Pneuma.</hi> And although theſe in moſt Creatures do hang looſe, that they may move more freely, yet by the mediation of the Veſſels of the Weazon, they are hung to the Neck, and tyed forwards to the Breſt-Bone, and backwards to the Spine. And Nature taking care to maintain this Motion, ſhe hath united them to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> that ſo by this connexion they might follow the Dilatation of the Cheſt, though it were perforated. They adhere to the Heart by the <hi>Pulmoniack</hi> Vein, or <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> and the <hi>Vena Arterioſa.</hi> Their Figure they gain according to the proportion of the Parts of the Cheſt, being both gibbous and ſwelling. They are divided by a <hi>Mediaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> into a right and left, that one Part being hurt, the other might work for both. Their Subſtance is looſe, ſpongey and rare, made as it were of frothy Blood. They have allowed them a Membrane bred out of the <hi>Pleura.</hi> They have 3 Veſſels deſeminated through them; it receives 2 from the Heart, and theſe according to the opinion of ſome, are to be moved according to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lungs, others according to the Heart. Their uſe is to aire the Heart in its dilatation, moderately cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tempering the heat of the Heart, for want of which the natural heat growes weak. Theſe being fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for fanning the Heart, upon being wounded they occaſion a difficulty of Breathing; the Blood which here comes forth is ſpumous or frothy. Sometimes there is perceived a noiſe or murmuration, the Neck of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59608:146"/>
Patient is convelled, the Face inflamed, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards grows white, and many Changes in a ſmall time act their Parts here. If the Lungs be inwardly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Tongue hath a change in its colour, they breathe ſhort, and cough frequently, the Wound ſmall, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording much Matter, they live a good while, but pine away into a Conſumption or Myaſme; for the inciſed Lungs do beget ill Tempers and Inflammations, the which having once obtained, they leave ſmall hopes of Agglutination; for upon expiration or inſpiration ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Air is received, by which the hurt Parts are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and at beſt, if Medicines might be allowed a fair reception into the Lungs, yet they muſt be moved by inſpiration and reſpiration, and lacerated by Coughs. And where the Veſſels are wounded which are lodged herein, or the Subſtance of the Lungs wounded, theſe are generally accounted lethal for ſeveral Reaſons, they being in continual motion, moiſt, and ſubject to Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, no Medicines eaſily reaching them, a large Flux of Blood attending theſe Wounds, and a great part of this Blood muſt neceſſarily fall into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> he which by its weight falling upon the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> doth cauſe ſhortneſs of Breath; and after all, the Heart muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhare with them in their miſchieſs, the Lungs having their Veſſels from thence; yet dangerous Wounds here, have been cured; as we ſhall afterward ſhew by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. But to proceed:</p>
               <p>Wounds of the Lungs are known by their proper Symptoms. Evacuations being premiſed, breathing of a Vein is here requiſite, and Cupping glaſſes and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for revulſion of Humours. As to the ſuperfluities of the Lungs, theſe are to be carried off by Purgation, good Diet, and Medicines. And as to Topicks, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either inwardly adminiſtred, or outwardly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ought to be of a drying quality, and of that ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative faculty, as may both act its own Part, and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59608:147"/>
yet not prove mordacious. And here may we obſerve, That all Metals or Medicines having a ſaline quality in them, are not to be uſed here, theſe being not to be ruled and governed according to the native heat of the Part; ſuch as are <hi>Verdegreaſe, Burnt Braſs, Lead, Cadmia, Ceruſs, Litharge, Chalcit.

               <p>I Shall here alſo continue my former Cuſtome, in giving you a ſhort Survey of this Membrane, and its Uſes, and then fall to its Wounds and Curative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. It is a Membrane enwrapping the Heart ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in it, and defending it from Injuries, ſo far diſtant from it as its pulſifying actions do require: It ariſeth at the baſis of the Heart, from the common diſruptions of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> outwardly covering the Veſſels of the Heart. <hi>Riolanus</hi> will have it a double Membrane; it outwardly adheres to the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> in the lower part to the Center of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> it hath ſmall Arteries given it for its nutrition, ſmall branches of Nerves it ſends forth to the Axillaries, and doth receive ſmall Nerves from the left recurrent, and the 6th pair paſſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart. It contains in it a liquor, the which doth keep the Heart moiſt, making its motion more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, and prohibiting its dryneſs. It hath been obſerved by Practitioners, That this part being wounded, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor hath paſſed out; but the Wound being Cicatrized, the Patients have been recovered, and this hath renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its growth again. This Pannicle thus covering the Heart, by ſome being called <hi>Capſula Cordis,</hi> being alone hurt is not very dangerous, being by <hi>Galen</hi> reckoned as an ignoble part; and hence he produceth a Story of <hi>Marulus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mimographus,</hi> who although his Heart did lye bare and uncovered, and the <hi>Pericardium</hi> corrupted, yet he recovered. This Membrane is ſo much ſofter than a Bone, as it is ſofter than the Lungs, and being as the Hearts <hi>Marſupium,</hi> it being wounded,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59608:149"/>
it loſeth its ſtore of <hi>Serum,</hi> whereby the Heart is kept moyſt; hence followes ſometimes <hi>Syncope,</hi> Fever, and <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> or Palpitation of the Heart. Wounds hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening here are to be dreſt as you do thoſe of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> and therefore I ſhall not inſiſt hereon, but give further ſatisfaction as touching ſome Hiſtorical Obſervations hereof.</p>

               <p>WE arrive now at the Prince of the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the great Maſter of life, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Arterial blood. And as the Soul of man is by it ſelf individual and ſimple, the which <hi>Hip.</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

It's a Bowel carries in it much dignity, for it is not to be long corrupted with injuries, neither does it ſpin out its grievous puniſhments of life, for being once hurt it brings preſent death.

In its Temper it is the hotteſt of the bowels. In its paſſive
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59608:150"/>
qualities more moiſt than the <hi>cutis.</hi> Its whole ſtructure is framed of Fleſh, Fat, Veins, Arteries and Nerves. Its Fleſh is interwoven with three kind of <hi>fibres,</hi> right <hi>fibres</hi> from its <hi>baſis</hi> to the end of its ſharp point; then oblique, which are obliquely produced according to its length, and laſtly tranſverſe for orbiculating the heart, paſſing through its ventricles. The heart draws blood by the help of the right in its <hi>Diaſtole</hi> through the <hi>Venacava</hi> into the right, and Air by the Venous Artery into the left <hi>Cavity.</hi> It enjoyes its attraction by the help of the <hi>Oblique,</hi> and by the tranſverſe it contracts and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, and hereby expulſion is here made. Its Vein is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Coronaria,</hi> encompaſſing the whole baſis of the heart like a Crown. It hath oft times two coronary Arteries alſo running through its whole Arteries. Its ſmall Nerves it hath from the ſixth Conjugation. I ſhall not enlarge any further upon its Anatomical diſcourſe, although I might here bring in its Ears, its Ventricles, Valves, and Diviſions, but ſhall rather deſire you to look into <hi>Laurentius Bauhine, Deemerbrooke</hi> and the like, who are full enough in every one of theſe. We come now to the ſubſtance and body of the Heart it ſelf as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our diſcourſe of Wounds, and here may we ſee, the heart being ſtruck, much black and thick blood to iſſue thence, eſpecially if its right ventricle or ſide be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and hereupon we ſhall ſee the face ſoon grow pale, cold ſweats attend the body, and a ſtrange ſmell accompany the whole man. Juſt under the right or left breaſt the wound is made, the pulſe doth much vary and act its changes, the extream parts grow cold, the mind troubled, and death follows. If the left ventricle of the heart be wounded, the blood is of a more roſie colour, more ſpirituous, ſpinning out. And in theſe direful caſes we generally meet with Syncopes, cold Sweats and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. The heart being ſo noble and generous a part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure a divorce in it without death, for it's the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59608:150"/>
of life, and elaboratory of the vital Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in continual motion, full of blood, and this oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times emptying it ſelf into the cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> there threatning ſuffocation, as I have already ſaid. If it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in any of the Ventricles, this wound muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be lethal, by reaſon of the great expence of blood which is made and loſt. Another ill affect here may be the Air, the which paſſing into the wound does ofttimes occaſion death. If the wound do happen in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the heart, and do not reach any of its Ventricles, the Patient may live for two or three days but not much longer. The prince of life being corrupted, doth ſoon diſtribute and ſhare of its hurts to all its ſubject parts, and theſe of neceſſity muſt contract by their Rivulets from the Fountain of its hurts and miſchiefs, it being as the Radix or Ocean both of Veins and Arteries, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes the beſt of all bowels, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to, and not receiving from any part, giving life and motion unto others, and diffuſing its proper virtues as it pleaſeth it ſelf, and expoſing its griefs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows to other parts according as it thinks fit. <hi>Hip. Aphor.</hi> 6. affirms that wounds of the heart are lethal, eſpecially if they be large, and penetrate its ventricles. Superficial wounds here happening may be cured. But theſe wounds whatſoever are ſo rarely cured, that you ſhall ſcarce read of any one man here being wounded to have recovered, but in the ſpace of two or three hours to have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his laſt breath. For as <hi>Fallopius</hi> writes, ſhould we either conſider the excellency of the heart, or its ſubſtance, death muſt neceſſarily follow, its ſubſtance being hard and not to be agglutinated. And if we regard its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Motion alſo and Temper, we may ſoon ſee it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed; and if to theſe we add the greatneſs of the wound, we may find it time loſt in expecting ever to gain cure here. And for the proving of this I ſhall produce ſome worthy Hiſtorical Obſervations. <hi>Galen lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.

And that eſpecially if the left Ventricle be wounded. Yet if the wound have only penetrated the ſubſtance of the heart, and not reached its Ventricles, theſe may live that day or the next, but ſeldom any longer, for inflammation hence ariſing it ſoon puts out the light of his life.</p>

               <p>WE come now to the general diſcourſe of the Veins and Arteries, where we may ſee how they vary by Anatomy. A Vein is by the Greeks called <note place="margin">What a Vein is, and how made.</note>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>abundare,</hi> becauſe a plenty of Blood doth abound in it. This is an Organick ſimilar part, membranous, long, thin, hollow, containing Blood in it, and carrying the ſame to the Heart. It's ſaid to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick in reſpect of its action or uſe, for conveying the Blood. It hath a membranous ſubſtance, moderately ſoft, the better for diſtenſion; it hath one proper coat, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texed with a threefold kind of Fibres, the which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly apparent in <hi>varices,</hi> the which when its tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and oblique Fibres have been rent, the coat of the Vein ſeems looſe, neither is it to be ever reſtored to its former natural ſtate. It's nouriſhed with the Blood which paſſeth through it, it's nouriſhed as are the Arteries. The Veins are inwardly furniſhed with valves for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the reception of the Blood, and making a free paſſage for its addreſs to the Heart, and hindering its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux from it. They take their material Origination from the ſeed, but whether they take their firſt Origination from the Liver by the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta,</hi> or from the Heart is yet much diſputable.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how made.</note> An Artery by the Greeks is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being generally in motion, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe it keeps air or ſpirit in it. It's an Organick, ſimilar, long, round, and hollow part, ordained for conveying the ſpirituous Blood. Organick in reſpect of its action or uſe, the Blood being herein contained, being much like the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59608:153"/>
diſtillation of Wine, the which being the oftner diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doth yield a more pure and ſubtile ſpirit. Thus the Blood, the oftener it is dilated in the Heart, its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous particles are the better diſſolved from its thick maſs, and are the better attenuated. The ſubſtance of an Artery is membranous, ſo framed for its better dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſtriction. It conſiſteth of a double proper coat outward and inward. The outward whereof is ſoft and thin; endowed with many right, few oblique Fibres: the inward is more hard and thick. And it is very neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo, eſpecially about the Heart which doth receive the warm Blood falling from the Heart. This coat hath in it many tranſverſe Fibres, few oblique and right, the better for conſtriction; for ſhould the Arteries not be made firm by theſe tranſverſe Fibres, by their great pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations they would be dilated, and ſo remain. For this <note place="margin">Cauſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuriſm.</note>is the cauſe of Aneuriſm: This coat being rent with its Fibres, the Blood doth ſoon make its entry and paſſage into the firſt ſoft coat, the which by reaſon of its ſoftneſs is ſoon extended, and hence doth ariſe a Tumour in the part. They are nouriſhed with ſpirituous Blood which doth paſs through them, in which becauſe there are in it many ſaline particles, a good part of which comes to the coats, it maketh their ſubſtance both more firm and thick.</p>
               <p>Having thus given you a brief Anatomical diſcourſe of theſe parts, we are next to look into their wounds, and here are we to enquire whether this Wound was given by a Sword, or Shaft, or occaſioned by a fall upon a ſharp Stone, or inwardly by ſome ſalt and corroding humour. All theſe are to be collected either from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, or by their proper ſigns. That there is a breach of ſome veſſel profuſion of blood is certificate enough, herein comprehending the place by the glaſs of Anatomy, conſidering the largeneſs of the wound, and impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Blood flowing. Now whether it flows from a Vein, or an Artery, may be collected from theſe ſigns.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59608:153"/>
As firſt, the Arterial Blood being both roſie and florid, alſo paſſeth out with leaping, ſpinning forth in its dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Secondly, this Blood is more thin and fluid than that of the Veins. And thirdly, as this is florid and roſie, ſo the venal blood is black and thick. Again, the Arterial Blood is more hot than the Venal, neither hath the Venal Blood ſuch Spirit allowed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Preſages.</note> Becauſe Blood is the treaſure of life, if this flux be not immediately ſtopt, it brings a diſſolution of the whole man. For in theſe great fluxes we generally ſee Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Syncope, Singultus</hi> and the like, as continual atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants hereupon. The cure of an Artery cut is much more difficult than that of a Vein, becauſe the Arterial Blood is more fluxile, and its body more hard and always in motion. An Artery cut overthwart, is ſooner heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than that which is inciſed longwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> As to the Cure, we are adviſed by <hi>Galen</hi> to cauſe a ſpeedy ſtop to this flux, and then to cure the wound. And this is to be done either by averſion or derivation, or making the matter more firm that it make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addreſs, by obſtructing the mouths of the Veſſels, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by joining the lips of the wound together, or by obturation of the Veſſels by compreſſing them together with the fingers, and keeping them ſo compreſſed until the blood do become grumous. I have already in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my diſcourſe ſhown eight ſeveral ways of ſtanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of blood, and this may be done either by a certain regulation of the whole body, or well ordering of the affected part. The Diet here ought to be thin, cold and of ſubſtance thickning, ſomewhat reſtringent, ſo as it may both cool and thicken the blood; and for this uſe Lentils, Rice, Jujubes, Quinces, Medlers, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, Prunes and the like are proper here. Let his drink be either cold water or chalybeated water or Poſca, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-water, of Julip of Roſes, Plantain-water, Spawn-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or the like. The part affected ought alſo to be cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59608:154"/>
and hence repercuſſives are proper whereby to repel the blood from the affected part. Hereupon both upon the part and its origination is to be aſſuſed Poſca, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, Juice of Nightſhade, Lettice, Plantain and the like. The flux is to be averted either by revulſion or deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for revulſion Phlebotomy is to be inſtituted, if the flux be large, and the ſpirits will allow it. For this uſe alſo Cupping-glaſſes either without or with ſcarrificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are proper engines here, as alſo Ligatures, Frictions, Unctions, Fomentations and the like, all which are to be applied to the contrary part. Now come we to the Veſſel it ſelf which is wounded, and here are we to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the lips of the Veſſels are to be ſhut up; and here if an Artery be diſſected, we firſt apply our thumb and finger upon the Veſſel for its compreſſion, after which the wound is to be waſhed with Poſca for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation of the concreted blood. The blood being cleanſed and the wound dried up, we are to ſprinkle ſome reſtrictive powders into it, over theſe to apply a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liniment upon the preſent removal of the finger, after the application of which, to apply the finger upon it again. And when you take off your dreſſings, you are to take them ſingly off, with a due obſervation of keeping your finger on untill you have wholly removed all your dreſſings. The wound being expleted, its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies is to be ſprinkled with reſtrictive powder, then covered over with a rowler, which was dipt in ſharp Wine and oyl of Roſes. And here are we to obſerve that we do make three or four ligations upon the wound, and ſo to mount your ligatures upwards towards the origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Veſſels, ſo as the blood may be retracted from the affected part. Then remove your ligature the third day, changing alſo your dreſſings, in which time you may ſafely proceed in this operation. The Chirurgeon ought to be well skilled in Anatomy, for Nature hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and mixed Nerves with Arteries as cold bodies that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59608:154"/>
by their heat they may be cheriſhed: for if in theſe caſes the Chirurgeon do not ſeparate the Nerve from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery by a ſmall hook, he will bind up both parts, and if the Nerve be compreſſed, it ſpeedily is deprived both of its ſenſe and motion, and hence doth follow a ſtupidity of the whole member. In theſe caſes therefore the Nerve is to be ſeparated from the Artery, and then the Artery to be bound up. And in our ligations we are to take care that they be not made too ſtrict. <hi>Fallopius fol.</hi> 211. writes of an infirm Mechanick who received a wound in his <hi>Vena Poplitis,</hi> in which wound it behoved the part to be rowled up without which he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have periſhed; the wound was rowled up although the Artery was cut, yet within the ſpace of a year after the man perceived a pulſe in the Artery of the <hi>Malleolus.</hi> For which reaſon he thinks in ſuch a proceſs of time that the Orifices of the Arteries do meet together again and conjugate; but this is not always approved of, neither doth uſe of ligatures always appear here proper. For in ſome caſes the Artery is to be tranſverſly inciſed: for this is the proper nature of the Veſſel upon ſuch an inciſion, to make towards its Original, and to ſhrowd it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Muſcles, and with eaſe join their Orifices with them. And <hi>Gal. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Meth.</hi> teacheth us this way of diſſection of an Artery, as firſt, to lift it up with a hook, then to ſeparate it from the Vein and Nerve, and then to divide it; the which being done, the Artery is to be tied up or twiſted by the hook, for hereby the Orifices of the Veſſels are compleatly obſtructed. But if the wound be ſo deep and do penetrate ſo far as that we cannot come at it, in theſe caſes Uſtion is moſt proper, for hereby the flux of blood is ſtopt by cringing the mouth of the Veſſel and at its ends procuring an Eſchar or cruſt; but this very ſeldom doth happen. And here I do adviſe with all imaginable caution that you take care of the Veſſel that it be kept from being burnt up, becauſe
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59608:155"/>
this action is both painful, cruel and difficult, and we proceeding here as it were hood-winkt; beſides all which if this cruſt or eſchar ſhould fall off, it would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the part to a new flux, the which is ſeldom conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beſt of medicines. In theſe deſperate caſes theſe things are to be obſerved, That you firſt make this with a red hot Iron, taking care that the concreted blood be not cauterized in the wound, but this firſt to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purged with Poſca. A ſecond caution is, That we make not too much aduſtion, but only ſo far as to cauſe a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugation of the veſſel, by the firſt or ſecond application of the actual Cautery. And ſometimes a potential as well as an actual Cautery may here properly be uſed, and for this ſome do preſcribe Soot as the beſt of medicines both for procuring an eſchar and alſo for ſuppreſſion of the blood. But this is not to be uſed in all places, as the face or eyes or the like, for it always doth leave its mark of black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We in theſe caſes do generally uſe <hi>Calcanthum,</hi> or calcined Vitriol. Some do uſe oyl of Vitriol or Sulphur, others for the ſame effect do preſcribe <hi>Troch. de Minio,</hi> but it is a miſchievous medicine in theſe caſes, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its exciting of pain, it doth alſo encreaſe the ſame. Having by theſe or the like medicines granted that the flux of blood is ſtopt, our next intention is the aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of the wound. And here becauſe there is an eſchar to be removed, emollient and digeſting medicines are here to be applied, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent. Dialth. Baſilicon,</hi> freſh butter, <hi>Axungia Porcina,</hi> or the like. Then is the wound if deep to be filled up with fleſh by Sarcoticks, and skinned by Epouloticks. And here by the way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Galens</hi> advice <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Method.</hi> we are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to wounded Arteries ſo much the more drying me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines than to Veins, by how much they are of drier bodies: wherefore a Vein wounded without loſs of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is to be cured as you do wounds of the fleſh. And <hi>Gal. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Meth. cap.</hi> 7. relates that Arteries may alſo
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59608:155"/>
be conſolidated, for he ſaith that he hath ſeen them ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated in Women and Children, and to be every way covered with fleſh, and that both in the Forehead, Ancles, and Arms; and brings in this Story of a young Chirurgeon not much skilled in his art, who was about by a Phyſicians order to breath a Vein in the Arm, but cut the Artery inſtead of the Vein; the blood which iſſued out was yellowiſh, thin, and full of ſpirit, coming out with leaping. He being called to this Patient with ſome other Phyſicians, a Plaiſter being made ready for the ſuppreſſion of the blood he joyned the Artery, and applied over it the Medicine, and bound a ſoft Spunge over all; unrowling of the dreſſings the fourth day the inciſed Artery was apparently ſeen to be conglutinated, after which were applied the ſame Medicines again, and ſo for ſome days to be continued, and within a ſmall while his Artery was perfectly cured.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds of the Abdomen.</head>
               <p>HAving in my former diſcourſes ſhown the upper and middle Regions, wherein we have diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled every of the parts, we come now to Natures work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, wherein we may ſee her nutritive Engines by which ſhe doth ſuſtain the whole family. This being as the Kitchin of the Body, guarded with an outward armour of Muſcles, then wrapt about with a fine ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Peritoneum, inwardly may we firſt view its fatty Kell framed with curled veins, and criſped fat, being as a warm rugg keeping warm the Stomach and Guts. Next theſe the admirable ſeries of Inteſtines, in whoſe midſt is planted the Meſentery ſtaying them in their proper places, and conveighing to them the meſeraick Veins, by which the aliment is convey'd unto the gate of the Liver. After this appears a Pancreas, the Liver, blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gall, Spleen, Ventricle, Bladder, Ureters, Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and the like. But of each of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p>We begin with wounds of the Abdomen, and here we may meet with two ſorts hereof, the one being ſimple and not penetrating, the other being more compound and penetrating. And before we concern our ſelves with the cure hereof, let us ſee the ſigns by which we may know theſe. And theſe again may be ſeen to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate with, or without the exciſion of any part, with or without hurt of the ſame. A penetrating wound we may find either by the probe or ſearching candle; for if a great way in, it's a ſign of a penetrating wound, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Signs of a penetrating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wound.</note>here alſo that the wound be made directly. For if the wound be made obliquely, you may put your Probe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59608:157"/>
or Candle a great way in between the Muſcles, and the wound notwithſtanding not penetrate. Again if you make any injection of Wine and do inject it into the wound well warmed, if the wound penetrateth, it will remain and lodge in the Cavity. If not, it will make its ſpeedy exit. If the Omentum or Inteſtines come out of the wound, theſe are evident teſtimonies of its pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. <note place="margin">Preſages.</note>As for ſuch wounds as do not penetrate they are void of danger unleſs they be very large; and that is worſe which is made in the middle part than in the ſides, for the middle part is more nervous, and more difficult to ſtitch up; beſides the guts do more eaſily paſs out here than at the ſides and ſo do hinder agglutination. And as <hi>Celſus</hi> faith, all penetrating wounds are accounted dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, becauſe they are moſt commonly large and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deep, becauſe the air which paſſeth into the wound does hurt the guts, and likewiſe alſo becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ofttimes does fall into the Capacity thereof. And he further noteth, that as he cannot eſcape who is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the body of the Brain, Stomach, in the Gate Vein of the Liver, or whoſe ſpinal marrow is ſmitten; ſo alſo may he not be ſaid to be cured, to whom the middle of the Lungs, Jejune, ſmall Guts, Kidneys or Bladder are wounded. In theſe wounds theſe Intentions are required. If any part comes out, to repoſe this, then to ſtitch up the wound, to apply agglutinative Medicines, and to remove all evil Symptoms. We ſhall treat of the parts by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And here by way of Caution as touching our future herein required, we are to conſider how much of the part we are to take up to ſtitch with the Needle, for if here we take up but a ſmall part, the thread will cut it through, if too great a part, we ſhall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain. Secondly, that we make convenient ſpaces between our ſtitches for a better exition of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And then that we conſider the depth of placing our Needles, and that our thread or Silk be of a good
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59608:157"/>
ſize. Here alſo are we to note that the ſtitches are not to be cut off the fourth day, but to remain on until the ninth or longer, for wounds here are not ſuddenly conſolidated. Over the ſtitches may be applied ſome of the agglutinative Medicines which I have already propoſed, being made of Turpentine, Frankincenſe, Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armenick, Dragons-blood, or the like. If to this wound inflammation be adjoined, the wound not being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, the inflammation is to be minded, the which does ſufficiently declare it ſelf by its colour, touch, and ſenſe of the affected part. And this is to be ſpeedily abated and all other ſymptoms, as pain, intemperiety, and the like. To conclude this.</p>

The bloody flux being ſtopt, and the concreet blood cleanſed, the wound was ſtitcht up with convenient ſpaces for the diſcharge of the matter. The matter being digeſted, the wound was healed, and he perfectly recovered, and was with me when I writ this.</p>

               <p>IF the caſe be, that the Inteſtines or Omentum do come out of the wound, theſe with all ſpeed are to be reſtored. But if they have been out long, and the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wound be ſmall, and by reaſon of the cold air theſe parts are filled with flatuoſity, ſo as that they cannot be reduced, you are in this caſe according to <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s advice firſt to make an incarnative fomentation to diſperſe this wind, and then to try the repoſition of the parts. The fomentation may be made of Camomile, Spick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Squinanth, Melilot, Dill, Pennyroyal, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Mints, Balm, Lavender, and all the carminative ſeeds and berries boyled in Wine, in which is to be dipt a ſpunge, and ſo to apply it warm to the affected part. <hi>Rhaſis</hi> for this purpoſe doth apply the Lungs of Animals hot hereto. The flations being thus diſſipated, the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines are to be reduced with your fingers. If the <hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> do come forth at the wound, and by reaſon of cold it hath got a ſtrange colour, and purchaſed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural hardneſs in it, ſo far as the part is corrupt, this is to be cut away: but if it carries its native colour, and no change do appear in it, this are we to repoſe into its proper place; and if the wound be ſo ſmall as we cannot get it in with our fingers, we are adviſed by a ſearching candle to repoſe it, this being dipt in ſome Trauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick decoction. Some there are who for this uſe do uſe a Golden wire, and hereby do cut away all the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part. The next intention after this is to ſtitch the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59608:158"/>
wound up by <hi>Gaſtroraphia.</hi> By <hi>Aquapendens</hi> there are ſet down 3 forts of theſe ſtitches: the firſt performed by thruſting the needle through the skin and the Muſcles, even to the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> not touching it; then from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in outwards the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is to be thruſt through and the Muſcles of the oppoſite ſide by the needle; then within the diſtance of an inch the needle is to be thruſt through the Muſcles of the ſame ſide, leaving the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum:</hi> and thus are you to proceed until you have ſtitcht up the wound. The ſecond is done by ſtitching the Muſcles together and the ſides of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> together. The third differeth not from the ſtitch which is uſed in other parts of the body. Theſe being done, the next Intention is to apply agglutinative emplaſters or powders, of which I have already directed ſufficiently; over which may be applied <hi>Empl. Diapalma, de Beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, Barbarum Stipticum,</hi> or the like. <hi>Galen</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the fourth ſcope is to prevent the hurting of any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts; and this may be occaſioned either by pain, or a collection of matter or blood in the cavity of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen. Gal.</hi> for the firſt, 6. <hi>Meth. cap.</hi> 4. adviſeth to embrocate all the parts from the Arm-pits to the Inguens with Olive-oyl warmed; or oyl of Camomile, Dialthaea or Roſes for this uſe is better. And as to the ſecond acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, matter and blood may well fall from the lips of the wound into the Abdomen, and may not only offend the Guts but alſo all the other contained parts, for hereby ſometimes a Tumour is cauſed, ſometimes a Dropſie gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. And theſe ſigns do certifie their being inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained; as firſt, the weight ſhews the ſame with pain and tenſion of the part; 2. if upon depreſſion of the belly you find the matter make its paſſage from one part to another: hence are we by <hi>Galen</hi> directed to order ſuch medicines as may rarifie the parts, both diſſipate and draw forth the matter.</p>

The <hi>Arabians</hi> do call it <hi>Zirbus,</hi> being as the mop of the belly ſweeping up its ſuperfluities. It is a large membrane, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated upon the bottom of the Stomach, and downwards over the Guts unto the Navel. It's faſtned to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Spleen, and Colon. Its form is like a purſe-net or Faulkners-bag, conſiſting of a double membrane knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the bottom. Its membranes are two lying one upon the top of another. It hath many Veins ariſing from the Port-vein. It hath its Arteries from the Celia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Meſenterical branches. The fat is very plentiful about theſe Veſſels. Its uſes are to keep the guts moiſt, and it warms and comforts the Stomach, and in time of Famine it ſupplies a kind of ſubſidiary nouriſhment to the natural heat. Having given you the abſtract of the Anatomy of the Kell, whereas I have already ſhown in ſome meaſure how it is to be dealt with if it comes out the <hi>Abdomen</hi> being wounded; here ſhall we brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew how to cure any part thereof which is either cut, or hanging a long while out of the wound, eaſily cauſing it to putrify and gangrenate. If any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the <hi>Omentum</hi> comes out, and by reaſon of cold or the air is too much cooled, which you may diſcern by its unnatural hardneſs, or if it be black or livid, then is this to be bound up near to the warm and ſound part, and the corrupt part muſt be cut away, letting the thread hang out of the wound until the corrupt part doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59608:160"/>
from the whole, then draw the thread wholly out of the wound. If the <hi>Omentum</hi> be nothing altered in its colour, let it be reſtored and reduced into its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, and be ordered as I have already directed in the foregoing Chapter. In theſe kind of wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fleſhy parts are generally hurt, digeſtives, mundificatives, incarnatives and cicatrizing medicines are required. All which I will ſhow you in this enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.

Chirurg.</hi> the which I ſhall ſet down here for thy better management if occaſion doth or may <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note>require. The Hiſtory is of a Nobleman who challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Scholar into the field to fight, the which being met, the Scholar wounded the Nobleman a little under the Navel the length of 6 fingers, out of which came forth part of the <hi>Omentum,</hi> with ſome of the Guts, yet unhurt. The Chirurgeon which was imployed neglects this wound of the <hi>Omentum,</hi> and doth repoſe the cold parts, and ſtitcheth up the wound, whence in the ſeventh day when the putrified matter could not obtain an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, a Fever did hereupon ariſe, with frequent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of the mind. <hi>Glandorps</hi> Father being conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſeeing the wound ſo ſtrictly ſtitcht up, preſently did cut them open, hence followed out at the wound a great plenty of matter; and having more diligently examined the wound, and cleanſed it with Wooll or Lint, he ſees the <hi>Omentum</hi> turning black, as you ſee in the beginning of a gangrene; the part of the <hi>Omentum</hi> was drawn forth, and tied in the upper part, and part thereof was taken off, which was the quantity of three tranſverſe fingers, and having preſcribed him a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of diet eſpecially in reſpect of his Fever which was <note place="margin">Clyſter.</note>very hot and afflicting, he had afterwards this Clyſter adminiſtred. ℞ <hi>fol. malv. alth. violar. an.

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds of the Guts.</head>
               <p>THE Inteſtines are called by the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Latine <hi>Inteſtina,</hi> being placed in the inmoſt part of the body; theſe are wrapt up into many folds, they are knit together by the benefit of the Meſentery, they are long bodies, hollow but not of a like bore; they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with the Stomach at the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> but their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is thinner than that of the Stomach, and they have almoſt innumerable Veins. The ſmall Guts are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber three, <hi>Duodenum, Jejunum, Ilion,</hi> the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have almoſt one capacity, yet they are eaſily diſtinguiſhed by their ſite, length, and by the Meſeraick Veins. The great or thick Guts are of the ſame number, called <hi>Caecum, Colon,</hi> and <hi>Rectum,</hi> all differing in ſite, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and Magnitude. You may find in all Authors of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy their true inſertion, ſite and length, we ſhall therefore paſs to the three coats, one of which is common to them all, having its origination from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> this is made as a guard for their defence. They have alſo two proper coats, partly as <hi>Galen</hi> ſheweth, that their expelling faculty might be ſtrong, and partly alſo for ſecurity. They have all kinds of fibres, the inward being oblique that they might retain, the middle tranſverſe more proper for expulſion, the right being in the ſmall Guts fewer than in the great. They have their Veſſels from the Port Vein, Arteries from the <hi>Coeliacal &amp; Meſenterical Branches,</hi> they have Nerves from the ſixth pair. The uſe of the ſmall Guts is as the proper conveighing inſtruments of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſtributing the ſame, and for this reaſon hath Nature drawn the Guts out to a length, ſo as ſhe may in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59608:161"/>
each of them lodge a little quantity, fit to be ſuckt up by the Meſeraicks. The uſe of the great Guts is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the excrements in them, with choler which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them from the bladder of gall having a paſſage which enters the <hi>Duodenum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come now to the diſcourſe of theſe being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and here are we well to conſider whether the ſmall or great Guts be thus wounded. If the ſmall be wounded, <note place="margin">Signs of the ſmall and great Guts being wounded.</note>the Chyle is ſeen to paſs through the Orifice, the Hipps do tumify and grow hard, or Choler is ſeen to come this way, eſpecially if the <hi>Duodenum</hi> or <hi>Jejunum</hi> be wounded, ſometimes meat and drink do paſs through the wound. There's little hopes of cure if the <hi>Jejunum</hi> be wounded, becauſe it is exanguial, and does receive a great Quantity of veſſels, its coats being very thin and nervous: beſides, the choler which deſcends from the bladder of gall on one ſide, and the pancreatick juice which paſſeth into theſe Guts on the other does much hinder Conſolidation. And although theſe reaſons are true, yet that theſe being wounded have been cured, Example and Hiſtory makes good; and therefore in theſe caſes by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> order we are not to leave the Patient in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery without help. Wounds of the great Guts are more fleſhy, and therefore may be allowed more readily and with leſs trouble and difficulty to be cured. If theſe be wounded, the excrement does paſs out by the wound; yet if a great and tranſverſe wound does happen here, it ofttimes does threaten death: but if the wound be ſmall and made directly, it may be cured, and yet muſt not be allowed void of danger, becauſe the external part of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is divided. If inflammation adjoins with this wound, and cauſeth a fever, and this encreaſeth, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt neceſſarily die.</p>
               <p>In curing of theſe wounds five Intentions are required. Firſt therefore the lips of the wound are to be brought
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59608:162"/>
                  <note place="margin">5 Intentions required as to the cure.</note> together; ſecondly the Gut is to be reduced into its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place; thirdly convenient Medicines are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; fourthly to prevent any excrements coming to the affected part; and laſtly the penetrating wound of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is to be cured.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 Intention.</note> The firſt intention is performed by future: but here may we note that there are ſeveral ways ſet down by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors about this future. Some of which do take an Elder pith, and through this they put the needle into the cavity of the Guts, and then they ſow the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and Inteſtine together; but this way in common ſenſe is out of the way: others there are who do take a dry Gut of another animal, and this being extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do put it about the wound; but this alſo is not to be followed, becauſe this dryed Gut will ſoon fall from the moiſt, and therefore neceſſarily it muſt be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Another ſort there are who apply to theſe wounds the wings and bodies of Ants, and with their fingers do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them in, but this way is alſo idle. The beſt and moſt ſafe way therefore is to ſow up theſe wounds as women do ſow cloath, or to ſtitch up the brims of the wound with the Glovers ſtitch.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Intention.</note> The quantity of the Gut which is to be taken up ſhould neither be too great nor too ſmall, but in a moderate quantity, for the inteſtines are extended in their proper motions, and therefore if a greater part be taken up than what is neceſſary, the Inteſtine is eaſily obſtructed, and its Cavity rendred too ſtrict, and hence come great pains, and the Gut is made ſubject to the <hi>Iliaca paſſio.</hi> The future being made, the remaining part of the thread is to be left hanging out of the wound; here adviſing before we begin any future, that we ought to apply ſome agglutinative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine into the inward part of the Inteſtine, and for this uſe the powder of Myrrh, Aloes and Frankincenſe is very
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59608:162"/>
good: but here we muſt note that theſe powders are to be applied before the ſuppreſſion of the blood; but if you in this caſe may fear the ſharpneſs of Aloes, you may add the powder of Comfry root, and then to take one part of Aloes, two of Frankincenſe, and one of Comfrey, and theſe to be ſprinkled both upon and into the wound. Some for this uſe do much commend the Juice of <hi>Pilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſella, Pentaphyl.</hi> and <hi>Tormentil.</hi> others do uſe the Juice of Elme, and do account this as an excellent Medicine. They do take the bladders out of the Tree which grow in the month of <hi>May,</hi> and out of thoſe they take a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour contained in them, and this they uſe as a moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Remedy. <hi>Fallopius</hi> writes that he ſaw an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirick who ſold this Oyl for agglutinations of wounds, and this being applied to the deepeſt ſtabs, within the ſpace of twenty four hours it cures infallibly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3 Intention.</note> Thus have we ſhown the firſt two Intentions, the third is to reduce the Gut into its proper place, and a future to be made in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> it being firſt Fomented with ſome warm reſtringent Wine, over which alſo may be applied of the former reſtringent powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4 Intention.</note> Fourthly, no excrements are to be ſuffered to paſs to the wounded part. Hence a reſpect is to be had to the order of diet, and well regulating of the whole body. In this caſe alſo may you preſcribe the Patient emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Clyſters with ſome of the aforeſaid Powders: inwardly by the Mouth may he take ſome vulnerary decoctions, ſuch as I have preſcribed in wounds of the <hi>Thorax.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. LXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Wounds of the Liver.</head>
               <p>WE come next to diſcourſe of the Liver, being in Latine called <hi>Jecur, quaſi Juxta Cor,</hi> being a large bowel ſeated in the right Hypochondry under the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> round and ſmooth in its convex part, and in its lower part concave. Its ſubſtance is ſoft and red, much reſembling concrete blood. <hi>Malpighius</hi> who by Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes hath moſt accurately viewed its ſubſtance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards parts, hath herein obſerved many things unknown to former ages. As firſt, the ſubſtance hereof in Man is contexed of Lobes, and theſe framed out of the Glandules, the which affording a heap of ſmall Ramifications, are inveſted with a proper circumſcribing membrane. And that the whole maſs of the Liver doth conſiſt of rough Glandules, and diverſe Ramifications of Veſſels, and hence is it, that they ſhould work together, Nature hath neceſſarily interceded a commerce between theſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and thoſe Glandules. Thirdly that the Veſſels of the Port, hollow, and biliary <hi>ductus,</hi> do run through all the branches into theſe little Lobes in an equal number, and that the branches of the Gate Vein do carry the power of the Arteries, and that there is ſuch a commerce and ſociety between the Gate-vein and biliary <hi>ductus,</hi> that both their ramifications are ſtrongly knit by one and the ſame knot. The ramifications of theſe Veſſels are not joined together by <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> but theſe rough Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules conſtitute the chief part of the Liver, and ſo they order ſome of theſe for conveying others for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving into the ſame. Hence may be conjectured that the Liver is a conglomerated glandule, ſtraining the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:59608:164"/>
And hence may we well contradict the opinion of the Antients, who did aſcribe to the Liver the principal faculty of ſanguification; for we evidently ſee that it is but as a colature for the <hi>Bilis.</hi> It's covered with a ſmall membrane adhering to its <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and from this do many ſmall watery bladders ariſe, from whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Dropſie hereof, as <hi>Platerus</hi> obſerveth. It's tied by three ligaments, to the <hi>Abdomen</hi> by the umbilical Vein; ſecondly to the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> upwards from the right part, by a large thin membranous ligament taken from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> called <hi>Suſpenſorium;</hi> the third upwards alſo to the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> It's made of a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymatous ſubſtance, much reſembling the ſubſtance of a Bullocks Liver; the uſes of which <hi>Parenchyma</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable, ſhowing it ſelf to be the principal part of the Liver, the other parts being but as ſubſervients to it, for the ligaments do ſtrengthen its ſite, a coat covers it, the Gate-vein brings it blood, the common Capſula adminiſtreth to it, the Artery and Hepatick Nerve do pay their ſervice partly to the Port-vein, partly to the common Capſula and biliary pore, the ſmall branches of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and Hepatick <hi>Ductus</hi> do take hence their blood, it ſeparates the <hi>Bilis</hi> from the blood, and is as a colature here ordained by Nature for performing this office. But not to dwell too long here, we paſs to its colour, and this is ſomewhat reddiſh, in ſickly people it is ſeen to look pale. The Veſſels in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are the roots of the two great Veins the <hi>Cava</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> The Veſſels in the Liver are accounted ſeven in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as the branches of the <hi>Porta,</hi> of the <hi>Cava,</hi> of the bladder of Gall, the Capſule of the great vein, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patick Artery, Hepatick Nerve, and Hepatick Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts. To which alſo may be added the Umbilical Veins. Having thus given you an account of the Liver, its paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, uſes, ſite, connexion, and Veſſels, we come now to its Wounds. And here they happen either ſuperficially, or penetrating even its Trunks.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds of the Ventricle.</head>
               <p>HAving drawn all the other parts out by Anatomy, we come next to the Ventricle which is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Natures Workhouſe, the Kitchin of the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are ſhown the Organs and Inſtruments that both maintain the family of the body, and its ſpirits. And ſeeing the life-tide of every creature is inconſtant, and doth quickly poſte away, Nature doth endeavour by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the continual expenſe of his threefold ſubſtance whereof he conſiſteth, to conclude the breach by reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nutriment. This Ventricle is an Organick part placed in the lower Venter, and is the Inſtrument of chylfication. It lies under the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> as it were hanging in the middle of the body; its left part is largeſt and more round towards the bottom, and is placed in the left Hypochondry, giving way to the Liver in its right. It hath two Orifices, and both in its upper part, the left of which is generally called the upper mouth of the Stomach. It hath allowed it circular Fibres that it may ſhut its Orifice. It's by this Orifice that we let down our meat and drink, it's placed in the Epigaſtrical Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Its right Orifice commonly called its lower part, doth much differ from the other, for it is narrow, and doth remain ſhut until an abſolute concoction be made of the meat. The Chyle paſſeth by this <hi>Pylorus</hi> or <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor.</hi> This <hi>Pylorus</hi> by <hi>Helmontius</hi> is held to be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of digeſtion. It hath three ſorts of Fibres allowed it, right, oblique and tranſverſe, and to theſe ſome grant theſe three operations, retention, attraction, and expulſion. It hath three ſorts of coats or membranes,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59608:167"/>
the firſt ariſing from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and is the thickeſt, the ſecond more fleſhy, the third nervous, into which the veſſels and coats of the Oeſophagus, Mouth, and Lips are terminated. And hence is it that we perceive when there is any choler in our Stomachs that we do find a bitterneſs in our mouths. Its ſubſtance is membranous and cold, its figure is round and ſomewhat long, much reſembling a Bagpipe, it's ſmaller in Women than in Men, its veſſels it hath many from the Spleen. <hi>Conringius, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> and others do defend that it taketh its Veins from the Gate-vein, its Arteries it hath from the <hi>Coeliaca.</hi> Its Nerves ariſe from the ſixth pair.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signs and Preſages.</note> Now as touching its wounds. When the Ventricle is wounded there generally doth happen a <hi>Singultus,</hi> and a vomiting of choler doth ſucceed, and whatever is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in of meat or drink at the mouth doth make its quick paſſage hither. Here follows no great flux of blood, for the Veins belonging hereto are but ſmall, ſave only in its bottom. It's ſuddenly ſtirred up with pains, and hence is ſpeedily inflamed, the motions of its Veins do languiſh, thin ſweats do ariſe, and hence the extream parts do grow cold, ſometimes both chyle and indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted victuals do paſs out of the wound, ſpitting of blood doth attend theſe, and cruel pains of the Heart doth ſeem to be herewith concerned, at length this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part doth grow hard, being deprived of its natural ſuſtenance. And the wound is made under the <hi>Sternon</hi> in the middle Region. This being cut, death ſoon follows. For it's the inſtrument of the firſt concoction, and doth receive and elaborate what is received into it, and what it findeth unneceſſary or uſeleſs it throws out by its <hi>Pylorus.</hi> Its outward part if only wounded may be cured having in it a fleſhy intertexture ſpun of tranſverſe Fibres, but its domeſtick or nervous part is either very rarely or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſolidated if wounded, being generally repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humours and liquors, and hence follow Fevers,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59608:168"/>
Vertigo, Syncope, Singultus, vomitings, and other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſymptoms, the which do poſt away to the Heart, and make it ſhare and communicate of its direful acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> When the Ventricle is wounded, we are to enquire into theſe its proper ſigns, and if poſſibly, to gain the true place of the wound; the which having once pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, we are to ſee how far it penetrates. In theſe wounds all fatty and oleaginous meats are to be ſhunned, and ſuch as are Euchymick and eaſie of digeſtion are to be here elected. Let the Patient eat and drink very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly. Outwardly may be applied a Decoction made of chalybeated water wherein have been boiled Comfrey roots, Sumach, Myrtills, Cicers, and Pimpinel. The common and general Intention of the inward parts is, that all ſuch things are here to be preſcribed which are moſt familiar to the nature and conſtitution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and ſuch as may moſt properly be allowed for his nouriſhment, ſuch as are Partridge, Pheaſant, Rabets, Blackbirds, Plover and the like. If the body be pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique breath a Vein. If cacochymick diſcharge the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humour with ſome convenient Cathartick. Theſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be given Clyſterwiſe than by the mouth. This he may take every morning by his mouth, as Syrup of Myrtills, of dried Roſes mixt with the decoction of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, Comfrey and Betony, to which may be added a little powder of the <hi>Troch. de Carabe</hi> or <hi>Spod.</hi> ℈j. in theſe caſes alſo <hi>Saccharum Roſatum</hi> is good And becauſe agglutination is the greateſt intention in theſe wounds, you may order your Patient to take every morning of <hi>Electuar. Diaſpermat.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. diſſolved in the decoction of Comfrey or Betony or Cinquefoil, and this to be taken every morning and at four in the afternoon. The wound if it be large is to be ſtitcht up, which is very rarely done, or firſt to be covered with Turpentine, anointing all its circumjacent parts with oyl of Roſes, Camomile,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59608:168"/>
Maſtick, and the like, and fill up with <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> and skin with <hi>Diapalma,</hi> leaving the reſt to Nature to perform. If the wound be ſo large that it cannot be ſtitcht up, then are we to dilate the wound of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enquire whether the Chyle doth paſs out of the wounded Ventricle, and falleth into the cavity of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> in this caſe the wound is not to be ſtitcht up, for the Chyle thus paſſing among the Guts doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them; and hence the wound is to be kept open, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing inwardly ſuch medicines for the Patient as have both an aſtringent and agglutinative quality. In theſe caſes <hi>Troch. de Spod. de Terr. Lemn. de Carab.</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpermat.</hi> as I have already ſhown are very good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59608:169"/>
which was performed by <hi>Florianus Matthiſius</hi> of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh.</hi> Thus the Knife which was for ſeven weeks and two days lodged in the upper part of the Ventricle, and had contracted a ſtrange colour, was taken out by him, the wound being made by inciſion, proper medicines being applied the Patient recovered, and by his Wiſdom, Induſtry and Art he was perfectly cured.</p>

The event here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being conjectured to be ill both by theſe Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſuch as were ſpectators, it was conſented that this wounded part of the Ventricle ſhould be brought outwards to the lips of the wound and that the wounded Stomach and the lips of the wounded <hi>Cutis</hi> ſhould be ſown together, although this operation was conjectured not to be void both of pain and danger; but the thing was done, ſo as the wound being conglutinated, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther danger enſued, but the wounded man was reſtored to his priſtine health.</p>

               <p>THE Spleen is an Organick bowel ſeated in the left Hypochondry, between the Ventricle and Ribs. In man this is generally one, and very rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this number. In its convex part it's tied to the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma</hi> ſuperficially, its Fibres do ariſe from the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum.</hi> Its blunt part adheres to the <hi>Omentum</hi> and its neighbouring parts. Its magnitude is various in men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their variety of conſtitution and bodies. <hi>Spigelius</hi> doth obſerve that thoſe that have large Veins have alſo a large Spleen. Its figure is long; its colour is ſublivid or of a leady colour. It's covered with a double membrane, the outward ariſing from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> the other is its proper coat, between either of which is inſerted a plenty of Lympheducts endowed with many valves. It hath innumerable thin and ſtrong Fibres fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of Filaments intertexed with admirable art. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe Lymphatick veſſels, it receiveth other veſſels as Veins, Nerves, Arteries. Its Arteries ariſing from the left branch of the <hi>Caeliaca,</hi> it ſends forth the ſplenetick branch out of its blunt part. Its Nerves it doth receive from the ſixth pair. Its office is to make a ſubacid matter out of the arterious blood. We come now to its being wounded, where we may by theſe ſigns collect its hurt. This part being well repleniſhed with Arteries, being of a ſpungy and looſe ſubſtance, framed and nouriſhed as it were by a thick, black and melancholick blood, when this part is wounded there follows inflammation; yet when it is lightly wounded, theſe wounds are of no great moment, for inward medicines may with eaſe reach this part.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59608:170"/>
theſe wounds are collected from their ſite alſo happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the left Hypochondry by the blood iſſuing thence. Theſe wounds are to be cured as you do cure wounds of the Liver, and therefore I ſhall not here trouble you with repetitions.</p>

Either Kidney hath allowed it two large ſanguiferous veſſels, an Artery, and an emulgent Vein. In the inward part of the Kidney is framed a <hi>Pelvis</hi> or <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> being a membranous cavity, it appears of a fibrous ſubſtance. The uſe or action is to ſeparate and diſcharge the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſeroſe humidity from the blood, which is brought thither by the emulgent Arteries, of which blood in its tranſition through the Kidneys glandules, venary fibres, and papillary caruncles, a good part of this ſerum is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and diſtilled into this <hi>Pelvis,</hi> and thence being carried into the ureters is ſent by them into the Bladder.

               <p>THE urinary Bladder is a membranous part of the lower belly, the which receiving the <hi>Serum</hi> from the Kidneys doth retain it in it for a while. It is ſeated in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> between two coats of the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> in the cavity which is efformed by the bones of the <hi>Os Sacrum, Coxendix</hi> and <hi>Pubis.</hi> It conſiſteth of a threefold membrane. It hath a longiſh and globous or pyramidal figure. It hath one cavity perviated with three Foramens, two at its neck, and one at the end of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reter entring it. It receiveth its Arteries from the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtrical Arteries paſſing into the ſides of its neck, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood to it for its nutriment. It admits Nerves from the ſixth pair, and the marrow of the <hi>Spina Dorſi.</hi> It's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into a neck and a bottom, its bottom lies upwards, its neck downwards, and is the lower and narrower part thereof. Its neck is conſtituted of many Fibres chiefly tranſverſe and orbicular encompaſſing the whole body of the bladder here conſtituting a Sphincter Muſcle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringing the neck of the bladder, ſo as the urine might not involuntarily fall out. Having given you this ſhort draught of the bladder by Anatomy, we are next to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into its wounds, where firſt we are to enquire of the ſigns hereof.</p>

If the body of the bladder be wounded, the urine doth fall into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and the pain will communicate it ſelf to the Teſticles and Inguens. The Stomach is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with affected, a vehement pain doth accompany the

               <p>WE come laſt of all to the parts appointed for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, being the Genital parts, where we are to ſtay a while and view theſe parts by Anatomy. And firſt to begin with the <hi>Teſtes</hi> or <hi>Teſticles</hi> being proper parts hanging out beyond the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and planted in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> they are called <hi>Teſtes</hi> becauſe they teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a mans <hi>virility.</hi> They are in number two, partly that the ſeed may proceed more happily; partly that one of theſe being taken away, it might be neceſſary for the other to perform the office of both. They are placed at the root of the <hi>Penis</hi> and hid up in a <hi>Scrotum.</hi> They much reſemble a Pidgeons Egg. They have a peculiar ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the like of which is not to be ſeen in the whole body, white and ſoft, being made of innumerable minute funicles of ſeminiferous veſſels. They are in a great errour who do account theſe glandules, for they neither have in them the temper, ſubſtance or uſe of glandules. They receiveſmall Arteries from the <hi>Spermaticks,</hi> and do ſend forth ſmall Veins to the <hi>Cava</hi> and left <hi>Emulgent.</hi> Its Nerves it receives from the ſixth pair. The ſanguiferous Veſſels do enter the ſubſtance of the <hi>Teſticles,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do end in the albugineous coat, is a doubt not yet reſolved. They are wrapt about with an albugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and vaginal coat. They have two Muſcles allowed them, called <hi>Cremaſteres</hi> or <hi>Suſpenſorii.</hi> Outwardly they are covered with a <hi>Scrotum</hi> as with a Purſe or Bag. To theſe alſo do belong, <hi>Vaſa deferentia, Veſiculae ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariae, Proſtatae,</hi> and the like, all which being at large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of by Anatomiſts I ſhall ſpeak no further hereof. Now come we to the <hi>Penis,</hi> where alſo are we to ſee
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59608:174"/>
how this <hi>virile</hi> member is framed and conſtituted. The Seed being made ready in the former Veſſels, does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a peculiar Inſtrument for its injection, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which Nature hath ordained that part which we call <hi>Penis.</hi> This being an <hi>Organick</hi> part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for injection of the <hi>Sperm in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terum,</hi> and alſo for excretion of the Urin. It's placed at the root of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> it hath a long and almoſt round figure, not being alike in all people. It conſiſts of a <hi>Cuticula, Cutis, Membrana Carnoſa,</hi> and a proper ſubſtance, wanting fat. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> or Urinary paſſage is placed in its lower part, which inwardly is inveſted with a thin and ſenſible, outwardly with a fibrous and caver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous membrane, continued all along its neck. It hath a good large paſſage, ſave only in its fore-part where the <hi>Glans</hi> is joyned to the nervous bodies. Its uſe is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey and conduct the ſeed through it, and alſo to let the Urin paſs through it, and hence Nature hath appointed two ſmall Cavities into it for the letting the ſeed into it. In the upper part of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> lie two ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous bodies, conſtituting the greateſt part of the <hi>Yard.</hi> At the end of the <hi>Penis</hi> is planted a <hi>glans,</hi> or by ſome called <hi>Caput Penis,</hi> in the which the two nervous bodies do end with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra:</hi> it hath a Turbinat Figure; its colour is ſomewhat ſublivid, but tumefying it is red. It obtains a proper ſubſtance, being fleſhy, ſoft, ſpungious and of a quick ſenſe inveſted witha thin <hi>Membrane.</hi> Outwardly it is covered with a <hi>Praeputium</hi> which is framed of a <hi>Cuticula</hi> and <hi>Cutis,</hi> in its lower part it is tied to the <hi>Glans</hi> by a <hi>Fraenum</hi> or bridle. It takes its Arteries from the <hi>Hypogaſtricis</hi> ſprinkled through its nervous bodies running through its length, it ſends forth Veins inwardly to the <hi>Hypogaſtricis,</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the <hi>Pudendis.</hi> It's moved by four Muſcles.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given you an Anatomical deſcription of theſe parts, we now proceed to them being wounded.

                  <note place="margin">Signs.</note> Where firſt we are to inquire into the ſigns. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe parts are endowed with an exquiſite ſenſe, great care is to be had as touching their Cure that they may not be vexed with pain or Inflammation, theſe parts being very plentifully ſtored with Veins and Arteries. For as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> writes, wounds happening in theſe parts are accompanied with great pain, and very ſubject are they to inflammation. The whole body therefore being well ordered, and a good diet preſcribed, and Phlebotomy directed, we are next to come to the wounded parts, where we are both to provide againſt pain and inflammation, for which uſes theſe are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medicines. Againſt pain may be ordered ſuch things as may mitigate it, and for this, <hi>R. Malv. Violar. Solan. an. M. j. Furfur. pug. ij. coquantur in Sapa,</hi> and apply it to the part. Oyl of <hi>Roſes, Chamomile</hi> or <hi>Dill</hi> will do the ſame, anointing the circumjacent parts therewith. And for Inflammation by <hi>Rondeletius</hi> we are adviſed to uſe Repellers and breath a Vein, and for this uſe alſo may be applied a <hi>Cataplaſm</hi> made of Bean Meal, Wine and Vineger boiled together to be applied warm and renewed until the pain remit. If it ceaſe not by theſe, you may add powder of <hi>Camomel</hi> flowers, <hi>Melilot</hi> flowers, Red <hi>Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> flowers, and make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Catapl.</hi> to the wounded part. Oyl of S. <hi>Johns wort</hi> mixt with <hi>Turpentine</hi> is a good Medicine. If the wound be large ſtitch it up, leaving an Orifice in its lower part for the diſcharge of the matter, anointing the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts with Oyl or Unguent of <hi>Roſes</hi> and Oyl of <hi>Maſtich.</hi> Then the wound is to be deterged with honey of <hi>Roſes,</hi> filled up with <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> and incarned with <hi>Diapompholigos</hi> and skinned with <hi>Diapalma.</hi>

And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wounded part, here are we firſt to ſtop the flux, then to bring the wound to a fair digeſtion by Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Baſilicon, the Yolks of Eggs, Saffron, and the like, then mundefie with honey of Roſes, Juice of Smallage, &amp;c.

               <p>THE Arm hath allowed it eight Muſcles, as <hi>Deltois ſupraſpinatus</hi> lifting it up, <hi>Latiſſimus</hi> or <hi>Ani ſcalptor, Rotundus major,</hi> theſe bringing it down; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoralis,</hi> this bringing it forward, thence called the Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Muſcle; <hi>Infra Spinatus, Subſcapularis,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundus,</hi> theſe drawing it backwards. Wounds happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bough of the Cubit are dangerous becauſe of the great Veins. Wounds of the Cubit are ſuſpicious alſo in reſpect of Convulſion and Inflammations. The German Chirurgeons are very ſcrupulous in medling with wounds of the <hi>Biceps,</hi> for that it hath but a ſlender beginning and ending, but a thick fleſhy belly: but of this more in wounds of the Elbow. As to the Cure here, if either the Veins, Nerves or Arteries be wounded, you have already methods ſhown how to cure theſe. If any of the Muſcles be wounded, to prevent pain and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſtop the flux of blood, keep the body ſoluble and other parts in good temper. If the wound happens according to the Fibres of the Muſcles, a good ligature goes a great way in the cure. If the wound be tranſverſe, you are to ſtitch this up, leaving a cavity in the bottom of the wound, into which you are to put a Tent armed with a digeſtive to cleanſe it inwardly. Outwardly may you apply ſome reſtringent powder and ſuch as may agglutinate, then perform the reſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions as I have already ſhown you.</p>

The German Chirurgeons do eſteem wounds of this Muſcle, which with <hi>Brachiaeus</hi> doth bend the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, to be lethal. Wounds happening in its beginning are moſt dangerous, theſe parts being Tendinous and ſo of an exquiſite ſenſe, being in its beginning double. If the middle body thereof be wounded it carries leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger becauſe it is fleſhy, yet hence may follow a flux of blood and great pain. The cure hereof therefore doth chiefly conſiſt in ſtopping this flux of blood, eaſing of pain, and in digeſting, mundefying, incarning and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trizing the wound, all which I have already ſhown how they are to be performed.</p>

               <p>COnſidering the admirable frame and ſtructure of the hand being as the Inſtrument of Inſtruments, and its proper action is apprehenſion, and this made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our will by its muſcles, we here ought to enquire into its Muſcles which are of two ſorts, ſome guiding the motion of the whole hand, others only moving the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. In the whole, the Muſcles which are allowed to belong to the whole hand are accounted forty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, four of the Wriſt, four of the <hi>Radius,</hi> three of the Palm of the hand, and twenty nine of the fingers. Of theſe there are nine inflecters, two bending the fore-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ſeven the thumb; the extenders being twenty, ſixteen extending the four fingers, in which number are included <hi>Lumbricales,</hi> and <hi>Interoſſaei,</hi> the other four do extend the thumb. Having given thus a brief diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Muſcles of the hand and its fingers, here we are to note, that if any of its Tendons or Ligaments be wounded, that you dreſs theſe in the ſame manner as I have already ſhown you to cure wounds of the Nerves and Tendons. If any of its Veins be cut ſtop the flux and cure it as you do wounds of the Veins and Arteries; and if only ſome of its Muſcles be wounded cure theſe wounds as I have directed you in wounds happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fleſhy parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> I ſhall conclude this with ſome remarkable Hiſtories. The Firſt is of <hi>Foreſt. fol.</hi> 176. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. where he writes of a young man who received a wound in the left hand tranſverſly made by a ſword by his Brother, which wound paſt through the hollow of his hand even to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59608:181"/>
his little finger. Inſomuch as that all the Nerves about that part and Tendons were tranſverſly inciſed. The wound was ſtitcht up in three places, putting tents between eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry future dipt in the white of an Egg and <hi>Bol. Armeny</hi> for the ſtopping the flux of blood. But this would not ſtop it, wherefore by the command of <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> who afterwards was called into conſultation, was Tinder or burnt rags mixt with the bole and the white of an Egg, after which the part being rowled up the flux was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Theſe Topicks were left on for near three days. The third day the reſtrictive was removed, then was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a digeſtive made of Turpentine, the yolk of an Egg and a little Saffron, with which the Tents and Doſills were armed, they firſt being dipt in <hi>Ol. Hyperic. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral.</hi> Theſe being thus dreſt the wounds were bound up, and all the circumjacent parts were anointed with oyl of Roſes for abating of pain and inflammation, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fourth day a heat about his hand, inſtead of this digeſtive the whole hand was anointed with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent. Populeon.</hi> The fourth day he was purged with <hi>Manna</hi> or <hi>Caſſia,</hi> the ſixth day he took a decoction of Senna and Rhubarb. The ſeventh day being paſt, when all ſymptoms as Fever, Convulſion, inflammation and the like were no further dreaded, he was not ordered ſuch a thin diet. The eleventh day becauſe the wound did appear very ſordid, and was not well purged, it was inwardly waſht with a decoction made of Roſemary flowers and Roſes boiled in Rheniſh-wine, the which being done the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid medicines were applied. The thirteenth day was applied to the wound <hi>

               <p>THE Thigh is moved by fourteen Muſcles: <hi>Pſoas Iliacus,</hi> theſe do bend it; <hi>Glutaeus major, Glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus minor, Glutaeus minimus,</hi> theſe ſaid to extend it; <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps</hi> taken for three, this doth adduce it; <hi>Quadrigemini</hi> taken for four; <hi>Obturatores</hi> theſe for two, abducing it. If the Articulation of the Hip be wounded, the Thigh bone muſt be kept in its Cavity, which may be done by laying the Patient on his back, and applying fit bolſters and rowlers. If the wound be large and made directly, here are you to ſtop the flux, and then digeſt your wound with Turpentine or the oyl of Eggs with a little Saffron. Mundifie it with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum ex Apio</hi> or <hi>Mel. Roſarum,</hi> fill up with <hi>Aureum</hi> or <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> and skin with <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma</hi> or <hi>Deſiccativum Rubrum.</hi> If the wound be made tranſverſely and large, here are you to ſtitch up the wound, leaving an Orifice at the bottom for the diſcharge of the matter; then apply agglutinative Medicines, and proceed in this cure as I have already directed you in Wounds made in the fleſh. If a wound happens here with a fracture, I ſhall here produce you an example of the like collected from <hi>Ambroſe Parey,</hi> how you are here to deal, and another from <hi>Glandorpe</hi> in his <hi>Spec. Chirurg. Obſ.</hi> 49.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> The firſt of <hi>Parey</hi> is of a Noble man <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>de vuln. Sclop.</hi> who kept his bed for ſeven Months by reaſon of a wound which he received three fingers above the Knee. With which he had theſe ſymptoms at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. As Intolerable pains, continual Fever, cold Sweats, Watchings, Excoriations of his <hi>Coccyx,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59608:183"/>
by his ſo long lying in his bed. He oft times fell down like an Epileptick man with vomiting and a continual Trembling, ſo as that he could not bring his hand to his mouth without help. His thigh was fractur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both lengthways and tranſverſely with many ſmall pieces of bones, of which ſome came forth, and others kept within, adhering to the Muſcles of the thigh and of the legg, which cauſed a very large cold pituitous and flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humour about the parts, that they ſeemed as it were extinguiſhed and robbed of their native heat. All which being conſidered there was but little hopes left of any cure. Yet confiding ſomewhat in the Patients age and ſtrength, he firſt made two inciſions to diſcharge the matters, which did irrigate into the ſubſtance of the Muſcles circumpoſed to the bone. Which thing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded happily, for hereby a great quantity of matter was diſcharged. Here was injected into theſe inciſions by a Syringe a good part of <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> mixt with Wine and a little <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> whereby the matter was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and amended, and the ſoft, looſe and ſpongey fleſh corrected, the Oedematous Tumour he reſolved, the pain abated, and the native heat which was oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the weight of the excrementitious humours was corroborated. He fomented the affected parts with this following Decoction made of <hi>Sage, Roſemary,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Fomentation.</note>
                  <hi>Tyme, Lavender, Chamomile flowers, Melilot flowers, red Roſe leaves,</hi> boiled in Wine and in a lye made of Oaken Aſhes, to which was added a little Salt and Vinegar. This fomentation having in it an attenuating and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haurient quality, it was uſed for a long while. After this was made frictions with warm cloathes ſuch as might cover the part in every place. For a ſhort friction doth draw more of humour into the part, than it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. Theſe being to be applied about the thigh, leg and foot, hot as they are taken from the fire and then dipt in Vinegar with a little of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> by which
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59608:183"/>
the humours were ſtirred up, and many wateriſh humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities were ſeen to run into ſweats. The Tumour aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the native heat ſeemed ſomewhat hereby to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. After which were applied Stuphes dipt in the aforeſaid lye, in the which was boiled <hi>Sage, Roſemary, Lavender, Salt, Aqua vitae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cloves,</hi> and the like. Then were the parts ſo artificially rowled up, that they did occaſion no pain, and that with good ſucceſs. That if one day were herein neglected, the Tumour did ariſe into a great Bulk. Thick doubled Linnen bowlſters were applied to the ſinuous Ulcers by which the matter which was inwardly lodged was expreſſed. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Tumour was applied this Cataplaſme. ℞ <hi>Far. Hord. Fab. Orob. an.</hi> ℥vj. <hi>Mel. commun. Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bint.</hi>

For fifteen days he took of a vulnerary potion, and beſides theſe particular frictions, the whole body was preſcribed to be bathed, by which the blood was drawn with its ſpirit to the parts. At length the Fever being abated, and the pains leſſened, he taking meat of good Juice for reſtoring of his loſt ſpirits, in a ſhort time he was made better, and by Gods goodneſs was reſtored to his former health, ſave only that he did not recover the perfect liberty of bending his Knee.

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds of the Legs and Feet.</head>
               <p>BEfore I come to treat of theſe, it will be neceſſary to bring in the parts of which they do conſiſt, which is beſt done by Anatomy. And here may we ſee the Leg framed with eleven Muſcles, thus called. The firſt of which is <hi>Seminervoſus,</hi> 2. <hi>Gracilis,</hi> 3. <hi>Innominatus,</hi> 4. <hi>Biceps,</hi> theſe ſaid to be made for its flection. 5. <hi>Rectus,</hi> 6. <hi>Vaſtus externus,</hi> 7. <hi>Vaſtus internus,</hi> 8. <hi>Crureus,</hi> theſe appointed for its extenſion. 9. <hi>Longus ſutorius,</hi> 10. <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litaeus,</hi> theſe adducing it, and the laſt <hi>Membranoſus</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it. The Muſcles of the Foot are 6. <hi>Tibiaeus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, Peronaeus</hi> theſe bending it, <hi>Gemell.</hi> or <hi>Gaſtroche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mii externi</hi> and <hi>Interni, Soleus,</hi> and <hi>Plantaris.</hi> The Toes have allowed them 14. Muſcles. As thus, 1. <hi>Magnus</hi> or <hi>Profundus,</hi> 2. <hi>Sublimis,</hi> theſe bending them, the 3. and 4. extending them, the 5, 6, 7, 8. called <hi>Lumbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cales</hi> adducing them, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Interoſſaei</hi> theſe abducing them. The great Toe hath four allowed it. Having given you this brief ſurvey of the parts of the Leg, Foot and Toes by Anatomy, we proceed now to its wounds, where we may by advice learn, that if the Knee be wounded, it muſt be kept extended, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe before the Patient be cured of his hurt, he may chance to meet with a contraction. When the joints of the Toes are wounded they are to be kept in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural poſture. Wounds happening upon the Knee or Leg are very perillous, theſe parts being accompanied with many Nerves, Tendons and Ligaments, and being plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by nature as the depending parts, they are the more ſubject for reception of defluxions of humours. Prevent
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59608:184"/>
in theſe caſes the impendent ſymptomes by revulſives, bloodletting, cupping, ligatures, and frictions, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Patient a thin diet, keeping his body ſoluble and the like. Here are you, as touching the affected part, to take the ſame directions as are preſcribed in wounds of the arm, making a repelling ligature to prevent any fluxion of humours. If any Nerve be here wounded theſe you may know by the pain and inflammation, or if any Tendon or Ligament be hurt, addreſs your ſelf to my diſcourſe of wounds happening in the Nerves, where you will meet with ſufficient directions and medicines, as may anſwer your expectation here. If a large flux of blood ſucceeds upon the wound, ſtop it alſo, as you are directed in wounds of the Veins. Keep your Patient in a good temper, and obſerve to follow the former dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions propoſed, and with Gods bleſſing queſtion not your way of proceeding. But to conclude theſe parts, take theſe following hiſtorical obſervations, the which may add to thy skill if the like accidents might happen to thee in thy practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> The firſt is of <hi>Gulielm. Placentin.

The Chirurgeon could not defend the place with all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but a ſtiffneſs ſeized the part, and a Fever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and within leſs than a month the Patient died hereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Another.</note> Another of the like examples <hi>Foreſtus</hi> brings in <hi>Obſ.</hi> 49. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 255. of one <hi>John Roan</hi> of <hi>Delph</hi> who had hurt his Leg againſt ſome hard matter, the which did contuſe it and tranſverſely wounded it; this not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much regarded, he applies a Womans advice for eight days. But when his Foot was affected with cold, the Leg began to grow ſtupid, and hence followed a great pain and Spaſm, the which accidents could no ways
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59608:185"/>
be removed; hence followed a Fever, no medicines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king place, although ſix Chirurgeons were in conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerned herein with a Phyſician. By this pain he became reſtleſs, the Fever encreaſing upon him. In his Foot and whole Leg did a gangrene ariſe, the which not being to be cured, and he being ſo weak that amputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not ſafely be made, died of this ſmall wound.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Wounds of the Joints.</head>
               <p>WE are now arrived at the laſt part of our diſcourſe, which doth treat of Wounds of the Joints, that part being ſo moſt properly called which is framed for the ſetting together of the bones for the performing of free motion. Now wounds made here, are made either by puncture or inciſion, and theſe do reach either the upper parts, or elſe do penetrate into the cavity thereof. All wounds here happening are dangerous, according to <hi>Galens</hi> ſaying, they being endowed with an exquiſite ſenſe by reaſon of the Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments wherewith they are covered, lined, and enwrapped. Hence therefore upon wounds here received do generally ariſe an afflux of humours, occaſioned here by pain. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inflammations, watchings, thirſt, convulſions, weakneſs, and ſometimes death. Such wounds as do
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59608:186"/>
penetrate the Joint, by <hi>Celſus</hi> opinion muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be allowed dangerous, for hereby the moiſture which kept between the joints is let out, the which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, an excrementitious humour doth fall thereinto, being a thin ichorous ſubſtance much reſembling that of <hi>Meliceris</hi> according to his opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> As touching its cure, if it be punctured, dreſs this wound as I have already ſhown in puncture of the Nerves. Keep the parts from cold and defend them from pain, for cold hardneth the skin, hindereth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, and doth extinguiſh the native heat as <hi>Hipp.</hi> writes. If the wound be made by inciſion, and this be large, ſtitch it up, hereby not touching any of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous or tendinous parts; leaving a ſmall orifice in the depending part thereof, for the better diſcharge of the matter. If the wound penetrates not the cavity of the juncture, dreſs this with <hi>Linimentum Arcaei,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereto a little fine powder of Frankincenſe, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons-blood, Myrrh and Aloes; and to an ounce of the former Liniment add a dram of the ſaid powders; above which may be applied an anodyne Empl. or Cataplaſm made of <hi>fl.

If the wound doth pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the Joint, you are by <hi>Aquapendens</hi>'s advice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a very drying medicine: theſe parts being naturally very dry, and therefore requiring drying medicines: they being alſo void of ſenſe and feeling, and a great plenty of matter falling herein, ought and do requeſt very drying medicines.

               <p>Thus have I ſailed through the bloody Ocean of Wounds, wherein I have like a faithful Pilot ſhown how the young Chirurgeon may ſteer his courſe in the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Main, and how he may keep both himſelf and the veſſel of his Art from the Rocks and Shelves of ignominy and ſlander. To which alſo have I added the variety of figures which ſhow both his uſeful inſtruments and poſtures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the diſcourſes with the authority of hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obſervations. And if any more ſtudious, and a greater lover of Art, and maſter of Learning ſhall be pleaſed to ſend forth a better light, I will ſoon call in mine; in the interim accept with kindneſs that which is here afforded, and be not diſſatisfied with my method which is good, and capable enough of teaching every young Artiſt, how to procure health to the wounded Patient, and to unite the parts which are disjoined.</p>
