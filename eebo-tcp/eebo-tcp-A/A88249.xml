            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>BEtwixt eight and nine a clock laſt night you ſent your ſervant to me, who deſired me in your name to come and ſpeak with you, which I accordingly did, and you told me to his effect, That you being out of Town in your abſence the Atturney Generall had ſent to you: to bring me up to him to the Temple in the morning by eight a clock, which you thought good to acquaint me with; and to know of me whether I would go or no, and you would go with me your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Vnto-which I anſwered to this effect, Alas, Sir, go with you? I muſt, for I know, if I refuſe, you can compell me by your Guards and therefore I muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>nolens, volens</hi> go, which I would not do, were I rationably able to reſiiſt you; but being I am not I ſhall go, but this I muſt tell you aforehand, that I know no ſuch man as Mr. Atturney Generall, neither when I come before him ſhall I ſo much as put off my hatt unto him, or give him any reverence or reſpect; but ſlight him, and contemne him with the greateſt ſcorne I can imagine. And withall I gave unto you a new book of mine not then publiſhed to the view of the world, though the cheefeſt part of it was pen'd many weeks agoe, which I read to Sir <hi>Arthur Haſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

VVhich book I entreated you ſeriouſly to read, becauſe there was ſomthing in it which did a little concerne you. And in the way as I came from you, I was muſing upon the frame of a <hi>Salva Libertate</hi> to ſend to you, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my <hi>quondam</hi> fellow priſoners. Sir <hi>Iohn Minard,</hi> Alderman <hi>Adams,</hi> Alderman <hi>Langham,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Bunch,</hi> their <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Libertate</hi> in the Caſe of the Houſe of Lords unjuſt dealing with them in ſummoning them up to their Barre, which they ſent to your late predeceſſour Col. <hi>Tichburne,</hi> whoſe ſaid <hi>Salva's</hi> are Recorded in Sit <hi>Iohn Maynards</hi> Caſe truly ſtated, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Laws ſubverſion. pag.</hi> 36. 37. and in the Aldermans printed and excilent Petition preſented to the Lords, 25. of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1649. But before I got up into my Chamber, I came back and told you, I had forgot to demand of you a ſight of the VVarrant by vertue of which you were to carry me up, and you told me, you had received none in writing, but only there was ſent unto you a verball command, unto which I anſwered, That was higher then the Kings own practiſes, and was ſo viſſibly imperious, and arbitrary, that I could not but ſcorne to be ſuch a ſcounderill as to ſtoop unto, or obey any ſuch command, although I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly hazarded my life in reſiſting of it, and therefore told you, if you would have me go upon them tearms, you ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me by the neck and heeles, for I would find no leggs to go; but if you would produce unto me a written warrant, which had ſome more face of legall Majeſtracy in it then verball commands, and according to my Right and Priviledge let me read it, I would go with you either by land or water as you pleaſed; becauſe I was in no capacity to reſiſt you, although I then told you I judged a paper warrant (although in words never ſo formall) coming from any pretended power or Authority in <hi>England</hi> now viſſible, to be altogether illegall, becauſe the intruding Generall <hi>Fairfax</hi> and his forces, had broak and annhilated all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and Legall Mageſtracy, of <hi>England</hi> yea the very Parliament it ſelf, and by his will and ſword (abſolute conqueror like) had moſt tyrannically erected and ſet up, and impoſed upon the free people of this Nation, a Juncto <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o Mock powerſitting at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> whom he and his aſſociates call a Parliament; who like ſo many Armed theeves, and robbers upon the high-way, aſſume a power by their own will moſt traterouſly to do what they like; yea, and to fill the land with their mock, or pretended Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtrates, amongſt the number of which is the pretended Atturnney Generall, in perfect oppoſition of whom, to the utmoſt of my might, power and ſtrength, I am reſolved by Gods gracious aſſiſtance, to ſpend my blood, and all that in the world is deare unto me, ſuppoſing him not really and ſubſtantially worth the name of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Free-man, that in ſome meaſure in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is not of my mind.</p>
            <p>But upon my fore-going Anſwer to you, you were pleaſed to tell me, upon a verball command you would not force me; but you would acquaint the Atturny Generall with my Anſwer which I intreated you to do, conceiving your practiſe therein abundantly every way more ſafe for your ſelf, then to execute verball commands, as is legally illuſtrarted in the 16. <hi>pag.</hi> of my forementioned book I gave unto your hands.</p>
            <p>And Sir, accidentally, ſeeing you betwixt 11. and 12. a clock to day, I deſired to know if you heard any more of the buſines, and you ſhewed me a pretended warrant the Copy of which thus, followeth.</p>
            <p>Theſe are to will and requite you to bring before me at my Chamber in the Inner Temple, this preſent day at 3. of the clock in the afternoone, the body of Col. <hi>Iohn Lilburne,</hi> to anſwer to all ſuch matters as ſhall be objected againſt him, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are not to faile. <hi>Given under my hand this 14. day of Sept.</hi> 1649.</p>
