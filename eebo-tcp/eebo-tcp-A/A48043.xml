            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU very well know, that the ſtrongeſt temptations which return'd me to my Native Country, were the hopes of ſeeing it intirely happy, the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> the Land of Promiſe. When the P. of <hi>O.</hi> Declar'd the deſign of his Expedition was to obſtruct the Evil Courſes of his Father-in-Law, I could never imagine he would have faln in with the ſame Meaſures, and as bad Miniſters himſelf. I expected a Theocracy, a Government levell'd to the Common Good, an utter Extirpation of Arbitrary Power, and an Extenſive Liberty of Conſeience, a Conſiſtency of one thing with another, and as much of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Idea as could be reduc'd to Practice. Little did I dream that the P. of <hi>O.</hi> could be infected with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and that he who had been bred up in a Commonwealth, could ſo ſoon aſpire to Tyranny. I did not believe that Monſieur <hi>Benting</hi> was to give Cloſet-Law to <hi>England,</hi> and that no Man ſhould get into Preferment, however worthy he is of it, unleſs he has firſt ſettled his Accompts with my Lord <hi>Portland:</hi> But ſince this is the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I don't doubt but we ſhall have more <hi>Shales</hi>'s every year to betray the King and our Country; and I begin to fear this man will grow as faſt a Grievance as the Old Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was to this Nation in the days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. I could not gueſs that <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>by, Nottingham, Godolphin,</hi> and ſuch like, were to manage all our Affairs, no more than I could ſuppoſe that Lieutenant-General <hi>Ludlow</hi> would have been Hunted down, for having once ſo greatly vindicated our Rights. Here, indeed, I am aſtoniſhed, that Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> Major <hi>Manly,</hi> &amp;c. (who were Out-laws) were fit to ſit with them in the Parliament-Houſe, and at the ſame time <hi>Ludlow</hi> fit to be Hanged. If Kings are puniſhable for Male-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that puniſhment is moſt Wiſe and moſt Honeſt, that makes things moſt ſafe: And it is an Act to be repented of, that we did not make our ſelves as ſecure at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> this time Twelvemonth as we did formerly. If a King is Impunible, we ought all to have ſubſcribed to Paſſive Obedience, but if he can be a Traytor to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, he ſhould dye as ſuch, and his Judges never upbraided for it; but when ſuch are employed as were the avowed <hi>Fautors</hi> of unlimited Power, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to the Miniſtry to Stigmatize, and cry out upon Republicans. But I am not only diſappointed in our Prince, for no man could have perſwaded me that my Lord <hi>Do—,</hi> and <hi>Del—,</hi> would have ſold Places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or could have been guilty of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, much leſs ſhould I have fear'd that <hi>Hampd—,</hi> and the leading Men of the Houſe of Commons, ſhould have ſold their Fellow-ſubjects for the greateſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement at Court. And leaſt of all did I apprehend that the Members would be ſo openly Pentionary, and run as errantly into the Diſtinction o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Court, and Country Party, as they did in that long Parliament of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: But we have now freſh reaſon to remember who was the greateſt Miniſter then. Thus far for Civils, but Religion is manag'd yet more oddly: The King has ſworn poſitively to maintain two Religions, has changed his own, and for the ſake of Epiſcopacy, has Exerciſed a Diſpenſing Power, and turn'd out the Whigg Faction in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Sacramental Teſt, is kept on foot to keep thoſe out of Office who are fitteſt to be in it; and a new Creed is made for the Quakers, that neither they, nor any body elſe underſtand. And to conclude, with what is yet moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we are crowded with Foreigners, to ſupport and maintain this certain Vaſſalage, and uncertain Religion. <hi>Torys</hi> muſt Govern the Corporations, and <hi>Mercenaries</hi> the Kingdoms, which I ſhall from henceforward give up for irretrieveably loſt, unleſs I ſee ſome Brave Patriot, have the Courage and Honeſty to Impeach <hi>Benting, &amp;c.</hi> that ſource of all our Miſeries, who is not only ill himſelf, gets all ill men into Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for what they can give him, but has the King too under an Incantation. I am ſick in Body, and perplexed in Mind, and am making what haſte I can to you; in the mean time, I give you all aſſurance that I am, without reſerve,</p>
