            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT taking notice of the great inequality of the Cuſtoms in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> on COALS tranſported beyond the Seas, by which His Majeſties Revenue (as to that Branch) is much impaired, the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation in a great meaſure diſcouraged, and that antient Corporation of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in danger of being ruin'd: He thought it his Duty, to let ſlip no opportunity whereby he might be inſtrumental to ſtop the current of ſo great Evils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54922:2"/>
And though the fatigue of a long troubleſom Journey from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> hither, might be a bar to his ſaid undertaking, yet he valu'd his Duty to the King and the Publick, above all, and came from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> now the third time upon the ſame Errand.</p>
            <p>The firſt time was in <hi>October,</hi> 1684. and in <hi>November</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, he preſented the Commiſſioners of His Majeſties Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, with a State of the Forreign Coal-Trade, herewith fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Letter—A</p>
            <p>Together with the enſuing Authentick Certificate from <hi>France,</hi> following the Letter—B</p>
            <p>Both which being debated before the ſaid Commiſſioners, were afterwards ſent up to the then Lords of the Treaſury, and made known to his late Majeſty of Bleſſed Memory, who, together with the ſaid Lords and Commiſſioners, ſeem'd inclinable to grant the Abatement ſet forth in the ſaid State, till one Mr. <hi>George Robinſon,</hi> one of the Sub-Farmers of the <hi>4s. per</hi> Chalder, under my Lord <hi>Townſend,</hi> obſtructed the ſame, by diſſwading his Partners from conſenting thereto, and for his ſo doing, he gave the Commiſſioners a Paper of groundleſs Reaſons, herewith follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Letter—C</p>
            <p>Which are fully refuted by the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi>'s Anſwer thereto, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Letter—D</p>
            <p>However, ſince the ſaid Sub-Farmers would not bear their ſhare of the Abatement, the ſaid Lords of the Treaſury and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners thought it not reaſonable the King ſhould bear the whole, and they reap half the Benefit: And thus the Buſineſs fell till <hi>February,</hi> 1685/6. That the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi> ſeeing thoſe Evils
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54922:2"/>
like to encreaſe, and having an opportunity by Propoſals made to him from <hi>France</hi> (upon encouragement) to improve that Branch of His Majeſties Revenue very conſiderably, he came the ſecond time to <hi>London,</hi> and preſented His preſent Majeſty with a ſecond State of that Affair, a Copy whereof is here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and follows the Letter—E</p>
            <p>And of which another Copy was likewiſe delivered to my Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> then Lord Treaſurer, and the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi> being call'd out of Town before any Reference could be had upon it, he left a Friend to ſollicit the matter; and though it was ſent to the Commiſſioners after he was gone, yet his Friend could get no other Anſwer to it, than a Copy of the ſaid <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Reaſons. This put him the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi> upon procuring ſtronger Proofs for what he aſſerted, and after the Expence of Time and Money, he at laſt got an Authentick Certificate from <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Copy whereof follows the Letter—F</p>
            <p>Which he hopes will be ſufficient to ſhew what Prejudice the ſaid <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s and Partners Obſtinacy has done the King, the Navigation, and the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> which I doubt ſo ſmall an Abatement will not now prevent, after the Trade is almoſt ſetled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it would do in the beginning, when there was not much of that: Inſomuch that raiſing the Cuſtom in <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſome equality with the Cuſtom in <hi>England,</hi> would prove more effectual; and this is conceived may be done by the King and Lords Commiſſioners of the Exchequer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as appears by the Preamble to the Scotch Book of Rates, whereof a Copy is alſo herewith fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Letter—G</p>
            <p>Eſpecially in a Matter that occaſions ſo National a Prejudice:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54922:3"/>
But till that be done, ſome Courſe is requiſite to be taken to prevent the aforeſaid apparent Evils.</p>
            <p>And as an addition to the Ruine of that ancient and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Corporation of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> there is one of its own Members (called <hi>Sunderland)</hi> that contributes thereto in a high degree, and that in the Cuſtom ſaved in the difference of meaſure, by which His Majeſty loſes 30 <hi>per cent.</hi> of His Cuſtoms, which the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi> is ready to make out, of his own certain knowledg, having loaded Ships there, and found that every 7 Chalders in <hi>Sunderland,</hi> made out 10 <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Chalders, and paid the Kings Cuſtom but for 7 Chalders, and as a further demonſtration, they ſell their <hi>Sunderland</hi> Chalder of Coals moſt commonly for 14 <hi>s.</hi> and 14 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Chalder, when <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> cannot ſell for above 8 or 9 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder, though as good or better Coals; ſo that the Meaſure is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to be the cauſe, by which a great ſhare of that little foreign Coal Trade in <hi>England</hi> (which otherwiſe would come to <hi>Newcaſtle)</hi> comes to that Port, which is like wiſe a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Navigation, by reaſon none but ſmall Veſſels come there, whereas in <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> Ships of any Burthen may fitted.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more burthenſom to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in reference to its Members, whereof no mention would be made, if the ſaid Members were not like to deſtroy the Head, and that is the 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Chalder, which comes to a conſiderable yearly Sum, which is not in the leaſt grudged, provided the ſaid Members paid the like, and not have 30 <hi>per cent.</hi> abated in the Cuſtom more than the head.</p>

            <head>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE <hi>Forreign Coal-Trade,</hi> Humbly offerred to the conſideration of His Majeſties Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, BY <hi>WILLIAM CREAGH,</hi> Of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> Merchant.</head>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>William Creagh</hi> ſaith, That a Company of <hi>French</hi> Merchants of the City of <hi>Rouen</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France,</hi> about Three Months ago, writ him, that they made a Contract with the <hi>French</hi> Farmers, to import great Quantities of Coals into the River of <hi>Rouen</hi> by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipping, and thereupon gave the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi> orders to Freight (with all poſſible ſpeed) as many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships as could take in 800 Chalders of Coals, declaring, that the next Spring and Summer they would import as many Coals to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54922:4"/>
the ſaid River of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and continue yearly ſo to do, as would ſupply the whole Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> whereupon, and in purſuance of the ſaid Order, the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi> freighted Nine Ships of conſiderable Burthen, and loaded them off; but before he could compleat Shipping the ſaid Number of 800 Chalders of Coals, he receives a Letter from the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, acquainting him, that the Truce being then as good as ratified betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> their <hi>French</hi> Ships which formerly uſed to come for Coals to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> were then all going for <hi>Scotland,</hi> by reaſon of the great Diſcouragement they met with at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> by the high Duties and Tonage there, which on <hi>French</hi> Ships is 30 <hi>s.</hi> ſterling <hi>per</hi> Chalder, on <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships <hi>20s. per</hi> Chalder, and on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships <hi>8s. per</hi> Chalder, that they could do no good thereby; whereas in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> no foreign Ship pays more than 10 <hi>s. Scotch</hi> Money (which is but <hi>10d.</hi> ſterling) for their great <hi>Scotch</hi> Chalders that makes about Five <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Chalders; ſo that by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, they pay but at the rate of <hi>2d.</hi> ſterling <hi>per</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Meaſure: And beſides a Ship of 200 Tons may clear there for 40 or 50 Tons; ſo that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon Coals duly conſidered as it is now collected, is next to nothing.</p>
            <p>This encouragement in <hi>Scotland</hi> being ſo great, moſt of the <hi>French</hi> Ships went thither, and ſome of them being lately returned to the ſaid River of <hi>Rouen,</hi> they brought with them a new ſort of <hi>Scotch</hi> Coal, which gave as good a Price in <hi>Rouen</hi> Market as <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Coals, though heretofore, <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> Coals uſed to give 10 <hi>French</hi> Crowns in every 100 Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Coals <hi>Rouen</hi> Meaſure (which is computed to be about 6 <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Chalders) more than the <hi>Scotch</hi> Coals: But now the one giving as good a Price as the other, if ſome ſpeedy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54922:5"/>
care be not taken, His Majeſties Revenue in the ſaid Port of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> will be mightily impaired, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a great meaſure diſcourag'd: All which is moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly referred to the conſideration of the ſaid Commiſſioners, that they may find out ſome ſpeedy Remedy to prevent all the foregoing Evils. And that the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi> may not be wanting with his weak endeavours, he humbly conceives, that ballancing the <hi>Scotch</hi> Coal-Trade with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would do the work; that is to ſay, to raiſe the Duty of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Coals in ſome meaſure equal to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But ſince that muſt be (if at all) a work of much time, and likely to meet with great oppoſition, he the ſaid <hi>Creagh</hi> thinks that an Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 5 Chalders in every Score, or an allowance of 25 <hi>per cent.</hi> (joynt with the difficulty of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Navigation) may in the mean time keep the ſaid <hi>French</hi> Project (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will fall off) on foot, to the encreaſe of His Majeſties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue by the ſaid Over-Sea Coal-Trade, in the ſaid Port of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and Members thereof, and great encouragement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigation.

            <head>Mr. <hi>GEORGE ROBINSON</hi>'s Anſwer To the foregoing <hi>Preſent State.</hi>
            </head>
            <head>The Commiſſioners of His Majeſties Cuſtoms may pleaſe to take notice,</head>
            <p>THAT Whereas it hath been ſuggeſted a ſort of Coal was lately found in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (not much inferiour to the Coal of <hi>England)</hi> and from thence Exported to <hi>France</hi> in <hi>French</hi> Veſſels, paying little or no Cuſtom for the ſame, and whereas it was alſo alledged by Letters from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. That the Forein Markets were of late years extraordinarily ſupplyed with Coals from <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Strangers Ships, to the great prejudiee of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigation and damage to His Majeſties Cuſtoms here, upon which allegations ſome of the Traders (His Majeſties Subjects) of <hi>England,</hi> in that Commodity, humbly deſired (by proper applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) a ſeaſonable remedy for ſuch an Evil, either by an equality of Duty to be paid by Strangers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or by ſome encouragement or favour to rhe <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Duty here: which ſuggeſtions and ſeeming good reaſons, made not only deep impreſſions, but great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to endeavour a preſent Abatement of the Cuſtom on Coals Exported from <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipping, for a ſhort temporary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, till the Duty in <hi>Scotland</hi> could be raiſed higher, if the King ſhould ſo pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54922:8"/>
Now having ſince farther well examined the Premiſes, there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing more certain therein than,</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>That the Cuſtom in <hi>Scotland</hi> is indeed next to nothing, and the defect (ſuch as it is) there.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>That there are no better Coals in <hi>Scotland</hi> now, than in former and later years, in which the Duties in both Kingdoms have been as now they are; and yet the Exportation from <hi>England</hi> far greater than that of the laſt year, from whence it ſeemeth evident that the greater or leſſer Annual Exportation of this Commodity, hath not been occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by any extraordinary Coal found in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or the difference of the Cuſtom, but Peace, War, Plague, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> doth influence the ſame. And ſome years the Forein Markets (as well as <hi>London</hi> Markets) are over ſtocked with this Commodity, the Cuſtom of <hi>Anno</hi> 1679. was better than 1678. about 5000 <hi>l.</hi> the year following was worſe than that by about 2000 <hi>l.</hi> 1681. was near as good as 1679. 1682. was ſomewhat better than 1680. 1683. was about 1500 <hi>l.</hi> better than 1682. and <hi>Anno</hi> 1684. is not ſo bad as 1678. by near 2000 <hi>l.</hi> neither were the years before 1678. (though not altogether ſo good as ſince) leſs ſubject to variation, and yet the Coals of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Duties of both Kingdoms, the ſame as now, for any thing yet proved to the contrary.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>III.</head>
               <p>That the advices from <hi>Holland</hi> of the encreaſe of this <hi>Scotch</hi> Trade now want Confirmation, and the abatement from 8 to 6 <hi>s. per</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is chiefly projected by the Factors, or Traders of <hi>France,</hi> and that for accompt of the groſs Farmers of the Cuſtoms of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who (as Strangers) ought by the Book of Rates here to pay 14 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder for Coals Exported in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipping; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of 2 <hi>s.</hi> this project will abate them 8 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder.</p>

               <p>That by that ſenſible Letter to Sir <hi>John Buckworth</hi> of the ½ 2/2 Inſtant from <hi>Rouen,</hi> touching this matter, it ſeemeth apparent, That if the <hi>French</hi> could be without our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coal, or the <hi>Scotch</hi> Coal were ſo good as is alledged, and could be brought from <hi>Scotland</hi> in <hi>French</hi> Ships within 2 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder as cheap as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coal, the <hi>French</hi> would not be ſo kind to our Navigation as to employ them in this Trade to the neglect of their own Shipping: or on the other hand in the ſame Letter, it would rationally be propoſed, that if <hi>French</hi> Ships may be permitted to fetch out Coal at <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtom, they will be willing to pay the <hi>French</hi> Tonnage of 5 <hi>s.</hi> which will amount to 18 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder; a <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Chalder being more than two Ton: Now if the Market at <hi>Rouen</hi> will afford to pay that 18 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder, and produce good profit to the Merchant, as the ſaid Letter ſets forth, it ſeemeth not neceſſary to abate the Cuſtom, and to let them have a Commodity from us, which they cannot be without (for the reaſons aforeſaid) at 6 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="part">

               <p>If it be ſaid in favour of all Forein Markets as well as <hi>France,</hi> that the cheapneſs of a Commodity ſuppoſeth an encreaſe of Conſumption: it will alſo be remembred that the ſuppoſition will utterly fail in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities not ſubject to Luxury. If Salt were at a penny a Buſhel, it would not (for its cheapneſs) augment the Conſumption. And if all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtom on Coals were taken off, it would not amount to above 1 <hi>d.</hi> ½ a Buſhel, in the price of Coals cannot make 6 <hi>d.</hi> difference in 5 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Manufacture, and the dearer we ſell a Commodity abroad which the Stranger cannot be without as aforeſaid, the more we bring back to inrich our own Nation.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="part">
               <head>VI.</head>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigation, the ſame will appear to be very little advantaged by the deſired abatement to 6 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder, when it ſhall be computed that the whole Forein Coal-Trade is not ⅕ part of the Annual quantity brought only into <hi>London,</hi> of which the bare Duties, firſt and laſt, amount to 6 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Chalder, and if the ſaid abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and Decreaſe of ſeveral years Product, after the Rule of falſe Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is no way pertinent, but rather a blind to hinder Men from diſcerning the true State of the Caſe, which is this,</p>

                  <p>His Majeſties Revenue is diminiſhed notwithſtanding that later years have produced more than formers; this may ſeem paradoxical, but it ſhall be made out: for what His Majeſty might have by good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and loſt by bad, is a leſſening of His Revenue, good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might hinder ſo many Fleets to paſs by for <hi>Scotland</hi> to fetch a Commodity which they might take up half way, and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably encreaſe His Majeſties Revenue: therefore the want of that good management has diminiſhed it.</p>

were not ſet on foot, which required a ſpeedy ſupply, and which of neceſſity (in the beginning) muſt Employ ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships to fetch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coals, the ſaid Ships being of greater Burthen, and the ſaid Coals nearer hand: but it is to be noted that at the ſame time their own Ships go for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that when they have once a Stock by them to keep the Men at Work, then will they ſupply themſelves from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſo as <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> ſhall hardly ſee any more of them, or receive any further Orders to ſend them any more Coals in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships: as to the <hi>French</hi> Ships, being willing to pay 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder Tonage, provided they may pay no more than 8 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtom, which would make in all 18 <hi>s. per</hi> Chalder.

                  <p>How abſurd it is to ſay that the Stranger cannot be without our Commodity, when at the ſame time he may have it as good, and a great deal cheaper from another place, is obvious to the meaneſt capacity.</p>

                  <p>As to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigation his Argument bears as little weight as the former; for if there be no encouragement to Trade, there will be as little to Build Ships, and if that encouragement fails, Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a ſmall proceſs of time muſt fall in Courſe, which already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that antient Nurſery of Navigation <hi>(Newcaſtle)</hi> where of ten Ships that uſed to be Built, there is hardly one now, there appeared no leſs decreaſe in the buying of Forein Bottoms, even before the Act of Parliament: ſo that this and the fall of Freights, is a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54922:11"/>
and though it is very true that it is the <hi>London</hi> Market that moſtly governs our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coal-Trade, yet when that is at an ebb, it is no policy to knock down all other helps for Company: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s witty home Charity is not ſo meritorious, when the Parent ſtarves himſelf and his Children, by ſhutting out the Stranger that brings them Bread.</p>

                  <p>As to Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s Conception of the abatement deſired, to be for the benefit of the Coal-Owner: it will be made appear to be a very falſe Conception, and ſo incapable of bringing forth any thing that is good, that it will prove Abortive; for in the firſt place he himſelf owns that the Coal-Trade is governed by <hi>London,</hi> if ſo, it muſt be the <hi>London</hi> Market that cauſes a Riſe or Fall in the Price of Coals: therefore the Forein Trade being ſo inconſiderable as he makes it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the cauſe. It may be conſidered likewiſe, that none that comes to Buy will give more than the Current Price, which is publickly known, but very often may Buy under the Current Price from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous Men, who will underſel rather than want mony, though contrary to the Orders of the Hoſtmen Company, whereof they are Members, and which by their Freedom Oath they are bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Company may enjoy an equal benefit of the Trade. And further that the ſaid Sir <hi>William Creagh,</hi> who deals moſt in the ſaid Forein Coal-Trade may clear himſelf of this falſe ſuggeſtion; he declares that he is not, nor ever was Owner of any Coals that went over Sea, otherwiſe than by paying others his ready mony for them after they were Shipped off and ſent away; ſo there is no room left to think him guilty of ſo foul a practice: if any of Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s Acquaintance be, it were fit he were made to diſcover them. And if it ſhould be thought ſtrange why the ſaid <hi>Robinſon</hi> ſhould thus oppoſe a buſineſs wherein he and his Partners would gain as much as the King, it were not amiſs to know his reaſon for giving the late Sir <hi>William Blackett</hi> (one of his Partners who dealt much in the over Sea Coal-Trade) ſome years ago, order to clear his over Sea Ships for the Coſt, which I am ſure did not look like a benefit to the King nor his Partners, but he is beſt able to anſwer the meaning of that Practice.</p>
