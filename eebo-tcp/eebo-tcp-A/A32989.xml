         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>XXX. The lawful use of the Cross in Baptism explained.</head>
               <p>VVE are sorry that His Majesty's most Princely care and pains
taken in the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> amongst many
other Points, touching this one of the Cross in Baptism, hath taken
no better effect with many, but that still the use of it in Baptism is
so greatly stuck at and impugned. For the further declaration
therefore of the true use of this Ceremony, and for the removing
of all such scruple as might any ways trouble the Consciences of
them who are indeed rightly Religious, following the royal Steps
of our most worthy King, because he therein followeth the Rules of
the Scriptures, and the Practice of the Primitive Church; we do
commend to all the true Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> these
our Directions and Observations ensuing.</p>
               <p>First, It is to be Observed, That although the Jews and Ethnicks
derided both the Apostles, and the rest of the Christians, for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and believing in him who was crucified upon the Cross; yet all,
both Apostles and Christians, were so far from being discouraged
from their Profession by the Ignominy of the Cross, as they rather
rejoyced and triumphed in it. Yea, the holy Ghost, by the mouths
of the Apostles, did honour the Name of the Cross (being hateful
among the Jews) so far, that under it he comprehended not only
Christ crucified, but the force, effects and merits of his Death and
Passion, with all the Comforts, Fruits and Promises which we receive
or expect thereby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The honour and dignity of the Name of the Cross, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
a reverend Estimation even in the Apostle's times, (for ought
that is known to the contrary) of the Sign of the Cross, which the
Christians shortly after used in all their Actions, thereby making an
outward shew and profession, even to the Astonishment of the Jews,
That they were not ashamed to acknowledge him for their Lord and
Saviour, who died for them upon the Cross. And this Sign they did
not only use themselves with a kind of glory, when they met with
any Jews, but Signed therewith their Children when they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened,
to dedicate them by that badge to his Service, whose Benefits
bestowed upon them in Baptism, the name of the Cross did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
And this use of the Sign of the Cross in Baptism was held in
the Primitive Church, as well by the <hi>Greeks</hi> as the <hi>Latins,</hi> with one
consent and great applause. At what time, if any had opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against it, they would certainly have been censured as Enemies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95976:10"/>
of the Name of the Cross, and consequently of Christ's Merits, the
Sign whereof they could no better endure. This continual and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
use of the Sign of the Cross, is evident by many Testimonies of
the Ancient Fathers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It must be confessed, that in process of Time the Sign of
the Cross was greatly abused in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially after
that corruption of Popery had once possessed it. But the abuse of a
thing doth not take away the lawful use of it. Nay, so far was it
from the purpose of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to forsake and reject the
Churches of <hi>Italy, France, Spain, Germany,</hi> or any such like Churches,
in all things which they held and practised, that, as the Apology of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> confesseth, it doth with reverence retain those
Ceremoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s which do neither endamage the Church of God, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the minds of sober men: and only departed from them in those
particular Points, wherein they were fallen both from themselves in
their Ancient Integrity, and from the Apostolical Churches which
were their first Founders. In which respect, amongst some other
very Ancient Ceremonies, the Sign of the Cross in Baptism hath been
retained in this Church, both by the Judgment and Practice of those
reverend Fathers and great Divines in the Days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Sixth, of whom some constantly suffered for the Profession of the
Truth; and others being exiled in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> did after
their return, in the beginning of the Reign of our late Dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
continually defend and use the same. This Resolution and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of our Church hath been allowed and approved by the censure
upon the Communion Book, in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth his Days, and
by the Harmony of Confessions of later Years: because indeed the
use of this Sign in Baptism was ever accompanied here with such
sufficient Cautions and Exceptions against all Popish Superstition and
Error, as in the like Cases are either fit or convenient.</p>
               <p>First, The Church of <hi>England</hi> since the abolishing of Popery
hath ever held and taught, and so doth hold and teach still, That
the Sign of the Cross used in Baptism, is no part of the Substance of
that Sacrament: For when the Minister dipping the Infant in Water,
or laying Water upon the face of it, (as the manner also is) hath
pronounced these Words, <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> the Infant is fully and perfectly Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.
So as the Sign of the Cross being afterwards used, doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
add any thing to the virtue and perfection of Baptism, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
omitted doth detract any thing from the Effect and Substance of

               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95976:11"/>Secondly, It is apparent in the Communion-Book, that the Infant
Baptized is by virtue of Baptism, before it be Signed with the Sign
of the Cross, received into the Congregation of Christ's Flock, as a
perfect Member thereof, and not by any power ascribed unto the
Sign of the Cross. So that for the very remembrance of the Cross,
which is very precious to all them that rightly believe in Jesu Christ,
and in the other respects mentioned, the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath
retained still the Sign of it in Baptism: following therein the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and Apostolical Churches, and accounting it a lawful outward
Ceremony and honourable Badge, whereby the Infant is dedicated to
the Service of him that died upon the Cross, as by the Words used
in the Book of Common Prayer, it may appear.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The use of the Sign of the Cross in Baptism, being thus
purged from all Popish Superstition and Error, and reduced in the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to the primary Institution of it, upon those true
Rules of Doctrine concerning things indifferent, which are conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Word of God, and the Judgments of all the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
we hold it the part of every private man, both Minister and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
reverently to retain the true use of it prescribed by Publick
Authority considering that things of themselves indifferent, do in
some sort alter their Natures, when they are either commanded or
forbidden by a lawful Magistrate, and may not be omitted at every
man's pleasure contrary to the Law, when they be commanded, nor
used when they are prohibited.</p>

Not that always every Deacon should be kept from the Ministery for
a whole Year, when the Bishop shall find good cause to the contrary;

Ordination of Deacons and Ministers, there may ever be some time
of trial of their behaviour in the Office of Deacon, before they be

               <p>THE true, ancient and flourishing Churches of Christ being ever
desirous that their Prelacy and Clergy might be had as well in
outward Reverence, as otherwise regarded for the Worthiness of their
Ministery, did think it sit by a prescript Form of decent and comely Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
to have them known to the People, and thereby to receive the
Honour and Estimation due to the special Messengers and Ministers of
Almighty God: We therefore following their grave Judgment, and
the ancient Custom of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and hoping that in time
new-fangleness of Apparel in some Factious Persons will die of it self,
do constitute and appoint, That the Archbishops and Bishops, shall
not intermit to use the accustomed Apparel of their Degrees. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all Deans, Masters of Colleges, Archdeacons and Prebendaries
in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, (being Priests or Deacons)
Doctors in Divinity, Law and Physick, Batchellors in Divinity, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Arts and Batchellors of Law having any Ecclesiastical Living,
shall usually wear Gowns with standing Collars and Sleeves strait at
the Hands, or wide Sleeves, as is used in the Universities, with Hoods
or Tippets of Silk or Sarcenet, and square Caps. And that all other
Ministers admitted or to be admitted into that Function, shall also usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
wear the like Apparel as is aforesaid, except Tippets only. We
do further in like manner ordain, That all the said Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
above mentioned, shall usually wear in their Journeys Cloaks with
Sleeves, commonly called Priests Cloaks, without Gards, Welts,
long Buttons or Cuts. And no Ecclesiastical Person shall wear any Coife
or wrought Night-cap, but only plain Night-caps of black Silk, Satten
or Velvet. In all which Particulars concerning the Apparel here Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
our meaning is not to attribute any Holiness or special Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
to the said Garments, but for Decency, Gravity and Order, as
is before specified. In private Houses and in their Studies, the said
Persons Ecclesiastical may use any comely and Scholar-like Apparel,
provided that it be not cut or pinckt; and that in publick they go not in
their Doublet and Hose, without Coats or Cassocks: And that they wear
not any light coloured Stockings. Likewise poor Beneficed men and
Curates (not being able to provide themselves long Gowns) may go in
short Gowns, of the Fashion aforesaid.</p>
