            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

FOR MANY and greuous iniuryes, extorſions, oppreſsions, and other wronges, done by her, and ſuffered to be done againſt the poore and innocent people of both cuntryes. FOR ſturringe vp to ſedition and rebellion the ſubiects of other nations about her, againſt their lavvfull and naturall princes, to the deſtructyon of infinite ſoules, ouerthrow and deſolation of moſt goodly cittyes and cuntryes. FOR harboringe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectinge Heretikes, fugetiues, rebelles, and notorious malefactors, vvith greate iniury and preiudice of diuers comon vvealthes: and procuringe for the oppreſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtendome and diſturbance of comon peace, to bringe in our pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and cruell enemy <hi>the Turke.</hi> FOR ſo longe and barbarouſe perſecution of gods ſaints, aflictinge, ſpolynge, and impriſoninge the ſacred Biſhops, tormentinge, and pittyfully murtheringe numbers of holy Preiſts, and other catholike perſons. FOR the vnnatural and iniuſt impriſonment, and late cruelty vſed againſt the moſt gracyous Princeſſe, <hi>Mary Quene of Scotland,</hi> vvho vnder promiſe and aſſurance of protection and ſuccor, came firſt into Englande. FOR aboliſhinge the trevv Catholike religion; prophaninge holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, Monaſteryes, Churches, Sacred perſons, Memories of ſaints, and vvhat els ſo euer might helpe or further to eternal ſaluation: And in the Comon vvelth, diſgraceing the auncyent Nobility, erecting baſe and vnvvorthy perſons to all the Ciuile and Eccleſiaſtical Dignetyes, ſellinge of lavves and iuſtice, And finally exercyſinge an abſolute Tyrannie, with high offence to almighty God, oppreſſyon of the people, perdition of ſoules, and ruine of thoſe cuntryes.</p>
            <p>WHERFORE, theſe thinges beinge of ſuch nature &amp; qualety, that ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make her vnable to reigne, others declare her vnworthy to liue; <hi>His Holineſſe,</hi> in the almighty power of God, and by Apoſtolical auctority to him committed, doth renewe the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his predeceſſors <hi>Pius</hi> 5. and <hi>Gregorie the</hi> 13. tooching the Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication and depoſition of the ſad <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and further a nevve doth <hi>Excommunicate, and depriue</hi> her of all auctority and Princely dignety, and of all title and pretenſy on to the ſaid Croune and Kingdomes of England and Ireland; declaringe her to be illegittimate, and an vniuſt vſurper of the ſame; <hi>And abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge</hi> the people of thoſe ſtates, and other perſons whatſoeuer, from all Obedience, Othe, and other bande of Subiection vnto her, or to any other in her name. <hi>And further</hi> doth ſtraitely commaunde, vnder the indignation of almighty God, and nayne of Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, and the corporal puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t appoynted by the lawes, that none, of whatſoeuer condition or eſtate, after notice of theſe preſents, preſume to yeilde vnto her, Obedience, fauor, or other ſuceurſe, But that they and euery of them concurre by all meanes poſsible to her chaſtiſement. To the ende, that ſhe which ſo many wayes hath forſaken God and his Churche, beinge now deſtitute of wordly comforte, and abandoned of all, may acknowledge her offence, and humbly ſubmitt her ſelfe to the iudgements of the higheſt.</p>
            <p>BE IT THERFORE notefyed to the inhabitants of the ſaid Cuntryes, and to all other perſons, that they obſerue diligently the premiſſes, withdrawinge all ſuccor publike and priuate, from the party purſued and her adherents, after they ſhall haue knowlege of this preſent: And that forthwith they vnite them ſelfs to the Catholike army conducted by the moſt noble and victorious Prince, <hi>Alexander Farneſius, Duke of Parma and Placentia,</hi> in name of his Maieſty, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that eche one can procure, to helpe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre as ys aforeſaid (yf nede ſhall be) to the depoſition and chaſticement of the ſaid perſons, and reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Catholike faith. <hi>Signifyenge</hi> to thoſe which ſhall doe the contrary or refuſe to doe this here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, that they ſhall not eſcape condigne puniſhment.</p>

AND there ſhall not onely due care be had, to ſaue from ſpoyle the Catholikes of theſe cuntryes, which haue ſo longe endured, but mercy alſo ſhewed to ſuch penytent perſons, as ſubmitt them ſelues to the Capitane generall of this army. Yea for ſo much as infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ys giuen, that there be many, which onely of ignorance or feare be fallen from the fayth, and yet notwithſtandinge are taken for heretikes; Neyther ys yt purpoſed, preſently to puniſh any ſuch perſons, but to ſupporte them with clemency, till by conference with lerned men and better conſideration, they may be informed of the truth, if they doe not ſhew them ſelues obſtinate.</p>
            <p>TO PREVENT alſo the ſheadinge of Chriſtiane bloode, and ſpoyle of the cuntry, which might enſewe by the reſiſtance of ſome principall offenders. Be it knowne by theſe preſents, that it ſhal not onely be lawfull for any perſon publike or priuate (ouer and beſides thoſe which haue vndertaken the enterpriſe) to areſte, put in holde, and deliuer vp vnto the Catholike parte, the ſaid vſurper, or any of her complices; But alſo holden for very good ſeruice and moſt highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, accordinge to the qualety and condition of the partyes ſo deliuered. And in like maner, all others, which here to fore haue aſsiſted, or herafter ſhall helpe and concurr to the puniſhment of the offenders, and to the eſtabliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Catholike Religion in theſe prouinces, ſhall receyue that aduauncement of honor and eſtate which their good and faithful ſeruice to the comon welthe ſhall require; in which, reſpecte ſhalbe vſed, to preſerue the auncyent and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble famelyes of the lande, in as much as ys poſsible. AND finally by theſe preſents, fre paſſage ys graunted to ſuch as wil reſorte to the catholike campe, to brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge victuals, munytion, or other neceſſaryes; promiſinge liberall payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for all ſuch things, as ſhal be receiued from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſeruice of the army. Exhorting with all and ſtraitely commaunding, that al men accordinge to theire force and ability, be redy and diligent to aſsiſte here in; to the ende no occaſion be giuen to vſe violence, or to puniſh ſuch perſons as ſhall neglect this commaundement.</p>
