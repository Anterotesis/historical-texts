            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Good Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I DO acknowledge that I am bound to lay my ſelf out in any thing that may conduce to your Aſſiſtance, for carrying on that Great Work, which lyes upon you of the cure of Souls. But when I reflect upon the cheerful concurrence I met with in thoſe endeavours I have hitherto uſed for the promoting that Unanimity, which is the Life and Strength of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and Cements and Embodies your whole proceeding to a laſting ſtrength: I cannot, but with a moſt thankful Heart to God, rejoyce in that juſt diſpoſition, with which, by his Grace, he has fill'd your honeſt Mind. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may never be wanting, and that this Repetition of what you were my Councellour in the laſt year, may the more quicken you to do your duty in thoſe things, which you did then ſo readily conſent and adviſe to: Take your own and my ſenſe, ſo near as I can recollect it, concerning the Subject of our laſt confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon Canon</hi> 54.</p>
            <p>THe Title and Subſtance of this Canon is, <hi>The Licenſes of Preachers refuſing Conformity, to be void.</hi> And to compleat the expectation of the Church in matters of this nature: We muſt look to Canon 38. which ordains, That <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Revolters after Subſcription, are to be depos'd from the Miniſtry.</hi> The reaſon of theſe ſeverities proceeds from the abſolute neceſſity of keeping up Diſcipline in the Church of God. For Nature, the Conſtitution of the World, experience in the ſubſiſtence and ſucceſs of things, teach us, that the Maker of all things is a God of Order, and hates Confuſion. Therefore is the Church of Chriſt likened to a Building, which conſiſts in an orderly diſpoſing of different Materials into one Structure. <hi>I will Build my Church,</hi> ſays our Saviour, Mat. 16. 18. <hi>You alſo are Built together,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 2. 2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Schiſmatical Separatiſts of <hi>Corinth, As a wiſe Maſter Builder, I have laid the Foundation,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 10. <hi>Ye are Gods Building,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 9. <hi>In whom all the Building fitly fram'd,</hi> Eph. 2. 21. And ſo in many other places. It is alſo expreſs'd as a Body, <hi>See</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. how the Apoſtle adapts the Conſtitution and Frame of the natural Body to that of the Church, and concludes <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Ye are the Body of Chriſt.—For the edifying the Body of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4. 12, <hi>and</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>The whole Body fitly joyn'd together,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>maketh increaſe of the Body. From which the Body by Joynts and Bands,</hi> Col. 2. 19. <hi>For his Body's ſake, which is the Church,</hi> Col. 1. 24. There are many more expreſſions of this kind; but I mention theſe eſpecially, to ſhew after what manner we are Embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd, and to what end. Sometimes it is called a Kingdom, which is a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick under one Head. <hi>The Goſpel of the Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 4. 23. <hi>I appoint you a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Luke 22. 29. And ſo in divers other Portions of Scripture. But to let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how neceſſarily the utmoſt rigour of Diſciplin is to be obſerv'd in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, we are moſt truly repreſented to be in a ſtate of War, continually encountring the Fleſh, the World and the Devil, at the Peril of an everlaſting Death. And therefore he ſays, <hi>Put on the Armour of Light,</hi> Rom. 13. 12. <hi>Put on the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God,</hi> Eph. 6. 11. Now we know under what ſevere Penalties almoſt the leaſt fault is forbid by Martial Law, and how ſtrictly it is Executed, not from the roughneſs of the Profeſſion, but the Nicety of the Caſe; where every little diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or diſobedience to command, always gives advantage to a watchful Enemy, and many times endangers a total overthrow. We are therefore to conſider what is expected from us, for the fitting our ſelves to this poſture, that we may be able to ſtand in the day of tryal.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt thing we are to do, is ſo well to diſpoſe our ſelves, by an humble and peaceable Mind, that in the Church where it has pleas'd God to place us, <hi>In what ſtate ſoever, therewith to be content: To ſtudy to be quiet and mind our own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And to yield a hearty, willing and thorough Conformity to the Rules we are under. For if nothing be ordain'd contrary to the expreſs Will of God: <hi>Every Ordinance of Man is to be ſubmitted to for the Lords ſake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13. To this end, the two Acts of Uniformity ought to be ſtrictly read, and obſerved by us. As alſo the Conſtitutions and Canons Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. with the Rubricks to the ſeveral Offices in the Liturgy; taking great heed at the ſame time to our Doctrin, by having a ſpecial regard to the 39. Articles, as expounded in the Books of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. That neither in word nor deed we may hurt, or offend the Church we ſerve in.</p>
            <p>What leſs can we think our ſelves obliged to; when we conſider in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner St. <hi>Paul</hi> conjures the <hi>Corinthians?</hi> Ch. 1. 10. <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions (or Schiſms) among you: But that you be perfectly joyn'd together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame Judgment.</hi> And, <hi>let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame thing,</hi> Phil. 3. 16. <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 40. Surely after this we may ſafely conclude, that whoſoever tranſgreſſes the Rule up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a leſs account, then obedience to the expreſs Will of God, or <hi>ſhall teach men ſo; he ſhall be call'd the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not here to underſtand every breach of the Rule, to lye under this guilt, but ſuch as are committed wilfully, or out of ſupine negligence. Neither need we think it a neglect of duty in thoſe things, which by an Univerſal omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the ſilence of our Superiours giving way to it, lye under a tacite conſent of Abrogation, or Suſpenſion at leaſt. Nor are we to think it a ſmall matter, the leaving theſe things undone; becauſe it is of greater immediate duty to obſerve the weightier matters of the Law. I ſay immediate, inaſmuch as the conſequence in the omiſſion of leſſer matters, may occaſionally and too frequently does prove more fatal to the peace of the Church, and Mens Conſciences than the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the next place, we are to conſider our ſelves in the State of Church-Diſcipline, as Watchmen and Shepherds to guard and ſecure our Flocks. We muſt for this reaſon, not only ſee that we our ſelves, but be careful that others do not offend thoſe that in a ſpecial manner belong to us. We muſt drive away all erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrines, and avoid diſorderly Walkers. We muſt drive away the bold Wolves, the little Foxes, and all Beaſts of Prey, as we will otherwiſe anſwer for the care committed unto us.</p>
            <p>If any come upon us, or go out from among us, and diſcover the Savageneſs of their natures, by not being content to forſake and renounce Order themſelves, but teach and encourage men ſo to do; theſe are Beaſts of Prey. And it is one of the great advantages God has beſtowed upon us, in that promiſe to his Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. <hi>Kings ſhall be thy nurſing Fathers, and Queens thy nurſing Mothers.</hi> That all offenſive and diſorderly Walkers may by their Protection and coercive Power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be reduc'd, or ſecur'd from harming of us. For there is no pretence of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this, no more than if a Man ſhould ſo call a juſt Conviction for an Action of Battery: <hi>Becauſe he is Self-condemned,</hi> Tit. 3. 11. and is not puniſhed for his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but for his diſorderly acting upon that Opinion. Such was <hi>Diotrephes, who loved to have the preheminence,</hi> 3 Joh. 9. 10. And if you ſhould paſs over the <hi>Deeds which ſuch Men do;</hi> you would be the Betrayers and Murderers of your Flocks. Like <hi>the Hireling, who fleeth,</hi> or ſitteth ſtill, <hi>when he ſees the Wolf coming,</hi> Joh. 10. 13.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of diſorderly Walkers who ſtill keep amongſt us, of whom I may ſay in the Apoſtles Words, <hi>I have told you before, and now tell you even Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that by a baſe compliance and a ſervile Aw of the moſt Blameworthy of their Flock, they diſcover ſo cowardly a temper, and unſutable to that Chriſtian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which ſhould place them above the fear of Men; that they become <hi>the Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> Such Men ſhould not be ſuffered to herd with us, but ought to be avoided as infectious Creatures. <hi>Mark them which cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye learnt, and avoid them, Rom.</hi> 16. 17. Such Wretches lye under a complication of diſeaſes, being diſobedient through omiſſion of their Duty, Traitors in not Faithfully diſcharging the truſt committed to them; diſorderly in not Walking according to the Rule, perjur'd in breaking their Oath of Canonical obedience, and that of Supremacy, injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their Brethren and the whole Church, by cheriſhing the unruly expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the People, and are ſo many ways Unfaithful, that had they any ſence of Religion, the conſequent words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt needs make them aſham'd, and confounded. <hi>For they that are ſuch, ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt but their own belly.</hi> 18. Or as it is in another place, <hi>Whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their Belly, and whoſe Glory is in their ſhame, who mind Earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3. 19.</p>
            <p>In ſhort do but mark the careful admonition againſt all <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or diſorder in the Church. <hi>Warn them that are unruly,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 14. <hi>Now we command you Brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw your ſelves from every Brother that walks diſorderly.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 6. And then obſerve with what pleaſure that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or good order is mentioned, For <hi>I though abſent in the Fleſh, yet am with you in the Spirit, joying and beholding</hi>

               <hi>your order, Col.</hi> 2. 5. This word ſhould be written in the Forehead as well as Heart of every Chriſtian, but eſpecially of the Clergy, as <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Inſcription upon the Croſs, in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, that from Eaſt to Weſt, and throughout the World, the Glory of our Chriſtian conſent might be underſtood.</p>
            <p>You may remember upon the recommending a Hearty and Serious pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Divine Service, it was thought very adviſeable and reaſonable to forbear long and expatiating Prayers before Sermon: Leſt either we ſhould be thought our ſelves to eſteem the publick Offices deficient, or give Occaſion to others to be of that Opinion. Upon which Occaſion was mention'd Mr. <hi>Seymours little Treatiſe of publick ſet Forms of Prayer.</hi> Then likewiſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended for your People to read, Mr. <hi>Allens</hi> little Books viz: <hi>A Perſwaſive to Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity. A ſerious and friendly Addreſs to the Nonconformiſts. The danger of Enthuſiaſm.</hi> And I ſhall now add his Book call'd <hi>Catholiciſm.</hi> As alſo Mr. <hi>Lamb</hi>'s two Books, viz: <hi>A ſtop to the Courſe of Separation: And a freſh ſuit againſt Independency.</hi> And this I did, not only for their brevity, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are written by Laymen. And ſuch whoſe expreſſions are ſo fair and their integrity and manner of living ſo well known in the City: That it were impoſſible to propoſe more unexceptionable either as to the Style or Authors. I then wiſhed you, as I ſtill do, to Read the Canons to your Congregation once a year, as it is ordered in the Kings Confirmation of them: And that ſuch Acts or Proclamations as have been appointed to be Read upon the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeth of <hi>January,</hi> the nine and twentyeth of <hi>May,</hi> and fifth of <hi>November,</hi> might be for the future obſerved.</p>
            <p>The urging neceſſity of Perſecution forceth Men into order. But in times of Proſperity, there is great danger of falling aſleep: Eſpecially in ours, where the corruption of the Age makes unrulineſs paſs for a virtue. And yet the Cenſorious humour which it produces, is a ſtrong motive on the other hand, where any ſparks of Wiſdom or common prudence remain, to obſerve a very ſtrict and cloſe Order in our own Defence. Take away then the Glory of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Rules, by that which is of infinitely more value, the obſervation of them. And let not the great and painful care of the Fathers of the Primitive Church, both by Private endeavors, and in Councils, riſe up in Judgment againſt us, for deſtroying that Diſcipline by diſorder and neglect, which at the peril of their Lives many times, they upheld for the preſervation of Chriſts Body, which is the Church. I pray God ſtrengthen your Heart with a courage ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the times we live in, and every way enable you to anſwer the juſt expectations of,</p>
