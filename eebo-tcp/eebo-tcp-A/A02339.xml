            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>THe firſt remedie againſt ſinne, is pouertie, becauſe Riches are the Winges and armes of Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which being clipt and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by want, wee cannot ſo eaſilie flie

                     <p>The ſecond remedie is comtempt of the World, leaſt opening our eares to the vaine praiſes of mens lips, or aduan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced to ſudden honour and eſtimation, our hart ſucke in the poiſon of ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceit, whereby we thinke our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie a ſufficient diſpenſation for ſinne.</p>

                     <p>The fourth remedie, is the auoiding of peruerſe companie, for the wicked will infect the godlie, as one bough of a tree, being ſet on fire, conſumeth the reſt.</p>

                     <head>Of vertue in generall.</head>
                     <p>VIrtue, is a proportion and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life agreeable to reaſonne, and conſiſteth in mediocritie, as Vice doth in exceſſe or defect: It is neither ſubiect to Fortune, ſclander, ſickneſſe, olk-age, aduerſitie, or tyrannie.</p>
                     <p>Of vertues there are two kindes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue and morrall: contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, which is a quiet and ſetled behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all thoſe good things gathered together by reaſon, and approoued by iudgement: and morrall, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the practiſe and diſperſing of thoſe good thinges to the benefite of humane ſocietie; ſo that it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to thinke well, but to doe well. And the bodie of vertue is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it muſt be complet, not found of one lim, and lame of another.</p>
                     <p>For if either chaſtity ſhall be without humility, or humilitie without chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

when god doth as well deteſt pride as vncleannes, by what meanes ſhall proud chaſtitie be acceptable in his ſight, or vnclean humility, good things are not pleaſing to God, which are ſpotted with the commixture of euill: as for example, to liue ſoberly, and to be aſleepe to good workes, or to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute good works and liue licentiouſly are both vaine.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the tree of vertue muſte floriſh in euerie bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, In which ſence it will be as a ſhelter in time of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and a hauen of peace to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

                     <p>Secondly, wee murmur againſt god, when we find falt at the courſe of time

or the vnſeſonablenes of the weather, knowing that in all thinges we ought to ſubmit to his will and prouidence; ſo that neither for the oppreſſion of wicked men, nor the diſtemperature of drouth, moiſture, cold or heat, oght we to be diſmayde, but faithfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God will at length remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vs.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>THe firſt thing that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our conſideration in this Genealogy of virtue, is to know the parent or firſt originall, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence this glorious Impe and ofspring of happineſſe takes her beeing. For as in the deſcent and pedigree of men, it is held an honourable thing, to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from worthy parents: ſo, to make the excellency of Vertue more noble and reſpectiue in mens eies, is to ſhew that ſhe is no meane borne perſonage, but ſprung from the mightye king of heauen and earth, euen God himſelf. For proofe hereof, we haue both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Scripture: Whoe hath euer ſeene Figges to ſpring of Thiſtles, or
<pb facs="tcp:19252:61"/>
grapes of thorns? Good fruit is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from good trees, no man ought to thinke that any perfection or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent guift, tending to the beauty and bleſſedneſſe of this life (ſuch as virtue is) doeth proceede or hath his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from anye other then the father of lightes: which being ſo, let vs pay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her that tribute of loue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which we owe vnto her, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence her for her nobillity, and loue her for the infinite treaſure of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that ſhe brings with her</p>
                  <p>Comming thus like a royall princeſse, the ſecond thing to be conſidered is, where ſhe makes her throne of rule &amp; gouernment: not in anie baſe corner of the world, but in the heart of him that is the ruler of the worlde: Soloman would not erect a throane vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe but of pure gold, no more wil vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but of the heart of man; as ſhe is her ſelfe excellent, ſo will ſhe haue her ſeate agreable: for of al creatures man
<pb facs="tcp:19252:61"/>
is moſt excellent.</p>
                  <p>The third, thing to be conſidered is, the quality of her gouernment: ſhe is not tyranous, bloudy, or cruell, but gentle, meeke, and gracious: mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place where ſhe raigneth, a paradice, and the parties ouer whom ſhe raignes, Peerleſſe. Shee bringes with her peace of conſcience, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of ſoule, arming her ſubiectes with invincible power againſte the force both of domeſticall and forren ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Domeſtical, which are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations and wilde affections of the ſoule, as Ambition, Anger, Sloth, Pride, Couetouſneſſe, and ſuch like, and forren, as ſhame or ſickneſſe, pouertie, perſecution, old age, impriſonment and death, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The 4. thing to be conſidred, is the continuance of her Kingdome: it is not momentarye but eternall, and to ſuch as imbrace her for their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, ſhe plats a wreath of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:
<pb facs="tcp:19252:62"/>
earthly Princes may giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happineſſe, which for an age or ſo, may happilye indure; but ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſteth her friends and louers with that bleſſedneſſe, that neuer ſhal haue end. Plato was woont to ſay, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Virtue compared with the Pompe of the world, is ſo great: that if it were put into one skale of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and virtue into the other, this would aſcend vp to heauen, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touch the center of the earth.</p>
                  <p>The fift thing to be conſidered, is her Lawes and ſtatutes, they are not (ſuch as Dracos were) writ in bloude, but drawn with a ſoft and gentle hand, vſing rather perſwaſion than compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, faire intreaty, rather than foule inforcement.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt and laſt thing to be conſidred, is to whom ſhe preſcribes her Lawes and Statutes, which is not to a creature dull and vncapable, but to an eſſence deuine and apt to conceiue, which is
<pb facs="tcp:19252:62"/>
the ſoule of man, created after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of himſelfe. And this is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhe labours to beautifie, and the Gardens ſhe faine would plant with all manner of ſweete and odoriferous flowres. Nor doth ſhe ſtand in need as other Princes doe, for the helpe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or anie coniugall ſocietie of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon, to the propagation of her poſterity; but is in her ſelfe (like a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) fruitefull and ful of increaſe. But before we come to the perticuler iſſues that flow from this rich ſpring, it ſhall not be amiſſe, to conſider how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it is for man to be made a ſubiect of virtue.</p>

As the Romans did builde their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of honor in ſuch ſort, that no man could haue acceſſe into it, but firſt hee muſt come through the temple of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: euen ſo we may ſay of the temple and pallace of heauen: there is no loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for entrance there, except we firſt paſſe thorough the gates of piety and vertue here. This was the reaſon that moued Ariſtotle to ſay, that man was borne Ad intelligendum &amp; agendum, Man by creation had this propriety aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him, to labour for knowledge, and not ſo only, but being furniſhed therewith, to endeuour to ſet it forth by action and conuerſation. For as to be ignorant is a thing contemptible, ſo is it farre more odious to knowe much and practiſe little; to be rich in Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and poore in Conſcience.

The ſoule is a ſpirit, which giueth life to the body whereunto it is ioyned, and which is capeable of the knowledg of
<pb facs="tcp:19252:67"/>
God, to loue him as being meet to be vnited vnto him to eternal happineſſe. In that it is a ſpirit, it confutes their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, that thought the ſoule did proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the partes of the body, but in that it giueth life, it confutes their oppini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thought it was mortall, and that with the death of the body it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe periſhed.

In the booke of Gen. 2.7. it is ſaid, God made man a liuing ſoule, that is immortall. In the goſpell after S.

manefeſt the ſoule liueth after the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Likewiſe in the goſpell after S. Luke, 16.22. the begger dyed, and his ſoule was carried into Abrahams boſome. And in the 23. of the ſame goſpell the 43. verſe our ſauiour chriſt ſaid to the repentant theefe, This day thou ſhalt be with mee in Paradice, (meaning his ſoule and not his body) which words he would not haue vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if the ſoule had periſhed with the bodie and not been immortall. Many other places might be recyted, but if theſe ſeeme inſufficient, ſo wil the reſt. Further, the ſoule appeares to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall by her owne properties: firſt, in that it giueth life to the body, and is ſo farre from corruption, that ſo long as it bides therein, it preſerues the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from corrupting; Secondly, in that it is in continuall motion, and neuer ceaſeth (whether wee ſleepe or wake, walke or ſit ſtill) to apprehend, think, or ponder vpon ſomething; in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

it wanders through the heauens, compaſſeth the earth, and croſſeth the broadeſt Seas.

in Philoſophye, nor ſtands it with the dexteritie of euerie ones wit, or the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billitie of his minde, to trafficke with ſo magnificent a prince, as virtue is, therefore ſay they, it is better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues in the courſe of meaner matters. How abſurd a ſtarting hole this is, appeares in that, euen in thoſe weake matters which they prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtudie of virtue, for the moſte part, they ſpend more time and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more danger to compaſſe their de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire, then they ſhould haue done in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie point of the diſcipline of virtue, and yet when they haue what they would haue, it is rather their deſtruction then their happineſſe, their diſturbance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their quiet: as we ſee in the end of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, how will the couetous man, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſweat, ſpare and pinch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to the intente he may haue his bagges cramd and his coffers ſtuft? and yet when they are ſo, his fear is greater to loſe them, then his care was before

to get them; nay oftentimes he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainde to forgoe them, euen with the forfeyture of his life. Euen ſo in honor, the ambitius man wil refuſe no paines, thinke much of no extremitie, but be readie to indure the heate of ſummer, the colde of winter, to watch, attend, ride and run, in hope to reach at laſte the top of preferment: which when he once hath got, and thinkes to ſleep ſecurelye, ſome ſiniſter blaſt or other ſhakes his tottering ſtate and hurles him ſuddenlie downe into the pitt of all diſgrace and obloquy.

the Guiſians before they brought to paſſe the bloudie maſſacre at Parriſſe, were eight or nine whole yeare buſied and imploied in meetings, conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and beating their brains about it.

<pb facs="tcp:19252:80"/>
wherby men labor to cloke their ſlack<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes in the ſtudy of vertue is pouerty we finde (ſaie they) by experience, that vertue giues her louers and welwillers aboundance of knowledge, but verie little wealth: plentifull braines, but verie needy and penurious backes: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it were ſo, yet let me aſke this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whether is better the riches that ſhall neuer vaniſhe, or the riches that dailie are ſubiect to caſualtie? whether more excellent, the poſſeſſion whoſe fruite is eternall, then the poſſeſſion, whoſe profits are momentarie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fading? I thinke there is no man ſo void of reaſon, but will ſay the former: but notwithſtanding this difference it is manifeſt that ſuch carpers &amp; detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe walke in a very palpable and groſſe errour. For why, vertue is ſo far from leauing her friends deſtitute and contemptible, as ſhe is the cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually both of wealth, honour and promotion. Did not Iacob proſper and growe riche in the ſeruice of his

                     <p>The third and laſt pretenced cauill againſt the ſtudie of vertue, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils which it bringes men into, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it hazardes their liues, liberties, &amp; welfares: for ſay they, to reproue mens behauiours wherunto they are nature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inclinde, or to find fault with their delightes, or condemne their actions (as commonlie the virtuous are ſtirred vp to doe) is but a meanes to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incur hatred, lie open to checkes and tauntes, and be ſubiect to a perpetuall warfare of an infinite number of ſuch like inconueniences. I anſwere, that through the mallice of the diuel and of the world, it is true in deed, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is many times liable to ſuch afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb facs="tcp:19252:81"/>
but withall we muſt remember, that as the meaſure of calamitie which inſiſtes vpon vertue is great, ſo the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure of patience which accompanies her, is likewiſe great; yea ſo great, that it maketh thoſe thinges which ſeeme ſowre and vnpleaſant, to haue a moſte ſweet and delectable taſt: hence it is, that many vertuous men haue ſuffered a thouſand outrages with ſuch conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that tyrants haue binſooner wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in perſecuting, than they in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: naie they haue vndergone their martirdomes with ſuch ioy, as in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding of them, you would either haue thought they had beene ſenſles, or that in ſeing them, you did not ſee them. Witneſſe the example of Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, a holie and religious man, who being condemned and throwne into a caue to be deuoured of wilde beaſts, when he felt their teeth take hold in his fleſh, cried cheerfully out, as if he had felt no paine, grinde ſmall, and
<pb facs="tcp:19252:82"/>
make ſweete manchet for my God to feed vpon To come neerer home. Bi. Cranmer Archb. of Cant. (as we read) was a man of that vertous reſolution, that without ſhrinking, he ſuffered his right hand to burn off, with the linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring flame of a torch; and therfore we ſee, as vertue is ſubiect to calamity, ſo is ſhe ſtrong to make a ſcorne of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>

                     <head>The effects of Vice.</head>
                     <p>BEſide, that vice is the mother of all diſorder, rancour, murder, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, periury, luſt, and ſuch like, it hath four other principall and moſt daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effects. Firſt, it is the depriuation of grace, it robs a man of the fauour of God, and leaues him in the power of the diuell: and what it is to be forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god, appears by the example of ſaul that ſlue himſelf, &amp; Iudas that hanged himſelf. Secondly, ſhame in the world, for it leads men blindfold (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did the Aramits 2. king. 6, 20. til it hath broght them into the midſt of al infamy, and then it opens their eies &amp; lets them ſee their ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and folly.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:19252:83"/>The third is torment of conſcience, which is equall with vice, both for birth and age, and followes it no other wiſe than the ſhadow doeth the body. For euen at the ſame inſtant that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe is committed, ſhe frameth in and for her ſelfe her own puniſhment, which beginneth to afflict &amp; torment her with the remorſe thereof; and this is it, which the Diuines call the worm of conſcience that neuer dieth, but con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually (like Titius vultur) tyreth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hart of a malefactor, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeng his miſerable life with ſhame, confuſion, frightes, and continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, euen to his lateſt gaſpe: ſo that his whole life is nothing elſe but a figure of eternall death: as is made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant vnto vs by the example of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, who when he had ſlaine his owne mother, could neuer ſleepe quietlie in his bed, but alwaies thought hee ſawe her follow him and torment him with firebrandes. We read another ſtrange
<pb facs="tcp:19252:83"/>
example to the like effect in our eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Cronycles, of king Richard the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, who hauing put to death the Earle of Arundel and other noblemen, (rather for that they reprooued his vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſought to bridle his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong youth, than for anye capitall point of treaſon) was ſo troubled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward with remorſe of his bloudye fact, as that one night he ſtarted out of his bed, and being in great agony and paſſion of ſoule, would not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but that the Earle of Arundell was reuiud and ſought to perſecute him, til ſuch time as he had opened his graue, and ſaw that his dead bodie lay there ſtill without a head.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and laſt effect of vice and wickedneſſe is infection, for it is not onely noiſome and pernitious to him in whom it remaines, but it alſo vſeth him as a means to corrupt and ſpoil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the proofe hereof we ſee dailie, in that there is not any wicked perſon,
<pb facs="tcp:19252:84"/>

                     <p>The ſecond, is the diſguiſe which vice puts vpon her, blearing mens eies with falſe and fained ſhewes, ſo that ſhe creepes into them and bewitcheth them, vnder the title and cogniſaunce of vertue; as when ſhe perſwades them and ſets before their eies the things of
<pb facs="tcp:19252:84"/>
this world as their true and onely feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
                     <p>The third is authority; ſome men will be the more audatious and readye to commerce with Vice, for that they thinke their high birth or calling may be a priueledge for their lewde beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: but ſuch men forgette, that to whom more is giuen, of him more ſhal be required, &amp; that the greater ſhame and ſcandall ſhall redound to ſuch a one, who being borne to commaund men of all eſtates and condicions, and like a Lampe to giue light vnto them; doth notwithſtanding ſuffer himſelfe to be made ſeruyle to ſuch vyle and abiect thinges, as are ſenſuality, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, concupiſence, and other like effectes wrought and brought foorth by Vice.</p>

                     <p>FAith is diuerſlye taken, firſte in the Hebru tongue, it is put for veritie and truth.

which men obſerue in their words and promiſes, of which we wil ſpeake hereafter. Fourthly, according as it is effectuall to ſaluation, the holye ſcriptures call it the ground of thinges which are hoped for, and the euidence of thinges which are not ſeene, Hebru. 11, 1. that is, Faith is an aſſured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the accompliſhment of gods promiſes made vnto vs in Chriſt Ieſus.

<pb facs="tcp:19252:87"/>
our ſaluation to our owne merits, then were not our redemption of the free grace of God, but of deſert: as is in the epiſtle to the Romans 4. chap. to him that worketh, the wages is not counted by fauour but by debt. Againe, Gen. 3, 10. The workes of the Lawe are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſſe, but he that beleeueth in the ſonne, hath life euerlaſting. Iohn 3 36. Therefore faith onely iuſtifieth, though this faith be neceſſarily accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panied with good workes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is another kinde of Faith, which only conſiſteth in word, without any deſire to expreſſe the ſame in action: as there bee many that will ſay, they beleeue in God, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his word, and they tremble at his iudgements; but to be mercifull vnto their brethren, to relieue the poore, or helpe the fatherleſſe or widdow, that they either care not for, or think to be no part of their dutie: but this a dead faith, an vnprofitable faith, and ſuch a
