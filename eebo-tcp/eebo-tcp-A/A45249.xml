            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
TO THE

Shewing them how they may get out.</head>
            <byline>FROM
Mr. <hi>William Hutchinson</hi> alias <hi>Bury</hi>
For Fourteen Years of their SOCIETY;
But now of the Church of ENGLAND.</byline>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured Dear SIRS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>DO not vainly flatter your selves with the hopes of Martyrdom; You
know as well as I can tell you: 'Tis the Cause, not purely Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which makes a Martyr. If the State of <hi>Venice</hi> might lawfully
prohibit you their Territories, so may our Gracious Sovereign law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
prohibit you his Dominions; provided he tolerate (as he does)
a sufficient number of Christian Priests and Bishops to Preach the Doctrine, and
Administer the Sacraments of our Lord Jesus to his People. Seing therefore (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to His Majesties Prohibition) you have entred his Kingdoms, to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the Ecclesiastical and Civil Peace, and to the disquieting of his pious
Subjects Consciences, by telling them they are damned for not communicating
with a Prelate as their supream Pastor, a thousand Miles off, who has no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them: Confess your fault and ask pardon, and be gone; or else hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyn with your Natural Liege and his Bishops, in reforming abuses crept into
the Christian world through the negligence of Ecclesiastical Prelates, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
the true primitive Christian Doctrine and Discipline to our poor Country.
Say no more falsly, you are hardly dealt with, to be prohibited your Native Soyl
under pain of being Hang'd, Drawn and Quarter'd, for loving your Neighbours as
your selves, for gently admonishing them they are precipitating themselves into
eternal Misery by all manner of sins and wickedness. Say no more neither, our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35881:2"/>
Blessed Lord bids you go teach all Nations his holy Gospel; but no says King
<hi>James;</hi> I except my three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> You are
mistaken, you are not prohibited <hi>England</hi> either by our gracious Soveraign or
his Royal Grandfather, for your preaching Christs holy Gospel; but for your
superadded Doctrines of the Popes Temporal and Spiritual Supremacy, of new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
Indulgences and other Trashy Tenents and practices prejudicial to our Souls
health, and destructive of the Civil Polity. Joyn your selves to our Communion,
and bring a long with you as much zeal as you please against all manner of sin and
wickedness, only leave your Treasonable and Trashy Doctrines behind you,
and you are welcom.</p>
            <p>Know my Dear Friends, God is deservedly angry with your Society for your
Deposing, and other Trashy Doctrines. Do not die with an Equivocation in
your Mouths, but confess (to the glory of God and the confusion of your Order,)
that not a man of your Society hath writ against the Popes power of Deposing
Heretical Princes, but either they treated not the question, or else they posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
held he had such a power: As have done you know, your <hi>Santarel, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,
Suarez</hi> and others. And if your later Writers teach no such Doctrine, 'tis
not because they hold it not, but because they are politickly prohibited to meddle
with the Controversy. Your silence in this matter is a tacit consent, unless you
would positively renounce what your prime Doctors have positively taught: If
this be Christian Doctrine, doubt not to die for it, if not, abjure it. And know,
if you suffer Imprisonment or other Grievances for such Treasonable Doctrines,
you are in the sight of God no more Confessors, or Martyrs, then common
Highway-men, or other Fellons. Acknowledge all your damnable Doctrines of
Deposing Princes for Heresie or Mis-government, of Equivocation, and forswea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by Oath what you are guilty of, to defend your honor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For these and
your other damnable Doctrines God evidently punishes you and your Party. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
renounce these and God and men will favour you. To say you renounce King-killing
Doctrine is an Equivocation: 'Tis ill halting before a Cripple; a Deposed
King is no King, but an Usurper and Rebel, if he go on after his deposition to
exercise Regal power: And consequently it becomes lawful to the next man that
meets him to Kill him, if the next Heir so command. So that, whosoever holds
the Deposing Doctrine, necessarily holds King-klling Doctrine. And therefore
if it be your unhappy fate to die at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> which I hope it will not be, renounce
candidly the Deposing Doctrine, and confess ingenuously withall, that your
Writers universally either teach it, or else say nothing of the Question. Our
Lord Jesus is purging his Church, he abhorres the Papal Infallibility, his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and much more his Temporal universal Supremacy, your Indulgence Doctrine,
your Attrition Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so must you too, if you ever expect his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
in this World or the other.</p>
            <p>If ever any ones sin was legible in their punishment, your and your parties is:
Take notice then of these seroius Reflections. By a <hi>Breue</hi> from the Pope your
General Licensed <hi>Santarel</hi>'s Book for Deposing of Princes for Heresie or Mis-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
And you are accused that your General by a <hi>Breue</hi> from the Pope
appointed Officers Military and Civil in our Gracious Soveraigns Dominions.
You commonly teach the people that our Blessed Saviours natural Body is in
Heaven and on Earth at the same time; and your chief accuser must (you say)
prove himself to have been in two places at once to make his Testimony valid. You
say its Pride and unsufferable Arrogancy to question the Decrees of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
undoubtly after they are in a manner universally received; and they are looked
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35881:2"/>
upon as willfully blind who question your guiltiness after a whole Parliament has
resolved you guilty, especially after this has been also in a manner generally belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the whole people. You falsly maintain an usurped Papal Power, and you are
accused to make use of it to Treason and Rebellion. You have notoriously abused
the power of Ecclesiastical Dispensation, partly by extending it to Divine Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Oaths and Vows made to God, and manifestly by making use of it to avarice
and gain: And you are believed to have a Dispensation for Lies and Perjuries
in the very Article of Death. Your exacting a set mulct upon Priests for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubins,
looked much like a giving leave to keep one for the increase of the
Church's Treasury: And you are accused to have leave to commit most horrid
Villanies for the Church's interest. You have abused the Power of Absolution, to
absolve as oft as customary sinners pleased: And you are accused with perjury to
attest your innocency, and then to absolve one another afterwards. Not that I
accuse you of the Crimes laid to your charge, I leave you to God and your own
Consciences. But I say, your Doctrines are the just cause of all your sufferings.
You have taught the World to equivocate and deny with Oathes the Crimes
they are guilty of, and every one is laughed at as sensless who believes a word
you say or swear in your own defence. If in your persons you be innocent of the
crimes you are charged with, your Doctrines are more manifestly punished by the
Providence of Heaven. At length acknowledge not onely your Personal, but your
very Church-faults. 'Tis a notorious cheat, that your Church is chargeable with
nothing but the mistakes of General Councils. If I cannot meet with an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Ghostly Guide, one in ten but he teaches me dangerous Doctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
Practises, my Soul is in no less danger by my being in your Communion, than if
the Errors and Fopperies of every petty Confessor were so many Decrees of
Oecumenical Assemblies. That which influences our Souls either to good or
bad, are the notoriously known Sentiments of our immediate Guides, and not
the secret and to few known Decisions of Christian Councils. I will not say with
a Friend of yours, Calumny was your crime, and by Calumuy you are punished:
yet I wish you would reflect how falsly and undeservedly you calumniated the
Great Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and the Divine Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> (and indeed whom you pleased)
in the Court or <hi>Rome,</hi> and disparaged amongst your Devotes their incomparable
Writings with blind and surreptitious Censures. <hi>We are verily guilty concerning
our Brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us, and we would
not hear: therefore is this distress come upon us, Gen.</hi> 42. 21.</p>
            <p>You may say, and perhaps truly, you never were taught your selves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Doctrine, nor never taught it others; because the teaching of it by
some of your Authors made you odious to Christian Princes, and thereupon
your General prohibited all medling with the Question. You may also perhaps
truly say, you do not believe the Doctrine to be true, that is, as an Article of
your Faith. But what security is this to Christian Princes, whom you deem
Hereticks, if in your hearts you generally think it a probable opinion, partly
for intrinsecal reasons, but manifestly for the Authorities of your own, and
other Doctors of your Church? Especially you commonly maintaining as you
do, that it's lawful to follow a probable opinion, though but even extrinsecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
probable, as you speak; and this without dispute, when great Good is
likely to ensue upon your acting according to such an opinion. God forbid I
should go about to add afflictions to your afflictions, but I would gladly shew
you how you may appease God and Man's anger against you, by inducing you
to an humble and penitent acknowledgment of your manifest and notorious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35881:3"/>
faults. Your blind zeal for the Pope's Temporal and Spiritual Power, has brought
all this evil upon you; examine it well and impartially, at least now when God
afflicts you for the idolizing of it, lest you hear, and deservedly, <hi>Jer. 2. 30. In
vain have I smitten your children, they received no correction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Acknowledge the plain truth; the Pope, as from Christ, has no more power
in <hi>England,</hi> than the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> has in <hi>Italy.</hi> All Bishops are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Spiritual Monarchs in their Diocesses; Archbishops, Primates, and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
are purely humane inventions, for Union and Order sake, in the vacancy of
General &amp; Provincial Councils; as for a Supreme Pastor, that would be as inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
as a Civil Monarch of the whole World. The Government of the Church of
Christ is not Monarchical, but Aristocratical; St. <hi>Peter</hi> was no more the Vicar
of Christ, than any one of the other Apostles, they were all his Vicars, and so is
every Christian Bishop, and has power all over the World to ordain Priests, to
preach the Gospel, and to administer Christs Sacraments; but by mutual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
for Order's sake, and to avoid confusion, they exercise not this power out
of their particular Diocesses. The twelve Apostles divided the World amongst
them, that so their labours might be more profitable, and no place left uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated;
the like is done and to be done by all Christian Bishops till Dooms-day
come. Consider attentively, whether seeing Jesus Christ resolved his Church
should be spread all over the Earth, it be not as certain he would never ordain
an Universal Monarch over it, as 'tis certain he would not appoint a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which would be impracticable, useless, and sensless. A Monarch even over
the Western part of the World, what mischief has it not done, in making strange
Doctrines and Practises universal? such are the Doctrines of infusion of habitual
grace by the words of Absolution, Indulgences, mock-Absolutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No
less notorious mischiefs has it done, in exhausting vast Riches out of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Europe</hi> to satiate the avarice and ambition of one Pompous See. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the unanimous belief and practices of several Christian Provinces in the
same Faith and Rites, what assurance does it not give for their being Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical?
But when all are over-awed and commanded to believe or practise as one
Spiritual Monarch pleases, their agreement has far less force. Nor is there fear
of as many Christian Religions as there are Christian Provinces, provided they
meet frequently in General and Provincial Councils, as they ought, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
nothing of Faith to others which is doubtful to themselves, and resolve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be Apostolical, but what is so clear to them all to be so, in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
Tradition, &amp;c. as they cannot doubt but it had its origin from the Apostles;
for what's so clear to one Province, cannot be obscure to another, consulting the
same safe means of not mistaking the holy Scriptures, holy Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our
Judgment are as agreeing as our Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no twenty men can so clearly see an
object at such a distance, so as they cannot doubt they see it; but any three men
of equal good eye-sight, at the same distance, must needs see the same. If Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
have disagreed, 'twas because they stuck not to this Rule, and therefore
their disagreement ought to be no prejudice to those who are resolved rigidly
to adhere to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In my next I shall hint to you the Reasons of my Change, which so much scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes
you, but indeed ought to edifie you, and all good Christians.</hi>
