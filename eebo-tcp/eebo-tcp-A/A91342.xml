            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Virtues and Uſes of the Queen
of Hungary's Water.</head>
            <p>THe Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Water, being of a hot Nature,
and very ſubtle; it ſtrengthens the Heart, Brains and
Stomach, digeſts all manner of Crudities, diſſolves
Phlegm, and repairs the Diſſipations of the Spirits; in
ſo much that one may uſe it for all the Indiſpoſitions of the Brains
and Stomach, which may proceed from Colds, and to expel Winds
and Cholicks.</p>
            <p>To uſe it rightly, you muſt mingle half a ſpoonful (more or
leſs, having reſpect to the Age or indiſpoſition of the Party that
is to take it) either in a little Broth, or ſome other Liquor, for
to temper its Virtues: it may be taken ſeveral days together, or
elſe two or three times a week.</p>
            <p>One may alſo uſe it outwardly, for all manner of pains in what
part of the Body ſoever; for thoſe that are troubled with a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in their Sinews, to fortifie the Joynts; for the Palſie, Gout,
Burnings, Contuſions, and in the decline of an Erezipelus, or
Saint <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire. It muſt be uſed by fomenting and bathing
the parts affected, warming it a little if deſired. For a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Sight, and the Headach, you muſt rub the Forehead and
the Eyes. It is alſo very good for Deafneſs, in dropping it into the
Ear, and ſtopping it with a little Wool. The Ladies uſe it for
their Fa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, it makes the skin ſmooth, and a fair Complexion, by
taking away Scurfs or Witherneſs; you muſt waſh your ſelf twice
or thrice a week by mingling it with a little Spring-water, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe that are of a ſwarthy Complexion.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the ſeveral Diſtillers of this Water in <hi>Montpellier,</hi>
where by the confeſſion of all Men it is beſt prepared, <hi>James
Puech</hi> Apothecary and Perfumer dwelling in the ſaid City, doth
make it with all the exactneſs and care imaginable; and is ſold
here in <hi>London</hi> by his Son <hi>David Puech,</hi> living in
at the Sign of the true Perfumer of <hi>Montpellier.</hi>
