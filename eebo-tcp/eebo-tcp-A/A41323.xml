            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOur Commands firſt gave the enſuing Diſcourſe Life, and now Publication; as to the latter, there is ſo little of my own in it, that I can thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign not ſo much the publication of it, as of my obedience; But that there is ſo little, may I hope be believed, was more out of choice then neceſſity; for tho the notions of a Braine, rufſted and diſordered by a violent and tedious Diſtemper, might fall short of any reaſonable performance; yet there is no invention ſo weak or barren, but might upon ſuch extraordinary occaſion, abound with more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry productions. But indeed (conſidering our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) I thought nothing more proper for that occaſion, then to lay open the Principle of that Church to which we are beholding for the deſign'd Treaſon of that Day.</p>
            <p>And let their pretences to Loyalty, be what they will, yet they muſt give me leave to aſſert, that where the Popes Supremacy is maintain'd, there the King looſes always ſo much in a Subject, as his Holineſs gains in him.</p>
            <p>I am very far, from the leaſt deſign of exaſperating your Lordships againſt any of that Profeſſion now amongſt us; Your prudent Conduct, (of which they themſelves are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes)
<pb facs="tcp:63746:3"/>
may I hope prove a more ſucceſsfull inſtrument of their Reformation, then Ruine and Power. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Zeal for the Truth (without making uſe of either) is already conſpicuous enough, and will yet more eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in Commanding theſe Sheets (that with ſo much plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs aſſert it) to the Preſs.</p>
            <p>Their dreſs I muſt ſubmit to your Lordships favour, but their truth, to the greateſt ſeverity; if in the former, I have been ſo unhappy as to have done ill, yet (conſidering my preſent ſtate) I have the happineſs, that Charity may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue I might have done better; Them together with my ſelf, I lay at your Lordships feet, and beg leave to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

            <epigraph>

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21. latter part of the <hi>11th.</hi> verſe.</bibl>
               <q>They have imagined a miſchievous device which they are not able to perform.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IF we call to mind the Mercy of this Day, we may ſay of it as the four Lepers ſurprized with joy at the ſudden va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and diſapearance of the <hi>Syrians</hi> Army, <hi>This day is a day of good Tidings, and we ſhould not do well to hold our Peace.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 9. Should we hold our Peace, <hi>the very Stones</hi> (as our Saviour told the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> troubled at the triumphing of the Diſciples) <hi>would Immediately cry out;</hi> for if ever any People, we, if we for any Deliverance, for this; and if for this, on any day, much more on this day, may well ſay and ſing with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in the words of the Text, <hi>They have Imagined a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Device which they are not able to perform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come particularly to the Text, method requires, that I diſingage it from ſome connexion: And that may be beſt done by caſting a glance on the foregoing <hi>Pſalm;</hi> It is ſpent in Prayer for the King; was penn'd by <hi>David,</hi> and by him commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63746:4"/>
to the praeſect of his Muſick, as a ſorm to ſolicite God with in the troubleſom times, and days of Danger.</p>
            <p>And removing your eye from that <hi>Pſalm</hi> to this, you will find this to ſtand as a Talley to the former, containing a Form of Praiſe, in return of the Mercies there prayed for; what the Church begged of God, in the foregoing, they bleſs him for the receipt of in this <hi>pſalm:</hi> They are none of thoſe Orators whom affliction only makes ſo, who never cry, but under the laſh, nor liſt up their hands to God but when he laies his hand upon them; ſuch as the Prophet tells us of, <hi>Ila.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>Lord in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have they viſited thee, they poured out a Prayer when thy chaſtening hand was upon them:</hi> But even now, when God hath remembred them they will not forget him; now they are paſt danger, they are not paſt duty, now they are ſet out of hazard, they ſet their hearts, and tune their ſpirits to thankſgiving. To beg of God when we are empty may ſpeak Faith in the Heart, but to bleſs him when we are full, is the breathing of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Text then is a part of that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Song ſung by the <hi>Jews</hi> in acknowledgment of Gods goodneſs to <hi>David</hi> their King, and in him to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Pollicy or Common Wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> The ſum or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof I ſhall deliver in theſe two Concluſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Enemies of Gods Church and People are of a plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, deviſing, and miſchievous ſpirit, and temper, <hi>They have imagined a miſchievous thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Let the wicked deſign what they will, or plot what they can, they ſhall not be able to accompliſh their deſire or deſign, <hi>Which they are not able to perform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt the Enimies of Gods Church and People are of a Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Deſigning, Miſchievous, ſpirit and temper.</p>
            <p>The Miſchievous thing here deſigned, was the overthrow of <hi>David</hi> and his People, by the Forces of the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> with the <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> under the Command of their Capt. General <hi>Shobach,</hi> of which we read 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 10. But <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63746:4"/>
Victory, that this and the foregoing <hi>Pſalm.</hi> refer to, plainly declare, tho <hi>they imagined a miſchievous device, they were not able to perform:</hi> It were eaſie to manifeſt this truth, either by Scripture, or the Hiſtory of the Primitive times; I could ſhew you that Gods People were no ſooner owned to be ſo but they were ſoon oppreſſed; for how did <hi>Pharao</hi> (who proſeſſed that he <hi>knew not the Lord, nor would hear his voice, nor let the People go)</hi> begin his Reign, but by conſulting how to keep Gods People under by heavy Burthens, and hard Task-maſters: but when that ſucceeded not, the more they were vext, the more they increaſed; he adds to the former cruelty a Charge; that the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes</hi> ſhould kill all the Males of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in their birth; but neither did this prodigious cruelty prove ſo ſucceſsful as he deſired; For the Text tells us, that the <hi>Midwifes feared God, and did not as the King Commanded them; but preſerved alive the Men Children,</hi> Exod: 1. 17. and therefore tranſported by rage as one that had loſt Humanity itſelf, he makes a more publick and general Law, charging all his People that <hi>every Man child that was born, they ſhould caſt into the River, and Drown if,</hi> V. 22. With what ſury and violence, after he had made them weary of their lives by ſundry oppreſſions, did he purſue them into the very bottom of the Seas? thinking its like, that God had devided the waters for no other end then for him to pitch his Field in, againſt his own People: Its plain if God had not taken him off, he had never taken his rod off the <hi>Iſraelits:</hi> If we ſhould after him, look upon <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> that wretched <hi>Idolater,</hi> who did evil in the ſight of the Lord, after the abomination of the Heathens, he built the high places which his good Father <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; he erected Altars for them, and that in the Courts of the Lord, all which was attended with ſuch Barbarous and Diſpiteful waſting and oppreſſing of the Church of God, that it is ſaid in the 2 of <hi>Kings,</hi> 21. 16. that <hi>Manaſſes ſhed Innocent blood exceeding much, till he repleniſht Jeruſalem from corner to corner</hi> We might likwiſe reflect upon <hi>Haman</hi> that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63746:5"/>
Tyrant; the Text tells you <hi>Eſt.</hi> 3, 6. that being full of wrath againſt <hi>Mordecay</hi> for not bowing unto him, he thought it to little to lay hands only on <hi>Mordecay,</hi> but thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the <hi>Jews</hi> that were throughout the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ahaſueras,</hi> and for this purpoſe procured letters from the King, which he ſent into all the Provinces, to Root out, to Kill, and to Deſtroy all the <hi>Jewes, both young and old Children, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in one day. Eſt.</hi> 5. 15. I might further inſtance in <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> that Monſter of men, for his horrible Idolatry, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Cruelty againſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> called <hi>Epimanes,</hi> in both which he ſo raged, that never was the like ſince there began to be a Nation till that time, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us in Chap. 12. 1. What ſhall I ſpeak of the Tyrany and Cruelty of thoſe Heathen Roman Emperors, within the firſt 300 years after Chriſt? by whom, not only the Apoſtles themſelves ſuffered Death, but whoſoever made any profeſſion of their Doctrine, were moſt ignominouſly tormented; no reſpect had of Sex, or reverence of Age, ſo that the Hiſtorie of thoſe times ſeem to be writ in blood, of which thoſe Monſters of nature in the ſhape of men, made ſuch effuſion; that we read the dead bodies of Men, Women, and Children, old and young together were caſt out, and lay naked in the Streets, like the pavement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; And indeed that enmity put by God himſelf between the ſeed of the Serpent, and the ſeed of the Woman, ſeems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate as much, which <hi>David</hi> ſound in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 38. 19, 20. <hi>They that render me evil for good are mine adverſaries, becauſe I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the thing that God is;</hi> this ſpightful wrath was kindled in them agaiſt him, becauſe of his Religion and Piety, with which their corruption could admit no accord; as <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his brother becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous, ſo our Saviour tells us in <hi>John</hi> 7. 7. <hi>The world hateth me becauſe I teſtifie of it,</hi> that the deeds therof are evil; and that his Diſciples might not be ſurprized when they meet with the like uſage, he forwarns them in <hi>John</hi> 15. 19. <hi>If you were of the world the</hi>

It were endleſs to recite their dealings this way, whereby it would appear that a great part of their Religion is but a Miſtery of Iniquity, a bundle of Pollicy, which hath brought, and held moſt Kingdoms and Countryes in Europe within the ſnare and Bondage of a ſilly Fryer; and that by the pretended Sanctity, lying Miracles, falſe Donations, forged Writings, and the like. What Potentate could ever lay the Foundation of Obedience in Conſcience? or could overcome his Enemy without War by a Parchment Bull? or maintain himſelf and his pomp, at all Mens coſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions? or conquer oppoſite Princes, by their own Subjects? or ſtabliſh himſelf by Diſpenſing with unlawful Marriages, or lawful Oaths, or maintain ſo many Intelligences by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſſions?

By theſe and the like Poſitions which they maintain, we plainly ſee how they diſolve all Bands of humane Fellowſhip, and ſtrangle the very Vitalls of all Society; But amongſt many, many more, there is one yet remaining, the moſt peſtilential of all, to wit, that <hi>no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> and that all Proteſtants are Hereticks, being condemned by the Pope and Council of <hi>Trent</hi> as ſuch, and ſo are fallen from the Faith, and forfeit all priviledges where keeping of Faith with them, might ſtead them or oblige others. I confeſs indeed I have ſeen a little Book written by one of them, who denieth this, aſſirming that Papiſts eſteem themſelves Obliged to keep Faith even with Inſidels; but this is an ordinary Stratagem of theirs, to profeſs to abhor Jeſuitical Tenets to lull us aſleep, to get their Wickedneſs acted with leſs Suſpition. Amongſt many Inſtances that might be given, I ſhall give one in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, ſo ſoon as the Pope perceived, that She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in earneſt, to ſhake off the Romiſh Yoke, and that all his ſlattery, and ſmooth dealing, could not reduce Her to his Obedience, (She refuſing to permit his <hi>Nuncio</hi> to enter Her Kingdom) he falls to his old courſes, and in the Year. 1569: Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 5th. Excomunicates Her, Abſolving all her Subjects from their Obedience; Curſing all that ſhould any longer ſubmit to Her, giving Her Kingdom, to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſends over his Bull againſt into <hi>England,</hi> which ſome Seminary Prieſts there, admired, and Extolled, and Blaſphemouſly aſſerted, that it was Indited by the Holy Ghoſt; yet preſently after they ſet out a Book on purpoſe, to lull the Queen and State aſleep and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Papiſts of <hi>England,</hi> not to practiſe any miſchief upon the Queen, becauſe Catholicks might uſe no other Arms but Prayers, Tears, Watching, and Faſtings againſt their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; And yet in the mean time, theſe very Men, never reſted Plotting one Treaſon after another; and <hi>Watſon</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſts, who writ againſt this Book, were the deſperate

Propounders and Ringleaders, of that Treaſon againſt King <hi>James</hi> and Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> at his firſt coming into <hi>England,</hi> for which he with <hi>Clarke</hi> ſuffered the reward of Traytors; So that they are not to be believed, for they will ſay any thing, maintaine any Aſſertion, that may tend to the advancement of their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But for your farther ſatisfaction to prove the truth of this, and ſhew you that their practice is ſutable to this principle (let them aſert what they will) who knows not that <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> upon the Emperors promiſe, and Letters of ſafe Conduct appeared before the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, when they had them there, they Condemned them to the fire, and accordingly burnt them, which the Emperor highly reſenting, the Council declared; He was not obliged to keep his promiſe to them: Becauſe no Faith is to be kept with <hi>Hereticks.</hi> In Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> time in <hi>England,</hi> our own Chronicles tells us, the <hi>Suffolk</hi> men did aid, aſſiſt, and advance Her to the Crown; She ſwearing to them, that they ſhould enjoy the Liberty of the Proteſtant Religion.

            <p>And to make them the ſurer, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are obliged to inculcate their Principles of Treaſon, into their Profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and to ſtir them up, upon all occaſions, to act it: As will be evident to any, who will but read the Rules of <hi>Ignatius Loyala</hi> the Father of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and how far do they extend their Vow of biind Obedience? even to the killing of Kings, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63746:9"/>
raiſing of Treaſons and Rebellions, where ever they can have acceſs? In order to which, their great work is to corrupt the Judgments of their followers, and Inſtruments of Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination and Treaſon, with poyſonous Poſitions, touching the nature of ſuch Arts; and bribe their Conſciences, with ſtrong baits of Reward and Glory, propoſed to all that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch deſperate Attempts, which is a ſtrong incentive to them; for Men that are either ſenſible of Religion, or deſirous of Glory, will eaſily be induc'd to any Attempts, which is pronounc'd, not only Lawful, but Noble and Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious too, eſpecially if it be for the advancment of their Religion. And their Church-mens perſwaſions, are the more forcible, by reaſon of the great Influence they have over Papiſts of both Sexes, and the Power they exerciſe over their Conſciences, and the eſteem and honour they have among them, which makes them more apt to drink down any poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Principle that they inſuſe; and ſo under pretence of Religion, they at their pleaſure, involve them in deſperate Treaſon; for whether will they not lead them? by Advancing the Popes Authority over all, <hi>inordine ad Spiritualia?</hi> and by telling them, that the Proteſtants, are a pack of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and damnable <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which all <hi>Catholicks</hi> are to look upon as ſuch, and ought to proſecute them, as the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall Command, and Direct.</p>
            <p>It would be too redious, to ſhew, how often, and with what arguments they have excited their Followers, to Treaſons and Rebellion; for what Rewards have been promiſed to Traytors, if they do the deed, and what Glory of <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> they purchaſe in Heaven, in caſe they miſcarry, is better known, then I can declare, I ſhall only mind you of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and never to be forgotten, <hi>William-Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Grandfather of Ours, (and the beſt of Kings) It pleaſed God to make uſe of Him (as his Grandſon amongſt us) to deliver the <hi>Netherlands</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyranny, and <hi>Popiſh</hi>

            <p>But we need not rove abroad, for Foreign inſtances, nor for practices, ſuitable to theſe Principles, need we go any farther, then the horrid Matchleſs, and Bloody Deſign of this Day, ſuch a <hi>Miſchievous thing</hi> as the preſent age may well admire, the future age will hardly belive, and no former age can parallel a Treaſon and Cruelty ſo matchleſs, as no name can fit it; a Plot ſo odious, a Tragedy ſo direfull, a Wickedneſs ſo incomparable; nay ſuch a piece of Deviliſhneſs it ſelf in the abſtract; that the actors (if it had been effected) would not have own'd it, but as <hi>Nero,</hi> after he had ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, fathered it on the Chriſtians, ſo had they prepared a Proclamation, to caſt it on the <hi>Puritans,</hi> under which title they would have revenged it, by the Maſſacre of all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Land, within their reach.</p>

            <p>But what was it, that could poſſibly have provok'd them to ſuch a deviliſh and bloody attempt? was it any hard uſage, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the King or State; were they hurried to the fire, as in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes? or was there a new Inquiſition, erected after the manner of <hi>Spain,</hi> with Racks, and Tortures to rectifie them? no, ſo far from this, that they were tollerated to enjoy their Liberties and Poſſeſſions, grac'd with Titles of Honour, living ſecurely under the protection of the Kings Laws, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt violence offered to any of them, and yet all this, and more then this was too little to oblige them, when the good of the Catholick Cauſe came in competition; ſtrange! that any thing that's called Religion, ſhould be made a Cloak for ſuch Bloody, Treacherous, and Atheiſtical Practices; and yet ſaith <hi>Faux,</hi> it was meerly, and only for Religion, and he was bound in Conſcience to do it, becauſe the King was an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;</hi> And ſo much for the firſt thing, <hi>they imagined a miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous device.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond follows, but <hi>they are not able to perform,</hi> which in other words we have delivered thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let the wicked Deſign what they will, and Plot what they can; yet they ſhall not be able to accompliſh their deſire, or deſign;</hi> and to go no farther then our ſelves; have not we ever ſince the Reformation found it ſo? have any of their wicked Projects, or Plots, which ſince that time have been continually forging, taken any expected ſucceſs, have any of their <hi>Armados,</hi> or <hi>Powder Plots,</hi> any of their <hi>Bulls,</hi> or <hi>Curſes,</hi> any of their late and great endeavours attain'd the end they ſought after? if God, (as one obſerves) hath always defeated their malicious deſigns.

and ſhewed by his Judgments on the Actors how much he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts ſuch wicked practices, they might well gather, that their courſes are not warrantable, or as ſome of them in indignation have blundred out, <hi>that the Judge of all the world is become a Lutheran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we are (as the ſame Author expoſtulates) ſuch damnable <hi>Hereticks</hi> as they would make us, how comes it to paſs that God ſo takes our part?</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible that their Doctrine, that is ſo Catholick, or thoſe Catholicks that are guided by an Infallible Head, ſhould venture ſo far, and attain ſo little, profeſs ſuch Infallibility and be ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deceived; ſure if they were not given up to a ſpirit of deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch palpable tokers of Gods Judgments againſt their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſuch manifeſtations of his Mercy towards us, might breed at leaſt a ſuſpition in them that ſomething is a miſs, and force them to a ſerious Examination to know where the cauſe lyeth.</p>
            <p>They call much for a Judge of Controverſies between them and us, but why take they not notice, how God hath time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time, ſhewed himſelf a Righteous Judge pleading our cauſe, and preventing their Plots; but never more then in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Religion and our ſelves on this day, for never was Wickedneſs nearer being acted, nor more ſtrangely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, nor effectually defeated, then this was, ſo <hi>that the Pit they have dug for others, they have fallen into themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How near this work of darkneſs was to have been brought to a fiery light, judge you, it was not according to <hi>Jonas</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, forty days, nor four days, nor ſcarce ſo many houres one night betwixt; and but a part of that neither er'e the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blow had been given, and we deſtroyed; <hi>the hand of wickedneſs was ready to have done the work before it was known to be lifted up;</hi> the ſnare on our <hi>heels before it was diſcovered to be laid:</hi> we might well ſay had we known it, there was <hi>but a ſtep between death and us,</hi> all things were ſo ready, and we ſo near being

undone, that theſe wretched Conſpirators applaud themſelves in their pregnant hopes and believe all their own: The Letter ſaid, God and man was agreed to puniſh the wickedneſs of the times, but ſtay man was agreed, God was not, bleſſed be his Name, he was at, but not of their Council, he who is a preſent refuge ſtept in, trapping them in their own ſnare, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Juſtice, in detecting their Mallice; and indeed none but he could do it, not man but the Devil devis'd it, not man, but God defeated it, ſo that in this if in any thing the Lord was known as a juſt Judge Do but trace the ſeveral ſteps of the diſcovery and you will plainly ſee it was not, it could not be any other but God himſelf <hi>that ſnared them in their worke;</hi> and ſo brought it about by his wonderfull providence, that he makes theſe very Traytors to be the betrayers of themſelves.</p>
            <p>For the diſcovery was made but the night before, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of a monitory Letter written in an obſcure ſtile, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a Lackey (croſſing the ſtreet) to the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> ſon and Heir to the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> wherein he is deſired to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the Country, where he might expect the event with ſafety, for tho there be no appearance of any ſtir, yet I ſay they ſhall receive a terrible blow in this Parliament, and the danger is paſt ſo ſoon as you have burnt the Letter; which Letter my Lord <hi>Salisbury</hi> (who firſt carried it to the King) concluded to be an Idle Paper, deſign'd only to amuſe the Lord to whom it was written, or to make him the ſubject of ſome mirth, if upon it he ſhould abſent himſelf from the Parliament, the Principal words were, <hi>the danger is paſt as ſoon as you have burnt the Letter;</hi> this might ſeem a ſlight danger indeed, and not worth the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if it had not been meerly to amuſe one, but the King on the contrary from this very ſentence, devin'd the whole Truth of the matter, interpreting it thus: That the danger or blow intended to the Parliament, ſhould be paſt as ſoon, or as quickly, and in as ſhort a time as that Paper ſhould be blazing in the fire: So concluding it to be

ſomething of Powder, the Rooms under the Parliament were ſearched, and the whole Villany diſcovered and prevented, and that by as ſignal a Providence as is to be found in the Records of any Nation, and which is ſuch a mark of the Divine favour to us, and to our Church and Rellgion as can never be too much praiſed and admired by us, in our Annual Thankſgivings.</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you conſider, what was it that extorted the means of revealing this from his Pen, whoſe Tongue had ſworn Concealments, that made him who was Plotting the ruine of many, to conſult for the preſervation of one? not any innate pity in the Traytor, but the over-ruling Soveraignty of God.</p>
            <p>What was it that inclined the heart of that noble Lord, who affected their Religion, to communicate the Letter (which detected the Treaſon) to the King? not Popery, or carnal policy, but the all diſpoſing Providence of God: What was it that inſpir'd (I can call it no leſs) the breaſt of that Royal King, otherwiſe free from Jealouſie, as a badge of Tyrany to ſuſpect the danger, and by a violent unnatural conſtruction of a phraſe to find out the violent unnatural deſtruction that was hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? not ſo much his own prudence (tho otherwiſe great) but the wiſedom of the Almighty; What was it that infatuated the Traytors who while the Plot was but ſuſpected, had oppertunity to eſcape that they ſhould try the utmoſt, and afterwards ſharpned the edg of all mens ſpirits againſt them, to kill ſome and ſurpriſe the reſt, even before a Proclamation could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, but that juſt ſeverity of God: So that all the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God were concentred and met together in this days deliverance, and therefore <hi>not unto us, not unto us O Lord, but to thy name, be the glory of this and all our deliverances.</hi> for <hi>it is of the Lords Mercies that we were not conſumed: becauſe his compaſſions faild not:</hi> Lam. 3. 22. For <hi>if the Lord had not been in our ſide may we now well ſay, if the Lord had not been in our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, the had blewn us up quick, when their wrath</hi> and their match <hi>was kindled againſt us.</hi> Pſal. 124, 1, 2, 3,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:63746:13"/>
O let the Lords Mercy, and their Cruelty never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had their <hi>Paſcha,</hi> and <hi>Purim</hi> Holydays, ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for the acknowledgment of their grand deliverance from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Hamons</hi> Treaſon; ſo let this days ſolemnity be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with everlaſting thankfulneſs, for the miraculous diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Powder Plot; let the People learn from our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and our Children underſtand in our ſtreets, the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs of this deſign, the profeſſion of the Actors, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that would have fallen on their innocent heads, if the Lord in judgment to the contrivers, and in mercy to us, had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, and inſnared the wicked in the work of their own hands; and let us return all poſſible Praiſe and Thankſgiving, to him who on this day mercifully declared himſelf both the Protector of <hi>Sion,</hi> and a Detector of her Enemies. Who ſhould we praiſe if not God? and for what, if not for this? I may uſe St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> words <hi>quisquis non videt caecus eſt, quiſquis videt et non gaudet ingratus eſt,</hi> whoſoever beholds not both the mercy and ſeverity of God in this, is groſly blind; whoſoever beholds and rejoyceth not is ingratefully dumb.</p>
            <p>O happy fifth of <hi>November!</hi> wherein our Sun had been turned into blood, wherein our name had been changed into <hi>Ichabod,</hi> wherein had been ſet up again the abomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, but God for his own name ſake hath turned it into a glorious day, a Day of Joy and Gladneſs to all true hearted <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had this Monſter which was come to the birth been brought forth, <hi>England</hi>'s Funeral had been with them a new Feſtival; how had this Fact been extolled at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the <hi>Popes</hi> Calendar, as one of the moſt glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits that ever was attempted? How ſhould we then inſtead of this pure worſhip, theſe bleſſed opportunities we now enjoy, either have been plunged into groſs Superſtition, as adoring <hi>Images,</hi> turning over Beads, mumbling to Saints, wandring

in Pilgrimages, or elſe have been dragged to the Rack or Stake, the proper Engines of that <hi>Romiſh</hi> Cruelty.</p>
            <p>But that God <hi>who ſtill brings to light, the hidden things of darkneſs,</hi> and who hath from time to time delivered us from all the Malicious, Mercileſs, and Reſtleſs attempts of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, hath likwiſe blaſted this bloody deſign, ſo, that though <hi>they imagined a miſchievous device, yet they were not able to perform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude all: Let us beware of that Church, whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices are ſuch as you have now heard, and from whoſe growing and cruel Uſurpations, we have been ſo lately and providentially delivered.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay, or what can we do to manifeſt our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to him, who next (under God) was the Author of our deliverance; who ſo generouſly expoſed himſelf to preſerve us; and not only to him but to his Royal Conſort, our gracious Queen, to whom we are originally beholding for our miraculous eſcape from an inundation of Slavery and Popery, but under the auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conduct of a Sovereign truly meriting the Noble and Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Title, <hi>of King of men, and Shepherd of the People,</hi> and the yet more dignified addition, of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and (which is beyond that) amongſt us the <hi>reſtorer</hi> of it too: For had it not been for them, I verily believe that neither we, nor poſſibly this place, eſpecially in this decorum and luſtre, had been ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Syons ſtones had been pittied, and any have favoured the duſt thereof,</hi> ſo that ſhe did not ſink into eternal, and irrecove rable Ruines. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 102. 14.</p>
            <p>That our Church is not ſitting ſolitary like that Widow in the Lamentations, bemoaning her miſeries, and begging pitty of Paſſengers. <hi>Is it nothing to you all you that paſs by? behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which is done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his anger.</hi> Lam: 1. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63746:14"/>
That we have <hi>no leading into Captivity, no complaining in our Streets, but our eyes ſee Jeruſalem a quiet habitation, a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle that ſhall not be taken down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Deſigns, and Contrivances of unreaſonable men are diſcovered; their Purpoſes diſappointed, and their Arm broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That our Necks are not under perſecution, and we labouring without reſt, Servants ruling over</hi> us, <hi>while there is none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us out of their hands.</hi> Lam: Ch: 5. 5. 8.</p>
            <p>In a word, that we are not incomparably wretched, as miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as error and wickedneſs, as malice, or a miſguided Zeal can make us, is ſoelly and wholly (next under God, by and from them: To whom likwiſe (next under him,) we owe not only our Eſtates, our Quiet, our Plenty, our Liberty, but our very lives, I could not forbear enlarging upon this? but that I muſt not anticipate the day <note n="*" place="margin">being the 16th of this month ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed, a Day of So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemne Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing for our deliverance</note> which is at hand, and purpoſely deſigned for it: But while then, and always let us admire them, as the generous Redeemers of the true Reformed Religion, as the truly indulging Father and Mother of our Church and Country, and reſpect them as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did <hi>David, the light of our Iſrael,</hi> and as they did Joſiah <hi>the breath of our Noſtrils,</hi> the ſerious acknowledgment whereof, will not ſuffer us to be wanting in all ſubmiſſive obedience to them; whom God long continue over us, and let all that love the Peace, and happineſs of Church or State ſay <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
