            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IS only Necessary, at present, to let the Reader know, that tho the Moralist makes bold to Censure a certain Learned and Religious Pastor, for wasting his precious time, about the worst piece of Work (as most People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) that ever he took in hand, yet I must inform him, it was not the only Reason for setting his Morals against the others Arguments; nor, indeed, could that alone, give cause enough for the solid design of Morality, tho it might, for matter of Dispute and Argument. But to deal Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inely, there was a double reason for Writing this Satyr, first meeting with the Vindication of some Logical, Divine, and Historical Tracts, at first ill enough Stated, and then worse Resolv'd, especially by leaving the main mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unanswered, of which that Author is principally Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The reconciling the <hi>Case of Resistance</hi> with the Case of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> And in the second place, having the Misfortune, lately, to observe some, who pretend to be Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so Negligent of their Duty, and Careless of their great Office, that they are rather sit to be exposed as Scandals to their Holy Mother, than to serve at her Altars; particularly one, that I am sure will find himself out when he views this Page, and whom I could Uncase like a Rabbet, and shew his Hypocrisie bare and naked to the World, if the respect I had for some
<pb facs="tcp:47913:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others of the Reverend, and the Coat in general, did not, through good Manners, hinder my Intentions, for where I am sensible that a Preacher abounds in Malice, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, Pride, Lust, and Hipocrisie, 'tis very difficult for me, that profess my self a Satyrist, and know my self wrong'd, to spare him upon the account of good Breeding, or think him a good Teacher of the Congregation, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; that I, as well as others, have observ'd to make a whole Sermon for no other purpose but to influence a pretty young Gentlewoman how necessary it was for her Souls salvation to cleave to him and his feeling doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now what the rest of his Flock had to do with his Amours, I leave the Reader to judge, who I know will only laugh as the Lady did to see him make his Grimaces, and tell an Out-of-the-Way story, so little satisfactory to the People, and so very insignificant to her. I confess, I cannot well follow that Toping Country Vicars Advice, who bid me not do as he did, but do as he taught. For my own part, I love a good example, and such, to the great disgrace of the Church, 'tis believ'd, have been very much wanted of late; those that do show it, are not concern'd here, I'm sure, and those that do not, 'tis reason should have a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reprimand, for 'tis that which causes our Enemies to get so much ground, and makes Religion so little esteem'd; and 'tis this chiefly, not Malice nor Impiety, that has drawn this from the Pen of the Moralist.</p>
