         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whence ſprang this Epidemical <hi>Madneſs, Apoſtacy,</hi>

               <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> And
moſt true it is; for as in <hi>general</hi> our crying ſins pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

ſo there was ſomething in <hi>particular</hi> of Covetouſneſs,
Ambition, and cunning Malice which <hi>contrived</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>Not to touch upon thoſe <hi>State affairs</hi> which were

in the pleaſant bowres of our quiet ſolitude,
to ſit down and <hi>re-view</hi> that pretence of <hi>Divinity,</hi>
and regulating of our <hi>Conſciences,</hi> which plotted and
fomented our <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and put a <hi>gloſſe</hi> upon our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections.</hi>
To this purpoſe we finde in the Preface to
the Covenant, <q>
                  <hi>That the</hi> Noblemen, Barons, Knights,
Gentlemen, Citizens, Miniſters of the Goſpel, and
Commons of all ſorts in the Kingdoms of <hi>England,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> called to minde the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and bloudy Plots, Conſpiracies, Attempts, and
Practices of the enemies of God againſt the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and Profeſſors thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially in theſe
three Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how much their Rage,
Power, and Preſumptions were of late, and at that
time, increaſed and <hi>exerciſed.</hi>
               </q> But who were theſe
<hi>enemies? Papiſts:</hi> 'tis granted. But were theſe the
<hi>only enemies?</hi> Suppoſe they were (which yet cannot

be yielded) how muſt they be <hi>ſuppreſſed?</hi> By a <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
and Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant:</hi> for thus we
were taught by our Neighbour <hi>Nation.</hi> I need not
therefore enquire, Who <hi>compoſed</hi> our <hi>Covenant?</hi> or,
By what Authority it was <hi>Impoſed,</hi> and <hi>preſſed?</hi>
Let it ſuffice that This <hi>Covenant</hi> was concluded to be
<q>the <hi>way,</hi> and the <hi>only way</hi> to <hi>advance</hi> the glory of
God, and the Kingdom of Chriſt; the honour and
happineſs of the King, and his Poſterity; and the
true publick Liberty, Safety, and Peace of theſe
<hi>Kingdoms.</hi>
               </q> Here were indeed <hi>ſpecious Pretences;</hi>
and <hi>fair hopes,</hi> as full of <hi>confidence</hi> as the ſimple people
could be hugged and dandled with.</p>

My Noble, and much Honored

               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN this tempeſtuous ſeaſon (like that in <hi>Rome,</hi>
when as <hi>Livie</hi> relateth it <hi>rained bloud</hi> for
many dayes) the beſt counſell I can give is, That
you and all who are like you, (from whoſe Prayers
<hi>offered up with ſtrong cryes heaven ſuffereth
violence</hi>) would cry aloud with the Diſciples
(when the ſhip was covered with waves) <hi>Save us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 24, 25.</note>
               <hi>Maſter, we periſh:</hi> that ſo he being awaked by our
watchful devotion, may <hi>rebuke the winds and
the Seas,</hi> and reſtore unto us our former <hi>calm</hi> and
Halcyonian dayes. For particular directions how
to <hi>ſteer</hi> your courſe between the Rocks you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon which you are in danger to ſplit either your
Conſcience, if you enter into this New Covenant;
or your Eſtate, if you enter not into it; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect them from me. For though I have for
many years ſtudied the <hi>Compaſs</hi> of Gods word;
yet I am no Pilot. I have ever lived under the
<hi>hatches,</hi> and never ſate at <hi>helm</hi> in Church or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112895:10"/>
Common-wealth. And if I ſhould take upon me the
office of a <hi>Steerman;</hi> and you following my advice
ſhould miſcary; and be daſht in pieces, or ſunk in
your fortunes; in ſtead of <hi>thanks</hi> from you, I
were like to receive <hi>curſes</hi> from your family
and poſterity. Yea but I am (ſay you) a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of the myſteries of ſalvation; and it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of a <hi>Steward,</hi> that he be found <hi>faithful:</hi> and
I have ſuffered already for the teſtimony of a good
Conſcience; and therefore ought not for any fear
or terrour <hi>conceal</hi> my judgement, or <hi>ſtifle</hi> the
truth. I cannot deny my function; neither will I
betray my innocency; neither am I afraid of any
thing ſo much herein as this; That if you make me
your <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> your caſe will be ſoon like mine; and
by <hi>gaining</hi> the truth you will be a <hi>loſer.</hi> But I
check my ſelf in theſe thoughts with the words
of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 26.</note> 
               <hi>What will it advantage a man
to win the whole world, and loſe his own
ſoul?</hi> What will it avail the maſter of a Ship
to ſave his whole <hi>fraight,</hi> if he loſe that pretious
<hi>pearl</hi> which the rich Merchant ſold all that he
had to buy?<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 46.</note> This peerleſs <hi>pearl</hi> no <hi>plunderer</hi> can
rob us of: this affordeth me a comfortable light in
the thickeſt darkneſs of melancholy thoughts.
Save for this, I account my ſelf nothing <hi>worth</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:112895:10"/>
at all. No <hi>carbuncle</hi> (as your love overpriſeth me)
but a dead <hi>coal</hi> now reſolving into aſhes: and as
I <hi>lie hid in the dark,</hi> ſo I deſire from this
obſcure ſtate to <hi>ſteal</hi> into heaven; and in the
mean while <hi>Ita vivere ut nemo me vixiſſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat;</hi>
ſo to paſſe through theſe <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
ſeas, that none may diſcern the <hi>print of my
Keel.</hi> Notwithſtanding, becauſe you charge me ſo
deeply by all the <hi>ties</hi> of Chriſtian charity, which is
the <hi>bond</hi> of perfection; I will <hi>freely</hi> open my ſelf
concerning the <hi>Engagement</hi> of our Conſcience in
the New Covenant; and return you not ſo much a

            <p>In all thoſe Covenants the King had the main ſtroak, but
in this none at all.</p>
            <p>1. For the Covenant mentioned, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 3, 4 it comes
not home to our caſe; for that was a private Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two intimate friends, for the ſafety of both their
lives, ſought after by a bloudy Tyrant: this is a National
Covenant between two Kingdoms, for the Reforming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and ſetling Peace; that was made by the true King
appointed by God, and anointed before this by <hi>Samuel,</hi>
againſt him who indeed held the Crown, but was rejected by
God himſelf; this is a Covenant made by Subjects againſt the
Commands of a moſt gracious Prince.</p>
            <p>2. For the Covenant mentioned 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 5. the text
ſaith, <hi>King Joſiah</hi> made this Covenant, that they ſhould walk
after the Lord, and <hi>keep his Commandements, and his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and his Statutes with all their heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that he put
down the Chemarims,</hi> &amp;c. There the King makes a Covenant,
and reforms a Church, and not the People; here the People
enter into a Covenant without the King, and they take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, againſt his command, to <hi>Reform,</hi> or rather <hi>Deform</hi>
the Church, by overthrowing the Hierarchy, and aboliſhing
Epiſcopacy. <hi>Chius ad Choum,</hi> theſe things agree as well as
Harp and Harrow.</p>
            <p>3. For the Covenant mentioned 2 <hi>Chr. 15. 8, 9. King
Aſa</hi> gathered all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> together to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
where they offered to the Lord of the ſpoyles, and made
this Covenant, and in performance of this Oath or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
v. 16. <hi>he depoſed Maacah</hi> his mother from her <hi>Regency,</hi>
becauſe ſhe had made an Idoll in a grove, and <hi>Aſa brake
down</hi> her Idoll, and ſtampt it, and burned it at the brook
<hi>Kidron.</hi>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:112895:18"/>
4. For the example of <hi>Iſrael, 2 Chron.</hi> 30. who in the
dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though they were under another King,
yet joyned with the men of <hi>Judah</hi> in keeping the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
it yeilds no ſupport at all to their tottering cauſe.
For</p>
            <p>1. They entred not into any ſolemn League with the
men of <hi>Judah,</hi> though for the preſent they joyned with them
in a Religious duty commanded by the Law.</p>
            <p>2. What they did, they were invited to do by King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah;</hi>
whereas the <hi>Scotch</hi> are not invited to this League with
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the King.</p>
            <p>3. The King of <hi>Asſhur</hi> forbad not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to joyn
with their Brethren of <hi>Judah</hi> in keeping the Paſſover; but
the King forbids any of his Subjects to enter into this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>4 The King who Reigned over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was an
Idolater; but our King is a worſhiper of the true God.
And albeit, in ſome caſe and quarrel, the worſhipers of the
true God may joyn with their Brethren of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in another Kingdom, in a Defenſive League (though
the King being an Idolater, ſhould forbid it) yet it follows
not, that they may do ſo without the conſent, and againſt
the command of a Chriſtian Prince, who is a profeſſor of the
true Religion.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> beſides the invitation of King <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
to keep a ſolemn Paſſeover with the <hi>Jews,</hi> had the
expreſs command of God himſelf; whereas neither <hi>Engliſh</hi>
nor <hi>Scotch</hi> have any command from God expreſly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly,
to enter into this League for the Defence of the
Proteſtant Religion againſt Papiſt without the King, the
King himſelf undertaking, and that by moſt ſolemn Oathes
and Proteſtations to defend the ſame.</p>
            <p>5. For the Covenant mentioned <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 3. that was
meerly to remove a Scandal from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to fulfil
the expreſs command of God, for putting away ſtrange
wives, ſet down in the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> in which caſe no man
doubteth but a Covenant may be made not only without,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112895:18"/>
but againſt the commandement of a Prince. Yet here the
<hi>Jews</hi> (beſides the command of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the Viceroy) had
the approbation of the <hi>Prince</hi> for making this <hi>Covenant:</hi>
for the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> at this time favoured the <hi>Jews;</hi> and
contributed largely to the reedifying of the Temple; and
gave order to <hi>Ezra</hi> the Prieſt to adorn the houſe of God,
and perform all things in his ſervice according to the Law,
Ezra 7. 10.</p>
            <p>The laſt example <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 5. is leaſt to our preſent
purpoſe: for the Angel there made no <hi>Covenant,</hi> but
only <hi>ſware</hi> by the living God, that <hi>time ſhould be no more.</hi>
It is true he <hi>lifted up his hand;</hi> yet that no way helpeth the
Covenanters cauſe: for that might be a fit geſture in an
Angel menacing a fatal doom to the world, and the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating</hi>
of all time; which yet may not be thought ſo fit a
geſture for men entring into a holy <hi>League</hi> for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of two Kingdoms. If they can, as the Angel did,
ſtand upon the earth and the ſea at the ſame time; let them
alſo further imitate the Angel in <hi>lifting up their hands to
heaven,</hi> when they make their <hi>Covenant.</hi> Howſoever for the
<hi>geſture</hi> we will not contend with them: I think it fitter
in taking this Oath, then after the uſuall manner, to <hi>lay the
hand upon the Bible;</hi> for this <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> hath no
ground or foundation at all in that book: and the <hi>lifting
up</hi> of the <hi>hand</hi> very well expreſſeth the purport of this
<hi>Covenant,</hi> which is a <hi>lifting up</hi> of their <hi>hands againſt the Lords
anointed,</hi> and his <hi>Church:</hi> yet under pretence of <hi>defence</hi> of
the <hi>Kings perſon,</hi> never ſo much <hi>endangered</hi> as by their
<hi>Armies;</hi> and of <hi>Religion,</hi> never ſo <hi>profaned</hi> as by their
<hi>Reformadoes;</hi> and of the <hi>liberties</hi> of <hi>Subjects,</hi> never ſo much
<hi>infringed</hi> as by <hi>arbitrary votes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we take this <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>reformation,</hi> we muſt deſire
a <hi>reformation</hi> of the <hi>Oath:</hi> for it is full of <hi>ambiguities</hi> and
<hi>contradictions:</hi> whence I thus frame a fifth argument.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 5. No <hi>ambiguous Oath</hi> ought to be taken, or <hi>Covenant</hi> ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:

to engage the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> in a <hi>firm League</hi> with the

God ordained to propagate the Goſpel.</q> Go and <hi>teach</hi>

               <p>OUr Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> deſire a Reſolution
from this Aſſembly, concerning the Neceſſity
and Lawfulneſs of entring into this New League:
and how can we reſolve them, if we be not reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
our ſelves, as ſome of us are not? I ſhall
therefore humbly offer to your ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Whether it be not fit to qualifie the word
<hi>Prelacy,</hi> when it is ranked with <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi>
after this manner; I will endeavour the
extirpation of Popery, and all Antichriſtian, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical,
or Independent Prelacy? for otherwiſe
by abjuring Prelacy, abſolutely ſome of us <hi>ſhall
ſwear</hi> to <hi>forſwear our ſelves.</hi> For Prelacy, as alſo
Hierarchy, in the former and better ages of the
Church were taken in the better part; Hierarchy
ſignifying nothing but a holy Rule or Government;
and Prelacy the preeminence of one in the Church
above another. Prelation is a <hi>relatio diſquipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiae,</hi>
and <hi>Praelati</hi> are <hi>Relati</hi> to thoſe over whom
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:112895:31"/>
they are ſet; who may be either the flock, or the
Paſtors themſelves. If the Flock, in that ſenſe all
that have charge of ſouls may be truly called <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati,
viz. Gregi;</hi> for they are ſet over them to be
their Over-ſeers and Spiritual Rulers, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 28.
1 <hi>Pet. 5. 2. Heb. 13. 17, 24. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 17. In this
ſenſe both St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> take the word;
<hi>Praelati non quae ſua ſunt, ſed quae Domini, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:
&amp; non Paſtores, ſed Impoſtores; non Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores,
ſed Seductores; non Praelati, ſed Pilati:</hi> let
Prelates not ſeek their own, but thoſe things which
are the Lords; <hi>now a dayes we have</hi> not Teachers,
but Seducers; not Shepherds, but Deceivers; not
Prelates, but <hi>Pilats:</hi> in which ſentence, Teachers,
Paſtors, and Prelates are ranged together, as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the ſame perſons: In which elegant <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanaclaſis</hi>
you hear that Doctors, Paſtors, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
are a kind of <hi>Synonyma</hi>'s. In this ſenſe if we
condemn Prelates, and Vote their Exterpation; we
ſhall with one breath blow all the Divines that have
cure of Souls, not only out of this Aſſembly, but
out of their Parſonages, and Vicaridges alſo. But if
<hi>Praelati</hi> are here in this Covenant taken in reference
to Paſtors themſelves, and Miniſters of the Goſpel;
and thereby ſuch are meant only who are <hi>Praepoſiti
clero,</hi> ſet over Clergy-men themſelves, as having
not only ſome precedency to, but authority over
the reſt: neither in this ſenſe may we piouſly ſwear
the Eradication of them. For there are Claſſes in
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> Intendents and Super-intendents in
<hi>Germany;</hi> Preſidents in the Reformed Synods in
<hi>France;</hi> and Maſters, Provoſts, and Heads of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:112895:31"/>
and Hals in our Univerſities, who have a
kind of Prelacy, and Authority over the Fellows and
Students, whereof the major part are Divines, and
in holy Orders. Here I conceive it will be ſaid, That
none of theſe are aimed at; but only <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
already baniſhed out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And Prelates
indeed they are in a more eminent degree; and if
Prelacy be reſtrained to them, it is Epiſcopacy that
is principally ſhot at; to the Extirpation whereof I
dare not yield my Vote or Suffrage, leſt this New
Oath intangle me in perjury. For both my ſelf, and
all who have received Orders in this Kingdom by
the Impoſition of Epiſcopal hands, have freely En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
our ſelves by Oath to obey our Ordinary, and
to ſubmit to his godly Judgement, and in all things
lawful and honeſt to receive his Commands. If then
we now ſwear to endeavour the Aboliſhing of
Epiſcopacy, we Swear to Renounce our Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

is a plant, either ſet in the Church by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or their immediate Succeſſors in the firſt and beſt ages
of the Church; and is it agreeable to Piety to ſwear the
Extirpation of ſuch a plant?</p>
            <p>4. It cannot be denyed, that when the Church moſt
flouriſhed, and was of far larger extent then now it is, over
the face of the Chriſtian World; there was no<note n="*" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Nice.</hi> Can. 5. Conc. <hi>Antioch,</hi> Can. 6. Concil. <hi>Sard.</hi> Can. 14.

then Epiſcopacy regulated by Divine precepts, and
Eccleſiaſtical Canons: and ſhall we ſwear to Extirpate that
Government under the which the Church moſt thrived and
ſlouriſhed? Shall we ſwear againſt our Prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> for the
rooting out of that, upon which we are enjoyned to pray
God <hi>to pour down the dew of his bleſſing?</hi> Surely the dew of
heaven burns not the root of any Plant upon earth, but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
it and makes it grow.</p>
            <p>5. They were Biſhops who had the chiefeſt hand, firſt in
the plantation of Chriſtian Religion in the dayes of <hi>Lutius,</hi>
King of <hi>Britan;</hi> and after in the reſtitution in the dayes of
<hi>Etheldred</hi> King of <hi>Kent;</hi> and in the Reformation of it in
the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:112895:33"/>
it a Religious act to eradicate that Government and Power
which both planted and pruned Religion it ſelf?</p>
            <p>6. Chriſt died not <hi>inteſtate;</hi> he made his laſt Will and
Teſtament, and by it bequeathed many Legacies to his
Church; and among them not onely Catholike Doctrine,
but Diſcipline alſo. This Diſcipline, if it be not Epiſcopal
Government moderated by Evangelical and Apoſtolical
Rules, the whole Church is guilty of the loſſe of a Sacred
and Precious Jewel; for certain it is out of Records of all
ages of the Church, that no other was ever retained or can
be found ſave this, before the Religious Reformer and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> having baniſhed their Popiſh Biſhops,
were after a ſort neceſſitated to draw a new Plat-forme of
Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline by Lay-Elders. Chriſt, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
teacheth us, <hi>was faithfull in the houſe of God,</hi> as <hi>Moſes:</hi> and
if <hi>Moſes,</hi> after his forty dayes ſpeech with God on the
Mount, received a Patern from God and delivered it to the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> not only of Doctrine but of Dicipline alſo, which
continued till Chriſts coming in the fleſh; it cannot be
conceived, but that Chriſt left a Pattern of Government to
his Church, to continue till the end of the world: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
his Apoſtles with whom he converſed forty dayes after
his Reſurection, ſpeaking of thoſe things which appertain to
the kingdom of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 1. delivered that to the Church
which they received from their Maſter. What Government
or Diſcipline was that? There can be conceived but three
formes of Government; Epiſcopal, moſt conformable to
Monarchy; Presbyterial to Ariſtocracy, and Independent as
they tearm it, to Democracy. Presbyterial or Independent
it could not be, for Presbyterial is no Elder then the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the Independent no Elder then <hi>New-England;</hi> whereas Epiſcopal Government hath been time
out of mind, not in one but in all Churches. A and ſith it was
not firſt conſtituted by any Sanction of a General Counſel,
it follows neceſſarily, according to St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it muſt needs be an Apoſtolical Inſtitution. For
what not one Church, but all Churches, not in one age, but

Councels which all conſiſted of Biſhops, Epiſcopacy it ſelf
is almoſt in every Canon and Sanction either Aſſerted or
Regulated</p>
            <p>10. Next to the Primitive Church, we owe a reverend
reſpect to the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas; who
either have Biſhops, as in <hi>Poland, Tranſilvania, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>

Qu.<note place="margin">See <hi>Art. 36. &amp; l. de Conſecrat.</hi> It is evident to all men reading holy Scriptures and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors, that from the Apoſtles time there have been theſe three Orders in the Church of Chriſt, and that a Biſhop ought to correct and puniſh ſuch as are unquiet, criminous and diſobedient within his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, according to ſuch authority as he hath by the word of God.</note>

unrepealed Acts, in which Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Government is either related
unto, or regulated and confirmed in
ſuch ſort, that quite to aboliſh
and extirpate it would bring a
confuſion, and make a ſtop as well
in Secular as Eccleſiaſtical Courts?
And therefore our zealous Reformers, if they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
not too good to be adviſed by the Great Counſellor,
ought to take heed how they raſhly and unadviſedly pluck up
the tares, as they eſteem them, of holy Canons and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Laws, <hi>ne ſimul eradicent &amp; triticum,</hi> leſt together with
thoſe tares (as they count them) they pluck up by the roots
the good wheat of many profitable and wholeſome Laws of
the Common-wealth and Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>12. But if the Authority of both Houſes could ſoon cure
theſe ſores in precedent Acts of Parliament, yet how will
they make up the breaches in the Conſciences of all thoſe,
who in the late Proteſtation and this New Covenant, have
taken a Solemn Oath to maintain the Priviledges of the
Members of Parliament, and the Liberties of the Subject? The
moſt Authentical evidence whereof, are <hi>Charta Magna,</hi> and
the Petitionof Right; in both which the Rights of the Church
and Priviledges of Epiſcopal Sees, are ſet down in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
in Capital Letters.</p>
            <p>13. To ſtrain this ſtring a little higher, the power of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Congedeliers,</hi> together with the inveſtitute of Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Biſhops, and Collation of Deanries, and Prebends,
with a ſetled Revenue from the Firſt-fruits and Tenths there,
is one of the <hi>faireſt flowers in the</hi> Kings Crown; and to rob the
imperial Diadem of it (conſidering the King is a Perſon moſt
Sacred) is Sacriledge in a high degree; and not Sacriledge
only, but Perjury alſo in all thoſe who attempt it. For all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:112895:35"/>
Graduates in the Univerſity, and men of Ranck and Quality in
the Common-wealth, who are admitted to any place of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Authority or Truſt, take the Oath of Supremacy,
whereby they are bound to defend and Propugne all Pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences,
Authorities, and Prerogatives annexed to the
Imperial Crown; whereof this is known to be one inherent
in the King, as he is Supreme head of the Church within his
Realms, and Defender of the Faith.</p>
            <p>14. Yet for all this, admit that Reaſon of State ſhould
inforce the Extirpation of Epiſcopacy thus rooted, as it hath
been ſaid, both in the Royal Prerogative and Priviledge of
the Subject, and in the Laws of the Land; it is a golden
Maxim of Law, <hi>Poſſumus quod jure poſſumus,</hi> we can do no
more then lawfully we may. If Epiſcopal Government muſt
be overthrown, it muſt be done in a
lawful way: not by Popular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
but by a Bill paſſed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and that to be tendered to
his Majeſty for his Royal Aſſent.
And how ſuch a Bill can be preſſed
upon his Majeſty, who hath taken
an Oath<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Firſt it is ſaid, That Epiſcopal Government is inconvenient
and miſchievous, and prejudicial to the State: but it was
never proved to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Admit ſome good proof could be brought of it;

            <head>His Majeſties Proclamation, forbidding the Tendring

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS</hi> We have lately ſeen a Vow or
Covenant pretended to be taken by ſome
Members of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby after the taking notice
of a Popiſh and Traiterous Plot for the
ſubverſion of the true Reformed Prote
ſtant Religion, and the Liberty of the Subiect and to
ſurprize the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſtr,</hi> They do
promiſe and covenant according to their utmoſt power
to aſſiſt the Forces pretended to be raiſed and continued
by both Houſes of Parliament, againſt the Forces rai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
by Vs, and to aſſiſt all other perſons that ſhall take
the ſaid Oath, in what they ſhall do in purſuance
thereof; which Oath as the ſame hath been taken
without the leaſt colour or ground, the Contrivers
thereof well knowing that there is no popiſh Army
<pb facs="tcp:112895:39"/>
within this Kingdom, that We are ſo far from giving
countenance to that Religion, that We have alwayes
given, and alwayes offered Our conſent to any Act for
the ſuppreſſion of Popery, and the growth thereof; and
that the Army raiſed by Vs is in truth for the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
defence of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion
eſtabliſhed by Law, the Liberty and Property of the
Subiect, and Our own Iuſt Rights according to
Law; all which being ſetled and ſubmitted to or ſuch
a free and peaceable Convention in Parliament being
provided for, that the ſame might be ſetled, We have
offered and are ſtill ready to Disband our Armies:
and as the ſaid Oath was deviſed only to prevent
Peace, and to pre-engage the Votes of the Members of
both Houſes (directly contrary to the Freedom and
Liberty of Parliament) and to engage them and Our
good Subiects in the maintenance of this horrid and
odious Rebellion; ſo it is directly contrary, as well to
their natural Duty as to the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy eſtabliſhed by Law, which obliges them to
bear to Vs Truth and Faith of Life, Members and
Earthly Honour, and to defend Vs to the utmoſt of
their powers againſt all Conſpiracies and Attempts
whatſoever, which ſhall be made againſt Our Perſon,
Our Crown and Dignity and to do their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to diſcloſe and make known to Vs all Treaſons
and Traiterous Conſpiracies which ſhall be againſt
Vs and to their power to aſſiſt and defend all Iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Priviledges, Preheminences and Authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Vs, or united and annexed to the Imperial
Crown of this Realm. And whereas We are informed,
that ſome deſperate ſeditious perſons do endeavour
to perſwade and ſeduce others of Our good Subiects
to take the ſaith Oath, thereby to engage them and
<pb facs="tcp:112895:39"/>
this Kingdom into a continuanee of theſe miſerable
and bloudy diſtempers, We do therefore out of Grace
and Compaſſion to our people, and that they may not
by any craft or violence ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced
againſt their Duty and Conſcience, warn them of their
natural Allegiance, and their Obligations by Oaths
lawfully adminiſtred to them, and wiſh them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the great Bleſſings of God in peace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which the whole Kingdom hath received, whilſt
that Duty and thoſe Oaths were carefully obſerved,
and the unſpeakable miſeries and calamities they
have ſuffered in the breaking and violation thereof.
And we do ſtraitly Charge and Command Our loving
Subiects of what degree and quality ſoever, upon
their Allegiance, that they preſume not to take the ſaid
Seditious and Traiterous Vow or Covenant, which
endeavours to withdraw them from their natural Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
which they owe unto Vs, and to which they
are or ought to be ſworn, and are bound by the known
Laws of the Land, albeit they are not ſworn, and
engages them in Acts of High Treaſon by the expreſs
letter of the Statute of the <hi>25th.</hi> Year of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the third. And We do likewiſe hereby forbid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
all Our Subiects to impoſe adminiſter or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſaid Oath or Covenant: And if notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this Our Gracious Proclamation any perſon
ſhall preſume to impoſe, tender, or take the ſaid Vow
or Covenant, We ſhall proceed againſt him or them
with all ſeverity according to the known Laws of the
Land.</p>
