            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Tis true they were, but ſuppoſing that preſently upon that, ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident falls out, a Witneſs is taken ſick, and be feign to be carried a way, or for any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable cauſe, it ſhould be thought fit by the Court to diſcharge the Jury of it, that they ſhould not paſs upon your life, are you in Jeopardy then?</p>

               <p>I would have you be ſatisfied with reaſon, and the courſe of Law that other mens lives are under, as well as yours. The Oath the Jury take, is that they ſhall well and truly try, and true deliverance make of ſuch Priſoners, as they ſhall have in charge, the charge of the Jury is not full, till the Court give them a charge at the laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evidence had, and becauſe there was a miſtake in your caſe, that the evidence was not ſo full as might be, the Jury, before ever they conſidered concerning you at all, they were diſcharged, and ſo you were not in Jeopardy, and I in my experience know it to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten done, and tis the courſe of Law, the Clerks will tell you tis frequently done here and at other places; and this is not the ſame Indictment, and it contains further matter, then that you pleaded to before. And then if you will make this Plea good that you go upon, you muſt alledge a Record, and ſhew ſome Record to make it good, and that cannot be, becauſe there is none, &amp; ſo it will ſignifie nothing to you, as you have pleaded it.</p>

               <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> there is no entry made upon it, and the reaſon is becauſe there was no Tryal, and there was no Tryal, becauſe there was no Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Acquittal, if there had been, then you had ſaid ſomething.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, it is only in the diſcretion of the Court. For if a man be indicted for murder, and ſome accident ſhould happen, (when the Witneſs come to prove it) that he ſhould be taken ill, and ſo be carried away, ſhould the murtherer eſcape?</p>

And tho I muſt tell you, that it is now almoſt</hi> 100 <hi>years ago ſince that Statute was made againſt Prieſts coming into England, Yet Examples have been very rare that any of this ſort of Men have dyed for their Religion, within that Queens time, or any of her Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; yet they have dyed upon worſe accompts, and upon ſuch accompts as they are now brought to this Bar for, Such is the difference between their Religion and Ours, they have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to live here under a Law by which they ought to dye. They kill the Proteſtants by Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, without Law or Juſtice, witneſs their Bloody doing at</hi> Mirendol, <hi>Their Maſſacre as</hi> Paris, <hi>Their Barbarous cruelty in</hi> Ireland, <hi>ſince the year</hi> 1640. <hi>And thoſe in</hi> Piedmont <hi>ſince</hi> 1650. <hi>But theſe are not the crimes they are charged with, they are not accuſed for their Religion, but for the blackeſt and darkeſt Treaſon that men can be charged with. They are charged with an endeavour to Murder the King, under whoſe protection they lived, This mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King hath been carried on in the Deſign of it, with all the malice and Reſolution that can be from the firſt time that we can give you an account of it, which was the</hi> 24th. <hi>of</hi> April 1678. <hi>When theſe perſons and ſeveral others, did firſt Aſſemble about other matters of their own, and among the reſt to Murther the King: there they came to Reſolution that it ſhould be done, and perſons were appointed to do it, theſe were</hi> Grove <hi>and</hi> Pickering, <hi>who have been Executed for it; They were to kill the King in St.</hi> Jame's-<hi>Park but it pleaſed God, that the Flint of the Piſtol failed, to which we are more beholding than to them that he eſcaped that time. They were not ſatisfiyd with that, but they ſend down Four Butchers to murther him at</hi> Windſor, <hi>who being diſappointed, they ſent down Others after that to Murther him at</hi> New-Market; <hi>and when all theſe failed, they had Recourſe to that Treacherous and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmanly way of Poyſoning him, and hired one ſo to do, and they did not only intend to Murther the King, but to make it good by force when they had done. They intended to raiſe an Army; they had got Commiſſions to ſeveral perſons in the Kingdom to command theſe Forces. They deſigned to raiſe</hi> 50000 <hi>men to maintain the Injuſtice when then they had done it. And that was not all, they had a recourſe to Forreign aſſiſtance, and depended upon Forreign ſuccours, if they were not made good at home. Gentlemen, they have been diſappointed in all theſe things; they had an intention further (as I find it in my brief,) to make a general Maſſacre of all Proteſtants here. A thing that they have done, and we have heard of abroad, but thanks be to God, we never knew it Experimentally at home. And I hope God that hath preſerved us hitherto, will preſerve us ſtill.</hi>

               <p>The priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> was made &amp; conſtituted Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſo as it was publickly known to us in the month of <hi>December</hi> laſt was 12 month, &amp; he did Order by Vertue of his Authority one Father <hi>George Conyers,</hi> to preach in the Sodality of the Engliſh Seminary, on the Holyday which they call St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> i. e. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Beckets</hi> day, in which there was Order given that Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> ſhould Preach &amp; aſſert this Doctrine; That the Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy were Heretical, Antichriſtian &amp; Devilliſh: accordingly this Order was Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutted, and the Sermon preached.

               <p>Where <hi>I</hi> have occaſion <hi>I</hi> will name them, my Lord. Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Harcourt</hi> were together at <hi>Wildhouſe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kaines</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blundell,</hi> and as near as I remember, Mr. <hi>Langworth</hi> was there, but I wont be poſitive. And there lay before them at <hi>Wildhouſe</hi> Fourſcore pounds, the moſt of that money was <hi>Guineys,</hi> which was to be paid to the four <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ruſſians that were to murther the King at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> After it was agreed that they ſhould do it, and <hi>Coleman</hi> who was executed came thither, and gave the meſſenger a Guiney to expedite the journey. We drew off from <hi>Wildhouſe,</hi> and went to Maſter <hi>Harcourts</hi> chamber, and becauſe Maſter <hi>Harcourt</hi> had there left his papers that were to be ſent down to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> there he paid the meſſenger the money. And, that Gentleman was preſent there, Mr. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> and this is another part of <hi>Auguſt</hi>'s buſineſs. No ſooner was this meſſenger diſpatch'd but within a day after or a day before; but it was a day after, as near as I can remember, there was a Conſult held at the Benedictines Convent, at which Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> was preſent and Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and there they had ſome more <hi>Iriſh</hi> news from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Talbot,</hi> who did give an account of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, how they did conſpire the death of the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>; and deſired to know how affairs went in <hi>England,</hi> and deſired ſome Commiſſions might be ſent over to ſome particular perſons, there to raiſe Forces for the carrying on of the Deſign, and ſome money to be tranſmitted to them. And Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> did bring the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Wildhouſe</hi> (as near as I remember) but he did bring them with him, and ſent them down by a ſpecial meſſenger to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and ſome Letters by the Poſt. That of the Poſt I know of my own knowledge, but that of the ſpecial meſſenger I had only from his own mouth. My Lord, from the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> as near as <hi>I</hi> remember it fell of a <hi>Saturday, Bartholomew</hi> day it was, but whether it fell of a <hi>Saturday</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be poſitive, but if the Court pleaſe to inform themſelves of it by their <hi>Almanacks,</hi> they may.</p>

               <p>The 1ſt. or 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> we received a Letter (in the beginning it was) from <hi>Mr. Whitebread,</hi> and this Letter they did ſay was a Foreign Letter, and yet it paid but 2 pence, by which <hi>I</hi> did conclude that <hi>Mr. Whitebread</hi> was come into <hi>England,</hi> and lay ſome where privately, or was not yet come to Town. On the third of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember I</hi> went to <hi>Mr. Whitebreads</hi> chamber (at night) but he being at ſupper was not to be ſpoken with; but when he ſaw me the next morning, he did revile me and ſtrike me, and asked me with what face <hi>I</hi> could look upon him, ſeeing <hi>I</hi> had dealt ſo treacherouſly with them. Now after that <hi>I</hi> had inquired in what reſpect, he anſwered in the diſcovering of the buſineſs, for there was a Gentleman that went to the King in this Buſineſs, to whom I had communicated much of my Information by Dr. <hi>Tongue.</hi> This Gentleman had the ſame coloured cloaths that I had, and ſo they not being able to give an account of the Name of the perſon, gave only an account of the Habit he was in, and therefore they charged me with it. After I had juſtified my ſelf as well as I could, <hi>Mr. Whiebread</hi> did ſhew me a Letter which came from one <hi>Beddingfield,</hi> alias <hi>Benningfield,</hi> which did ſhew the Plot was diſcovered, and they were like to be undone, if it had not been for the five Letters that were ſent down to <hi>Windſor</hi> and intercepted, which made all to be looked upon as counterfeit; after that, I juſtified my ſelf as well as <hi>I</hi> could. He told me he would be friends with me, provided <hi>I</hi> would give an account of the party, and of the Miniſter that went with him. And this is what I have to ſay againſt <hi>Mr. Whitebread,</hi> and the priſoners at the Bar; but only this: becauſe Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> did not accept of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> that was propoſed to him to poyſon the King, this Gentleman offered that 5000 <hi>l.</hi> more ſhould be added.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps a man will venture to write more than he will Swear; not that he does Write what he does not believe, but that he knows he ought to be more cautious in his Oath, than in his Affirmation.</p>

                  <hi>My</hi> Lord with your Lordſhips favour, it is upon Oath.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fenwick</hi> you are in a Court of Law, and we muſt go according to the Law, if you will prove any contradiction in him to his Oath, you muſt bring the perſons here that ſaw him take the Oath; and you muſt not think to take a Pamphlet for Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

               <p>It was Sworn before a Juſtice of Peace, and will not, I ſuppoſe, be denied, and therefore he muſt make his Evidence agree with it, being part of his Narrative.</p>

               <p>He ſays he ſaw you in Town when <hi>Aſhby</hi> was in Town, which was towards the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> or beginning of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> He cannot tell exactly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but poſitively he ſays before <hi>Mr. Aſhby</hi> went to the <hi>Bath.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt. North,</speaker>
               <p>Well, to ſatisfie you, we will ask Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> the Queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Can you recollect whether it was the middle or latter end of <hi>July?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, as near as I can remember, it was about the middle of <hi>July</hi> that <hi>Aſhby</hi> came to Town, and he did not ſtay in Town above a Fortnight. And it was whilſt he was in Town, and deſigned to go down to the <hi>Bath,</hi> That this Gentleman came to Town, and gave accompt of the particulars of that Letter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt. North,</speaker>
               <p>You may ask him any Queſtions, but I would have you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what accompt he gives, That about the middle of <hi>July, Aſhby</hi> came to Town, that he ſtaied in Town about a fortnight as he believes, that during that time, you came to Town, and then was this Diſcourſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>During that time I ſaw him in Town, but I know not exactly when it was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gavan,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I would ask him one Queſtion, the thing that is brought againſt me, is this, He ſays <hi>Mr. Aſhby</hi> came to Town in the middle of <hi>July</hi>; that he ſtayed in Town a fortnight; that while he was there I came to Town and had ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Now my Lord, <hi>I</hi> deſire to know whether it was the firſt week or laſt week that <hi>Aſhby</hi> was in Town that he ſaw me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>If he can anſwer it, let him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>My</hi> Lord, I cannot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>He tells you he cannot charge his memory with it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, nor will not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Really I believe there is ſcarce one in all this company able to give an accompt of a particular time of a paſſage ſo long ago.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gavan.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt he hath an excellent memory.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>And if he had not ſome memorials of this, he could not do it. And though he hath memorials of the moſt eminent paſſages, yet we cannot ſuppoſe he hath of all circumſtances.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gavan,</speaker>
               <p>But this is the ſubſtance; and your Lorſhip may conceive that not without Reaſon I urge it; for if <hi>Mr. Aſhby</hi> came to Town the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and ſtayed but a fortnight in Town, and I came to Town while he was here, it muſt be in one of the two laſt weeks. Now I would have it aſſertain'd, becauſe <hi>I</hi> may diſprove it in one week or in the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true you did not amiſs in asking the Queſtion, if he were able to anſwer it; but if it be either, it is enough to prove you Guilty.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35679:11"/>
and Ile tell it you by a particular circumſtance, that I ſaw you in the afternoon when you were a little illiſh, and there was a cordial brought to you by an Apothecary, that went by the name of <hi>Walpoole.</hi>

               <p>My Lord <hi>I</hi> have at ſome Conſulations heard ſpeak of it, but the chief thing that they aimed at was firſt, there was a letter that came out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and came through <hi>Mr. Harcouort</hi>'s hands, and ſo came down into the Country, to prove that it was the Opinion of them at <hi>Paris,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> to fling all this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that is, the Death of the King, That if any thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould happen, they ſhould be ready to give the firſt Alarum, and give out, That it was thoſe ſtill <hi>King-killing Presbytorians,</hi> that had done the Fact: And ſo they thought they ſhould eaſily have brought in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> party into their Company to revenge themſelves of the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>It</hi> was prity Adviſe indeed, to have it firſt laid on the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they might get <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to join and cut them off, and then their own Throats ſhould be cut.</p>

               <p>mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> you know very well, that when Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was laſt in the Country laſt year, you were to ſend him the Anſwers that came by letters from Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> and thoſe were ſent down to my Lord <hi>Aſtons,</hi> and I ſaw them, eight of thoſe letters, I am ſure. And I can prove it by one circumſtance, two of them came relating to Mr. <hi>Edward Aſtons</hi> death, from <hi>Paris</hi>; I intercepted them, and talking of it, that I could conjure, and tell of the death of Mr. <hi>Edward Aſton,</hi> before any of his Friends knew of it. And Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> writ a chiding letter about it, that he had not heard it ſooner, and you ſent down word, That you did write thoſe letters, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <speaker>Harcourt,</speaker>
               <p>This Gentleman does pretend to know my hand, and 'tis true, I have writ ſeveral letters for Mr. <hi>Ewers,</hi> and directed to him; but as to this time he ſpeaks of I have left off writing for divers years. He pretends to know me, and yet this Gentleman before the Committee of Commons in Parliament, which was yeſterday was 5 weeks, as well as he knew my hand, came and ſaid <hi>I</hi> was a Gentleman he did not know. He came alſo to entrap me at the Gatehouſe before thoſe Gentlemen of the Committee of the Houſe of Commons; but becauſe he ſaid he knew my hand ſo very well, and teſtifie, thoſe expreſſions in the letter, I muſt ſay this, I never did write any ſuch letter, nor did I ever in my life ſeem to approve of any mans death or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But the thing is this, he pretends to know my hand, and to prove it, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen deſired me to write my own hand and my name, and he in the mean time did withdraw; and three of them did write their names, &amp; afterwards they called him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and asked him which was <hi>Harcourts</hi> hand, &amp; he was not able to ſay which it was.</p>

               <p>My Lord if your Lordſhip pleaſe, I was moſt part of the Summer in the Country, I came into <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> about the 29th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> My Lord, there is a Gentleman, one Mr. <hi>Sanbidge,</hi> that is a Kinſman of my Lord <hi>Aſtons,</hi> that was very well acquainted with the Family where I was, which was half a mile off my Lords, and uſed to come and play with me at Tables. <hi>My</hi> Lord, at that very time in <hi>October</hi> he came to me, and there ſays he, Do you hear nothing of a Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where you live, that is killed? or to that effect. No, ſaid I, and I had Letters yeſterday, and heard nothing of if. Saith he, I was this morning at <hi>Elds,</hi> and there a Girl of the Houſe told me, <hi>Mr. Dugdale</hi> had been there, and reported, that there was a Juſtice of Peace of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was killed; but who he ſhould be <hi>I</hi> never heard named, and on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday following my Letters brought it down to me.</p>

               <p>it was Tueſday morning, (as I remember) and that by very good cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, I went that day for <hi>Lichfield,</hi> the Saturday after the News came to me to <hi>Lichfield,</hi> that Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi> was found murthered.</p>

               <p>The Jury will do well to obſerve this in point of time, Sir <hi>Edmundbury-God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> was kill'd, as it was ſince proved, a Saturday, but on Munday he was miſſed, on Thurſday he was found, and on Saturday the News was ſpread all over the Country. Now ſaid he, the Tueſday before the news came down, which muſt be the Tueſday after the Saturday he was killed, one comes from the Alehouſe, and asks, do you not hear of a Juſtice of Peace at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> that is killed? for the Wench at yonder Alehouſe ſaies Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was here this morning, and reported that ſuch an one was killed: So that it is moſt Notorious, as any thing in the World can be, that this thing was known to them, before any of us knew what was become of him.</p>

But I remember particularly the firſt information <hi>Mr. Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> gave in the Country, came to my couſins hands from the Mayor of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and I happen'd to ſee him, I think it was <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day. It came incloſed in a letter upon the apprehenſion of Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> I remember I met him, and he told me of it, and ſaid he, the Parliament did nor ſit that day: ſo he went to acquaint the Lord Lieutenant of the County, that is, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> with it, who carried it to the King. But when Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was ſent for, my couſin went down, and writ me a good character of him. As ſoon as ever <hi>Dugdale</hi> came to Town, before he went to be examined by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as I remember, I went with ſome Gentlemen to ſpeak with him, and ſaid I to him, can you ſay any thing about Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Death? Said he, I remember ſuch a Letter came at ſuch a time from Father <hi>Harcourt,</hi> to Father <hi>Ewers,</hi> wherein were theſe words; <hi>This Night Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfrey <hi>is diſpatched</hi>: And ſaid he, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I asked the Queſtion of <hi>Ewers Is not this likely to ſpoil all the deſign</hi>?

Upon this I went to <hi>Mr. Dugdale's</hi> Chamber, and there ſaid I to him, What was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you were not produced as an Evidence, at the Tryal of Sir <hi>Edmonbury Godfrey's,</hi> murtherers? Said I, you told ſuch a thing, and I hope you told Truth, for I don't hear that you have ever contradicted it, that you ſaw a Letter about the monday after he was murthered. In my judgment it is very material, if you have ſworn it; If your depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be true, or elſe you did ill to report it. Said I, pray let me ſee the Copy of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſworn before the Council.

                  <hi>My,</hi> Lord, I do not queſtion but Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt me my refuſing to give in Evidence againſt them at the former Tryal, but I think that there are ſome upon your Honourable Bench, that can make my Apology for not giving in all my Evidence aginſt them then; for it was not convenient, becauſe it would have ſtopt a Deſign I was then upon, and could not get off from, that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Mr. <hi>Reading,</hi> whom I was then treating with, for Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> as well as the Lords in the Tower, and he told me that he would depend upon my confidence &amp; Juſtice as to the Lords, according as I did deal with theſe men; if I brought them off, he would believe &amp; the Lords in the Tower believe that I would bring them off too. So that I did make an Apology them in the Court, that I could not ſafely ſay all that I had to ſay at that time. Some of the Juſtices I believe do remember it, and in that which I did give in againſt them, I did not ſay all nor half that I could have ſaid.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Bedloe,</speaker>
               <p>I will anſwer that matter to the Court, but 'tis the meaſure they always take to intrap the Witneſſe; for now <hi>I</hi> am out of a country that will give me an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and diſpenſation to ſpeak exactly to a day or an hour; as their <hi>St. Omers</hi> Witneſſes have.</p>

               <p>I did then ſay that I did ſee M. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and he hath been in ſeveral conſultations for the carrying on of the plot; but then I did it with a caution, that I never heard of Mr. <hi>Whitebread.</hi> that he was ſo very much concerned; and indeed I had no reaſon to ſay ſo, becauſe I heard him my ſelf, and could not well ſpeak from the hearſay of another. And as for <hi>Mr. Fenwicke,</hi> I never heard him give in any Anſwer; but I have ſeen <hi>Fenwick,</hi> at the Conſult there.</p>

               <speaker>M. Bedloe,</speaker>
               <p>For killing the King. But <hi>Pickering</hi> had been diſciplined before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Check from the Superiors, becauſe he had been negligent, and ſlipt many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Whitebread,</hi> 'Tis not one word that is relyed upon, for the buſineſs is purſued. 'Tis not ſaid <hi>pray meet at ſuch a time,</hi> but <hi>be careful you do not diſcover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi>; If it had been only ſaid ſo, it would have been a ſtrain to have made this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a ſingle word, to make this that Deſign, but as it is here we make no ſuch Conſtruction; <hi>It</hi> had been hard indeed to put that meaning upon it as you do even then, for tis ſeldom ſo uſed, for no man writes after that manner; but when it follows in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſenſe of ſo many lines, <hi>be ſure you meet on the</hi> 24<hi>th. of</hi> April, <hi>the day after St.</hi> Georges <hi>day, but come not too ſoon to Town, nor appear to much about the Town, for fear of Diſcovering the Deſign, which you know in its own Nature does require Secreſy:</hi> Can we make any ſuch Interpretation of it? <hi>If</hi> you have no better Arguments than theſe, you muſt have people loſe their underſtandings, or have a very blind obedience to yours, or it will never down. Ay, Come mr. <hi>Gaven,</hi> how do you ſay is the meaning of this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven,</speaker>
               <p>For my part <hi>I</hi>'le aſſure your Lordſhip I was not there, but this is known to all the Chriſtian World, that there is ſuch a meeting in <hi>Spain, France, Germany</hi> &amp;c. that wherever the Jeſuits are, once in three years they have a meeting among themſelves for the ſetling of their Affairs. Indeed the words have given your Lordſhip an occaſion to raiſe a Difficulty what the word <hi>Deſign</hi> ſhould mean, which I do give this Anſwer to Your Lordſhips Difficulty is, that the word deſign here ſhould not be made uſe of to ſend one poor Jeſuit to <hi>Rome.</hi> my Lord do but mark the end of the Congregation, and you will ſay to us that we might well uſe that word, becauſe the word may import ſome great buſineſs of Concernments now what buſineſs of greater concernment for poor Religious men to meet together about, than thoſe things that may promote their better ſtate in another world, and the Regulation of what is amiſs in their Order, my Lord, upon my Conſcience and Salvation this was the end of the Congregation, to meet and ſee what is amiſs in the Order, who do their duties, and who not, who are irregular in their Offices, and whoſe Office is vacant and to be ſupplied.</p>

               <speaker>Gaven.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore my Lord, as to the word [<hi>Deſign</hi>] it concerning the whole ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good of the whole body of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuits, it might well be uſed for the Conſultation of that Body, about all their good, Temporal and Spiritual, which was all concerned in it.</p>

               <p>Now, my Lord, for the ſecond thing that you Object, your Lordſhip remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers very well, that the Continuation of the ſenſe in ſo many lines made the thing the

more ſuſpitious, that more was intended by it than ſo: Now to this I ſhall be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if there can be given a particular reaſon why we ſhould ad that word of Secreſy to the other of Deſign, having Anſwered to the one part, we now give an anſwer to the other, and ſo to the whole. Now my Lord, becauſe of the time, the Parliament was then ſitting, and that we might not offend the King and all Civil Magiſtrates (whom we honour from our hearts and Souls) that word was uſed that it might be kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It</hi> was not out of Love to the Parliament, it was the <hi>nature of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it,</hi> nor was it out of any fear you had of them. <hi>I</hi> did never find, though you are as good at it as ever any I met with (for I never met with a Prieſt that had much more underſtanding) but really you do not Anſwer me. You are ſo far from Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and arguing like ſuch, that you do not maintain the matter with common and rational underſtanding, but only heap up ſo many vain words (like a Rope of Sand put together) which hath no natural Coherence, for you cannot poſſibley make this reaſonable, that the people ſhould have ſo much Caution, that they ſhould have not come too long to Town beforehand.</p>

               <p>You can make nothing of it, and you will find it an hard task to Anſwer it; for if half the Evidence that hath been given were not given, yet this Letter of your own, which cannot be denyed, is an unanſwerable proof. It does monſtrouſly confirm Mr. <hi>Oats</hi>'s Teſtimony to be undeniable as to the meeting at the Conſult; for he, four or five dayes before hand, comes and tells the Council the very day which five or ſix days after this Letter makes good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is found in <hi>Harcourts</hi> Cuſtody. Then there was a Conſulation upon the day, the very day that Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> ſays, and what he calls a Conſultation, your own Letter ſays is a Deſign.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> would appeal to your ſelves and all here preſent, what the natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſuch a Letter is, whether it does not carry a matter more than ordinary; whether its natural Intendment doth not look at that? And the next thing is this, does any man write plainer then this, when they write of a thing that is of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Is not the Danger too great to hazard that fact, which they call the nature of the thing, to intruſt it in a Letter? <hi>Is</hi> it not vain to put that in a Letter in words at length, which they, to whom it is writ, know what the thing means? And if it ſhould be further known than they would have it, the thing could never be done? And if you conſider the perſon that write<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, a Jeſuit or a Prieſt, are Prieſts ever plain? And will you expect plainneſs here, when, in things of Ten thouſand times leſs moment,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35679:20"/>
they don't write plainer? Is it not known, you have not a Proſelyte, that you do not keep under Obligations as cloſe as your Confeſſion are? Have you not taken here as it is ſworn, a Sacrament of Secreſie? <hi>Is</hi> there a woman that you convert but in the Dark? Or a Papiſt made out of a Preiſt's hole?

                  <hi>Worthy Sir, I know not from whence it proceeds, but I perceive that both your Letters and mine have bad fortune by the way; for my corroſpondents with you complain, they hear not from me, whereas</hi> I <hi>write conſtantly intire Pacquets; and ſince the Bills</hi> I <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from your ſelf for</hi> Sr. William Goring, <hi>and for</hi> Mr. Ireland, <hi>from Mr.</hi> Shelly, <hi>I have not had one letter but that</hi> I <hi>received this week, which in part made recompence for the former, for it brought me three of yours, and one of</hi> Mr. Ireland<hi>'s for which</hi> I <hi>render you many hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thanks, and acknowledge the fifteen pounds from my Lord</hi> Caſtlemain, <hi>though Mr.</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>made no mention of it in his.

               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>

               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, that which I have to ſay for my ſelf is this, I thank God, my Lord, I am not afraid of death; but I ſhould be very loth to die unjuſtly, and I hope your Lordſhip will conſider, that every mans blood is dear to him, and is concerned for his own life to preſerve it, he ought to be allowed liberty and freedom to preſerve himſelf as much as he can. Life is a thing not to be thrown away, but charily to be lookt after, and that there is ſuch a thing as taking away mens lives by Perjury as well as by a Knife or Piſtol, is without contradiction. Now whoever comes againſt a man for his life, I ſuppoſe he is to be looked upon not only by the Priſoner, but alſo by the Jury and the Court, that he ought to be <hi>Probus Teſtis,</hi> and a man fit to be admitted to be a Witneſs. Now I have ſomething to offer, That <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> is not any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Your Lordſhip was pleaſed to ſay, That he was the perſon who proved the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign mentioned in the Letter that was read. Now I hope your Lordſhip will give me leave (and I hope I may do it without offence to this Court) to ſay that he is perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in what he ſays.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>You mean that his Evidence is falſe, you may do it if you can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>He ſays he came over hither, and was here preſent the 24th of <hi>April</hi> with me, and that I did appoint him to do ſuch and ſuch things, and diſcovered the whole buſineſs to him. Now I deſire your Lordſhip would be pleaſed to conſider whether this were probable, and whether I had not been a very much miſtaken man all this while to truſt a man with ſuch a buſineſs, and whether I ought not rather to be ſent to <hi>Bedlam</hi> than <hi>Newgate</hi> for truſting ſuch a man as he, whom by his own confeſſion I never ſaw till that time. 'Tis not rational that a man would truſt him; and then, my Lord, that this buſineſs ſhould be diſcovered to him, a man that depended wholly upon us to live, and had no livelihood but what he had from us, who maintained him at St. <hi>Omers</hi> long as well as the beſt man in the houſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Did you do it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, I did.</p>

               <speaker>Whitebread.</speaker>
               <p>I, that is, when I came to the Office, and I and my Predeceſſors. When I was Superiour I found him not a fit man for that purpoſe and deſign he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. He was very zealous to be entertained amongſt us, and therefore I deſired him to abſent himſelf.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Why was he not fit to be employed among you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread.</speaker>
               <p>For ſeveral reaſons of our own: Firſt of all it was doubtful, whether he was a good Catholick; for he had oftentimes maintained ſeveral Propoſitions that were not ſoundly Catholick: and then ſecondly, he led a very idle life, and he was not found a man we were obliged to accept of, and therefore we deſired him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. And to that purpoſe we furniſhed him, gave him a good Suit of Cloaths, and a Perriwig, and four pounds in his purſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he promiſed me to pay me again when he had ſold his Library, which he ſaid he had a very good one in <hi>London,</hi> but he never did. But that I ſhould be ſo ſtrangely overſeen and mad, as at the firſt ſight of ſuch a man a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this, to truſt him with ſuch a great intrigue as this was, and to write in ſuch a plain ſtrange manner, and ſend by Poſt to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> as your Lordſhip did and juſtly might wonder at, had been a madneſs. It was much that any man would write ſo plain of ſuch a thing. But then my Lord, the chief thing is this, That I hope your Lordſhip will give us leave to produce our Witneſſes to prove, that he was not from Saint <hi>Omers</hi> from the tenth of <hi>December</hi> till the 23d of <hi>June</hi> following, and never lay out of the Houſe but one night from <hi>December</hi> till <hi>June.</hi>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Is it ſo great a wonder that you ſhould take into your Confidence and Conſultation that man, whom for a conſiderable time before you had maintained abroad?</p>

               <p>But my Lord, I ſuppoſe there is ſome difference between charitable acts to a man in want and a Scholar, and truſting him with ſuch an intrigue as this.</p>

               <p>Pray my Lord, be pleaſed to take notice, that this mans Evidence all along is, that he ſaw ſuch and ſuch letters from ſuch and ſuch perſons. They have no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence but juſt that they ſaw ſuch and ſuch letters, and how is it poſſible that a man who was turned away from Saint <hi>Omers</hi> for his miſdemenours, that I ſhould ſhew all my letters? Now my Lord, I have had a thouſand letters taken from me, not any of theſe letters had any thing of Treaſon in them, or ſoliciting of perſons to come into <hi>England,</hi> let the letters be produced, and then your Lordſhip will ſee what is in them, All the Evidence that is given comes but to this there is but ſaying &amp; ſwearing I defie them all to give one probable Reaſon to ſatisfie any reaſonable unintereſſed man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judgment how this could be.</p>

               <p>You ſay there is nothing but ſaying &amp; ſwearing, but you do not conſider what you ſay in that matter. All the Evidence and all the Teſtimony in all Tryals is by ſwearing. A man come; and ſwears that he ſaw ſuch a Bond ſealed, or heard ſuch
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35679:22"/>
words ſpoken, this is ſaying and ſwearing, but it is that proof that we go by, and by which all mens lives and fortunes are to be determined. But then, ſay you, 'tis won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that ſince they ſay they ſaw ſuch and ſuch letters, they ſhould not produce them; why? they did not belong to them: Ay, but then ſay you, 'tis ſtrange they ſhould not find one letter in all thoſe numerous papers that were taken that contains any trayterous matter; but I ſay, 'tis forty times more a wonder that one ſhould be taken, than for all the reſt to be undiſcovered. I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> amongſt thoſe Papers that he let be ſurpriſed did not think that letter that hath been read to have been of ſuch conſequence, nor the ſence of it to be ſo bad.</p>

               <p>I dreamt no more of my apprehenſion when I was taken, than the day of my death, it was ſo unexpected, nor what I ſhould be accuſed of: I had no fear of it, no thought of it, ſo that I took nothing out of the way.

               <p>My Lord, as to the going into the Infirmary at that time, I deny it.

but do not take notice of what Mediums you are to uſe. Say you, if <hi>I</hi> can but prove that he was there till after the conſult of the Jeſuits, that is the thing in Queſtion, and <hi>I</hi> need no more, but this is ſerving a turn only: Pray can you tell me what month he came to St. <hi>Omers?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cox,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he came thither in the month of <hi>December.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cox,</speaker>
               <p>He was never abſent from St. <hi>Omers</hi> out of the view of the Scholars, except one night that he went to <hi>Watton,</hi> and one day when he was in the Infirmary, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at that time he was ſeen by ſome of the Scholars.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cox,</speaker>
               <p>He was never abſent all the while.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cox,</speaker>
               <p>He ſayes he went away with Mr. <hi>Hilſley,</hi> but he did not, I can prove the contrary.</p>

               <speaker>L. <hi>C. J.</hi>

               <speaker>Cox.</speaker>
               <p>That is falſe, and I can prove it by this Circumſtance: one <hi>Mr. Conqueſt</hi> was to go for <hi>England</hi> that day, and he came into the Refectory, and told us a ſtory of this Mr. <hi>Conqueſts</hi> being unwilling to riſe in the morning to go for <hi>England.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>When was the time that Mr. <hi>Conqueſt</hi> went for <hi>England</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cox.</speaker>
               <p>In the month of <hi>May</hi> as we count.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cox.</speaker>
               <p>It was the fifth: and he ſays that Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nevill</hi> were in England with him, but I can teſtifie that they were not abſent, for one of them was my muſick-maſter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cox.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, but if I prove he was not in May in <hi>England</hi> it is ſufficient.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. <hi>C.</hi> J.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my word you deſerve a ſharp penance for running into that fault 2 or 3 times: you have done them no kindneſs in this matter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But you hear how he delivers his Evidence, 'tis as if he had been inſtructed, you muſt come and prove that <hi>Oates</hi> was not in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and that will do our buſineſs, for he tells you it is ſufficient, but we will have it proved to ſatisfie us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cox.</speaker>
               <p>But why ſhould I ſay more than <hi>I</hi> know?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You mean, more than you are inſtructed about. <hi>I</hi> only ask you one ſhort queſtion, Do you know when <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> left St <hi>Omers?</hi> Name the moneth.</p>

Now, my Lord, I have a Witneſs to prove that I was at that time at <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi> No body hath a right to ſit in the Congregation till he become a profeſſed Jeſuit, which at that time I was not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt. North.</speaker>
               <p>You might ſet your hand afterwards to it, if you were not there then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay you were then in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and might not you ſet your hand afterwards when you came to Town? I will tell you, Mr. <hi>Gaven,</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> they met, and had ſuch a Reſolution; you were then in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> might not you come to Town in <hi>July</hi> following, and ſet your hand to what was agreed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> before? And you cannot contradict him, but by ſhewing that all <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> you were not here: For if you prove your ſelf never ſo much to have been at <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhampton</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> that will not ſerve the turn. You ſeem to make a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this: All that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, is, that the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> he was preſent where there was a Conſult had about the death of the King, and divers perſons ſet their hands to the Reſolve. Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> afterwards was in Town, and then, ſays he I ſaw his hand ſet to the Conſult: I will not charge my memory to ſay he was preſent but I will tell you why I believe it was his Hand, becauſe I ſaw him draw a Bill of Exchange, and that was juſt like the ſame Hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven.</speaker>
               <p>Aye but, my Lord, I was not here in <hi>April.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>But this proves, in effect, that you ſet your hand to the thing afterwards. And now if you ſhould prove your ſelf never ſo plainly not to have been there in <hi>April,</hi> you do not come to the thing: it is ſtill a <hi>non liquet</hi> whether you were here in <hi>July</hi> or no. And <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> does not poſitively charge you as to <hi>April.</hi> Well, call your Witneſſes, and prove what you will.</p>

               <p>My meaning is this in plain Engliſh, to ask you plainly, and you ought in Conſcience to ſpeak the truth as much as if you were upon your Oath: for you are in the preſence of God, who will judge you as ſeverely for a falſhood in this Caſe, as in the other.

               <speaker>Winford.</speaker>
               <p>It was poſſible it might be ſo, but I am confident it was not, becauſe I uſed to order my maid to get him his Linnen ready upon any Journey, &amp; he had none now.</p>

               <p>My Lord, he took a Chamber to go into the Exerciſe; now, my Lord, he taking a Chamber on purpoſe for this very thing, he might pretend that, and come to <hi>London</hi> the while, and they not know it, becauſe he was ſhut up; for none are to come at them.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I know not any ſuch thing of him; but this is a Rule amongſt them, that when they are ſo ſhut up, if there be a neceſſary occaſion to come to them about any particular buſineſs, as ſending them Linnen or ſo, they have admittance to them.</p>

any kind of buſineſs, as carrying of the Linnen, and ſometimes a pair of Gloves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of his own, or ſometimes to ſpeak with him about buſineſs, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Winford.</speaker>
               <p>I do not believe he did: for he had no linnen with him, which he uſed to have, when he went to <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>Pray, my Lord, let me ſpeak; as I live, an innocent man will be loſt elſe. He ſays expreſly I was in Town in <hi>July</hi>; and gives this argument for it, That <hi>Mr. Aſhby</hi> was in Town, and he met me with him.</p>

But Miſtris, might not he in the beginning of <hi>July</hi> be abſent ſo long as a man might go to <hi>London</hi> and return again, in the firſt three weeks of <hi>July,</hi> I mean?</p>

               <p>My Lord, I cannot charge my memory, becauſe I did not know what I ſhould be asked, and ſo could not recollect my ſelf. I onely ſay I am confident of it, becauſe he always told me when he went ſuch a Journey, that I might make proviſion of Linnen to ſit him for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Your reaſons are weak, becauſe he uſed to tell you that you might get him linnen: men upon extraordinary occaſions do extraordinary things; ſo that you are not to govern your ſelf by what he uſed to do in his acquainting you, or you in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his linnen. This was no ordinary Errand, and therefore <hi>I</hi> don't ask you whether he had linnen from you or no; but you are onely to charge your ſelf with remembring whether he could not be abſent long enough out of your ſight to have been ſuch a Journey.</p>

               <speaker>Gaven.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, my Lord, give me fair play. He does charge it expreſly, and is preciſe to a day: He ſaith <hi>I</hi> was here in <hi>July</hi> after that <hi>Aſhby</hi> was come to Town, and before that he went out of Town: And he ſays that <hi>Aſhby</hi> came to Town in the middle of <hi>July,</hi> and went out of Town about the latter end of <hi>July</hi> or beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now, my Lord, I ſay this, he ſaying that <hi>Aſhby,</hi> came to Town the middle of <hi>July,</hi> and ſtaid there a fortnight, and then went to the Bath, &amp; that I came to Town while that he was there; if I prove that I was in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> from the 15th. or 16th of <hi>July</hi> to the end of the month, then I ſhall clear my ſelf evidently; for he does in effect charge me to be here ſome time in that fortnights time, and I prove that all the latter part of <hi>July I</hi> was in the country.</p>

            <sp>

that time Mr. <hi>Aſhby</hi> ſtaid in Town, mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> came to <hi>London:</hi> for I remember he ſaid he would go and ſee Father <hi>Aſhby,</hi> who was then at <hi>Wild-houſe.</hi>

                  <hi>My</hi> Lord, <hi>I</hi> will tell you; hear the words of an ingenuous man being as I was innocent, not knowing What they intended to charge me with, I in my mind run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all that I could imagine I had at any time done that they could lay hold on. If I had been guilty of any thing, my own conſcience would have told me of it; and I ſhould have provided to have given ſome Anſwer to it: but being innocent, I was to ranſack my memory to ſum up all the paſſages of my life, where I had been, what I had ſaid, what I had done, that would give them any occaſion of accuſing me. And becauſe I did imagine they might think I was here the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> I brought witneſſes for that; and becauſe <hi>I</hi> did imagine that they might ſpeak of ſome Conſults in <hi>April,</hi> I ſent up for ſuch witneſſes at my own charge, as could teſtifie where I was then.</p>

               <p>And now, my Lord I humbly caſt my ſelf upon the Honour and Juſtice of this Honourable and Juſt Court; to which I ſubmit my ſelf with all my heart and ſoul, haveing uſed all the remedies I can. I have cleared my ſelf as to the main day, the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> whereon all the pretended Plot lies: And I'le bring Witneſſes that ſhall ſwear I was not in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi>; and if my eternal Salvation lay upon it, I could averr I was not in <hi>London:</hi> and I wiſh I may be made an example of juſtice before all the world (in the ſight of God I ſpeak it) if I be not the moſt innocent perſon in the world, And, my Lord, ſeeing there is only his Oath for it, and my denial, I have onely one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: I don't know whether it be not an extravagant one or no; if it be, I don't deſire to have it granted.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven,</speaker>
               <p>You know that in the beginning of the Church (this learned and juſt Court muſt needs know that) that for one thouſand years together, it was a cuſtom, and grew to a conſtant law, for the Tryal of perſons accuſed of any capital Offence, where there was onely the accuſers Oath and the Accuſed's denial, for the priſoner to put himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tryal of <hi>Ordeal,</hi> to evidence his own Innocencie.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You are very fanciful, Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> you believe that your cunning in asking ſuch a thing, will take much with the auditory; but this is onely an artificial Varniſh: You may do this with hopes of haveing it take with thoſe that are Roman Catholicks, who are ſo ſuperſtitious as to believe Innocency upon ſuch deſires; but we have a plain way of underſtanding here in <hi>England,</hi> and that helpt very much by the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: ſo that there is ſcarce any Artifice big enough to impoſe upon us. You ask a thing that ſounds much of a pretence to innocencie, and that it would be a mighty ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if you ſhould miſcarry, becauſe you ask that you know you can't have. Our Eyes and our underſtandings are leſt us, though you do not leave their Underſtannings to your Proſelytes; but you are miſtaken, if you think to impoſe that upon us that you
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35679:33"/>
do upon them: and you do ſo impoſe upon them. But i'll tell you, there is ſcarce any man with us that can be a Papiſt: for you cannot deceive and gull us, as you have done all that you have perverted to your way.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven,</speaker>
               <p>Is it any harm, my Lord, to ask whether I might not be ſo tried?</p>

               <speaker>Witneſs,</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſpeak as to that; but in the laſt week in <hi>July</hi> he came to an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an houſe that I lived in.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I ſaw him my ſelf at the latter end of <hi>July</hi> for very many days, for he was in a Room of the houſe that I lived in, I am ſure, moſt of the laſt week.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I lived in the ſame Town with him, and I do not remember that he was out all <hi>July,</hi> but the laſt week he was in our houſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>So then he came home from <hi>London</hi> the 23<hi>th</hi> or 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July.</hi> Well Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> have you any more Witneſſes to any other purpoſe? for here are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven,</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> have you any Witneſſes to call?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wh,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have only this, and I deſire to be heard in this point, to prove that Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was miſtaken in his Evidence that he gave at the laſt Trial againſt Mr. <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L <hi>C.</hi> J</speaker>
               <p>Look you, I muſt break in upon you; you have been told ſo often, all of you have been told it, and yet you are upon the former Trials again. You are now upon your trial for your life, if you could have diſproved any thing that he ſaid at a former trial, you ſhould have taken a legal way and convicted him of perjury; but now to charge him with a printed Paper is not fair. You muſt ſpeak to what he ſays now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread.</speaker>
               <p>He ſays the ſame now. But all that I ſay is this, If he be not honeſt, he can be witneſs in no caſe. I ſuppoſe if any one can prove him not <hi>Probus Teſtis,</hi> his Teſtimony is not to be received in any caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>But how will you prove that? Come on, I'le teach you a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35679:33"/>
is the preſent debate here; for if you would convict him of any thing that he ſaid in <hi>Irelands</hi> Trial, we muſt try <hi>Irelands</hi> Cauſe over again. But if you will ſay any thing againſt what he ſays now, do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>That which I would alledg is this, If he be convicted of perjury in one caſe, he is not to be believed in another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay right, if he be convicted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>He is not only then an incompetent Witneſs, for he cannot be ſaid to be <hi>probus teſtis,</hi> but he is <hi>improbus.</hi> Now this is that I can prove.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Juſt. Pemberton,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Nay, you muſt ſhew it by a Record.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>You cannot have ſo little underſtanding, you that have been, and were to be ſo great a man among them, had been Provincial, and was to have been ſomewhat elſe. I have told you already, that to prove him to be a man that hath no faith in him he muſt be convicted. You muſt have indicted him, and convicted him, of the thing wherein he did commit perjury, and then he had been prepared to juſtifie himſelf. But ſhall you come now, and at this your Trial, and prove what he ſaid at <hi>Staleys</hi> Trial, and <hi>Colemans</hi> Trial, and <hi>Irelands</hi> Trial? And muſt we examine what matters have received a verdict and a judgment there? for conſider what will be the conſequence of it; if it ſhould be falſe, you there arraign a verdict. You ſhould have convicted him of the falſhood firſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>I deſire the Jury to take notice, that he does not ſtick to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he gave then, for if he does it was falſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>They muſt not take notice of any thing that was done at a former Trial, unleſs it be ſpoken of now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt. North,</speaker>
               <p>Do not call any Witneſſes to prove what he ſaid then, but to diſprove what he hath ſaid now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a pretty hard matter to make a Prieſt underſtand one, for what I ſee. If the Witneſs ſhall not gain credit with the Jury that he came over with Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Warner</hi>; if they are ſatisfied by thoſe many Witneſſes, ten or twelve at leaſt, that it is falſe, they ought not to believe him; but as to that Teſtimony they ought to believe your Witneſſes, but he is not preſently guilty of perjury: for if they ſhould not give <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>redit to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> you muſt indict him, and another Jury muſt paſs upon him before he is convicted: for it is one thing to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn and perjured, and another thing to be proved ſo; and he is not proved to be ſo, but by a Record for that purpoſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>They are no doubt good Witneſſes till they be proved otherwiſe, and they are left to the Jury to believe as they think fit.</p>

               <p>Now here are divers things that are brought againſt my ſelf by Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> Mr <hi>Oates,</hi> and Mr <hi>Dugdale</hi>; if the Witneſſes that I bring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, are not good Witneſſes, then I am in an hard caſe.</p>

               <p>Look then, you miſtake the thing; thoſe that are not Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, we do not hear at all; but our hearing them at all, proves that we look upon them as good Witneſſes. But when a man is a Witneſs, he is either of more credit, or of leſs credit, according to Circumſtances; and 'tis a proper queſtion to ask them, Whether they are <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks: but they are Witneſſes without all queſtion.</p>

               <p>That is an Objection that will not take away his Evidence, but only goes to the leſſening of the credit of it.

And whereas he hath ſworn he was here the 24<hi>th,</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> they have taken a great deal of pains by fifteen or ſixteen Witneſſes to prove that he was all the time at St <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

who he tells you come over in company with him, never ſtir'd from the places of their Reſidence, that this <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Watton,</hi> all that time: but this, Gentlemen, you muſt obſerve, that if <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> were out of the Caſe, all theſe perſons except Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> are proved guilty of the Treaſon they are charged with; and yet I ſhall ſet up his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and make him clear, notwithſtanding whatſoever hath been alledged againſt him Gentlemen, to take them in order, mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> hath mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> and mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> to prove him Guilty, let what will come of mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> all of them ſpeak to him.</p>

But then, my Lord, as to the reſt of the Witneſſes, here are a great many brought over to prove that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was all the while at Saint <hi>Omers</hi>; but I ſhall bring you a conſiderable number of Witneſſes to prove that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was then in <hi>London,</hi> and that all theſe perſons are miſtaken. They do all pitch upon the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> to fix it upon a time wherein he ſays he was here in Town: But Gentlemen, <hi>I</hi> hope you did obſerve, that as to other things and time that were not ſo neceſſary as to this matter, there they were pleaſed to miſtake, and to differ one from another, to contradict one another, for ſome of them ſaid he went away and leſt Saint <hi>Omers</hi> the tenth day of <hi>June,</hi> others the 23th, others, which was the ſame <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Gardiner, that he ſtaid till <hi>July.</hi> Truly half that variance in the time which is neceſſary would ſerve our turn, we are but for eight days time, that is, he was not above eight or ten days here, truly theſe Gentlemen will be ſure to ſpeak punctually to all thoſe eight days that hurt the Priſoners, but they will vary thirty days at another time that hurts them not. Why may they not be miſtaken as well with that portion of time, as they were in the other wherein they ſo much differed one from another?</p>
               <p>But I ſhall give you moſt infallible proof by and by, that <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> was in <hi>England</hi> at that time that he ſaid he was in <hi>England.</hi> My Lord, as to that of Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> truly we have ſent for a Witneſs, but we did not know of the Objection before; they have now brought you the Gardiner, and he did ſay poſitively at firſt that Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> was there all that while, but being asked again how he knew it, he ſaid it was the talk of the Countrey, and ſo ſome of the Witneſſes did ſpeak to Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton.</hi> But then I did deſire to know of theſe Witneſſes, whether theſe perſons were never abſent from theſe places or not, they told me they were abſent for ſome time in the Vacancy.</p>

               <p>You are very good at expounding I know, but what thoſe Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were I am not certain; but being apt to miſtake a little, they might miſtake the time too, and they might extend their journey beyond their Vacancy, <hi>Mr. Gaven</hi> he hath made a mighty Defence I muſt confeſs, endeavouring to prove that he was out of Town all <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> and in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> before, and truly he hath brought ſome Witneſſes that have ſpoken very far for him as to thoſe months, but I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to obſerve, as <hi>I</hi> know you did, that the three laſt Witneſſes that knew him very well did affirm poſitively that he was there the laſt week in <hi>July,</hi> but being asked to the week before that, and the week before that, they could not be poſitive. And under favour by that Evidence you will believe rather that he was not there, for if ſo be they could ſo poſitively remember for the laſt week, why ſhould they not be as poſitive for the two weeks before? why theſe two weeks were enough to ſerve our turn, for it was towards the latter end of <hi>July</hi> that which Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> hath ſworn upon Mr. <hi>Gaven,</hi> that he was in Town, and talked of the ſame matters which he had written the letter about. And therefore it is much to be preſumed, that becauſe the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will take upon them as to the laſt week, they are ſure he was at <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> but as to the two other weeks they could not be ſure, that they ſpeak with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and therefore it may be true that he was here. And the Woman ſaid ſhe could not ſay but poſſibly he might make ſuch a Journey and ſhe never the wiſer. So that under favour, Gentlemen, all that which <hi>Mr. Gaven</hi> hath ſo induſtriouſly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay upon Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> does ſhrink into a very ſlender Evidence, and that it might well be he was at <hi>London</hi> at the time that <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, the three laſt Witneſſes ſpeaking poſitively only to the laſt week in <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then truly, my Lord, they are fixed upon another great matter to blemiſh Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> as to <hi>Mr. Ireland,</hi> a perſon that is dead and out of the way. <hi>Mr. Ireland</hi> hath been hanged upon that Evidence, ſo far it was believed, but now after all this will theſe Gentlemen come to queſtion the Evidence that was given againſt <hi>Mr. Ireland.</hi> They have likewiſe, my Lord, brought my Lady <hi>Southcott,</hi> and ſome other perſons, who give you an Evidence concerning <hi>Mr. Ireland,</hi> that he ſhould not be here at this time, but Gentlemen under favour Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> hath ſworn before, and he hath now ſworn it again, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was at that time in <hi>London,</hi> and Gentlemen I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him in that by another Witneſs that did ſee him here in Town at that time. And when you have two Witneſſes for the King upon their Oaths come and teſtifie it, I hope you will belive them, rather than other perſons that teſtifie only by hear-ſay. It was the matter then in Iſſue, and had ſaved his Life if it had been true, but though it be now ſettled, and none could think it would be again ſtarted, they would make that an Objection, but by chance we have a Witneſs ſtill to give you ſatisfaction, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> at that time that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did ſwear him to be. We will begin with that Witneſs about <hi>Ireland.</hi> And then we will call our Witneſſes to prove that <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> was in <hi>England,</hi> and did come over when he ſaid he did, Call <hi>Sarah Pain.</hi> (Who was ſworn.)</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, I will. I have known, <hi>Mr. Titus Oates</hi> theſe ſeven years, and had not ſeen him above five years; but about two years ago <hi>I</hi> did meet him in <hi>Newgate-market,</hi> and then again in the latter end of the month of <hi>March</hi> 1678, or the beginning of <hi>April, I</hi> did ſee <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> in a diſguiſe, in a gray Searge Coat, and <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:35679:38"/>
think a gray Hat, but <hi>I</hi> did not underſtand it, nor did I know him to be the man, and <hi>I</hi> was very much troubled that <hi>I</hi> could not recollect my ſelf who he was, and <hi>I</hi> went to bed, &amp; could not recollect who he was; but before <hi>I</hi> roſe in the morning <hi>I</hi> did draw him within the Scheme of my knowledg that it was <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> &amp; to confirm my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that, I did go to a Gentlewoman, whoſe name I did not know, but I went thither becauſe it was the ſame place that I had ſeen him at a year before, to enquire what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and how he did: And when I came to her (in the morning early, it was the next day after I had ſeen him in the Diſguiſe) I enquired of the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man how Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did, and ſhe clapped her hand upon her Counter, being a Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>he is an undone man. Why ſo,</hi> ſaid <hi>I</hi>: ſaid ſhe, <hi>he is turned to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and he abſconds and hides himſelf, I knew not where he is; then in plain terms,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I ſaw him later than you, for I ſaw him Yeſterday, between nine and ten of the clock, it was at the upper end of St.</hi> Martins-lane, <hi>near</hi> Leiceſter <hi>Houſe.</hi>

               <speaker>Mayo,</speaker>
               <p>Very well Sir, Afterward he came again and walked into the Garden, and the young man I ſpoke of before, that is now dead, came again &amp; tooke notice of him, of the ſtrange Garbe he was in; he was in a Room that looked into the Garden, I ſaw him wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king there, &amp; ſaid he, <hi>Yonder is</hi> Oates <hi>again, and hath brought another with him</hi>; he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the window, and ſaid he, <hi>Perithee look here, does not he looke like a</hi> Jeſuite? and he that was with him lookt back, &amp; if it had not been for that, &amp; the young man's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, I had never taken notice of mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> After when I heard he was come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gave in his Teſtimony about the Plot, <hi>I</hi> would needs go ſee him; but he ſpoke very ſlightingly to me, and ſeemed to be offended with the Family becauſe they did ſcorn him. Said I <hi>They had no reaſon to countenance you, becauſe we all underſtood you were turned</hi> Catholick. <hi>They did,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>look very ſhye upon me. Why</hi> ſaid I, <hi>you muſt not be offended, for you know all the Family are no friends to</hi> Jeſuites <hi>and I hope never will be ſo; but I hope</hi> mr. Oates, <hi>you will not forget eaten Bread, becauſe he uſed to be made very much of at Sir</hi> Richard Barker's.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>I have this to ſay; firſt, That at my laſt Trial when I preſs'd him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare who had ſeen him, when he ſaid he was here in Town, he could name no body, not one. I know afterwards he was examined at the Committee, and then he could name no body neither. He ſaid he was there privately at mr. <hi>Groves,</hi> and we can prove that he never did lye there in his life. And then he ſaid abſolutely he had not ſeen much Company, he ſtay'd but 6 days. Now this good Dr. that does ſay he ſaw him here in the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or the middle of <hi>April,</hi> whereas he himſelf ſays he came over with <hi>Hilſley</hi> the 24th. of <hi>April.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. <hi>C. J.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>He was Landed here the 17th. of <hi>April,</hi> and the Witneſſes ſay it was the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>mr. <hi>Oates</hi> expreſly ſaid he ſtay'd here but 6 dayes when he came over to the Conſult.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, how could this ſtand together? His coming over the 17th. and his being here a great part in <hi>May,</hi> whereas he ſays, he was but 6 days.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Perchance Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> may be preciſe enough, but look you here, theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, do not ſo exactly to a day or two, or 3, or 4 or 5, but to the latter end of <hi>April.</hi> now why might they not ſee him the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and yet ſtand very well with mr. <hi>Oates</hi> teſtimony, who ſays he was landed here about the 17th. of <hi>April,</hi> and ſtaied here about 6 or 7 days? How nice would you have them be in that caſe, which becauſe they are honeſt, they will not be.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>You make your defences to depend upon an uncertainty of time, which no mortal man can ever remember; beſides, pray obſerve this, That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſtands a good witneſs till you impeach him by a fry out of your own Schools, and they go to the whole moneths of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> now theſe all ſpeak in contradiction to them, and ſo mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is ſtill ſet an upright and good witneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whitebread,</speaker>
               <p>They ſay they did ſee him there every day, or every other day.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But ſure I can as well tell who ſee him but once in ſuch a month and dined with him, then as any that ſaw him never ſo often; but here are five Witneſſes upon you in this point.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Juſt Pemberton.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The Divine did ſee him, and went and told the woman that he had ſeen him, pray remember that.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Now the Evidence is concluded, ſay what you will for your ſelves, and then we will obſerve what you object upon our direction to the Jury, according to our Conſciences.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>My</hi> Lord, then I ſay this for my ſelf, we commit our ſelves to God Almighty. We muſt compare the number, tho ours were not ſworn, yet there were 16 of them, boys, young men, that converſed with him every day, and theſe witneſſes ſpeak but of one or two particular days: One ſays he dined with him, and another ſaw him in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; but my Lord in theſe very Witneſſes there is an apparent contradiction, becauſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35679:41"/>
out of his own mouth (<hi>ex ore tuo te judico</hi>) they are contradicted. He ſays he came over upon <hi>Sunday</hi> with <hi>Hilſley</hi> which was the 20th. of <hi>April</hi> as <hi>I</hi> think, and ſtayed here only a matter of 6 days. One of the witneſſes ſays he ſaw him the firſt <hi>Munday</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> What ſignifie the witneſſes, though upon Oath, that ſay they him in <hi>May?</hi> How can he come over the 20th. of <hi>April,</hi> and ſtay but 6 days; and be ſeen here in <hi>May</hi>? Before theſe can be reconciled, one of them muſt be falſe; and then my Lord, beſides, that which I firſt ſaid, there is the number of witneſſes, they are nothing in compariſon with the number of ours. And then my Lord, 2<hi>dly,</hi> if we ſhould grant that a leſſer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould ſerve the turn, becauſe they are ſworn for the King, becauſe they ſwear for the ſafety of the King (whom God preſerve, whatſoever becomes of me) and the other ſpeak not upon their Oaths, yet my Lord, this does not deſtroy nor touch at all that evidence that is brought againſt him about the Rector of <hi>Leige,</hi> Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton.</hi> And tho it be granted that all the others that ſpoke about mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being at St. <hi>Omers</hi> be miſtaken, and muſt not be believed, yet we have him ſtill by thoſe 6 others who have proved that he hath ſworn falſe, and I hope we ſhall have fair play in the Law, to make the beſt defence we can for our lives; and I humbly conceive, no body muſt be convicted of High Treaſon by the Law, but upon the Evidence of two ſufficient witneſſes. Now <hi>I</hi> leave it to the Conſcience &amp; Honour of the Court, whether he ſhall be believed, and counted a ſufficient witneſs, when there are ſo many that have proved him falſe in that one point. And then beſides all this my Lord, we have here 16 at leaſt <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> Witneſſes who give you an account of mr. <hi>Irelands</hi> being out of <hi>London</hi> from the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> till 14 <hi>September.</hi> ſo that in theſe two things he hath been contradicted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Anſwer, for he ſays, the 12. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he was with him, when they ſay he was in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You have forgot the maid that ſaw him in <hi>London</hi> the 12 or 13.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, I have not. And this is it I anſwer to it, She is a witneſs that only ſays ſhe juſt ſaw him, but did not ſpeak to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>She made a Courteſie to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven,</speaker>
               <p>We are talking now of ſeeing <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and we prove by Sir <hi>John Souththcott</hi> and all his Family, who ſay they began their journey with him the 5th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſtayed with him till the 19<hi>th.</hi> after the particular day that ſhe ſpeaks of, you find 7 or 8 of them ſwear that they ſaw him all the time. And therefore I would feign know whether poor mens lives ſhall be caſt away upon ſuch Evidence as this. And then my Lord; for the other thing, I hope I have made a very good Plea for my ſelf concerning the matter of <hi>July,</hi> my witneſſes could be poſitive, as to the laſt week, but for the other weekes tho, they could not be poſitive, they rather believed I was there then not, but when it is urged, why might not they give as good a teſtimony for the former weeks as for that. To this I anſwer fully, that there is a great &amp; predominant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they ſhould have particular reaſon to ſwear why I ſhould be there the laſt week rather than the other weeks, becauſe I was then ſhut up in the ſpiritual exerciſe, &amp; they had a particular reaſon to take notice of that. Then my Lord, I hope you will be pleaſed to mind this by which I have made my Plea good, that is, my Lord, that mr. <hi>Oates</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt me is this, mr. <hi>Aſhby</hi> came to town about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> and that he ſtay'd there about a fortnight, and that in the time of that fortnight <hi>I</hi> came to Town, and ſaid <hi>I</hi> would go ſee Father <hi>Aſhby,</hi> and had that diſcourſe be ſpeaks of, and ſo much for that. And then my Lord, I beſeech you ſtill to bear it in your mind that I have been proved not to be in Town at the time of the great Conſult about the Plot,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35679:42"/>
and indeed I was not capable of it, for I was not then Profeſſed, and there could None be of that congregation about the Plot, but thoſe that were profeſſed, I could not be there in the Congregation by reaſon of my Age, mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> here and the reſt, if you will ask them, will tell you it, they were there, but upon the word of a dying man <hi>I</hi> was not there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis not poſitively ſaid by <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> that you were.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaven,</speaker>
               <p>But then my Lord, he ſays, my Name was to it, which he ſaw in <hi>July,</hi> now I prove that <hi>I</hi> was in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> the laſt week of <hi>July,</hi> and ſeeing I have witneſſes to prove that I was there till the 14<hi>th,</hi> &amp; the laſt week &amp; it was after the 14<hi>th.</hi> that he ſaw me, <hi>I</hi> hope my Plea is good. Then my Lord, I ground my Plea upon this, I have ſtudied Philoſophy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and other things, but I never ſtudied the Law, and ſo am very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it; but this is my Caſe, I am accuſed by one Witneſs concerning one Fact, and by another concerning another, the one committed here at <hi>London,</hi> the other in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi>; I deſire therefore to know whether the Witneſs that ſwears the thing done in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> in another County being joyned to the other Witneſs that ſwears what was done in <hi>London,</hi> can be eſteemed two witneſſes according to the Law, to convict me of Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C.J. <hi>North,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, Il'e tell you if it were a matter of doubt, it might be found ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and be argued, but it is a matter that hath been already reſolved in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> at the <hi>Kings Bench Barr,</hi> who was Indicted for levying War againſt the King, and there one Witneſs proved the levying of War in one County, and the other proved the levying of War in another County, and ſo though they were but ſingle witneſſes of ſingle Facts, yet being both came up to the Indictment, they were adjudged ſufficient to maintain it. So it is in your Caſe, here is one witneſs for the proving your hand to the Paper, which was for the Murther of the King, and there is another wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your diſcourſe to the ſame purpoſe, the Fact is your joining and conſpiring to deſtroy the King, and to levy War againſt him, and both theſe are proved, to the full of the Indictment by theſe witneſſes; and though they are to ſeveral particular Facts, yet they are all Overt acts of the ſame Treaſon.</p>

               <p>I'le tell you what you miſtake in what you ſay, for there are two witneſſes, <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who ſwear to the ſame Fact, which is killing the King, altering the Government, and bringing in Popery. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, He ſaw your hand to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, for the Murder of the King, for the raiſing the Army, and for the introducing of Popery, which is a neceſſary conſequence of change of Government; <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſays he was with you in the Parlor at my Lord <hi>Aſton's,</hi> where the diſcourſe was between him and you, and others, about killing the King, and altering Religion.

               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> I conſult a way to kill the King here, and then I go into the Country and there I conſult of it with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another perſon, are not theſe two Witneſſes to the ſame Treaſon, ſure they are?</p>

               <speaker>Gaven.</speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord, my ſecond Plea is this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> there be two witneſſes, you will grant me this ground, that no man muſt be convicted but upon the Evidence of two Legal and credible witneſſes, and upon clear Evidence, as the Statute ſince His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties happy Reſtauration does declare. Now two things are required certainly to make a credible Witneſs, and a clear Evidence; as the Witneſs muſt be credible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo it is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35679:42"/>
as agreeable to reaſon that the Evidence muſt be plain and clear, yea as clear as the light of the Sun at Mid-day. Now therefore if <hi>I</hi> prove, that neither the Witneſs is credible, ſuch as the Law requires, nor the Evidence clear, ſuch as the Law looks upon as ſuch, then I ought not to be convicted by this Witneſs upon this Evidence.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>You argue mighty ſubtilly, but I'le give you this anſwer, there muſt be two lawful Witneſſes; that is the law; a man cannot be Impeached of Treaſon but by two lawfull Witneſſes; now if they be not convicted of perjury, and their Teſtimony be not taken away, but they may be heard in a Court of Juſtice, they are lawful Witneſſes; now for the being credible Witneſſes, that is a matter that is left to the Jury, but we muſt receive them as lawful Witneſſes till they be convict of a crime that takes away their Teſtimony.</p>

Now I muſt leave my ſelf to the Jury, and will leave it to their judgments whether theſe two Witneſſes can be eſteemed credible Witneſſes; for to make credible Witneſſes there is required ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of life, and truth in their Teſtimony, for no man can be a good Witneſs that is not an honeſt man, nor that hath carryed himſelf ſo that he is not to be believed, As to the honeſty of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his life, you have heard that he was diſguſted by the Jeſuites, eſteemed not a perſon of that diligence or fidelity to be intruſted by them; He was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of St. <hi>Omers,</hi>

               <speaker>Gaven.</speaker>
               <p>It might be a ground of hatred amnd alice in him againſt them, and then Gentlemen, I deſire you to conſider that other thing, That we have proved him to ſpeak falſe in his Teſtimony about Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton</hi>; and all the buſineſs of the 12th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> concerning Mr. <hi>Irelands</hi> being here the 12th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> who by ſixteen Witneſſes, is proved to have been all the while in <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi> And though he was not convicted of Perjury before, which might have eaſily been done, as I have ſhewn to the whole world now, I appeal to the Honour and Conſcience of the Jury, whether all theſe proofs ought not to make this Witneſs to be deemed an incredible Witneſs. And pray Gentlemen hear me this, and carry this away with you, as to the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> between the eighth and twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> how many do ſwear that he was in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> I deſire you but to compare that one Woman that only ſaw him, and made a Curteſie to him, as ſhe ſays, with thoſe ſixteen Witneſſes that converſed with him daily. Then as for the ſecond Teſtimony of the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes, which you ſee is thwarted by ſome that do ſwear in the Kings name to the contrary, Still I deſire you to compare number with number, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers though they do not ſwear, are ready to ſwear, and there are only 3 or 4 againſt 16 of them, and there is an evident contradiction in what they ſay, and that proved out of his own mouth; for he ſays he came over the twentieth of <hi>April</hi> with Mr. <hi>Hilſley,</hi> and ſtay'd only ſix days; they ſay he was here in <hi>May,</hi> and I deſire theſe may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35679:43"/>
for how could it be that he ſhould be here in <hi>May,</hi> if he ſtaid but ſix days. And then to make your Verdict, and take their Credit away, I would deſire you to conſider thoſe Witneſſes that I have brought for my ſelf, not being here; but in <hi>Wolverhampton</hi>; for being in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> as long as till the laſt week of <hi>July,</hi> it muſt fall within the time of his Teſtimony. I have brought Witneſſes to prove upon Oath, that from the twenty ſecond upward, they ſaw me in <hi>Wolverhampton</hi>; and they do remember the particular inſtance, that I was then at my ſpiritual exerciſe; and this is that I have to ſay as to Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> As for Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> I would deſire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the whole ſtory of his coming to diſcover this Plot, and his being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former about it. The truth is, I confeſs I have known him five or ſix years whilſt he lived at my Lord <hi>Aſtons,</hi> and I have divers times diſcourſed with him there in Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> Chamber, but as I hope to be ſaved never any thing of Treaſon in all my life. Now 'tis well known, and there are thoſe that can teſtifie it, that in truth <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> run away from my Lord <hi>Aſtons</hi> after he had loſt three hundred pound of my Lords mony.</p>

               <p>If you can ſay any thing againſt Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> by Witneſſes that you can prove it, then you ſay well, but if you will tell a ſtory out of one Lords mouth and another Lords mouth, that is never to be indured; you ſhall never take away a mans Teſtimony by hearſay, you muſt prove it.</p>

               <p>'Tis well known, if I prove <hi>Dugdale</hi> no credible Witneſs, I play my own game. You know I have been a Priſoner 20 weeks and could not ſeek out Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, I asked it as ſoon as I knew of my Tryal, but it was denied me to ſend for Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prove that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was in Goal for Debt.

               <p>My Lord, I have but one thing to ſay, and 'tis but a word: your Lordſhip was pleaſed to make an Obſervation, and a good one it was, a Letter which Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſays was written by me to Mr. <hi>Ewers,</hi> which he ſays he intercepted, he was in the mean time a truſty correſpondent for his Friend. In that Letter he ſwears there was expreſly contained poſitive words, of entertaining perſons to kill the King, that only ſuch as were hardy, deſperate and ſtout, but as your Lordſhip well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it was an improbable thing that a man who had his Wits about him ſhould write ſuch plain expreſſions about ſuch a matter, and upon that improbability. I leave it to the Jury.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>Have you any thing to ſay <hi>Mr. Fenwick</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fenwick,</speaker>
               <p>I deſire, my Lord, your Lordſhip and the Jury to conſider and obſerve the nature both of our Witneſſes, and of them that are brought againſt us. The one ſpeak for the whole time that they ſaw him every day or every other day; they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſed with him and eat and drank with him in the ſame houſe, the others they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35679:43"/>
ſay only they ſaw him one particular day, another, another; and one of them ſayes he ſaw him but in a diſguiſe. Now my Lord, whether it be likely that ſo many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Children brought up in a good virtuous life ſhould come here to forſwear themſelves to contradict people that we know not what they are, and then beſides, we know that theſe people are of a poor mean beggarly condition, that intend to mend that condition by ſuch a pretence of diſcovery, and hope thereby to advance themſelves. It is probable, ſuch people might be drawn in, Then alſo we ſhall prove that Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> did not come over with him, nor Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> nor Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton.</hi> Then all his Witneſs as to them is falſe, and he does not ſay he went back with theſe people, and this for the Witneſſes. Now ſuppoſe the Witneſſes were all equal, what does he prove againſt us Three? Or what reaſon doth he give of his Evidence. He ſays, he ſaw ſuch and ſuch Letters from <hi>Mr. Whitebread.</hi> Now is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a man that had no credit at all with us, that we ſhould be ſuch fools to truſt him with ſuch Letters as thoſe, then your Lordſhips muſt hang us twice, once for Fools and then for Knaves. Or is it poſſible that we ſhould be ſuch egregious Fools that we ſhould truſt a man that was never eſteemed of, was expelled the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And for all his talk of Commiſſions and Letters, there is not one of thoſe found, let him ſhew any one Commiſſion, any money paid, or any Order brought in, or any Arms that were found, there are three quarters of a year now paſſed ſince the firſt diſcovery, certainly all this time could produce ſomething. Thouſands of Letters have been taken from us, ſome of thoſe Letters would have diſcovered this thing: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly therefore we have better Evidence than he hath, ſuppoſing them to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual as to Credibility in their Original. Is it credible we ſhould be ſo great Rogues to contrive the Kings Death, though he ſpeaks of the Writing being carried from Chamber to Chamber concerning this matter, he can never produce one Paper ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any one mans hand, nor can he produce any thing to atteſt his Teſtimony. I leave this to your Lordſhips judgment whether this Evidence be good, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears in ſo much time of any effect that is produced: Where were the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Where were the monies paid? Where the Commiſſions? Is it poſſible ſuch a thing ſhould be, and no ſign of it for a whole year almoſt? there is no reaſon brought amongſt them all, but ſaying and ſwearing, and that I will ſtand by.</p>

               <p>My Lord, <hi>I</hi> have only this to ſay, <hi>I</hi> have lived to this age, which is 70 years, and <hi>I</hi> never knew any man that could ſay I was accuſed of the thing in the world, for which <hi>I</hi> ſhould be brought before any Magiſtrate, and it is ſtrange that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many years <hi>I</hi> ſhould come to be arraigned, and condemned for a Crime of the higheſt Nature, and there is no reaſon brought againſt me nor any of the reſt, for the proof of what is alledged, nor do they who are the Witneſſes againſt us deſerve at all any Credit: They only affirm ſuch and ſuch things without any reaſon, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to believe them, and it is eaſie to ſay, and ſo it is to ſwear it. So that all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35679:44"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> have to ſay is this, ſince a Negative cannot be proved, <hi>I</hi> hope innocency will find ſome that ſhall defend it. I leave my ſelf to the Bench, for the Law is the defence of innocency. If they did bring any Evidence beſides that, which is down right poſitive ſwearing, without any reaſon or concurrent reaſon to confirm it, it were ſomething.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the <hi>Jury</hi>! Here hath been a very long Evidence, and a very confuſed one; and you cannot expect, that it ſhould be wholly Repeated to you; For it is almoſt impoſſible, for any one to remember it; neither would I if I could, becauſe a great deal of it is impertinent, and vainly to be repeated: And beſides, many things have been ſaid over, and over again, to no purpoſe. But I will obſerve to you, as well as I can, what Teſtimonies there are againſt each particular Man of them; and that <hi>I</hi> do look upon, to be very material. And I leave it to you, to judge and conſider, how far the Evidence is Credible, and how far it is Subſtantial.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Mr. Whitebread</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have the Teſtimony of three, <hi>Oates, Dugdale,</hi> and <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:</hi> Againſt Mr. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> you have the Teſtimony of <hi>Oates, Bedlow,</hi> and <hi>Praunce</hi>: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Harcourt,</hi> you have <hi>Oates, Dugdale, Bedlow,</hi> and <hi>Praunce.</hi> You have againſt <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Oates,</hi> and againſt <hi>Turner, Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Oates</hi>: So that, to the two laſt you have two, three to the two firſt, and four to <hi>Harcourt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:35679:44"/>Now, the matter that they have ſworn, hath been all tending to one thing: the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the King, the Advancing of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Suppreſſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>: That is the Thing, that all the Evidence does drive at.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Dugdale,</hi> for ought we can perceive, he hath been upon the matter a Stranger to <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi>; and I do not find, that he had any correſpondence with, or knowledge of them, at the time he charges Mr <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Gaven.</hi> And he charges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them with the very ſelf ſame things, <hi>viz.</hi> the conſulting the death of the King, and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Popery.</hi> And they have ſeveral inſtances of the Facts, as their ſeveral conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; how they met together, and where, or at what place: And <hi>Dugdale</hi> tells you of a letter, that he found; wherein <hi>Whitebread</hi> gave charge, for the entertainment of good ſtout Fellows; No matter for Gentlemen, ſo they were Reſolute. And ſo they have ſeveral <hi>Mediums,</hi> to prove one and the ſame Thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> ſayes to all this, Here is nothing againſt us, but Talking and Swearing. But for that, he hath been told, (if it were poſſible for him to learn) that all Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is but Talking and Swearing: For all Things, all Men's lives and fortunes, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by an Oath; and an Oath is by talking, by kiſſing the Book, and calling <hi>God</hi> to Witneſs to the Truth of what is ſaid. That is the Eſſence of an Oath, and thoſe are the Ceremonies: The kiſſing the Book, and Speaking, is the accidental Form; the ſubſtance, is Calling <hi>God</hi> to Witneſs. Therefore, What a vain thing is it in Mr. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> to ſeem to Tryumph, by ſaying, There is nothing againſt us, but Talking and Swearing. There is nothing againſt them, but Evidence and proof of Men upon Oath: And <hi>their</hi> Reaſons, the Truth is, are very Trifles. They defend their Lives as they do their Religion, weak Arguments; and fallacious Reaſons.</p>
               <p>For that long Buſineſs, that <hi>Mr. Gaven</hi> hath undertaken to ſay againſt <hi>Mr. Oates,</hi> and what they all inſiſt upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Number of their Witneſſes, which were ſixteen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, to diſprove mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that it could not be true what he ſayes, That he ſhould be preſent here at a Conſult, the Twenty-Fourth of <hi>April,</hi> becauſe they have brought ſixteen from <hi>St. Omers</hi> to prove, That he was there all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis very true now, if that be ſo, it is impoſſible, <hi>Oates</hi> can ſwear an Truth: But whether that is to be believ'd or no, is the Queſtion? methinks, they did not do well for themſelves, when they bid you remember the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Evidence. They did well enough, to bid you remember the Number: for the Number is more than what <hi>Oates</hi> is back'd with on t'other ſide; but the Nature is of much leſs weight: Not only becauſe they are not upon their Oaths, for by Law they may not be upon their Oaths (and that muſt not be charged on them as a Defect, ſeeing they would ſwear, I doubt not, if they might) but becauſe their Teſtimony is really to be believed much alike without an Oath; as with one; becauſe they are of a Religion that can diſpenſe with Oaths, tho falſe, for the ſake of a Good Cauſe.</p>
               <p>But, ſeeing they deſire the <hi>Nature</hi> of the men may be conſidered, you are to obſerve, that they are Proſelytes, and Young Striplings of their Church; which does indeed, in one reſpect or other, abuſe all Her Diſciples, and keeps them in a blind Obedience, to purſue and effect all Her Commands.</p>
               <p>If the Doctrins of that Church were better; If ſuch which are allowed by their Chief Authors, were but leſs Bloody and inhumane; If they had ever put thoſe that are ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into an <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> that they might have been publickly di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owned, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the particular Opinions of ſome ill men, which they did diſavow; Theſe men
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35679:45"/>
might have been then more worthy to be regarded. But when none of their <hi>Popes</hi> have done this (who muſt have very ſtrange foreheads, if they ſay, they have) and ſuch Doctrines are ſtill owned: there is much indeed to be obſerved from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Evidence, the <hi>Nature</hi> of the men, and their Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, <hi>I</hi> believe, that they would deny their principles to be bloody, or to be defended and allowed by any of their beſt authours, if at this time, the fear of apparent Falſhood did not deter them. But if to Murther Kings, or to depoſe them, and Abſolve their Subjects from their Allegiance for the advancement of Religion, be a Thing moſt impious, and void of Religion, and makes Religion worſe than none; which Doctrine yet they have owned, and their Counſells have owned, and we have proved it upon them, and out of them: I cannot tell what to ſay to theſe men, or their Teſtimony, the <hi>Nature</hi> of whom they deſire to be <hi>conſidered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they were Young Boys, ſent for hither on purpoſe to give this Teſtimony; and it was not indeed, a Fault in the Priſoners at the Bar, to ſend for what Evidence they could for themſelves: But it is very doubtful and ſuſpitious, to have ſuch green, and flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minds, thus imploy'd, and I muſt leave it to you, to conſider how far theſe Young men train'd in ſuch principles, may be prevailed on, to ſpeak what is not True.</p>
               <p>And now if the Kings Evidence after this, ſtood alone, it were yet ſomething: but when you have Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> Teſtimony as to this great matter of his appearing in <hi>April,</hi> confirmed by 7 or 8 Witneſſes, that ſpeak ſo expreſly to it, how will they anſwer it; Do they make Sir <hi>Ric: Barker,</hi> a perſon of no value; do they ſo little eſteem the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that ſays, I knew him though he was in diſguiſe; And went and ſaid it preſently to a Woman, that he knew was acquainted with <hi>Oates.</hi> And asking her, when ſhe ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and ſhe ſaying, not a great while: he ſaid, I ſaw him later then you; and ſays he did know him: And this is confirmed ſtill by Sir <hi>Rich: Barker,</hi> who tells you, that his men told him, that he had been there. What ſhould make them to acquaint their maſter ſo, if it were not ſo? Or do you think it is a thing maliciouſly prepared or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to take away the lives of theſe men, that his men ſhould tell him a ſtory ſo long ago? If it be not true, to what purpoſe ſhould they tell him ſo; and if it be true, it Confirms the matter ſworn againſt them.</p>
               <p>There is he, that was his companion, the School-maſter, that ſays, in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> was twelveth month, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> dined with him at his houſe, ſate with him Four hours, diſcourſed of his Travels into <hi>Spain</hi> and St. <hi>Omers</hi>: And there is the man that is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> if not a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that ſwears he ſaw him twice, about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Charles Howards</hi> lodgings in <hi>Arundels</hi> houſe; ſo that here are ſeven Witneſſes direct or circumſtantial, to prove Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to have been in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 78.</p>
               <p>But ſaid they This is but <hi>Talking</hi> and <hi>Swearing.</hi> Very fine! and the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Youths is <hi>Talking,</hi> but not <hi>Swearing.</hi> Ay, but then their <hi>Numbers</hi> are not ſo many. That Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I leave to you, for both cannot be true. The Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and the witneſſes that he had to back himſelf withall, and to prove himſelf to be here is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with what the young men ſay, that he was at St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you obſerve; All theſe mens Defence is in the Circumſtantial part of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in watching and catching at what day, What hour, and what month, how <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> reckoned falſe, ſo and ſo: <hi>If</hi> he came here about the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> how could they ſee him the firſt of <hi>May.</hi> And they think then, they have got ſuch a mighty victory, but it is not ſo weighty an argument with <hi>Proteſtants</hi> after all their conceit, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35679:45"/>
For here is the point, the matter of time is a thing that no man can ſo preciſely charge his memory with, as that it ſhould be too Strictly the meaſure of your Judgments about truth or falſhood, by the miſtake of 7 or 8 days. Examine your ſelves how often every day you do miſtake things that have been tranſacted half a year ago, and err in point of time? taking one week for another, and one Month for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and though I muſt ſay, it is conſiderable, yet too great weight is not to be laid upon that.</p>
               <p>As for that they inſiſt upon ſo much, the coming over of Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton</hi> and Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>; It is true, Three or Four Witneſſes ſpeak, as to Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> and ſome to Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton</hi>; and they ſay, they were both beyond Sea when Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> came over; but if the Sixteen be not to be believed in the firſt matter, and if Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> does ſay true, notwithſtanding all their Evidence, that he was here ſuch a time in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> Then I'le tell you what Inference may naturally be; to wit, That they can't want a Witneſs to prove what they pleaſe: For I believe there is none of them all will make any bones of it.</p>
               <p>I ſay (Gentlemen) if you are ſatisfied in your Conſciences, that the Evidence on Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his part to that point (that is to ſay, ſeven Witneſſes) ought to prevail with you, to believe he was here in thoſe months notwithſtanding the 16 Witneſſes, who ſay they ſaw him every day beyond Sea in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi>), Their <hi>other</hi> Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his coming over with <hi>Preſton</hi> and <hi>Warner,</hi> will have no great weight; becauſe the other is the <hi>great</hi> matter, by which they make the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of their defence.</p>
               <p>I am glad indeed to ſee a Gentleman here whoſe Face I never ſaw before, and that is Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon my word he hath eſcaped well, for I find little ſaid againſt him, very little either as to the matter or the manner of his Evidence. They would have made reflection on him for his Poverty, but <hi>I</hi> hope that they whoſe Religion is to vow Poverty, will never inſiſt on that for any great Objection againſt any.</p>

               <p>For my own part, this Evidence of Mr. <hi>Dugdales</hi> gives me the greateſt ſatisfaction of any thing in the world in this matter; and whilſt we reſt ſatiſfied in the murder of that Man, and are morally certain you muſt do it, knowing of what Principles you are, you cannot blame us, if upon ſuch manifeſt Reaſons we lay it upon you.</p>
               <p>And this is Occaſional Evidence, which I for my part never heard before this day; nor can I ever be more, or better ſatisfied, than I am upon this point, <hi>viz.</hi> The Teſtimony that <hi>I</hi> have received this Afternoon concerning the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey.</hi> As to the Defence they have made, they are Exceptions in point of time, but do not affect Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>; for they have hardly the confidence to deny the Things he ſayes to be true againſt them.</p>
               <p>They fall foul indeed upon Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> he appears to have been their Agent; and whilſt ſo, bad enough: But if he had not had a mind to have become a good man, he would not likely have done us that Good that he hath done, in diſcovering the deſign you had engaged him in.

               <p>To return, The Letter that is found in <hi>Harcourts</hi> Papers, does further confirm Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in all the great and conſiderable Matters that he ſayes; That there was a <hi>Plot,</hi> That that <hi>Plot</hi> was called by the name of a <hi>Deſign,</hi> which was to be kept Cloſe and Secret. And this is an Evidence that cannot Lye. For that Letter will never be got off, no more than the other Letter, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſpeaks of about Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I leave it to you, Gentlemen: You have heard how many VVitneſſes they have had for them, about Twenty-Four or Twenty-Five of one ſort or another. You have heard what they apply their Teſtimony unto, to Convict Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> of Falſhood in matter of Time, which was their principal Defence; That he was not here in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and that he came not over with Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> and that <hi>Ireland</hi> was not here all <hi>Auguſt.</hi> You have heard what VVitneſſes <hi>Oates,</hi> is back'd withal, as to the time of his being here: and the Maid ſays, ſhe ſaw <hi>Ireland</hi> here in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, though their Defence depends but upon a point of Time: I muſt tell you, it ought to be well conſidered, for 'tis indeed very conſiderable towards their Defence; and God forbid but we ſhould be equal to all men.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have Remembred, as well as I can, in this long and perplexed Evidence, that which ſeems to me moſt material as to their Charge or Diſcharge; and that which they have made their greateſt Defence by the Youths from St. <hi>Omers</hi> to diſprove Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his being here, and <hi>Mr. Irelands</hi> not being in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which in Truth is not the proper buſineſs of this Day, but hath received a former Verdict before: for if ſo be the Jury before had not been ſatisfied of the Truth of that, they could never have found <hi>Ireland</hi> Guilty. So I leave it to you upon the whole matter. I can remember no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides. Go together, and conſider of your Verdict, according to your Evidence.</p>

of them pretend to ſay, (and I take the liberty to take notice of it, for the ſatisfaction of them, and all that are here preſent, and all the world) That not a Perſon among the Priſoners at the Bar, were either wanting to themſelves to Offer, or the Court to them to hear any thing that they could ſay for themſelves. But, upon a long Evidence, a full Diſcuſſing the Objections made againſt it, and a Patient Hearing of the Defence they made, they are found Guilty: And I do think, that every honeſt Man will ſay, That they are unexceptionably found ſo; and that 'tis a Juſt Verdict you have given.</p>
