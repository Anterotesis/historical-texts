            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A General Epistle to all who have believed in
the Light of the Lord Iesus, and are called of
God to follow the Lamb through the Great
Tribulation.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHom God hath called out of the world and the
vanities of it to serve the living God in newness of
life, and to be worshippers of him in Spirit and truth, and
to be followers of Christ in the regeneration, and to be
baptized with him into his suffering and death, that so
you may be partakers of his resurrection and life, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
unto all that you are risen with him out of the
grave of sin, wickednesse, and death, by having your
hearts renewed, and your affections and minds set to seek
those things which are above, which are not transitory
and visible, but everlasting and immortal, by which the
souls of all the righteous and obedient children are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed,
and nourished up unto eternal life, and through
the eternal power of the Son of God, which hath been,
and is manifest among them that believe, in the measure
of his Spirit, and keep their first love and integrity unto
the Lord, all his are preserved out of the temptation of
the adversary within and without, who seeks to root out
that which God hath planted, and to nip the blossom,
and the bud, which God hath caused to spring forth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47343:2"/>
through his tender love in your hearts, so that you might
die to the good, and be spoiled in that wherein all your
happinesse lieth now and for ever. Oh therefore all watch
and be circumspect, so much the more against temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
lest you be ensnared, and your faith fail, and you fall
short of the promise of God, in not continuing faithful to
the end; friends, a care, and a tender love, and a godly
jealousie is in my he<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt to you, and over you all that have
believed, that none of you may be lost and scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the desarts and mountains, and dry and parched
places, where you have sometimes been in the time of
unbelief, where the Goats who are rough can feed, that
must go unto the left hand and have the curse: The zeal
of the Lord and his truth, which so gloriously hath been
manifest among you, above all the people and families of
the earth in our generation, constrains me thus to write
unto you, and to stir you up unto faithfulnesse in this day
of trial, for now Satan desires to winnow you within, and
to sift you without, therfore all watch and pray that your
faith fail not, which now will be tryed, and your hope, &amp;
your love, and your zeal to the Lord and his truth, and
whether you will confesse him before men, his way, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and Laws, and Statutes, which he hath revealed in
your hearts, which fallen men opposes and contradicts,
and sayers gainsay, and would not have him to rule, nor
his servants to obey, so let it be manifest to all, you fear
God rather then men, and love him, and obey him above
the precepts of men which are against him; and whether
you love the things that are above, beyond the things
that are earthly; and whether you will own him, his cross,
reproach, and suffering, or deny it, and have the liberty
of the world which is bondage, and free from righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47343:2"/>
It's no time of reserves, concealing, hovering or
halting, for there is an utter discord betwixt Christ and
<hi>Belial,</hi> and so much the more of Christ, his power and
kingdom is brought forth, so much the more is the hatred,
envy, and wrath of the Devil kindled, who hath deceived
the Nations, and blinded their eyes, and in his subjects
who oppose the Lamb of God, and tread underfoot the
blood of the Covenant, so that to one or other each one
belongs, and which is for each part will be seen, for there
can be no concord or reconciliation, therefore all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the day put on the armour of light, and have
your feet shod now when we walk through thorny pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and be not fearful or doubtful, but of believing hearts
stand not aloofe off, and idle when others are engaged in
this spiritual War, pull not your necks out of the yoke
when others draw, shelter not your selves, when you see
others in jeopardy, love not the world when you see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have thrown it off; be not intangled in cumbersom
things, when you see others throw off all weights, turn
not your backs in the day of the Lords controversie, but
follow the Lamb; this is the day of tribulation we have
to follow him in our age, like as all the Martyrs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
had in their age, whose garments were made white
in the blood of the Lamb; so all that continue and are
not faint hearted, shall receive the Crown, the honour,
the reward, and shall reign with Christ, who now suffers
with him; therefore all dear children of God, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Christ Jesus, let the loyns of your minds be gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, be now ready when the Lord calls, who is on my
side, who will take part with me, who will own my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
who will engage with me, who will gather to my
standard of salvation lifted up, and to my ensign of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47343:3"/>
held forth in the world to redeem it, and who
is ready and not abroad in the field, neither hath to go
to the house top; but that all may say in their hearts, here
am I ready to do thy will, ready to obey thee, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thee, and to suffer for thee, for whoso draws back,
the Lord hath no pleasure in such, he that will save his life
shall lose it, and he that will save his liberty will lose it in
the Spirit; and he that will save his earthly possessions,
and for the doing thereof will deny that which God hath
perswaded him of that he ought to be faithful in, he will
lose his inheritance in the heavenly; In a word, who so
fails in holding forth that testimony, that they know God
requires, and is their duty to render unto him, will lose
the testimony of his Spirit they have sometimes felt in
themselves, and will decay, and their love will wear out;
Therefore whosoever are resigned and given up unto the
Lord will be approved, and manifest to be on the Lords
part, by obedience unto these things mentioned; Friends,
do you not believe it a duty, that every Christian ought
to be exercised in, to meet together to wait upon him, to
vvorship him, and to admonish, exhort, and strengthen
one another to pray together in the holy Ghost, and one
for another, and to edifie and comfort one another; and
do you not believe God dvvells not in Temples made
vvith hands, neither hath any fellovvship vvith Idols, but
is vvorshipped any vvhere, and in every place vvhere the
Saints meet in his Name; again, have you not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
edified, and strengthened in meeting, and have
you not found the presence of the Lord and his face, and
have you not felt his great povver working in your hearts
vvhen you vvere assembled together in his Name, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in you to the opening of your hearts, and quickning

in your assemblies, so that all have gone away comforted and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and resolved to continue in the grace of God, the Consideration
of these things, dwelling in your hearts, and the sence of your owne
present condition should stir you up, and provoke you unto stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the faith and practice you have received and walked in from
the beginning of the manifestation of Gods love unto you, so that
there should me thinks need little exhortation, Gods enemies is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

by any means to make any fall from their principles and stedfastnesse,

that we are but as other men and people, that have professed God in
Summer and fair weather, but will make ship-wrack of all in a storm
and in suffering, &amp; any turning aside from the holy commandement of
God openeth the mouths of Gods enemies. Do not seek every one

not the time, till you can see some more ease, and some greater
calm, beware of that, for then coldnesse, fearfulnesse, and slavishnesse
will enter in, and you will lose your strength: Moreover, if any have
begun well, and be perswaded of the truth of that they have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and continue not unto the end, and do not finish, such will be
reckoned foolish builders, that could not finish, and all will mock
them, and neither God nor men can or will believe them,
but your adversaries will glory over you again when any suffers,
or are brought into bonds for Christ and the Gospel sakes,
seek not to get out by any indirect means, neither make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Covenant with thy adversary, vvho vvould sell both thee
and all faith and hope for money, that encourages deceit, and that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
would buy it self out of the service of God, and grow weary, give
no place to that, be content every one with your present condition,
till God arise and plead our cause, and make our innocency and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
appear as noon day, and make his adversaries his foot-stoole;
which undoubtedly he will do, and make all know the most High ought
to rule, and will rule in the kingdoms of men, and not give his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto another, neither suffer another to take it. Be conformable to
none that goes about under pretence of love, to perswade or counsel
you from your duty to God; neither submit to them that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
you of your peace, heed not the frowns of corrupt men, nor the
counsel of them who mind their own bellies, pleasure, ease, profit,
and earthly things; let not natural affections and love either to lands,
wife, or children blind your eyes, but love them, and receive them
in the Lord, and enjoy them as though not: stand loose from all
things, and out of all entanglements, and cast your care upon the
Lord, who careth for the fatherless and the widow, and them that hath
no helper in the earth; give no occasion or advantage to any that
would turn your hearts aside from following the Lord, least their love
betray you; give up all you have and enjoy to the Lord and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and your Souls, Bodies, and Spirits as a sacrifice unto the Lord,
that he may accept you, and pour forth and continue his blessing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you. Never heed the threats of them that are as the Oaks of
<hi>Bashan,</hi> nor of the great men of the earth, that mind their pleasure and
lusts, who shut you up in Prison, and hale you before Judgment seats
for the Worship of God, and falsely accuse you and condemn you,
when God justifies you; the moth shall e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and stain the glory of all flesh that withstand the Lord, and they shall
melt away as Snayls, and as the fat of Lambs, and the kidnys of Rams,
and God will bring the recompence of their own deeds upon their
own pates, and wound the hoary scalp of every one that doth wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
who toucheth Gods anointed, and doth harm to his Prophets,
and persecutes his Children; surely judgment is not far from the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of them who have required the Lord thus, as to render him evil
for good: and God will be avenged on such a faithlesse, mercilesse,
perfidious people as this, and of such a spirit which rejoyceth in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and makes a mock of sin, and hates all reproof, and would cloak
over all mischiefs with the Name of pure Laws and Authority, and
Decrees of the Holy Church, yet persecutes and gainsayes the highest
power of God in things spiritual, that pertains to the conscience:
the Beast, and false Prophet, and mother of Harlots have joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and flatters one another, and joynes their strength together,
against the true Church and heir of all the World, and would, under
pretence of doing honour unto him, shut him out of the earth, and

pretence of suppressing Herresie, and turns Judgment into Gall,
Hemlock, and Wormwood, and in stead of relieving the oppressed,
ads to their burthens.</p>
            <p>Friends, dwell above all these things, and the Devil and his rage;
the earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse of it; we cannot be banished
from Gods presence, neither shall they fulfil their determination, or
ever be able to root out that testimony which is among us, for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
shall be given for its Ransome, and Kingdoms and Nations for
its prosperity. The God of power strengthen you all, that you may
quit your selves like men of God, like children of the most high, whose
inheritance is not here in the world, but in the Kingdom that fades
not away: The Lord God of power be with you, and make you to
consider what I say, and to receive this my true love unto you all for
the Lord<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> sake, who partakes with all the suffering members of Christ
in their bonds, and shall and can rejoyce in all your comfort and joy.
The peace of God dwell in your hearts, and his heavenly light shine
upon all your tabernacles, that you may be as beautiful in the eyes
of the Lord as the Roses of <hi>Sharon,</hi> and blossom as the Lillies of the
valley, and yield your fruit as the Fig-tree that casteth not his fruit.
The Lord takes our part, let none doubt of that, and pleads our cause,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47343:5"/>
let all consider that; our enemies shall see it, and be troubled at this,
and time shall manifest it: therefore be of believing hearts, and trust
in the Lord, so shall you never be confounded, neither be ashamed,
but be as mount <hi>Sion</hi> that cannot be moved, and as the mountains are
round about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so shall the mercies of the Lord compasse you
about from this time forth and for evermore. Friends, Faith is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in my heart, and Love in my reins, and Gladnesse in my soul, and
Peace in my conscience, so that none doth or can hinder my rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
praised be the Lord for ever, and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
