            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THose many Favours that I have received by your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Approbation of my unmeriting Endeavors were too considerable to be passed by without my remembrance, or immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Gulf of Oblivion without my acknowledgment with thanks for the same; yet upon a review of what is done, methinks it appears so slender a piece of service, that I do indeed question your Acceptance.

            <opener>
               <salute>Friendly Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Here present thee with a Treatise in our own Language, that is, plain English, which I assure you is one of the best Pieces of its kind, and will, I question not, be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to all those who understand not the Latine, and yet are willing to be acquainted with the Mystery of Physick; and therefore to omit all other <hi>Prolegomena's,</hi> I come to speak something to the Book in general and particular.</p>
            <p>The Book is generally Chymical, and turned into as good English as the matter (without too much swelling the Book with impertinent words) would bear; and therefore for thy convenience and satisfaction I have added an Explanatory Table, to give the meaning of those words, which perhaps may not seem plain to every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as <hi>Dysentery, Haemorrhage, Narcotick, Sudorisick,</hi> &amp;c. But yet there are three or four words, which I do confess remain doubtful to me what English to give them; and therefore I have put them in the English, as I found them in the
<pb facs="tcp:59520:4"/>
Latine, that those who pretend to be Learned, may give their own sence of them. And the first is <hi>Sem. Cinae,</hi> mentioned in the Powder called <hi>Species Diamercurii,</hi> and in the Water called <hi>Aqua contra Vermes.</hi> The second is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphyllorum,</hi> mentioned in the Powder called <hi>Species Diajovis,</hi> and in the <hi>Marmelada Hyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> The third is <hi>Boletus Cervinus,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Species Diaveneris, Confectio Satyrii, Confectio Pacifica,</hi> and divers other Medicines: so that did I not think it a piece of modesty or honesty to translate them into such words as my Iudgment thought most congruous, there being no Authority for it but Opinion, and in so doing I should have abused both Reader and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and therefore I fairly expose them to every Reader that either is, or thinks himself able to give the true meaning of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In that Medicine called <hi>Morsuli Martiales,</hi> the Author hath prescribed half an ounce of Oyl of Cinamon, which I judge should be but half a dram; for half an ounce of that Oyl will cost of it self about forty shillings or three pound, and so make the Medicine too chargeable for common use: Hence I conclude it a mistake of the Printer, putting half an ounce for half a dram; yet I have in the English followed the Latine Prescript.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Species Confectio Anacardinae</hi> being the first Ingredient mentioned in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb facs="tcp:59520:4"/>
of the Water called <hi>Aqua Xyloaloe,</hi> is a Composition of it self, and may be found in the Dispensatory of <hi>Valerius Cordus,</hi> pag. 83.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, In several places of this Book the Author commands things to be duly gathered, as Peony in the <hi>Aqua Epileptica,</hi> in the <hi>Spiritus Vini Cephalicus,</hi> in the <hi>Elixir Poeoniae,</hi> and other places; there is no more designed by that, but to gather them Astrologically, in the hour of that Planet governing the same, the Planet at the same time being strong, also Angular, and every way fortified if possible.</p>
            <p>Thou hast three several Tables; The first, of the Sections, in which thou mayst see the general Heads and Matter of the whole Book: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of all the distinct Medicines Alphabetically set down under the Letter beginning the first word of the Medicine, as <hi>Oleum Balsami</hi> under <hi>O,</hi> and <hi>Sal Apoplecticum</hi> under <hi>S,</hi> and so of the rest. The third Table shews the Diseases that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in this Book cure, and for the Printers ease and the Readers convenience, they are brought under as few Heads as may be: For instance sake thus, <hi>Burning Feaver, Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and <hi>Hungarian Feaver,</hi> and others of that denomination, are all brought under the word <hi>Feaver.</hi> Likewise <hi>Wind in the Stomach, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Stomach, Diseases of the Stomach,</hi> &amp;c. are all brought under the word <hi>Stomach,</hi> and so are Diseases of the Matrix brought under
<pb facs="tcp:59520:5"/>
the word <hi>Womb,</hi> and so of the rest, which thou wilt no sooner see but understand them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I recommend it to thy Perusal, not desiring thy Commendation of it beyond its Merit, nor expecting thee so disingenuous, as to condemn it without a cause; but wishing thy impartial Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as if the Author hereof were thy real friend. But what need I say more to this purpose; for Books have their Horoscopes as well as Men, and therefore by consequence, Fate too.
<q>
                  <l>Habent sua Fata Libelli.</l>
                  <l>Fate is not bound to Man, to Prince or State;</l>
                  <l>But Books have also their peculiar Fate.</l>
               </q>
And this Fate of Books is wrapt up in the Opinion and Iudgment of every Reader; for according as he understands, so he reports, and according to his Credit, so he is believed in the World; and therefore hard is the Fate of Authors, if thus to be dealt with. But I leave it with thee, hoping that my pains may be thy profit and advantage, which if it be, and that thou art satisfied with my well wishes and endeavours, 'tis all that is either desired or expected</p>

            <lg>
               <l>HAil gentle Muses of <hi>Parnassus</hi>'s hill,</l>
               <l>Inspire my Genius by your glorious skill,</l>
               <l>To speak the praises of this worthy Piece</l>
               <l>Transcendently excelling <hi>Jason</hi>'s golden Fleece.</l>
               <l>He! for his lucre and his envy too</l>
               <l>The <hi>Trojan</hi>'s Treasure got, but this not so:</l>
               <l>This the <hi>Commune Bonum</hi> may be said,</l>
               <l>The best Translation that our Wits have made.</l>
               <l>Each joynt's unstirr'd, each knot so well unty'd,</l>
               <l>That nothing can be exquisite beside.</l>
               <l>Long hath bright <hi>Adrian</hi> eclipsed been;</l>
               <l>But now there's no defect that can be seen:</l>
               <l>Long hath his Treasure been obscure and hid;</l>
               <l>But now all difficulties are forbid.</l>
               <l>The Sacred Key we wanted of this Store;</l>
               <l>But now the passage's free, what need we more?</l>
               <l>Diseases now may flye from <hi>Britain</hi>'s Isle,</l>
               <l>And Health without controul may raign and smile.</l>
               <l>This Antidote, like Mists before the Sun,</l>
               <l>Distempers dissipates, and makes them run.</l>
               <l>Here's a whole Army of such Sacred Charms,</l>
               <l>As conquers perfectly all Mortal's harms.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ampusa</hi> trembles, and each Mortal's foe</l>
               <l>Impressions cannot make or breed us woe.</l>
               <l>As long as <hi>Mynsicht</hi> thus is made our own,</l>
               <l>What greater kindness to the Nation's shown?</l>
               <l>Peruse, kind Reader, and admire my Friend,</l>
               <l>Let all the Universe his Praise extend,</l>
               <l>Extol his Name, and lift it up so high,</l>
               <l>That it may meet and kiss Eternity:</l>
               <l>For this I'm sure there can be none more fit</l>
               <l>Or trusty to translate this, speaketh it</l>

               <p>THIS glorious and mysterious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, by reason of the unworthy and ungrateful Sons of the World, was hidden and obscured, lest this Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick Gemm should seem to be cast among Swine; nevertheless, out of affection to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian love, and the impulse of the Deity, I was willing to make it publick; and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mysteries, which I have gained from the Light of Nature, and the inquiry of Grace; or have found by the scrutiny of my own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or hath been revealed to me by the good will of excellent Spagyrick Artists, and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Searchers into the things of Nature, I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicate to the Sons of Learning and Experience; yet I do appoint it as a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt, that this healthy and celestial comfort may be received with a pleasant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,

               <p>
                  <hi>The Preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TAke native Vitriol green, and known to the Philosophers only, or for want of that, the Crystals of Vitriol of <hi>Venus</hi> well cleansed, sublimely mundified, and free from all its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial quality; put it into a strong and well luted Retort, increase the fire by degrees, till it produceth a reddish Oyl, which carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve: the use of it shall be shewed hereafter. Then take the Caput mortuum which is left in the bottom of the Vessel, and pour upon it an appropriate Menstruum, and set it in a cold place, and it will shoot into Crystals of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and savour of Vitriol. Calcine the Caput mortuum the second time, and proceed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is directed, and it will again produce new Crystals almost of the same kind, but less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to this Mystery. Repeat this labour so often and so long, till no more smell remains in the Vitriol; and then lastly calcine the Caput mortuum throughly, but Philosophically, and extract from it its Salt, which will be excellent and pleasant to the taste, which also preserve in hope of the following doctrine, and in the mean time be mindful of what hath been spoken:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You may by due rectifying of the terrene part, find a true occult Medicinal Stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then take the fore-mentioned Oyl, and pour into it Water, in that dissolve filings of Steel, and prepare Vitriol of it, which dissolve in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled Rain-water, that the Crystal may the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59520:11"/>
better appear, which labour you shall so often repeat, till you have the pure from the impure, and that the Crystals appear clear and pellucid, without dimness and obscurity. From these Crystals of <hi>Mars</hi> in the former manner distil a red Oyl, and let it be well rectified, lest any of the flegm should remain in it: Then you shall have the blood of the red Lion, that is, a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Sulphur of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> together, of excellent virtue, and this taken from <hi>Vulcan,</hi> according to that saying:
<q>
                     <l>Mulciberis capti Marsque Venusque dolis.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This being done, extract from the Caput mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum a Salt void of all smell of <hi>Mars,</hi> prepare it after the same manner as is already shewed in the Extraction of Salt of Vitriol of <hi>Venus.</hi> Both these Salts mix together in equal weight, put it into some open Glass-vessel, and set it in a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or other cold place, where it may resolve it self into a Mercurial water: Then take the solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from that again draw fresh Crystals; and then you will have a duplicate Mercury, the Salt of Sapience and Nature, the Salt of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, under which is hidden the Basis of the World. And this duplicate Mercury being wrapped in a hood of obscurity, was never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested so plainly by any of the Philosophers as by my self, although in certain obscure words it was delivered by them; which was not easie to be understood, till by the search of more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious men, the thing was further sought into: and this Mercury is called by the Philosophers <hi>Rebis,</hi> which is as it were the terrestrial Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure discovered by the mercy of God, an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of the best and greatest knowledge which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59520:12"/>
you must reserve for the following use.</p>
               <p>Take the Mercury now mentioned, and that red Sulphur, those two joyn Philosophically by the rule of Reason and Understanding, and let the Spagyrick Vessel, in which they are mixed, be three parts empty, and the fourth part only filled with the Medicine; this seal Hermetically, and manage it with a Philosophical fire by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in a continual heat, till the whole mass be coagulated and brought into the form of a stone: Which being done, you may, if you please, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into its forms principally, and in a short time render it more noble and illustrious; and so you have made the great Mystery. If you are curious, you may observe before the Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation a wonderful appearance of many things, and many colours also: all which consider well, honour God, and accommodate your Neighbour.</p>

of Gold, broken into piece like Hazel-nuts, the quantity of a pound or less, put it into a Cornuta, or other Spagyrick Vessel, and with a gentle clear fire distil it, the work being made secure and all well luted, and let the matter in the bottom not melt, but sweat only without burning, that it may send forth a sweet and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Water, which is of great price. And indeed by the benefit of this Spagyrick Art, a pound of the Mineral will scarce cast forth by sweat the quantity of a spoonful of water; therefore you may reiterate this labour with new Mineral until you think you have water suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for your purpose. Then rectifie this water eight or nine times, that the pure may be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the impure; which being done, let it be reserved for use as the true Arcanum and Hermetical Treasure: and he that knows how to transmute this water into a viscous and vivid liquor, hath really that most secret and rare Key which is known but to a few, by which that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Castle that is fenced with a threefold Wall, is most easily recluded, and by the thread of wisdom he legitimately enters to those Treasures hidden in Gold: But this work is the following labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now take the best Arabick Gold, with Antimony according to Art purified to the height, and wrought into thin plates by the Goldsmith or otherwise, and then without any other additament it may be brought into a most fine Powder; or if you know how without Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosives to prepare a fine Calx of the Sun Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, you may do it with more profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then put of this most secret Powder what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity you will into a Philosophical Glass, and

               <p>BY this Arcanum the wiser Physicians not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conserved (by the will of God) the health and strength of the body, and prolonged life for many years, but also they cured the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsie, the Apoplexy, the Elephantiasis, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, Melancholy, Madness, Quartan Agues, Sciatica, Gout, pains in the Joynts, Dropsie, yellow Jaundice, Pox, Asthma, Phthisis, Pleurisie, Itch and Scurff, Cancers, Noli me tangere, and the like dangerous humane Diseases of this kind by other Remedies incurable; and this done by the strength of the fire contained in it, which doth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59520:14"/>
not only consume the lethal humors, but also doth repair and renovate the very marrow in the Bones, and raise and succour the whole humane body, though half dead. And one thing is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noted of this Medicine, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it self a most powerful and diaphoretick force: Therefore whosoever is willing to use this Remedy, especially if he labours under any of the fore-mentioned Diseases, let him repair to his Bed for one or two hours, and prepare for a Sweat, and it will cast it out sweetly and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully without any pain, and leave nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure or superfluous in the Body. To young men who desire a long life, it is given once a month, and the day he takes it, let him forbear both meat and drink till the evening, by which means the virtue of the Medicine will grow into a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical equality with the humors, and the strength of the Body will increase more and more, the natural beauty will increase, and out-do the art of paint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> giving a comliness pleasing and conspicuous to every beholder. But to those who labour under the before-mentioned Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, it ought to be given ten days successively in Vehicles proper and appropriate to the Disease, and so (God willing) they will be restored to their pristine health, as much as Art and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine can perform. To old people it is given twice a month, and by the Providence of God it preserves their Intellectuals firm and entire, and in their greatest age it renders their bodies vigorous and fresh even to their graves. To young Women and Virgins this Arcanum is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven four times a week at the New Moon, it keeps Nature in its due current, and every part
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59520:14"/>
of the body in order. Also if you should give it to a Woman who is long in Labour, and though the Birth were hindred by the bigness of the Child, yet immediately after the wished for Infant will be brought forth almost without any pain. If it be given to Women whose Courses have left them, it keeps them fresh, lusty, and fair, and sometimes it causes their Terms to come again, so that they are made capable of Child-bearing. It also cures the Pestilence, and if any Carbuncle should appear, it dispels the matter of it, and by a friendly Sweat drives forth the cause of it: For which great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mystery we ascribe honour to Jehovah and the individual Trinity for ever and ever.</p>

Also against nauseating and windiness of the Stomach and Sides, yellow Jaundice, Dropsie, Tertian, Quartan, and other chronical, continual, putrid and acute Feavers, Love-potions, poisonous Draughts, cholerick Pleurisies, and all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases in general that Choler hath a share in. It is also good against that poisonous Dysentery that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth commonly in the Plague. Also against the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59520:19"/>
Hangarian disease it is an excellent, divine, and safe remedy. If any have unadvisedly or unawares ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poisonous Meats or Drinks, or swallowed Flies, Spiders, and such like; also little Fish-bones, and other such like things sticking in the Throat, or from other things which are brought into the Stomach, by Inchantments, as hairs, nails, pins, yarn, or other prodigious things of that kind that are dangerous to life, are all removed by the wonderful effects of this Vomit. The Dose is from four to five and six grains, especially in robust bodies, in any appropriate Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, taken two or three hours before or after meals, or at any time in necessity. But this is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That neither this nor any other Vomits may be given to every one without danger; but they are to be given to those only, who are apt to vomit, that have a strong stomach, a wide throat, and are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to vomit, and in whom the peccant humors are naturally carried upwards. But cholerick men, and those who abhor vomiting, or have weak brains, or any weakness or imperfection in the Head, which doth properly reside there, and is not caused by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from other parts of the body: All those who have Phthisicks, Asthma's, Coughs, Colicks, spit blood, are subject to be feaverish, those who have internal Imposthumes, or inveterate and confirmed obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Mesentery, Liver, and Spleen, or have schirrous Tumors in those parts, or have any of their principal members hurt: Also all those who have their spirits exhausted by burning and pestilential Feavers, all those who are troubled with a nausea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the stomach, that they are not able to contain either meat or drink, (which is not from any inherent matter in the Ventricle, that Nature endeavours to cast off by Vomit, but it riseth accidentally from the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59520:19"/>
effects of the parts adjacent) all these are to abstain from Vomits. Lastly, as well Women with Child as other Women and Virgins, who are troubled with the obstruction of their Terms, not rising from the impurity of the Bowels, but from the obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Veins only which pass into the Womb, these likewise are to forbear Vomits. It is to be noted also, when any one begins to vomit, it is usual to give them Broth made of Pulse or flesh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fat, or a draught of warm drink; and if it be needful to reiterate the same, that so the Vomit may work the easier, and the motion of the Medicine may be hastened.</p>

The operation of it chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in cutting humors, in dissipating, mundifying, drying, contracting, and resisting putrefaction, and by its tartness it restrains thirst. Hence it is a most excellent Medicine in all Feavers, whether malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, pestilential, putrid, Hungarian, or Epidemical, which from a sulphureous, astral, and poisonous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence are caused and kindled in mens bodies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it a Bezoardick property, by which it often moves Sweat and Urine, and consumes all internal, fervid, noxious Vapors; it also purgeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the Stomach by a natural heat, and helps it in Concoction; it stirs up the Appetite, takes away putrefaction, and the cause of a stinking Breath; it also kills the Worms, which are the effects of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and Crudity. It is also a most profitable Remedy for all Hepatick diseases, and for those who have their Faces painted with red Pustles, or are subject to a Diarrhoea. It is an useful Medicine in the Quincy, pestilential Pleurisie, Tumors of the Spleen, putrid Gonorrhoea, the Whites in Women, the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and the like. The Dose is from four or six grains to eight or ten in Conserves, Electuaries, Syrups, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps, or other convenient Liquors. In cold distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers it is given mixt with Wine; but in Feavers in Barley-water. In Diarrhoea's and imperfections of the Liver, as also in a Gonorrhoea and Fluxes in Women it is given mixed with Conserve of red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that it may become tart, and red like blood.

               <p>TO accomplish and perfect this Arcanum, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with singular care and study the following dissolving Menstruum: Take Nitre cleansed, Spirit of Vitriol rectified, of each equal parts, distil it in Sand in a Retort, observing degrees in your fire. And this first time, when the fire hath been at the height, and is again abated, pour out the Liquor and weigh it, and add to it the same quantity in weight of Spirit of Wine Alkoholisated, and pour it on your Nitre again, and draw it off as at first, keeping a gentle fire in the beginning of your work, lest the Spirit of Wine should fly too soon; then gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually increase your fire to the fourth degree, until you can perceive no more to rise. This labour is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in about three hours, ere you get your fire to the fourth degree; lastly you will see your Retort red-hot: from which, when it is cold, you may take your Receiver, and your Menstruum is prepared ready for use, and in the bottom of your Retort you shall find a very little white matter almost void of taste. Then take of the Oriental Bezoar-stone finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an ounce, put it into a small glass Cucurbit, and pour upon it of this Menstruum (last mentioned) as much as will stand above the Medicine three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and set it in <hi>Balneo</hi> with a moderate heat, and in the space of two or three hours the Menstruum will turn the Bezoar-stone into a red colour. Pour off this solution, and what still remains undissolved, pour upon it again the fore-mentioned Menstruum after the same manner as before, and again put that into a Bath, and repeat this work till it is all dissolved; and when it is so, put all the tinged Menstruum into a Cucurbit, and with an Alembick draw it off gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59520:27"/>
which being done, pour Spirit of Wine upon the mass left in the bottom, and again draw that off as before, and so do the second and third time (remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring to add new Spirit of Wine each time) until you can perceive no more acrimony of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum left; then again pour upon it water of Harts-horn, or other Cordial water, and again set it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> till all the Extract is dissolved in this Liquor: afterward filter it through a Paper, and evaporate it, that about four ounces may remain, which keep as the most excellent Treasure among all earthly things for your use. How this water of Harts-horn is truly and peculiarly prepared, shall be shewed in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Waters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virtue, Use, and Dose.</hi> This most noble and more than Royal Medicine is a singular Antidote against Poison of every kind, but chiefly against noxious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors of a poisonous quality, and pestilential infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reigning in the habit of the body, and afflicting the vital Faculty, which it expels by Sweat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible Transpiration, and roborates the Heart, and all other of the principal internal parts. This I have found by Experience, that it operates with great vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and force against all sudden and dangerous affects produced from pestilential Poison, in Feavers, the small Pox, Epidemical Pleurisies, the Hungarian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and all other diseases which arise from the same causes: neither is it used with less success against the Erysipelas and other poisonous Symptoms where Diaphoretick Bezoars are required; it is an enemy to all putrefaction and malignity, and it mundifies the blood. The Dose is from a scruple to a dram in proper Vehicles. It is also given to the sick in some Potion to be drunk, and not to put him into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat, (therefore it may be taken early in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59520:28"/>
morning, or if need require, at any other time of the day, being guided by your reason) lest it should weaken and abate the strength of the Patient by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too much vent for the Spirits; and yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the Patient be warm, and do gently sweat, as much as may be without the debilitation and decrease of strength. Moreover this Medicine may be given two or three times or more, according to the condition of the Patient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions and Constitutions of bodies, to Women with Child, to Children and Infants, without any hurt or danger, especially if the state of the disease be such, that they dare not give those hot Theriacal and Alexiterical Antidotes. But if the condition of the sick seems so to require, that a Vein should be opened, or the body cleansed by some Vomit or Purge, these things ought first to be done, and after, if need be, some Sudorifick given. Also if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Patient be such, that he cannot sweat easily, as indeed many such are sometimes found, when such a Patient shall be committed to your care that cannot sweat, though covered never so warm, and other means used to force it; give a Dose of this Arcanum, and it will work either by Vomit, or Stool, or by Urine, or some other insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Perspiration, like a pestilential Vulnerary that drives the peccant matter from the Centre to the Emunctories and out of the body, and no other ways doth it invade the malignity; therefore we may also expect the same effect from this Antidote which in other cases and bodies is produced from Sweat-driving Medicines. Also in the giving of it great care is to be taken, lest any thing of Vinegar, or other sharp Liquor be mixed with it, nay any acetous Syrups are also forbidden, as Syrup of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59520:28"/>
Goose-berries, Barberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Bezoar may be precipitated another way, which will fall to the bottom of the Vessel like Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and not easily dissolve. But if any should read this, especially one ignorant of the Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and will not believe, or doth not know the efficacy and power of this Divine Medicine, let him prove it in this manner: let him give poison to a Pigeon, Hen, Dog, Cat, or any other Animal, and when it is ready to dye, then let him give it of this Medicine in some appropriate Vehicle, and he may see what is to be done by the works of his Creator. Moreover I have often proved it, and by the Grace of God I have given it with wonderful success among the infected, in acute Diseases, the Plague, <hi>Petechia,</hi> poisonous Draughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lastly, it is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this Potable Bezoar is not to be kept in Venice or Bohemian Glasses, but in thick German Glasses, for the more sure keeping of its spiritual virtue, for which give praise and honour to God.</p>

that he may have a third, and of the happy success let no man doubt. But if the Patient should cast up the Medicine by Vomit, repeat it again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, yea though he should retain it, for it is not sufficient to give one Dose only; but give it so, that it may cast the pestilential Poison out of the body with power and safety, repeat this Alexipharmack Sudorifick five or six times in two days: Which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is often neglected, how many may be saved which dye, and this noble Medicine is defamed!

When his Sweat is over, let his body be dryed with clean Linen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately warm, but take great care lest the expulsed Poison be driven in again by too cold Air; let the Sheets and Blankets of the Bed be changed: And if the sick were tyred with sweating, let him use com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and refreshing Meats, as new-laid Eggs, Broth, Ptisans, and such like, which are pleasant, and nourish much in a small quantity. The Dose is from half a scruple to a scruple: But if he be seized with the Plague, or his case be desperate, let him take at first half a dram or two scruples in our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Harts-horn, Treacle, or Carduus benedictus, or let him take it in any other appropriate Vehicle, and sweat; for it doth most powerfully drive all Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son out of the body by its Diaphoretick force; for you will see the whole body flow with sweat.

                  <hi>Virtue, Use, and Dose.</hi> There is not a more noble and efficacious Medicine in the whole Republick of Physick for the Stomach than this is, as I can justifie by Experience; and therefore I will be brief in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring its Virtues. It is an incomparable Medicine in all distempers of the Stomach, and is given in our Stomach-water or in water of water Mint, or in any other appropriate Liquor. It comforts the Stomach and Intestines exceedingly, and warms all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Members debilitated by Cold, and provokes Appetite. Moreover it preserves from the Epilepsie and Apoplexy, purgeth the Brain, drys the Head and whole Body oppressed with flegmatick Humors and Catarrhs, and defends the Head from pain. In the Epilepsie it is given in Peony-water, Lily of the valley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In pains of the Head, often proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the impurities of the Stomach afflicting the Brain, it is given in Betony-water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all Feavers it is given in water of the lesser Centaury, Carduus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The dose is from half a scruple to a scruple.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Commonly two Clysters a day may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, or at the most three, beyond which it is not safe to proceed, and let there be at least four hours between each of them.</p>

And this is the way of using it: Let the Patient anoint it often in the day with a black Hens feather, till the Crust falls off, and the part be perfectly restored (but let no other external Applications or Ligatures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be used.)</p>

            <head>THE EPILOGUE.</head>
            <p>THus at length, benevolent Reader, by the favour of God I have finished this new Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Medico-Chymical Compositions, increased and inriched with many Additions, and this with much diligence used in revising, correcting and amending (where perhaps any thing amiss, or less fit for Publick use had casually slipt in) which Edition so revised, corrected and amended is such, as not in Title only, but in very deed it proves it self a real Treasury and Store-house of Medico-Chymical Preparations, most efficacious in expelling all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of humane Bodies: Yet I doubt not, but I shall find some Hadriano-Mastiges, like Dogs, barking and biting at, sometimes this and sometimes that in this my Work, and not only at the Work, but the Author himself also. And if perhaps they cannot disparage the Work as being good in it self, and already enough praised by the most expert Physicians, yet will they calumniate me the Author, (I say next to God) me the Author of this Work. And these, as I have already found, snarling and biting, are not of one sort, but of divers. Some of them not having any thing like it, much less better; (therefore it is plain, either they are wholly unwilling to excel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred perhaps by Envy, if not Idleness, or which is most probable, a non-ability) and what is my real Work, by the Grace of God, they ascribe
<pb facs="tcp:59520:199"/>
to the borrowed Labours of others, lest the proper Author should injoy the Reputation due to his Merit, (which he himself denies to none who deserves it) and already set up in the Temple of Fame (by all good men) as a token of Gratitude. Which that they may throw down, or at least asperse with blots of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, they use their best endeavour, casting abroad divers suggestions, but those vain and frivolous. The chiefest, and which they think will carry the Prize, is this: Art is long and tedious in attaining, mans life short; How then can it be (say they) that these so many singular Experiments diffused through the whole Art of Physick (struggling with a most long Experience and Practice) can be the work of one man? I could here, if I would, make long Recitals, what, and how much others before me have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med singly and alone, both in this and other Faculties not only to their own praise, but to the admiration of others, and not in any extraordinary number of years neither; but letting them pass, I will now speak to my own Work, performed by the Blessing of God, that when I am dead, my Labours may speak for me. I confess I found the Work difficult and toilsom; but yet (by Gods assistance) so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, that by the Light of Grace and Nature, and with great Cost, I have found out and discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such things, as have been happily used and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, in the many and divers cures of great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and others in the current of my life, which I am not now afraid (desiring to promote the Publick Good) to expose to the whole World. Which things thus published by me, if they shall enviously proceed in denying them to be mine alone, let them go on, and shew by what other persons they have been found out, and by whom communicated to me.

But this demonstration being likely to fail, another sort worse than the first, supplying their places, and aiding their Malice, whenas whatever is performed in this Treatise, is neither in it self, nor otherwise discommendable, being like good Wine, its own <hi>Bush,</hi> they ascribe all to a familiar Spirit. They did well, if by this Spirit they chiefly meant him by whom all things are wrought in all, from whom and in whom, and by whom all things are, in whom we are, live, and move, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Divine and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Spirit, familiar to all good men, of whom a Heathen Poet, acknowledging his gifts, says:
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Est Deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo,</l>
                     <l>Sedibus aethereis Spiritus ille venit. </l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>God moves in us, seen by our vital heat,</l>
                     <l>Sent from above from his Aethereal seat.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
To whom alone, as Giver and Mover of all things, whatsoever is good I ascribe as received from him, and that he may still remain in communion, and be merciful and propitious to me, is always my daily prayer: Again, if in a secondary and subordinate respect, they intended or designed under the Name of a familiar Spirit, the Spirit given me by the gift of the Omnipotent, whereby as a subservient and instrumental Cause, it being moved and instructed by its Principle, I was enabled to take this Labour upon me, and bring it to effect, I mean the Power, Genius and Faculties of my Mind, informed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned and confirmed by Art, Use and Experience: which Spirit, unless I should have always familiar to me, and never separated from my actions, sayings and thoughts, there would be but little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me and a <hi>Brute,</hi> a <hi>Trunk,</hi> or a <hi>Stock:</hi> I say, if they
<pb facs="tcp:59520:200"/>
meant this Spirit, they meant right. But whereas by apparent signs it appears what Spirit they point at, <hi>i. e.</hi> that, which committing it self to the service of rash impious men, desiring his privy suggestions, permits it self to be kept sometimes in Crystals, sometimes in Rings, and other sorts of Inclosures, nay to be bought and sold (to the great danger both of Soul and Body) to the Possessors, and that indeed deservedly: but injoying the testimony of God the Searcher of hearts, and of a good Conscience void of those impious Accusations, I account these my Traducers and Detractors, attributing to an evil Daemon the gifts of God divinely bestowed upon me, and which I have used to his Glory and the good of Mankind, worthy of no other Title than what our Lord Christ gave the Pharisees, <hi>A genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vipers,</hi> who ascribed his Divine Works to <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> who being totally evil himself, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all that is bad, can do nothing but ill, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d if he seems to do any thing under the appearance of good, his design is for mischief. They therefore who through Envy and Malice ascribe to the Devil and Satan Gifts divinely given for the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and as they deserve with their Patron a Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and Diabolical Name and Title, so also, unless they repent seriously, they shall not escape a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthy their wicked offence. Besides these, I have experience of the sawciness and audacious boldness of some (whom I may call <hi>Catapancritons)</hi> who according to their custom and Dog-like impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wherewith they bark at, inveigh against, and bite at every thing, and esteem nothing but what is their own, all things else, even the Arts and Liberal Sciences, with their Founders and Favourers (altho' themselves have scarce tasted them) they look on
<pb facs="tcp:59520:201"/>
them with a disdainful frown; neither do they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them only with derision and mocks, but with scurrilous reproaches, terming them vain Trifles, nay Dung and Dross. Without doubt with the same temerity and boldness will they handle me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful in the mean time, poor wretched Fellows, <hi>unseasoned, parboiled, Medicasters</hi> and <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> or to speak more plainly, <hi>Asses in Folio,</hi> how meanly they themselves are furnisht with the knowledge of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick and all other Arts and Sciences. But as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <hi>The more ignorant, the more impudent:</hi> so is it customary with these acute <hi>Zoilus</hi>'s and <hi>Aristarchus</hi>'s (forsooth) that when they cannot become known by their own Worth and Virtue, they endeavour it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, that is, by detracting the Fame of others, and crying up themselves and their own Deeds, they hope for Esteem and Repute, and this chiefly among the ignorant and simple; but remember the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>It is easier to carp than to copy.</hi> But alas what a pitiful Fame and a vain empty Glory is that, which when it comes to the <hi>Touch,</hi> what they so Thrasonically boast of plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes to nothing, and so runs the fortune of <hi>Icarus,</hi> and undergoes the like disgrace, having ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly emulated his temerity, that it becomes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Horace</hi> his Scoff, <hi>Risum teneatis amici.</hi> The Disease which by such an ignominious Event, this affected Glory and repulse draws upon it self (I speak both what I have known and seen) finds no Cure by Chickens boiled over and over again, much less by Sigils, Amulets, Characters, Superstitions, Incantations, Rites, Ceremonies, Figures, Cabali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Tables, Magical Cures, and a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanities, which as it self is mightily pleased in, so it imposeth upon others, under the name of
<pb facs="tcp:59520:201"/>
a more secret sort of Physick. But as to this Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonical Tribe of Censors, admiring only themselves and their own Works according to the supercilious Authority and Licence which they arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Marking</hi> (as the Proverb is) <hi>with a black Coal the Works of others;</hi> but whatever they be, why make I many words? Rats betray themselves by the mark they leave behind them, so our Censors do themselves by their own rash and insipid Judgments: For which they deserve no other reward, than what <hi>Midas</hi> had for his Judgment against <hi>Apollo,</hi> as the old By-word goes, <hi>King</hi> Midas <hi>wears the Asses Ears:</hi> But <hi>Ovid</hi> expresseth it more fully in <hi>Lib. 11.

In the mean time, candid Reader, I shall not desist to improve the Talent that is given me, but improve all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the service of the Physical Republick, and promote whatsoever may accommodate thee. Upon which account I had rather obey the desires of my friends, Princes and Great men, both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this and my former Piece, than fear the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Censures of barking <hi>Zoilus</hi>'s. First of all I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected these things for my own Use and private Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as a Store-house always at hand, where-ever I should be, at home or abroad, and had no thoughts of publishing them; but the Authority of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Physicians of almost all <hi>Germany,</hi> being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with me, and perswading me to a Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prevailed with me to change my mind, and to make those things publick, which were collected only for private use, considering also, that I was not born for my self alone, but also for such as should need my Labours. To such then do I willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate these things of mine, and not to those <gap reason="foreign">

I was unwilling enviously to keep any thing secret, to the end, that he who pleaseth, may to the Glory of God and good of his Neighbour, put
<pb facs="tcp:59520:202"/>
them in practice; and that any one being in peril of Health and Life, and want help, may come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to a Sanctuary, and take hence, as from a well-furnisht <hi>Armory,</hi> wholesom Weapons and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies against all Diseases and Distempers whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the various and manifold use of which, as it abundantly affords, so it evidently approves them to those who make tryal, which all Fundamental and Dogmatical Physicians and safe Practitioners confess with open mouth.
