            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>Beware lest any man spoil you through Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
and vain deceit, after the traditions

and not after Christ.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AD St. <hi>Paul</hi> lived in our Age, it would
have required little less than the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Bravery of the Spirit of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
to have said this: And nothing
but the Authority of so great an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
(which though some men do not
much value, yet they dare not openly
despise) can skreen those, who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to say it after him.</p>
            <p>What some men call Philosophy and Reason (and there
is nothing so foolish and absurd which some men will not
call so), is the only thing which those men adore, who
would either have no God, or a God and a Religion of
their own making. And what Attempts some have made
to undermine all Religion, and others to corrupt and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the whole Frame of the Christian Religion, upon a
pretence of its contradicting Natural Reason and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
is too well known to need a Proof. That thus it was
in his days, and that thus it was likely to be in future Ages,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was very sensible, when he gave this Caution to
his <hi>Colossians;</hi> and I'm sure it is as proper a Caution for
us, as ever it was for any Age since the writing of this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45001:4"/>
Epistle; for this vain Pretence to Reason and Philosophy
never more prevailed, and never did more mischief to the
world.</p>
            <p>It is an endless and fruitless Task to go about to confute
all the absurd Hypotheses and wild inconsistent Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
wherewith men abuse themselves and others: The
Experience of so many Ages wherein Philosophy was in all
its Glory, and the several Sects disputed and wrangled
eternally, without ending any one Controversy, gives no
great Encouragement, to hope for much this way; at least
it can never be expected that ordinary Christians should be
better instructed and confirmed in the Faith by Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Disputes.</p>
            <p>The Christian Religion has from the very beginning
been corrupted by a mixture of Philosophy: Thus it was
in the Apostles days, and thus it has been more or less in
all Ages of the Church to this day; and the direction the
Apostle gives for the security of the Christian Faith, is,
Not to dispute such matters, but to distinguish between
Philosophical Disputes, and Matters of Revelation; and
to reject all the Pretences of Philosophy, when it does or
seems to contradict the Faith of Christ, or would make
any corrupt Additions to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beware lest any man spoil you through Philosophy and vain
deceit;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is to make a Prey, or to carry away as
a Prey; that is, to seduce them from the Christian Faith,
or from the Purity and Simplicity of it: <hi>Through Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
and vain deceit,</hi> that is, through the <hi>vain deceit of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>
which cheats men with a flattering but empty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
may unsettle weak Minds, but cannot lay a
sure and solid foundation of Faith; may cheat men out of
their Faith, but when that is done, can give them nothing
certain in the room of it: For it is but <hi>after the traditions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45001:4"/>
of men,</hi> and <hi>after the rudiments of this world:</hi> Some of
these Doctrines may possibly plead Prescription, as having
been so long received that no man knows their Original;
or if they have the Authority of some Great Name, yet
it is but a Human Authority, and they are but <hi>the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men;</hi> and of men who at best had no better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
than from the visible appearances of Nature, and
their own imperfect Observations, and corrupt or defective
Reasonings, <hi>after the rudiments of this world:</hi> And is this
an Authority to oppose against the Faith of Christ, which
both wants that Divine Confirmation which he gave to
his Doctrines, and contradicts them? For they are <hi>not
after Christ,</hi> neither taught by Christ, nor consonant to
what he taught.</p>
            <p>These Words might afford great Variety of Discourse;
but I shall confine my self to what is most Useful, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that into as narrow a compass as I can, by shewing,</p>
            <p>I. What great need there is of this Caution, To <hi>beware
lest any man spoil us through Philosophy and vain deceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. What great reason we have to reject all these vain
Pretences to Philosophy, when they are opposed to the
Authority of a Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>I. As for the first of these, Whoever considers what an
Enemy these vain Pretences to Philosophy have always
been to Religion, will see need enough for this Caution.</p>
            <p>True Reason, and the true Knowledge of Nature,
which is true Philosophy, would certainly direct us to the
Acknowledgment and Worship of that Supreme Being
who made the World: And yet we know, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was an Atheist without some Pretence to Philosophy,
and generally such loud noisy Pretences too, as make igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45001:5"/>
people think them very notable Philosophers, and
that tempts some vain empty persons to affect Atheism,
that they may be thought Philosophers.</p>
            <p>That this is <hi>vain deceit,</hi> all men must own, who believe
there is a God: And if it be possible to pretend Philosophy
for Atheism it self, it is no great wonder if it be made to
patronize Infidelity and Heresy: But this plainly shews of
what dangerous Consequence it is to admit Philosophical
Disputes into Religion, which if at any time they may do
any service to Religion, much oftner greatly corrupt it,
and shake the very Foundations of it; of which more
anon.</p>
            <p>At present I shall only shew you how the Matter of
Fact stands; That most of the Disputes in Religion are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the Disputes of Philosophy, and therefore
according to the Apostolical Command, to be wholly
flung out of Religion, and not suffered to affect our Faith
one way or other. To be a Philosopher and a Christian,
to Dispute and to Believe, are two very different things;
and yet it is very evident, that most of the Arguments
against Revelation in general, and most of the Disputes
about the particular Doctrines of Christianity, are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than this <hi>vain deceit of Philosophy;</hi> that were the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, and the Disputes of Philosophy truly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
this alone would be sufficient to settle the Faith
of Christians, and restore Peace and Unity, at least in the
great Fundamentals of Religion, to the Christian World.</p>
            <p>1. As to begin with Revelation in general. The Books
of <hi>Moses</hi> are the most Ancient, and that considered, the
best attested History in the World; the whole Nation of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> whose History he writes, pay the greatest vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to him; and if we believe the Matters of Fact
which he relates, he was certainly an Inspired Man, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45001:5"/>
could neither deceive, nor be deceived. And it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to have greater Evidence for the Truth and Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calness
of any Writings, at such a distance of time, than
we have for the Writings of the <hi>New Testament;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Infidels of our Age have very little to say purely
against the Credibility of the History; and then one would
think, that all their other Objections should come too late,
unless they will justify <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in disbelieving <hi>Moses,</hi> and
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in disbelieving our Saviour, after
all the Miracles they did: For if they will disbelieve <hi>Moses</hi>
and Christ, though they have nothing material to object
against the Truth of these Histories; nothing, which they
would allow to be good Objections against any other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
they must by the same reason have disbelieved them,
though they had seen them do all those great Works
which are reported of them in such Credible Histories.
But whatever the Authority of these Books are, they think
they may securely reject them, if they contain any thing
which contradicts their Reason and Philosophy, and they
find a great many such things to quarrel with: They think
<hi>Moses</hi>'s History of the Creation very unphilosophical; That
the Story of <hi>Eve</hi> and the Serpent is an incredible Fiction;
That the Universal Deluge is absolutely impossible, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
with the Principles of Philosophy; and it
does not become Philosophers to have recourse to Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
That what we call Miracles are not the effects of a
Divine Power, but may be resolved into Natural Causes;
That Inspiration and Prophesy is nothing but Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,
and all the Pretences to Revelation a Cheat and
Imposture; That Nature teaches us all that we need to
know; That there is no other certain knowledge but this;
That we are not bound to believe any thing which our
own Reason cannot grasp and comprehend, and therefore
Revelation is perfectly useless; and God himself cannot
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45001:6"/>
oblige us to believe any thing which does not agree with
the Reason of our own Minds, and the Philosophy of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Those who understand the Mystery of Modern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
know that these, and such like, are the wise Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for which they reject and ridicule all Revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and endeavour to rob and spoil men of one of the
greatest Blessings in the World, A Divine Revelation. So
that Infidelity is resolved into these vain Pretences to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
that Men will understand how to make, destroy,
and govern the World better than God.</p>
            <p>2. As these men oppose Reason and Philosophy to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
so others either deny the fundamental Articles
of Christianity for the sake of some Philosophical Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or corrupt the Doctrines of Christianity by a mixture
of Philosophy. The Gospel of our Saviour is the plainest
Revelation of the Will of God that ever was made to the
World; all its Doctrines are easily understood, without
Art and Subtilty; and yet there is not a more nice, intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
perplext thing in the World, than what some men
have made the Christian Faith: All the Subtil Disputes of
Philosophy are brought into the Church; and <hi>Plato</hi> and
<hi>Aristotle</hi> are become as great Apostles, as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or
St. <hi>Paul:</hi> As to give some few Instances of it; for time
will not permit me to discourse it at large.</p>
            <p>What are the <hi>Arian, Socinian, Pelagian</hi> Controversies,
but meer Philosophical Disputes, with which these Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
corrupted the Catholick Faith?</p>
            <p>There is nothing more plain and express in Scripture
than the Faith of <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the
Doctrine of the Trinity in Vnity;</hi> and that great Art and
Subtilty which has been used, and to so little purpose, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
those Texts of Scripture, wherein this Doctrine is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
is an evident proof, That this is the plain, natural
obvious sense of those Texts, since it requires so much Art
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45001:6"/>
and Criticism to put any other sense on them; and that
will not do neither, till men are resolved rather to make
any thing of Scripture, than to find <hi>a real Trinity</hi> there.
If then this Faith be so plainly contained in Scripture,
what makes all this dispute about it? What makes those,
who profess to believe the Scripture, so obstinate against
this Faith? Truly that which makes some men Infidels,
makes others Hereticks, that is, a vain pretence to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</p>
            <p>The first Philosophical Dispute is about the Divine
Unity: We all own with the Scripture, that there is but
One God; but we say further, as the Scripture teaches us,
<hi>That there are Three, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, each
of which is true and perfect God.</hi> This they say is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
and if it be so, there is an end of this Faith,
for both parts of a Contradiction can't be true: But to be
Three and One upon different accounts, and in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
senses, is no Contradiction; for thus Three may
be One, and One Three; and this is all the Scripture
teaches, or that we profess to believe, whatever the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of this Distinction and Unity be: But this will not
satisfy these Philosophical Wits, unless they can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
how Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are really and
distinctly Three, and essentially One, the manner of which
the Scripture gives no account of, and therefore this is no
Dispute in Faith, but only in Philosophy.</p>
            <p>Another Objection concerns the Divine Generation,
how God can beget a Son of his own Substance; which
the <hi>Arians</hi> thought inferred a division of the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>And a Third Objection concerns an Eternal Generation;
how it is possible that the Father should beget an Eternal
Son; that the Son should be begotten without any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45001:7"/>
of Being; and that the Father should not be at least
some few moments before the Son, and consequently the
Son not Eternal. Now we all grant that we can give no
Philosophical account of this, no more than we can of
the simple Divine Essence, or of Eternity it self; but we
may believe that God has an Eternal Son, as we do that
there is an Eternal God, without knowing how any thing
is Eternal: These are Disputes in Philosophy, and such as
none but vain men will dispute about, as being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
above our Comprehension, and therefore no reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Objection against our Faith.</p>
            <p>This as for the Doctrine of the Incarnation, nothing
can be plainer in Scripture, than that <hi>the Son of God was
made man;</hi> That <hi>the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among
us;</hi> That <hi>God was manifest in the flesh:</hi> And all the disputes
about this Article are purely Philosophical: Some men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it, because they cannot understand how God and Man
can be united in one Person: Others confound the Divine
and Human Nature, as <hi>Eutyches</hi> did; or divide the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as <hi>Nestorius</hi> did; both which indeed destroy the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Incarnation; for the Word is not made Flesh,
unless the same Person, who is God, is Man too, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
perfect God and perfect Man after this Union: But
all these disputes concern the Philosophy of the Union of
the Divine and Human Nature in Christ; and if we
would separate between Faith and Philosophy, such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
might soon be ended.</p>
            <p>Thus most of the difficulties in the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarticular</hi>
Controversy, are ultimately resolved into mere
Philosophical disputes about Fate and Prescience, Liberty
and Necessity, and God's concourse with Creatures, or the
Powers of Nature and Grace: And would time permit,
it were easy to shew this in most of the Controversies of
Religion, That it is not what God has revealed, and what
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45001:7"/>
he requires us to believe, but such Nice Philosophical
Questions as men raise about these matters, which occasion
all these disputes.</p>
            <p>It has often been proposed as a means of Union to silence
all disputes, To confine our selves to Scripture-Words and
Expressions, without determining the signification of
them: But this would make only an Agreement in Words,
not a Consent in Opinions; nor could it secure the Peace
of the Church, while all men knew, that under the same
form of Words, they had very different and contrary
Meanings, which would still make them as much Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
to each other, as if their Words did as expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
each other, as their Faith. But would men reduce
all their disputes to Scripture, and make that the only Rule
of their Faith, without intermixing any Philosophical
disputes with it, this would be an infallible means of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for it is only this vain pretence to Philosophy, which
raises all these disputes, and then tempts men to pervert
the Scriptures to justify their Philosophy.</p>
            <p>In all these cases we are concerned to enquire what the
true sense of the Article is; for this the Scripture teaches,
and so far our Faith is concerned; and these are not only
justifiable, but necessary disputes, if the true Faith be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
And such were the disputes of the Catholick
Fathers with the <hi>Sabellian, Arian,</hi> and <hi>Photinian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
Whether Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, were only
Three Names, or Three Appearances and Manifestations
of the same One single Person, or any other Three, but
Three True, Proper, Coeternal, and Coequal Persons:
Or whether He, who is in Scripture called the Son of God,
be a Creature, though the most Excellent Creature; or a
Son, and God by Nature, truly begotten of his Father's
Substance: Or whether Christ be God Incarnate, or a
meer Man: And their ancient Creeds pretended to no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45001:8"/>
more, than to teach what the Catholick Faith was, not
to expound the Philosophy of the Trinity and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And thus far we must explain the Faith, as to
know, and to let others know, what it is we believe; and
if to assert the ancient Catholick Faith against old and
new Heresies, should be called New Explications, we
cannot help it; for we must explain what the Scripture
teaches about these Articles, and how the Catholick
Church always understood them: But that which we are
to beware of, is, Not to mix Philosophy with our Faith,
nor to admit of any mere Philosophical Objections against
the Faith, nor to attempt any Explications of these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
beyond what the Scriptures, and the Faith and
Practice of the Catholick Church will justify.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Importunity of Hereticks did very often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the Catholick Fathers in Philosophical disputes; but
this they did, not to explain the Christian Mysteries by
Philosophy, but only to shew, that as incomprehensible
as these Mysteries are, the Philosophy of Hereticks, and
their Objections against these Articles, were very absurd:
And such disputes as these may sometimes be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and of great use to shame these vain Pretences to
Philosophy, while we do not put the Trial of our Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Issue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us now consider what great reason we
have to reject all the vain Pretences to Reason and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
when opposed to a Divine Revelation. For that
is all the Apostle intends in this Caution; not to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the use of Reason, or the study of Philosophy, which
are great Improvements, and a delightful Entertainment
of Human Minds, and with a wise and prudent Conduct
may be very serviceable to Religion too; but we must not
set up any Conclusions in Philosophy against the Christian
Faith, nor corrupt the Faith with a mixture of Philosophy,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45001:8"/>
nor reject any revealed Truths, for want of Natural Ideas
to conceive them by.</p>
            <p>To shorten this Discourse as much as I can; I shall at
present only shew you what reason we have to believe
those Doctrines which are thought the most mysterious
and inconceivable, notwithstanding any Objections from
Natural Reason and Philosophy against them. And the
account of this must be resolved into the Nature, Use,
and Authority of Revelation; that Revelation, as to such
matters as are knowable only by Revelation, must serve
instead of Sense, Natural Ideas, and Natural Reason;
that is, That we must believe things which we do not
see, things which we have no Natural Notion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of, things which are not evident to Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for without this, there is little use of Faith, no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of pure Revelation.</p>
            <p>It is true, the general Corruption of Mankind made
it very necessary for God to revive the Laws of Nature,
and to reinforce the observation of them by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Command; but the proper work of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to discover such things to us as Nature cannot
teach, of which we have no Natural Notion, nor any
Natural Evidence; At least, thus it may be, if God
knows more than Natural Reason teaches, or can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend;
and thinks it fit to reveal such Supernatural Truths
to us, when he sees it useful for Mankind.</p>
            <p>Now if God ever does reveal such things to us, if we
believe upon God's Authority (which is the strict Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Divine Faith), we must believe without any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Evidence, merely because God has revealed it; and
then we must believe such things as are not evident to
Sense and Reason; and then it can be no Objection against
Revelation, nor against the belief of any such superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Truths, that we have no Natural Notion, nor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45001:9"/>
evidence of them, that they are what we cannot
conceive and comprehend.</p>
            <p>To believe no farther than natural Reason can conceive
and comprehend, is to reject the Divine Authority of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
and to destroy the distinction between Reason
and Faith. He who will believe no farther than natural
Reason approves; believes his Reason, not the Revelation;
and is in truth a Natural Philosopher, not a Believer: He
believes the Scriptures, as he would believe <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Tully;</hi>
not as inspired Writings, but as agreeable to Reason and
the result of wise and deep Thoughts; and this puts an
end to all the disputes about Faith and Revelation at once:
For what use is there of Faith? What matter whether the
Scriptures be divinely Inspired or not, when we are no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concerned with them than with other Human Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
to believe what they teach agreeable to our own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Let these Men then either reject Faith and Scripture,
or confess, That Revelation, as to all Supernatural Truths,
must serve us instead of Sense and Reason. I would gladly
know of them, Whether they would not believe such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Truths, as are not evident to Reason, were
they sure that God had Revealed them? I guess they will
not be so hardy as to say, That they would not believe God
himself, should he Reveal such things as their Reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend; and if they would believe God in such
matters, Why will they not believe a Revelation, which
they themselves acknowledge to be Divine, in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
For is there any difference between believing God,
and believing a Divine Revelation? If God does know,
and can reveal such Mysteries, and is to be believed when
he does reveal them, and such Doctrines are contained in
an undoubted Revelation; then the unconceivableness of
them can be no argument against the Truth of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or that sense of the words, which contains such
Mysteries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45001:9"/>
Let us then consider the natural consequence of this,
which is of great moment in this dispute, <hi>viz.</hi> That we
must allow of no Objections against Revealed Mysteries,
which we will not allow to be good Objections against
Sense and Reason; which is a necessary and unavoidable
consequence if Revelation, with respect to supernatural
Truths, stand in the place of Sense and Reason.</p>
            <p>Now no man questions the truth of what he sees and
feels, or what he can prove to be true by plain and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Reason, merely because there are unconceivable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in it; as there are in every thing, even the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and familiar things in Nature: And if Revealed
Truths are not more unconceivable than many natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Sense and Reason, Why should their being uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
be a greater Objection against believing a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than it is against believing our Sense and Reason in
matters equally unconceivable? When God has Revealed
to us, That he has an Eternal and Only Begotten Son,
though we cannot comprehend the Mystery of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Generation, Why should we not as firmly believe it,
as we do, that Man Begets a Son in his own likeness, the
Philosophy of which we as little understand? Nor can
we any more conceive the Union of the Soul and Body,
than we do the Incarnation of the Son of God, or the
Union of the Divine and Human Nature in one Person?
And if we own the Authority of Revelation, Why
should we not as well believe what Revelation teaches,
how unconceivable soever it be, as we do what Sense and
Reason teaches, though it be alike unconceivable?</p>
            <p>All men are sensible, that it is very absurd and foolish to
deny the Being of any thing which they have certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of, because they cannot comprehend the Nature
and Reasons of it: The Man who rose up and walked
before the Philosopher, who was disputing subtilly against
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45001:10"/>
the possibility of Motion, put a scorn upon all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by shewing him that he could Move: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we see, that all men believe their Senses and Reason
against all the difficulties in Nature, and will never be
persuaded, by the subtillest Disputant, That that is not,
which they certainly see and know to be. Now for the
same reason, if men will allow the Authority of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they must believe what is Revealed, how uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
and incomprehensible soever its nature be; for
when we know that a thing is, (and this may be known by
Revelation as well as by Sense, as those men must confess,
who acknowledge a Divine Revelation) no difficulties in
conceiving it, must persuade us to deny that it is.</p>
            <p>This is very plain in it self, though few men consider it,
That to disbelieve what is Revealed, for the sake of any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
in understanding or conceiving it, is to reject the
certainty of Revelation; For what other account can be
given of that difference men make between the Evidence
of Sense and Reason, and of Revelation, but that they
allow Sense and Reason to be good and certain proofs of the
being of such things as are evident to Sense and Reason,
how mysterious soever their Natures are; but that mere
Revelation is no certain proof of the being of any thing
which is not evident also to Sense and Reason, how plainly
soever it be Revealed; that is, that Revelation alone can
prove nothing; for if Revelation it self could prove the
certainty of what is Revealed, the difficulties in Nature
and Philosophy could no more disprove a Revelation, than
confute our Senses. Now let any man judge, whether this
be not unequal usage, to expect more from Revelation, than
they do from Sense and Reason, and not to believe Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the same terms that they believe their Senses.</p>
            <p>Should men resolve to believe nothing which they see, till
they could give a Philosophical account of the Reasons,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45001:10"/>
and Causes, and Natures, of all they see, as they refuse
to believe a Revelation any farther than they can conceive
and comprehend the thing Revealed, they must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
be as great Scepticks, as they are Infidels. For as for
contradictions, it is an easy matter to make or find seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contradictions in what we do not understand; for
when we know not the Philosophical Natures of things,
nor how they act, and yet will be reasoning and guessing
at them, all our false guesses may be full of contradictions
and impossibilities, because we know not the true Mystery
of Nature. It is this vain humour of Criticizing upon
Nature which makes so many Atheists. They go upon
the same Principle with Infidels and Hereticks, To believe
nothing which natural Reason cannot conceive and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend;
now they cannot comprehend the Notion and
Idea of a God, which they say, is made up of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
and impossibilities, and therefore they reject the
Being of a God: They cannot conceive a Creating
Power, which can give Being to that which had no Being
before, which they think a plain Contradiction to make
Something of Nothing; and therefore they reject the
Creation of the World, and either assert the Eternity of
the World, or at least the Eternity of Matter: They can
conceive no Substance but Matter and Body, and therefore
reject the Notion of a Spirit, as Nonsense and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
They will allow nothing to be wisely made, which
they understand not the reason and uses of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they fancy a great many botches and blunders in
Nature, which cannot be the designs and contrivance of
Wisdom, but the effects of Chance; and then the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is plain, That the World was made by Chance,
not by a Wise Author.</p>
            <p>Now, I confess, if this way of Reasoning be allowed,
it will be impossible to defend either Sense, or Reason, or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45001:11"/>
Revelation, against the Cavils of Atheists and Infidels;
for there are unconceivable and incomprehensible Secrets
and Mysteries in them all; and if to conceive and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Natures of things must be made the measure and
standard of true and false, we must deny our Senses and
Reason, as well as our Faith; and if we do and must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
our Sense and Reason beyond our Comprehension,
Why must we believe nothing that is Revealed, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than we can conceive and comprehend the Nature and
Reasons of it?</p>
            <p>The Sum is this: Humane Knowledge, whatever the
means of knowing be, whether Sense, or Reason, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
does not reach to the Philosophical Causes and
Natures of things, but only to their Being, and Natural
Vertues and Powers; and as a Wise man, who knows the
measure of his Understanding, expects no more from Sense
and Reason, than to know what things there are in the
World, and what they are, as far as they fall under the
notice of Sense and Natural Reason; so we must expect
no more from Revelation, than the knowledge of such
things as Sense and Natural Reason cannot discover. But
we must no more expect the Philosophy of Supernatural
Truths from Revelation, than we do the Mysteries of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from Sense and Reason.</p>
            <p>Now since Human Knowledge is not a knowledge of
the Mysterious Natures of things, but only to know what
things there are, and what they are; there can be no can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
between Sense, and Reason, and Revelation;
unless one denies what the other affirms, not that one
teaches more than the other teaches, or that one cannot
comprehend what the other teaches. Reason teaches more
than Sense teaches, or can comprehend; and Revelation
teaches more than either Sense or Natural Reason teaches,
or can comprehend; but this is no contradiction, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45001:11"/>
only a subordination between these different kinds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Knowledge; but as for Unconceivableness and
Incomprehensibility, that is no argument against any
thing; for Sense and Natural Reason can no more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
their own Objects, than they do what is revealed:
And it is manifest perverseness to make that an objection
against Revelation, which we will not allow to be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against Sense and Reason.</p>
            <p>This is sufficient as to the reason of the thing; but as
far as it is possible to remove mens Prejudices also against
believing Mysteries, I shall briefly answer two very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Objections.</p>
            <p>1. It is thought very unnatural, that when God has
made us reasonable Creatures, and therefore made Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reason to us the measure of Truth and Falshood, he
should require us to believe without Reason; as we must
do, if he reveals such things to us as we know not, and
cannot possibly know the reasons of. If we must believe
with our Understanding, how can we believe things which
we cannot understand?</p>
            <p>This were a reasonable Objection, were it true; for we
cannot believe what we have no knowledge, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of; for Faith is Knowledge, though not Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Knowledge.</p>
            <p>But do we not understand what it is we believe? Do
we not know what we mean, when we say, We believe
in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? Nay, do not our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
understand what we mean by it? How then
come they to charge us with believing Contradictions and
Impossibilities? For if they know not what we believe,
they cannot know whether we believe Contradictions or
not. And if we do understand what it is we believe,
then we do not believe without understanding, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45001:12"/>
is absolutely impossible, if we know what it is we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>And we know also why we believe: Our Faith is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Sense and Reason, and resolved into the Authority
of God, which is the highest and most infallible Reason.
The Miracles which Christ and his Apostles wrought, were
evident to Sense, and owned by Reason to be the effects of
a Divine Power; and the Answer the Blind man gave to
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> when Christ had opened his Eyes, speaks
the true sense of Nature: <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rein is a marvellous thing, that
ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine
eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners; but if any
man be a worshipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
eyes of one that was born blind: If this man were not of God,
he could do nothing,</hi> 9. John 30, 31, 32, 33. And all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
own, that the most absolute Faith is due to God, and
to those who speak from God; and this, as I take it, is
to believe with Reason.</p>
            <p>But still we believe such things, whose Natures we do
not understand, and cannot account for by Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and this is to believe without Reason. We believe,
that God the Father hath an Eternal Son, and an Eternal
Spirit; and that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are but
One Eternal God; but this is what Natural Reason cannot
comprehend, nor give us any notion or conception of,
how God can have an Eternal Son, and an Eternal Spirit,
really distinct from himself, and yet with himself One
Eternal and Infinite God: Reason can give no account of
the Eternal Generation of the Son, nor of the Eternal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Holy Spirit; and is not this to believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reason, which a reasonable Creature ought not to do,
and which we ought not to think, that God who made us
reasonable Creatures, expects from us?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:45001:12"/>
And this I grant would be a material Objection, were
Reason the Judge of the Nature and Philosophy of things;
and did Reason require us to believe nothing but what we
understand and comprehend. But then we must no more
believe Sense and Reason, than Revelation; for we do
not comprehend the Nature of any one thing in the World,
how evident soever it is to Sense and Reason, that there
are such things. Nature is as great a Mystery as Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and it is no greater affront to our Understandings,
no more against reason for God to reveal such things to us
as our Reason cannot comprehend, than it is to make a
whole World, which Reason cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p>When we make it an Objection against any thing, That
it is without Reason, or, as we apprehend, against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and contrary to Reason; we must first consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the proper Object of Reason; otherwise it is no
Objection; as it is no objection against Sounds, that we
cannot see them; nor against Colours, that we cannot
hear them; because Sounds are not the Objects of Sight,
nor Colours of Hearing.</p>
            <p>Now no man pretends, that the pure Natures and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences
of things, or their Essential Reasons, Properties,
Unions, Operations, are the Objects of Humane Reason;
for no man living knows any thing about them.</p>
            <p>And yet this is all the Incomprehensibility men have to
complain of in the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation;
That they cannot comprehend, how God can
beget an Eternal Son; nor how Three Divine Persons
should be so united, as to be essentially One God; nor
how the Divine and Humane Nature can be united into
One Person, God-man: All which concern the Essence,
and Essential Properties, Operations, Unions, Relations
of the Deity, which a modest man might allow to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
if God be infinite, though he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45001:13"/>
the Natures, Essences, and Essential Reasons and
Properties of Created Beings; but when all Created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is such a Mystery to us, that we know not the pure
Nature and Essence of any one thing in the World, is it
an affront to our Reason, that we cannot comprehend the
Divine Nature?</p>
            <p>Such Matters as these are neither without Reason, nor
against Reason, nor contrary to Reason; because Reason
has nothing to do with them, and can take no cognizance
of them: They belong not to Reason, but to that Infinite
Mind, which comprehends it Self, and the Ideas of all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Beings. A perfect comprehensive Knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
belongs only to the Maker of all things; for it is not
only to know what things are, but how to make them;
which would be a vain Curiosity, and useless Knowledge
to those, who have not a Making and Creating Power.
This is to know things <hi>à priori,</hi> with an Intuitive Ideal
Knowledge, which is infinitely more superior to Reason,
than Reason is to Sense: And it is the affection of this
Intuitive making Knowledge, which makes some men
Atheists, and others Hereticks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Another great Objection against such a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as contains matters which Natural Reason cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
is, To what purpose such a Revelation serves?
What Merit there can be in believing such Doctrines?
And of what good use such a Faith can be to us?</p>
            <p>Now I confess I cannot think it meritorious merely to
believe things which are incomprehensible; or that God
any more intended to puzzle our Faith with revealed My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
than to puzzle our Reason in making a Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
World. Whether we receive our information from
Sense, or Natural Reason, or Revelation, it is certain we
must believe Mysteries, if we believe any thing; for all
things have something mysterious and incomprehensible in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45001:13"/>
their natures; what natural Reason cannot account for,
and what God never intended we should understand: for
God never intended to teach us how to make the World,
nor how every Creature was made; and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
and are not concerned to know the internal frame and
constitution of Nature.</p>
            <p>But though neither Natural nor Revealed Knowledge
extends to the Reasons and Causes of Nature, and of essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Properties and Operations; yet both natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Knowledge is of as much use to us, as if we did
perfectly understand all the secret and incomprehensible
Mysteries of the nature of God, or of the natures of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Both natural and revealed Knowledge are alike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account, That they only acquaint us what things
are, and what ends they serve; and then we know what
use to make of them, without understanding the secret
Mysteries of Nature.</p>
            <p>Is this World, or any thing in it, the less useful to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we cannot conceive how God created all things of
nothing? Or because we do not understand the nature of
Matter, nor how the several parts of Matter came by
their different Virtues and Qualities? Is Corn, or Fruit,
or Herbs, the less nourishing or refreshing, because we
know not how they grow? Does it require any Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
to know how to eat, and drink, and sleep? Will not
our Food nourish us, unless we understand how it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted,
and turned into Chyle, and Blood, and Spirits?
Nay, is it of no use to know that God is an Eternal, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,
Omniscient, Omnipresent Being, unless we can
conceive how any Being can be Eternal without a Cause,
and without a Beginning? Or can comprehend how he
can do and know all things; and be present in all places at
once, without Extension, and without Parts? We may
make all the use that can be made of this world, and of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45001:14"/>
every thing in it, without understanding the essential Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Causes, or internal Nature of any thing; and
we must do so, if we will make any use of it; and we
know God to all the ends and purposes for which Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ought to know God, though his Nature be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.</p>
            <p>And thus it is in matters of pure Revelation, such as
the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Incarnation; how
unaccountable soever the Mystery of a Trinity in Unity,
the Eternal Generation, and the Incarnation of the Son
of God be, yet it is the most useful Knowledge in the
world: Though we know not how the Eternal Father
begat an Eternal Son of his own Substance, nor how this
Eternal Son in time became Man; yet it is the most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
knowledge in the world to sinners; to know, That
God has an Eternal Son; and <hi>that he so loved the world, as
to give his only begotten Son for the redemption of mankind,
that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have
everlasting life;</hi> and that this Eternal Son of God became
Man, lived a poor, necessitous, laborious Life, and died
an accursed Death for the Salvation of Sinners; and to
know, That the Holy Spirit, which proceeds from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Son, dwells in the Christian Church, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
and animates the whole Body of Christ. If this be
true (as we must suppose in this Argument), all Mankind
must confess, that this is a very useful Knowledge; and
never the less useful, because a Trinity in Unity, and the
Eternal Generation, and the Incarnation of the Son of
God, are great and inconceivable Mysteries. Could we
give a Rational and Philosophical Account of the Eternal
Generation, and of the Incarnation, we should know
more than we now do; but Faith makes it as useful to all
the purposes of Religion, as the most perfect intuitive
Knowledge could do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45001:14"/>
This is a sufficient Answer to that Objection against
the Usefulness of such Mysteries as have something in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
and unconceivable in their Natures:
Which is an equal Objection against all created Nature,
which is but one great Mystery; and yet the World is a
very useful World, and we know in some good degree
what use to make of it: And the Knowledge of those
Gospel Mysteries which are the Subject of our present
dispute, are manifestly of infinite use to us, if the certain
knowledge of the Pardon of Sin, and eternal Life, by
the Obedience, and Sufferings, and Death, and Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Son of God Incarnate, be of any use; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it became the Wisdom and Goodness of God to reveal
these Mysteries of Salvation to us.</p>
            <p>Especially if we add to this, That the lapsed state of
Human Nature makes supernatural Knowledge necessary.
Natural Knowledge we grant was sufficient for a state of
Nature, though no man would have had reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
had God in a state of Innocence by a more familiar
intercourse with Man, or by the frequent Conversation of
Angels, improved his Knowledge beyond the mere at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of his Natural Faculties; and it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
but this might have been; I am sure there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
thirst after knowledge in human Nature, and
such a great curiosity for secret and hidden Mysteries, that
it looks very unnatural for Men to complain, that God
Reveals more to them than Nature teaches.</p>
            <p>But yet I say, Natural Knowledge must be allowed suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to all the ends of Human Life, while man conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Innocent; for that is the Original state of human
Nature, as all men must grant, who believe that Man was
made by God.</p>
            <p>But when man sinned, he forfeited the Favour of God,
and a natural Immortality; and whether he should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45001:15"/>
or not, and by what means he should be restored,
depended wholly on the Sovereign Will and Pleasure of
God: And therefore the Light of Nature, though it
could direct an Innocent Man how to Please and Worship
God, and to preserve himself Immortal, it could not
teach Sinners how to make atonement for Sin, nor give
them any certain hopes that God would forgive Sins, and
bestow immortal Life on them; which makes it necessary,
that the Religion of a sinner be a Revealed Religion.
And if God in infinite Goodness is not only pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
sinners to Grace and Favour, but to advance them to
a supernatural state of Perfection and Happiness both of
Soul and Body in the next World; this must be done by
supernatural Means, and therefore requires a supernatural
Knowledge; for the Light of Nature can neither raise us
above Nature, nor discover supernatural Truths to us; and
this makes it necessary to know and believe such things, as
we have no natural Notion or Idea of, <hi>Such things, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eye hath seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the
heart of man to conceive.</hi> If Nature can't save us, it can't
discover to us the way of Salvation neither; and if we
must be saved by a supernatural Grace and Power, it must
be supernaturally Revealed; and what is Supernatural, is
the Object of <hi>Faith,</hi> not of natural <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This seems to me to give a plain account, Why God
thinks fit to Reveal such Mysteries to us as Nature cannot
teach, and as we have no natural Notion of, Because our
lapsed state has made such supernatural Revelations neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the recovery of Mankind; and when we are fallen
below the relief of Nature, and of natural Knowledge,
we ought to be very thankful to our Good God for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Knowledge, and supernatural Means of Salvation.</p>
            <p>To God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost,
Three Persons, One Eternal God, be Honour, Glory and
Power, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
