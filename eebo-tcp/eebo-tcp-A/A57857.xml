            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat I again appear publickly in this Paper War, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for my Age <hi>Miles emeritus)</hi> needeth no other Apology than the Necessity that the Months that were so Widely Opened against the Truth, and right Ways of GOD, should be Stopped: and I knew of no other Endeavours this Way, when I entered on this Work, nor till I had finished it. After it was in the Press, and some Progress made in it, I read the Learned and Industrious <hi>Mr. William Jamesons</hi> Nazianzeni Quaerela, &amp; Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>um Justum; wherein the same two Authors that I Deal with, are solidly Refuted, and the main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that I Treat off, is Handled: which made me think that B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ok might Supersede mine. Yet the Advice of others Wiser than my self, and my own second Thoughts, finding fewer Coincidences in them than might have been Expected: And that the one Work is more Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, the other more Argumentative; so that they may make up a complete Answer to what our Adversaries have now thought sit to say; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that some Debates are here insisted on which he hath not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and that two Witnesses are better than one: these Considerations (I say) determined me not to stop the Press, And indeed, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Confidence of these Authors, on the slenderest Grounds, should be exposed as much as may be: while they Build so Important Truths and Practices (and press them so warmly) on Phrases, Words, and Modes of Speaking used by the Ancients, which signified quite another thing then, than what now they are commonly applyed to. The Learned <hi>Clericus,</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Ars Critica,</hi> Sect. 3. at the end,
<pb facs="tcp:62347:4"/>
hath these Words here very apposite. <hi>Quot &amp; quanti viri credide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt se Historiam Christianarum Ecclesiarum, &amp; Opiniones eorum qui S. S. Patres vocantur, in numerato habere, qui revera Hospites ea in re fuerunt? nempe, Vocabula nuda didicerant, aut Voces, quibus ex Hodiernis placitis Significationes tribuebant.</hi> If we lay such Weight on Ways of Speaking of old used, as sufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Prelacy, it is reasonable to allow the same with Respect to Popery: And in that Case, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> and <hi>on this Rock will I Build my Church:</hi> and, <hi>I will give to thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. shall infer the Popes Supremacy with as good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as the Fathers Ascribing Jurisdiction to the Bishop, without mentioning the Presbyters at the same time, doth infer his sole Power: seing, as our Lord in another Place, giveth the same Power to the rest of the Apostles, that here He seemeth to give to <hi>Peter</hi> alone; so do the Fathers often speak of the Ruling Power of Presbyters, as well as they several times mention that of Bishops, without menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning Presbyters. No Protestant will admit the Consequence in the one Case; wherefore neither ought we so to Argue in the other Case.</p>

§ 3.

It is further to be considered, that as <hi>Antiquity</hi> is not, by it self, a sufficient Patrocinie for any Opinion; So <hi>Noveltie</hi> is not alwayes a just prejudice against it. If our Adversaries plead <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie</hi> for Prelacy, so may it be done for many principles which themselves will call Errors; and this sort of Arguments, hath in all Ages of the Church been judged invalide: It is <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> not <hi>humane practice, Custome,</hi> or <hi>Antient Opinion,</hi> that must be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62347:7"/>
a Foundation for our belief: and when they expose our way as new, they should consider, that what is Eldest in respect of its bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Gods appointment, may be new in respect of its discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and observation: What is old in it self, may be new to us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, by the corruption of many Ages, it hath been hid, and at last brought forth to light again: So Christianity it self was a <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philosophers, and by them treated with disdain and mocking, on that account; more than with rational refutation, <hi>Acts 17. 19, 20.

So was <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, and <hi>Calvins,</hi> and that of the other <hi>Reformers</hi> in their day, <hi>respectivè.</hi> If my Antagonist can make it appear, that our Opinion about Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, was never countenanced by Scripture, nor practised in the Christian Church, till of late in <hi>Geneva,</hi> or <hi>Scotland;</hi> Let it then pass for a <hi>Noveltie,</hi> and on that account be condemned: but it may be more Antient than the Hierarchie; tho for many Centuries; it was not practised under the Reign, and in the Kingdom of Anti-Christ. We are very willing, according to the place of Scripture, he putteth before his Book, to ask for, and walk in the <hi>old paths:</hi> but these paths must be such as God of old prescribed to his People (as some expound the place, of the way that <hi>Moses</hi> taught them) and which they walked in, who, we are sure did not err. (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this place, of the way of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob)</hi> we know that error hath been abetted under the Notion of the old way, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 17. Neither do we think our selves obliged to follow all the paths of some Antient good men, more then the <hi>Jews</hi> were to do as <hi>Aaron</hi> did, in making the Golden Calf, tho that was a very old practice, and that Calf worshipping had been before <hi>Jeremias</hi> dayes, both Antient and Universal.</p>

He doth <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6. Suppose, <hi>The Antient Ministers of the Word to have been Bishops with Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Authority,</hi> and telleth us, <hi>How in the Primitive times, they were opposed, by men chosen by the People, who calculate their Doctrine, to the fancies and humours of the Multitude, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Gospel to promote error, and delusion, in stead of serving our blessed Saviour, they became slaves of the People, by whom they were originally imployed; and because they were so unhappily successfull, as to gratifie their lusts, they were therefore voted the most Edifying Teachers.</hi> Whether this be to vvrite a Satyre, or to plead for Truth, to the conviction of them vvhom he dealleth vvith, vvise men vvill judge. It is rather to be lamented, than denyed, that there are such Ministers in the Christian, yea, in the Reformed Church: but I may confidently say, they are not more zealously disliked among any partie of men, than among the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Whom it is evident, that by all this Discourse, he designeth to defame; We preach against this Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even as it is in mens hearts: and vve censure it, vvhen it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in their practise, either to the promoting of Error, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing the Peace of the Church. More of this he hath, p. 7. of <hi>Ministers reconciling the moralls of the Gospel to mens wicked practises, and looser theorms, and the severe Discipline of the Antient Church to all licence and luxurie, and true faith, that worketh by love, to airie notions and mistakes.</hi> Whether these vvords afford us the lineaments of this mans temper, or of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers, I shall leave to others to determine. I am sure, they who know the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians, and do not spitefully hate them, will not say, that either their Doctrine, or their Exercise of Discipline doth tend to promote Loosness and Luxurie. This Author is pleased to represent them under a quite contrary Character when he findeth it for his purpose. Whether the Presbyterian, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62347:8"/>
Prelatick Church Discipline, as they have been exercised in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> come nearest to the <hi>severe Discipline of the Antient Church,</hi> it's easie to determine, by them who have seen the one, and can judge of both, without prejudice.</p>
               <p>§ 6. I gladly would understand what he meaneth by his Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 6. That <hi>the primitive Ministers of Religion, had their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate commission from heaven, and accordingly they endeavoured to restore the image of God in Men:</hi> To whom he setteth in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these ill men above mentioned. If he mean the Apostles, I shall not contradict his Assertion; but must look on it as most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent: Seing the other, who he saith, had their Authority from Men, were distinguished from, and opposite to, not only the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but the ordinary faithful Ministers of the Church, who were in, or after their dayes. Also the Assertion, so understood, could make nothing for Prelacy, or against Paritie, in the primitive Church, which seemeth to be the design of this Passage. If he understand it of Bishops, who, he fancieth to have succeeded to the Apostles; this is a <hi>new opinion,</hi> with a Witness; and for any thing I know, himself first hatched it: and we shall allow him the honour of this new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, that Bishops have their Immediate Commission from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: I know no Opinions held by Presbyterians, so new as this, of one who undertaketh to refute their new Opinions. Sure, if it be so, they must then shew their credentials from Heaven, and the signs of Apostles wrought in them. As 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. And these might supersede the King's <hi>Congedelire,</hi> and their Consecration, and also, all the debate that is about their Prelation, and will excuse us from owning them, till we be satisfied in this matter, wherein we promise not to be unreasonably incredulous.</p>
               <p>§ 7. He proceedeth in his Reproaches, and unaccountable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy; while p. 7. He speaketh of the <hi>shaking of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Ecclesiastical Unitie,</hi> (as if Unity were only found in the Prelatical way) and <hi>trampling on Antient Constitutions with great Insolence, and Impiety.</hi> Supposing (without any semblance of Proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) that then the hedge of true Religion is not only invaded
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62347:8"/>
but demolished, when Episcopacy is laid aside, and that <hi>without these sacred Vehicles (viz.</hi> The Antient Constitutions about Prelacy,) <hi>true Religion must evaporate into giddiness and Enthusiasm.</hi> If this wild talk be not <hi>spiritual raverie,</hi> (to use his own words) I know not what can be called by that Name. It is of the same strain, that <hi>the extravagance of these last dayes,</hi> (which is wholly charged on Presbytery) <hi>is boundless, and Sceptical, and Christianity is more dangerously wounded, by the delusions of some that are Baptized</hi> (Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians) <hi>then by the open blasphemies of Infidels;</hi> and that <hi>the first (viz.</hi> the Presbyterians) <hi>are altogether inaccessible by reason,</hi> that <hi>they pretend to extraordinary illuminations, and will not be instructed, their Errors are made stronger by their vanity.</hi> And much more is fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and injuriously said to this purpose. To which I have no other Reply, but the words of <hi>Psalms 12. 3, 4. The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things, who have said, with our tongue will we prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us,</hi> and Psal. 120. 3, 4. <hi>What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be done unto thee, O false tongue.</hi> We can answer his Arguments, and are willing to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by him, and attacked that way: But who can stand before this kind of Topicks? I have not met with any Person who is of opinion that Presbyterians <hi>think to make their Calling and Election sure, only by Division and Singularitie,</hi> save this Author. <hi>p.</hi> 8. Who seemeth to take the same Liberty to himself, of speaking all the ill he can devise of Presbyterians, that the Author of <hi>pax vobis</hi> doth against Protestants of all sorts. I am not at leasure to enquire how much he hath borrowed from that Author; But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the strain of both is the same: I shall take little notice of his confident insinuation. <hi>p.</hi> 9. That <hi>Prelacy was revealed by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, taught by his Apostles, and received by all Churches in the first and best Ages:</hi> For the truth of this is to be tryed in the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; But I cannot overlook his suposing, that <hi>we reject certain Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls and practises, which by the plainest and most undenyable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are agreeable to the general Rules of Scripture, and the uniform
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62347:9"/>
Belief of all Christians:</hi> If he can prove the Contraverted Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be such, we shall correct our Opinion about them.</p>
               <p>§ 8. He layeth some Foundations, <hi>p.</hi> 10. and 11. For his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Dispute, which we cannot allow, as first, that <hi>the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were agreed among themselves about not only the great Articles of Religion; but also about the General Rules of Ecclesiastick Order, and Discipline;</hi> under which Head, he plainly includes the <hi>Rituals of the Church.</hi> It is to be lamented, that even in Doctrine, there was not that Unitie, that was fit, in the Primitive times: we read of many Heresies early broached: for <hi>Order,</hi> it was not the same among all, there were sad Schisms, as well as Heresies: and for <hi>Ritualls,</hi> we find no General Rule they agreed in, for Ordering them, save the Word of GOD, contained in the Scriptures. For General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills, that medled most with these, were later than the times we speak of. And it is well known, what Fatal Contentions there were about some of them; such as the time of observing <hi>Easter.</hi> Yea, the first Churches had different <hi>Ritualls,</hi> about which they made no Divisions, but used Christian forbearance. <hi>Socrates</hi> hath a whole Chapter to prove this; which is, <hi>C.</hi> 21. of <hi>lib 5. of hist. Ecclesi. Iraeneus</hi> reproving <hi>Victor,</hi> for Excommunicating the <hi>Quarto Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,</hi> hath these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And at large sheweth, that the Primitive Christians did not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure one another, for difference of Rites and Customs observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Every one knoweth how far the Churches of the first Ages were, from uniformity in their <hi>Fasting;</hi> Some abstaining from that which others did not Scruple to eat: in the frequency of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating: about the <hi>time and manner of Baptising:</hi> about the <hi>time and degrees of publick penance, placing the Altar,</hi> or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is evident then, that the first Christians did not look on <hi>Ritualls,</hi> as that about which Christian Concord should be judged of: They minded things of higher moment, and greater necessity.</p>
               <p>§ 9. Another Paradox that he Advanceth is, that <hi>by this unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Doctrine and Rituals, they (the Primitive Christians,) strengh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62347:9"/>
themselves against</hi> Infidels <hi>and</hi> Hereticks. This Assertion with respect to <hi>Rituals,</hi> is wild and absurd; not only because such Uniformity was not found, nor much regarded among them, as hath been shewed; but also, because this Uniformity in Matters so extrinsick to Religion, could afford them no strength; more than an Army is the stronger, by all the Souldiers wearing Coats of the same Fashion and Colour. It was their Unity in the Truths of God, their Managing the Ordinances of God by one Divine Rule, and their Love and forbearance of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in the different Practice of such <hi>Rituals</hi> as were not Instituted by Christ, in these as the Means, did their strength ly. Yet another strange Position; he supposeth the Constitutions wherein he and we differ <hi>to have been received among all Christians,</hi> (which never hath yet been proved) and affirmeth, that <hi>despising these overthroweth the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Peace and Charity; and consequently, we exclude our selves from the visible Fellowship of Christs Houshold and Family.</hi> His Supposition (which <hi>p.</hi> 11. and often else where, he considently layeth as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his whole Debate) is groundless; as I hope, will appear in the Progress of this Disquisition. His Assertion is false and dangerous. For 1. There was Peace amongst the primitive Churches, where seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Constitutions he talketh of, were practised by some, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected or despised by others; as may be Instanced in the <hi>Trina Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi> and many others. 2. Even about some Truths and Ordinances of God, there were Debates in the primitive Churches, and some differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that which was generally held, and yet they were not Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, but dealt with by more soft Means, and born with, till the Lord should enlighten their Mind, according to the Apostles direction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15, 16. 3. It is the way of the Antichristian Church, but of few others, to unchurch all Sister Churches who differ from them in any thing, even in <hi>Rituals:</hi> this is not the Spirit of the Gospel. If he understand that they only exclude themselves from the Church, who differ from what all and every one hold who are Christians, his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be contradicted; yet it may be Ridiculed, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any who is a Christian, to do: but if he speak of what is commonly received, this very Assertion doth Sap the Foundation of all Peace and Unity in the Church: that all they were to be Treated as Apostats from the Church and Christianity, who have a singular Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent about any one Point of Doctrine, or Ceremony, even though they Dissent never so modestly: and this will Authorize all the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62347:10"/>
of the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> Whether will mens furious Zeal for Humane De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices carry them?</p>
               <p>§ 10. What followeth, doth surmount all that we have heard. <hi>p.</hi> 11. <hi>Whatever is uniformly determined by the wisest and best of Christians, (their learnedst Bishops and Presbyters) must be received as the infallible Truth of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> else we have no certain Standard to distinguish the Catholick Church in former Ages, from the Combinations of</hi> Hereticks. And a little below, <hi>The uniform Voice of Christendem in the first and purest Ages, is the best Key to the Doctrine and Practice of the Apostles and their Successors.</hi> I make here two Observes, before I consider the thing that is thus boldly Asserted. The former is, that (may be through oversight) he giveth Presbyters a share in Determining, or decisive Power about what must be received as the infallible Truth of God, together with the Bishops: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Bishops have not the sole Authority in the Church; but of this afterward. The other is, it is manifest that he here speaketh not of the Apostles, but of the ordinary and fixed Ministers of the Church, who taught and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church after the decease of the Apostles, and after the Canon of Scripture was finished. Now this Position containeth things worthy of our Observation. First, that this learned Author maintaineth an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to be in the Guides of the Church, so as they cannot erre; seeing what they Determine must be received as the Infallible Truth of God. 2. That there must be an Infallible Judge of Controversies in the Church, beside the Scripture; and without this, we have no Standard of Truth, but must wander in the dark, the Scripture being unfit and insufficient to guide us in the way of Truth, and to discover Heresie to us. 3. That this infallible Judge of Controversies, is the Bishops and Presbyters agreeing together, and uniformly Determining what is Truth. But here our Author leaveth us at a loss: What if some of these Bishops and Presbyters who meet to frame our Articles of Faith, or Canons for our Practice, be none of the Wisest, Best, nor Learnedst, yet have made a shift to get into the Office of Bishop or Presbyter? Next, what if his wisest and best Christians, that is, the learnedst Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, do not Determine uniformly about our Faith, or what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Practice; but some few Dissent, or are not clear to go along with the rest? Whether in that case, have we any Standard for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? He would do well to give us Light in this, when he hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter digested his Notions, and writeth his second thoughts on this Head. If some other Person had written at this rate, we should quickly have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62347:10"/>
had a whole Book, or a long Preface to one, exposing his <hi>Ignorance, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,</hi> and other such qualities: but I shall impute no more to this learned Doctor, but that he hath not well Considered what he here saith.</p>
               <p>§ 11. It may be it will have little weight with him, if I affirm and make it appear, that this is plainly and directly the Doctrine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church;</hi> yea, their darling Principle: and indeed the Foundation on which that Church is built; and without believing of which, they affirm that we have no certainty for our Religion: even as this Author thinketh, we have no Standard to distinguish the <hi>Catholicks</hi> from <hi>Hereticks.</hi> That this is their Doctrine, I might prove by whole Shoals of Citations; I shall single out a few. <hi>Eccius, Enchirid: de conciliis.

               <p>§ 12. For the 1. That there is not Infallibility in all Points of Faith or Practice, to be found among the Guides of the Church after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; but that any of them, yea all of them, may in some of these Points, erre: I prove 1. No such Infallibility is promised to any, or all of the Guides of the Church, <hi>tu es Petrus: lo am I with you:</hi> and such
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62347:11"/>
like Promises, cannot bear the Weight of our Authors Opinion; for the Church may be safe from the gates of Hell, and may have Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, even though her Guides be under some Mistakes in lesser Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 2 This Infallibility is inconsistent with Experience: the Guides of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church erred foully, when they condemned our Lord as a Deceiver: and yet that Church had the Promise of Gods Teaching, Upholding, and Presence, which was fulfilled upon the Remnant of true Believers that were among them. The <hi>Arian</hi> Church, and the <hi>Popish</hi> Church, have foully erred, and yet both of them did overspread the face of Christianity almost wholly; but there was still a Remnant according to the Promise. 3. The Fathers (whom I suppose he meaneth by his wise, good, and learned Bishops and Presbyters) not only did each of them erre in some things, (which I hope he will not deny, and how then shall Infallibility in all things, be found among them joyntly?) but they disown this Infallibility to be in themselves, or in others, as is clear from several Testimonies which I have cited to this purpose; Pref. to <hi>Cyprianic Bishop examined, p:</hi> 2.

               <p>§ 13. To say that all this is to be understood, of what one or a few Fathers say, not of that wherein they all agree: This hath various absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in it; for 1. It is falsly supposed (as in the Progress of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate will appear) that the Fathers are agreed about the Prelacy our Author contendeth for. 2. If every one of them may erre, why may they not all erre, seeing the Collective Body of them is made up only of infallible men? Christs promise of being in the midst of two or three gathered together in his Name, doth not free them from all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes. The Fathers together, and the same men apart, are the same persons under different Notions; and therefore they cannot be both fallible and infallible. 3. The Testimonies above brought, do not only make single Fathers fallible, but whatever Combinations of them ye can imagine; for they are still men, and the Fathers above cited, make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to be peculiar to Christ speaking in his Word. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth often and plainly bar this Distinction: <hi>contra Faustum, lib. 11. c. 5. id genus, &amp;c. We must read that kind of Writing, not with necessity of Believing, but with liberty of Judging.</hi> And <hi>Ep: 112: ad Paulinam. Quod Divinarum Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturarum, &amp;c. That which is confirmed by the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, is without doubt, to be believed;</hi> but for other Witnesses or Testimonies (whether single or Combined, he maketh no difference as to this) ye may receive or reject them, as ye shall judge they have more or less weight. Also, <hi>Tom. 2: Ep: 19: Solus Scripturarum libris, &amp;c. I have learned to give this honour and reverence to the Books of Scripture only, to believe there is no errour in them: but I read others, however learned or Godly they be,</hi> (see how exactly he meeteth with our Authors notion, of ascribing Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to what is Determined by the most Wise, learned and Godly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters) <hi>I so read them, that I do not believe any thing to be true because they thought so; but because they prove it by the Scriptures, that it is so.</hi> This forced a Confession from <hi>Occam</hi> (a Papist of profound Learning, a Disciple of our Country man <hi>Joannes Dans)</hi> that <hi>Augustine</hi> here maketh no difference amongst other Writers, beside the Prophets
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62347:12"/>
and Apostles; whether they be Popes or others; whether they write in Council or out of it. I shall refer the Reader to the Protestant Writers, who have collected the Errours and Mistakes even of General, and also more private Councils.</p>
               <p>§. 14. The second Proposition that may be drawn out of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors words, is, that an infallible Judge of Truth and Errour is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in the Church, besides the Scripture; for he telleth us, that <hi>without the uniform Determination of Truth, by the wisest, best and learnedst Bishops and Presbyters,</hi> we have no Standard whereby to <hi>judge of the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>from the Combination of</hi> Hereticks: this Principle falleth with the former; for if there be no Infallibility but in the Scripture, such a Judge cannot be necessary: for the Church doth <hi>de facto,</hi> subsist without such a Judge. Again, the chief ground on which his Partizans the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, assert the necessity of such a Judge, is, because the Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear Parties, nor can it pronounce a Sentence which the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties may hear, and be obliged by: I ask him, if his <hi>wisest, best, and most learned Bishops and Presbyters,</hi> can hear him and me, and audibly pronounce a Sentence for either of us, they being now all dead, as well as the Apostles and Prophets, and nothing of them extant but their Writings, as are also the Sacred Writings? The one is not a visible Judge more than the other; and if we Appeal to the Writings of the Fathers, why not rather to the Scripture it self, which I have proved to be of more, yea, of the only infallible Authority. And indeed, there can be no visible Judge but the present Church, to which therefore the Papists flee. And even that cannot be such a Judge to all Christians; for they cannot all hear the Pope, or Council, pronouncing a Sentence, and therefore must be content with their Writings, or Report of their Priests, who pretend to no Infallibility: and it is strange, that more certainty should be expected from either of these, than from the Divinely Inspired Scriptures. A visible Judge we own, to wit, the Guides of the Church lawfully conveened: an infallible Judge we also acknowledge; <hi>vix.</hi> God speaking in his Word: but a Judge that is both infallible, and also now visible to us, we cannot find. The Protestants Arguments against this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Errour I shall not insist on; they are, 1. That the Spirit of God in Scripture, sendeth us not to men, but to the written Word of God, for Decision in controverted, or doubtful Points. <hi>Isa. 8. 20: Luk: 27: 29: Mat: 22: 29: John</hi> 5: 39. 2. Christ and his Apostles, did always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Scripture, and to no other Judge. 3. All men may erre, as hath
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62347:12"/>
been shewed; and therefore they cannot be an infallible Judge. 4. If there were such a Judge, sure the Lord would have told us who he is, and that there is such a one: but not one word of either of these in the Bible. 5. Neither the Papists, nor such as this Author, can tell us where we shall find this infallible Judge: they are not agreed whether the Pope alone, or a general Council alone, or both concurring, must be this Judge. He telleth us of the <hi>wisest, best, and most learned Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> but leaveth us to guess who these were: it is a hard case, if our certainty of Faith must hang upon this Pin, who were <hi>the best, the wisest, and most learned</hi> among them who have Instructed the Cherch. The third Proposition above mentioned, cannot stand, the other two being taken away: it hath been made appear, that Scripture is the only Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard; and therefore not the learned and wise Bishops. Also that they have disowned such Infallibility and Authority to be in themselves or any men; <hi>Et collapsa ruunt subductis tecta columnis.</hi>

               <p>THe first of the <hi>New Opinions</hi> with which this Author is pleased to charge Presbyterians, is that <hi>they are for the Government of the Church by Presbyters acting in Parity, and against Prelacy, or the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of a Bishop over Presbyters.</hi> He is pleased to examine some of our Arguments, and pretendeth to answer them, <hi>c:</hi> 1, 2: and then cometh to prove his Opinion, <hi>c:</hi> 3.

Bring more and plainer Arguments for our Opinion, besides these which he is pleased to take notice of. 3. Reinforce these our Arguments which he meddleth with. 4. Consider the strength of his Plea for Bishops, on account of their Succession to the Apostles.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62347:13"/>
§ 2. In order to stating the Queston, we are to consider, that there are different Sentiments about the Government of the Church, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Episcopal Party themselves, who talk so highly of Unity, and condemn others who differ from them, (I mean the Presbyterians) as Schismaticks; and such in whose Communion people may not safely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, as this Author doth more than insinuat, <hi>p:</hi> 11. The various O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of our prelatical Brethren, I have taken notice of <hi>Rational des: of Nonconform: p:</hi> 159, 160, 161. I shall not resume what is there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed; but consider this Diversity somewhat more extensively. Some think that no one form of Government is held forth in Scripture, or was practised in the Apostolick Churches: I have seen this question learnedly Debated in a <hi>Manuscript;</hi> if the Abetters of it mean, that sometimes the Apostles acted by their own sole Authority; at other times they left the Management to the ordinary fixed Officers in the Church; and on other Occasions, deputed Evangelists to Govern for them, for a time; or that in some Circumstances of Government, they did not always observe Uniformity: I think all this may be allowed; but if it be meant, that the Substantials of Government were not always the same, as acted by the ordinarie fixed Officers; but that some Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were then Governed by Bishops, others by a Colledge of Presbyters: I see no ground for such a Debate, nor to think that there was any such Variety in the Apostostolick Church. 2. <hi>I</hi> have some where found it denyed, that Apostles had Majority of Power or Jurisdiction over Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters: and <hi>Paul Bayn, dioces: Tryal, p: 73: Arg: 5: and p: 77. Conclus:</hi> 5. is cited for this Also Mr. <hi>Rutherf: Div: Right of Church Government, p: 21. I</hi> need not Debate this. And <hi>I</hi> find <hi>Bayn</hi> saith no more, but that the Apostles had not Majoritie of Directive or Corrective Power as Lords, but only as Christs Ministers; and that no such Power is in the Church, save in the Person of Christ: but he expresly alloweth in them Ministerial Power, declarative and authoritative. Mr. <hi>Rutherf: I</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, meaneth no more. This indeed is the Opinion of many, and our Adversaries cannot disprove it, that the Apostles did not usually make use of their Power in settled Churches, further than to declare the Mind of Christ to them; but left the exercise of Church Power to the settled Officers of these Churches. 3. Some are of Opinion, that though the Apostles exercised Authority in Governing the Churches, and left Ecclesiastical Officers in the possession of it, to be exercised by them, during the want of the Christian Magistrat: yet as soon as the Church
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62347:13"/>
had a Civil Magistrat owning the Faith, that all ruling Power devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into his hand. This is no part of our present Debate; though our Brethren in the late Reigns, allowed much more of the Exercise of Church power to the Magistrate, than was warrantable. 4. We debate not now about the Popes Monarchical power over the whole Christian Church, though many think that Monarchical power of Bishops, over the Presbyters and People of a large District, now called a Diocess, hath no more Warrand in Scripture, than this hath. Nor 5. Do we now debate whether the Government of the Church be Democratital, and to be managed by the body of the people: or so Aristocratical, as to be managed by the Elders in every single Congregation, independent on superior Judicatures, to whom no Appeal may be from them, or who may call them to an account for their actings, and authoritatively Censure them. 6. Some hold that no one Form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is now necessary, or of Divine right, but that the Church or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat in several Churches, may Appoint what shall be found most fit and sutable to the people among whom it is to be exercised. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was lately generally owned by our Episcopalians, and asserted strongly by Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Worcester:</hi> (that learned Author doth also prove, out of an antient <hi>Manuscript,</hi> that this was the Opinion of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and four other Bishops) and it met with no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position from that Party, so far as we could hearof; nay, not by this our Author who is now so highly become a <hi>Jure Divino</hi> man. It was then the way to Preferment, and suteable to the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> and more especially to the <hi>Test.</hi> But it is one thing with some men, to think that a Popish King may alter Church Government: and another thing to allow the same Power to a Protestant King. We are then agreed about the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of a <hi>species</hi> of Church Government, and the unalterableness of it: which maketh it seem strange, that this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author should make such Tragical Outcrys against our pleading a Divine Right, as if this were <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> yea, <hi>much worse than speculative Enthusiasm,</hi> p: 14: <hi>Visions and fancies,</hi> ibid: while he is as positive for the Divine Right of what he holdeth: which we shall not call by so ill names; but think, that who hath the worse in matter of Argument, is in an Errour; but such an Errour as is consistent with Sobriety, and good sense.</p>
               <p>§ 3. The Question is not 7. What sort of Church Government is best, and nearest to the Scripture Pattern? for that may be nearer to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62347:14"/>
it, which yet doth deviate from the Scripture; but less than another Form of Government doth: and though that Form of Government is more commendable, than another which cometh nearest to the Pattern in all the Steps of the Administration of it; and we are willing that parity and prelacy be thus compared in all that they can charge us with, or we can charge on them; (which Comparison I cannot now stay to make in the Particulars in which it may be stated) yet they contend that Prelacy is exactly what Christ willeth to be exercised in the Church: and we say the same of Parity: and herein lyeth the Question. 8. It is to be noted that our Controversie is not about the name, but the power of a Bishop. The Pastors of the Church are called Bishops, <hi>Acts 20. 28. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 1. and else where: for the power of a Bishop, (as this name is appropriated to one Presbyter.) We deny not that very early in the primitive Church, the <hi>Praeses</hi> in their Meeting for Discipline and Government was fixed, and had that place during life, and due manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Office: and he had a power of calling and ordering their Meetings, and was subject to their Censures. But our Brethren are not content with this; but affirm, that by Divine Institution, and primitive Practice, the Bishop had a majority of power both extensively, that is over the Pastors and people, which other Presbyters had not: and that over the Pastors and people of many Congregations, which we call a Diocess: and also intensive, that is, that he hath power in some things wherein the other Presbyters have no such power: for they reserve to him the sole power of Ordination and Jurisdiction. It is true, some of them shun the word of sole power, and call it but a Majority of power: which is but to cover the nakedness of their Opinion, and inconsistent with their own practice: for they will not say that the Presbyter is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by the Bishop <hi>in plenitudinem potestatis,</hi> but only <hi>in partem sollicitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis:</hi> they make the Presbyters subject to the Bishop as a Rector, and as a Judge, in that they can do no act of power without his allowance: and he by himself may censure them, and cannot be censured by them, even in their collective Capacity: yea, they maintain that it is of the Bishops good will, not necessitie, or obligation, that he taketh the ad-Vice of the Presbyters in any act of Government: that he is the only Pastor of the Diocess; and all the rest of the Clergy are his Curats. It is true, some are more modest in expressing their Sentiments in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,; but these things are held by many <hi>in terminis,</hi> and particularly all this must be owned by this Author, (though he giveth us no distinct
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62347:14"/>
account of his Principles) seing he maketh Bishops Successors to the Apostles in their governing the Church, and that in their Rectoral Power, which he describes <hi>p. 97. to Preach, Govern the Church, give Rules and Directions to their Successors, and to all subordinate Ecclesiasticks, to inflict Censures,</hi> &amp;c. This power Apostolical, he contendeth to have been communicated unto the Bishops, and not to all the Presbyters <hi>I.</hi> S. in his <hi>Principles of the Cyprianick age,</hi> talketh high of this Power' of <hi>the Bishops Majesty, Monarchy, singular Prerogatives,</hi> which I have else where examined.</p>
               <p>§ 4. It is to be considered, 9. That there are diverse Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Episcopalians, who ascribe this power to the Bishop, about the Foundation of it, or how he cometh by it: some of them say, that Christ while he was on Earth, Instituted this Authority in the persons of Bishops, and made this difference between them and Presbyters. This the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> denyeth, while <hi>Iren: p:</hi> 197. he saith, that Christ gave equal power for ruling the Church, <hi>in actu primo,</hi> to all Ministers of the Gospel: others make it to be of Apostolick Institution; affirming that the Apostles after Christs Ascension, did appoint it. About this we contend not; but acknowledge it to be of Divine Right and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if either of these can be proved: for what the Apostles did in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling Church Order, was by the infallible Guidance of the Spirit of God. Others again hold, that this power was not settled till after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time, and that it was brought in by Custume, which obtained in process of time, and by degrees: but being of such reverend Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and practised by the Fathers, and all the primitive Churches, it may not be altered. There are also among them who say, it is only <hi>Juris Ecclesiastici,</hi> and was settled by the Church, and may be by her Authority changed. Our Opinion is, it hath none of these Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: that it was never settled by Christ, nor his Apostles; but that they settled the Government of the Churches, by Presbyters acting in parity: nor gave power to the Church, or any man, or men, to alter this Constitution: and so that this Power is usurped and unlawful.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Out of what hath been discoursed, our present Controversie turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this Hinge: whether the Government of the Church, which by Divine appointment, is to be used in all the ages and parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, should be by one Prelate, managing it by his sole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the counsel of Presbyters, so far as he thinketh fit to ask or take it: or by the Presbyters of the Church in their several Classes or Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62347:15"/>
acting with parity of power: the former part of the Question my Antagonist pleadeth for: I stand for the latter part of it: so that our Debate is not about the Accidentals or Circumstantials of Church Government; nor about what is practised by this or that Party, (for no doubt there are many things on both sides that want to be reformed, and which we can pretend no Divine right for) but it is about the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials of it, Prelacy or Parity.</p>

Wherefore, we own a perfect parity, in no other sense, but that preaching Presbyters are of the same order with a Bishop; and that he cannot act in matters of Government, without their concurrence, more than any of them can act without him. 2. I take notice that <hi>p.</hi> 22. he saith that <hi>such a Doctrine</hi> (the Divine right of parity) <hi>must be of dangerous consequence; because it is altogether new.</hi> What is to be thought of its <hi>noveltie,</hi> I have shewed <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. §. 1, and 2. As also, how weak the consequence is from its <hi>noveltie</hi> (such as I have acknowledged) to its being false. The dangerous consequence of it is, in general asserted; but he hath not told what hazard, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ariseth to the Church from this way of Government: many think that the greatest and most essential concernments of Religion, have been more promoted under Parity, than under Prelacy: if he will prove his Assertion, making the contrary appear, we shall consider the strength of his Reasons.</p>

I suppose by the <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> of the first Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, he meaneth that Summ of Doctrine which they appointed to be drawn up 1560, as that Doctrine that the Protestants would maintain: there, Artiole 22, are these words: <hi>Not that we think any Policy, and an order of Ceremonies can be appointed for all Ages, times, and places: for as Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, such as men have devised, are but temporary; so may and ought they to be changed, when they rather foster Superstition, than edifie the Church using the some.</hi> Here is not a word of Church Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither can these words rationally be understood of Ceremonies in a strick sense, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguished from Civil Rites and natural Circumstances in religious actings: for Ceremonies peculiar to Religion, the reforming Protestants of <hi>Scotland</hi> never owned, but such as were of Divine Institution. But that they did not hold the Government of the Church, by Prelacy or Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be indifferent, is evident, in that in <hi>the Book of Policy,</hi> or <hi>2d. Book of Discipline,</hi> they do own only <hi>four sorts of ordinary and perpetual Office bearers in the Church: to wit, Pastors, Doctors, Elders, and Deacons,</hi> where the Bishop is plainly excluded: nor did they ever look on <hi>Superintendents</hi> as perpetual Officers; but for the present necessity of the Church, not yet constituted. It is like this Debate may again occur: wherefore I now insist no further on it.</p>
               <p>§ 8. He blindly throweth Darts at Presbyterians, which sometimes miss them, and wound his own party: as <hi>p:</hi> 13, he hath this Assertion, <hi>when a Society of men set up for Divine, absolute, and infallible Right, they ought to bring plain proofs for what they say; else they must needs be lookt on as Impostors, or at least self conceited and designing men;</hi> and much to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Is it easie to subsume, but this Author and his Partizans set up for <hi>Divine, absolute and infallible right for Prelacy;</hi> and yet they bring not plain proofs for what they say: therefore he and they are <hi>Impostors, self conceited and designing men:</hi> they indeed pretend to plain proofs; and so do we: let the Reader then judge whose proofs are plainest, and best founded; and who are to be judged <hi>Impostors,</hi> by his Argument. But in truth there is no consequence to a mans being an <hi>Impostor,</hi> from his own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Divine Right, even though his Arguments be defective in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and in strength: it only followeth that such do mistake, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not the mind of God in that matter, so well as they should; and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62347:16"/>
that their strength of Reason doth not answer the confidence of their Assertion: and if this be a Blame (as I think it is) no men in the world are more guilty than his party; nor among his party, than himself: as will appear in examining his Assertions and Arguments. For <hi>self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,</hi> the Reader will easily see where it may be observed, if he consider the superciliousness with which his Book is written. If Presbyterians be the designing men, they are great fools: for there are no <hi>Bishopricks,</hi> nor <hi>Deanries,</hi> nor very fat Benefices to be had in that way: which might be the Objects of such designs. Who are the <hi>head strong</hi> men that <hi>will knock others on the head, unless they will swear they see that which indeed they cannot see,</hi> may be judged by the Excommunications, and the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as's</hi> and consequents of these, which many of late did endure for pure Nonconformity. I am not acquainted with these Presbyterians, who say <hi>that none but wicked men will oppose our Government:</hi> this is none of our Doctrine: it is rather his own who excludeth from the Church such as are for Presbytery, and affirmeth it to be dangerous to continue in the communion of such: we do not Excommunicat any who differ from us about Church Government, for their Opinion, nor for not joining with us.

which were hardest for him to answer: also representing them in such a dress as we do not so make use of them, and they may be easiest for him to Debate. It had been fairer dealing if he had represented our cause in its full strength, and then answered what we say. Before I come to these Arguments which he is pleased to name, I shall propose some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which he, or some others, may consider, when next they think fit to write.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Our first Argument shall be this: our Lord hath given power to Presbyters, not only to dispense the Word and Sacraments; but to rule the Church, and joyn in the exercise of the Discipline of the Church: but he hath given no majority of power to one Presbyter over the rest, nor made this exercise of that power to depend on one of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath not Instituted Prelacy, but left the Government of the Church to be exercised by Presbyters acting in paritie. The first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position many of the Episcopalians yield. yea, the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> saith plainly, that <hi>Christ hath given equal power to them all;</hi> which is the foundation of his <hi>Irenicum.</hi> But it may be this Author will deny it; and therefore I shall prove it: to wit, that preaching Presbyters had power of Government and Discipline. 1. Preaching and ruling power are joyned, as given joyntly to the ordinary Pastors of the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. The same persons who <hi>watch for the peoples souls</hi> (as all Pastors do) rule also over the Church, <hi>ibid:</hi> v. 17. they are called in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Leaders:</hi> the word is used to express any kind of Authority, whether Civil, Military, or Ecclesiastick: but Church Rulers only can be here meant, <hi>viz.</hi> who speak the word of God to the people, and watch for their Souls; and such as they had at that time; seing they are bidden salute them, <hi>v.</hi> 24. To understand this of <hi>Dyocesan Bishops,</hi> as some do, is most absurd: for the ground on which Obedience is here enjoyned is, Preaching and Watching, which are things not peculiar to the Bishop: wherefore not he only is to be obeyed: and thence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that not he only doth rule in the Church. 2. They who are sent to teach and baptize Authoritatively in the Name of the Lord, and have power to command and require people (by vertue of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from Christ) to obey what they enjoyn them, have also power of Spiritual correction of them who (professing subjection to Christ) do not obey his Laws: for we do not read that Christ committed to some the one of these powers, and the other to others: neither is there the least foundation in Scripture for that Fiction, that Christ impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62347:17"/>
Pastors to teach people and gather Churches, over whom he would afterward set some more eminent Pastor to rule them: the strain of Scripture seemeth to run contrary: That the Apostles gathered and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Churches, and then committed the feeding and ruling of them to men of an inferiour Order. Yea, it were strange, if this had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, that no hint is given about that more eminent Pastor, that should afterwards be set over Pastors and people. Neither can it be imagined, that the Office of begetting of Souls to Christ, can be separated from a power of correcting, as spiritual Fathers, or that Presbyters should be Pastors without governing power. 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Elders that were in the Church, to <hi>feed the flock, and take the oversight of them,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and <hi>to beware of lording it over them,</hi> which plainly saith that they had Authority; which they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of abusing, or stretching too far: now these Elders are told of their being accountable to Christ, but not a word of a superior Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Bishop, to whom they must be answerable: and this power is given to as many as were Feeders, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which cannot be denyed to Presbyters. It is true, the word Elder may be applied to a Bishop, yea to an Apostle, and the Apostle here designeth himself by it; tho he was more than an ordinary Elder: but that it cannot here be so restrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appeareth, because the Injunction is to Pastors or Feeders in general, as hath been said.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Our second Proposition of this Argument I prove, because all the grant of ruling that we meet with in Scripture, and all the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are given to any to rule in the Church, do respect the people as the Object of that work; we find no Commission to any man to rule over the Pastors of the Church: let our Adversaries shew us such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission given to any man, either directly and expresly, or by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. We read of feeding the Flock, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. and <hi>taking heed to themselves</hi> (each of them) <hi>and to the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made them overseers, Acts</hi> 20. 28. Here are Bishops of the Flock, but no Bishop of Bishops, or of Pastors: they were to be corrected, not by one set over them, but each by the Meeting of the whole. Again, if the power of the Pastors of the Church (I mean them who dispense the Word and Sacraments to the people) did depend on the bishop, is it imaginable that it should not have been told us that Ministers may not preach, nor baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the Bishops leave? This was needful to clear the Consciences of Ministers: Christ hath charged them to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62347:17"/>
preach, and that diligently; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 1, 2. If the exercise of this power depend on the Bishop, he may supersede this Charge; neither can the Presbyter preach if the Bishop forbid him: now what Minister of the Gospel can satisfie his Conscience in this Matter, unless he see a clear warrand from the Scripture, that the Bishop hath this power over them. Further, this is to make all the Ministers of a Diocess to have their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the Bishop, and to be in a proper sense his Curats: which (tho I know some of our Brethren own, yet) hath this absurdity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on it, that it maketh the Ministers of the Gospel contemptible in the eyes of the People, who depend on them (not on the Bishop, whom, may be, they shall never see, nor hear) for the means of their Edification: this is not the way to put Ministers in a Capacity to edifie the people, it is to make them the servants of one Man, not Rulers in the house of God, under their Master Christ.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Our second Argument we take from the Apostles enumeration of all the Officers that, by Divine appointment, are set in the Church: whether extraordinary, which are now ceased; or ordinary, which are to continue to the end of the World. But among all these there is no Bishop, with power over Presbyters; <hi>ergo,</hi> no such Officer is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christ: but the Church must be Governed by Presbyters acting in Parity, and without Subordination to such a superior Officer. That there is a full enumeration of all Church Officers that are of Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment made in the Scripture, is evident; for an enumeration of them is often made, as <hi>Rom. 12. 6, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. This enumeration is either <hi>complete</hi> or <hi>defective:</hi> if <hi>complete,</hi> that is, what we desire: there can be no Church Officer owned, as <hi>Juris Divini,</hi> but what is in some of these places to be found: if any say that this enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is Defective; not only in some one of these places, but in them all: that is, that there is a Church Officer of Divine appointment that is found in none of them; he reflecteth a blame on the Holy Ghost, which an ordinary Writer (who pretendeth to any measure of ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>or &amp; accuracy) would be ashamed of. The design of these Scriptures is to instruct the Church, what officers Christ hath appointed to be in his Church, that people may know from what sort of men they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Gods Ordinances, to whom they should Submit, whom they should hear and own. Now if there be some Officers whom Christ hath appointed to teach and rule his Church, who are not in some of these Catalogues mentioned, this is a lame instruction in this matter: and we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62347:18"/>
are still at a loss whom we should own as Christs Embassadors to us, and what should be our carriage toward them.</p>
               <p>§ 5. I suppose the second proposition is that which our brethren will most controvert with us: which if they do, they must shew us where they find a <hi>Diocesan Bishop</hi> in any of these places, or in any other enumeration of Church officers; if they know of any more. Here some of them have put their invention on the Tenter-hooks, to find my Lord Bishop among all these Church officers. If he be found <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. It must be <hi>v.</hi> 8. He that ruleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I have met with none of them who insist on this place. The current of Interpreters either hold in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: mentioning rulers. So <hi>Estius, Tolet, Hamond:</hi> or understand it of ruleing Elders, who were distinct from preaching Presbyters, as <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius, Gomarus, Beza, Parraeus: Grotius</hi> also saith, they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>de quibus</hi> Tertull: <hi>praesident probati quique seniores: horum erat diligenter attendere ad singulorum mores, monere titubantes, lapsos censura corrigere, Praescribere pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae tempus, &amp; modum; interdum &amp; relaxare.</hi> No man will think that <hi>Grotius</hi> here meaneth a Diocesan Bishop, who hath many thousands of Souls under his Charge, whose manners he cannot particularly inspect. Some pretend that the Bishop is designed 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. Under the name of <hi>Governments,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: but first, it is plain that here is meant a sort of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour distinct from the Teacher, who is here also named: but this is not competent to the Bishop; but to the ruling Elder. 2. Though an Argument drawen barely from the order wherein these Officers are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, were not of much force; yet in this place, where the Apostle doth accuratly note the order and dignity of these Officers, by a first, and secondarly, and thirdly; it must needs be very significant. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seing our Opposites themselves do take notice of the Apostles words as marking out out the Degrees of the dignity of these Officers. <hi>Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Hamond, Estius</hi> also, observes the eminency of the Apostles, from their being first mentioned, with this Note, first; the former two also on these words, <hi>Secondarly Prophets,</hi> call them <hi>Apostolis honore proximos.</hi> Let it then be considered, when the Apostle is so exact in setting down the order and dignity of Church Officers, whether it be consistent with this, that Governments, if by them were meant Diocesan Bishops, should be placed after the Pastors and Teachers; that is Presbyters. If it be said that <hi>Helps,</hi> whom we take to be Deacons, are set before <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> whom we make ruling Elders; though the latter be of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in the Church than the former. I answer: after the Apostle hath
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62347:18"/>
ranked the chief Officers in the Church, both these who were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, &amp; who are ordinarie, he doth not use that exactness in these that are inferior of either sort: but while he doth expresly place the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (who are Presbyters) in the the third place of Dignity, it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, either to take no notice of the place in which the Bishop should be ranked, or to put him behind the Presbyter. If any alledge that the Bishop is meant both by the <hi>teacher,</hi> and by <hi>Governments:</hi> this were to admit of an absurd tautologie in a very short list of Church Officers: beside that it were to exclude Preaching Presbyters, as no Officers in the house of God: for by this gloss no mention is made of any teaching Presbyter, except Bishops.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Others fancy that they find Bishops under the name of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. But he is neither pleased to tell us who these Greeks are, nor what reason they give for this Explication. 2. He seemeth to plead that here is expressed a part of the Episcopal power, <hi>cujus rei causa</hi> (saith he) <hi>est quod haec erat specialis pars muneris Episcoporum, quod ipsorum fidei commissa est cura pauperum, &amp; dispensatio facultatum Ecclesiae: ut testantur Justin: Ignat: Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp: &amp;c. Et Acts</hi> 20. 35. This Author rather than not find a Bishop in the Text, he will turn him to a Deacon: contrarie to the Institution of Christ, by his Apostles <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2, 3, 4. what <hi>Justin:</hi> &amp;c. Say in this point, I cannot examine, because he hath not pointed to the places: but I am sure <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 35. saith no such thing: nor can I understand what should move this Author so to expound the place, unless it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he findeth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in that Text, and he will force that word to express the work of a Bishop: it is plain, even from the records of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, as well as from Scripture, that the Bishops had no further the Dispensation of the goods of the Church, than that the Ministers and Elders had a directive power in that matter, and the Deacons did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute what was appointed by them. But for the Text <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 35. It is far from aiming at any such matter: the Apostle setteth before them his Example, in working with his own hands; by which he did two ways support the infirm; both by spareing the Poors Stock, in his not taking the maintainence that he might have demanded, and also by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of what he gained by his Labour, for their relief: I do not exclude from the meaning of this Text, Acts of mercy toward Souls, by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual instructions, and Consolations, Administred to distressed Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

By the force of the word: the native and genuine signification of which is, to <hi>help, uphold,</hi> or <hi>support</hi> one who is in hazard to fall: which I am sure, is rather done to the Poor by a Deacons work, or to a troubled Soul, by the work that is common to all Teachers in the Church, than by that work that is held to be peculiar to a Bishop. That learned Critick saith, it signifieth <hi>curam alicujus rei gerere;</hi> and referreth to his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 54. where I find he maketh it to answer to the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the <hi>hand,</hi> laid hold on by another, being that by which one is supported, that he fall not as he goeth: and it is evident that the force of that word in these places, doth not so much import Gods guiding his people in their way, as his <hi>manutenency</hi> by which they are supported. From all which it is plain, that there is no sufficient ground brought by <hi>Grotius,</hi> why we should think that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any ruling power in them of whom it is to be understood. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we should grant that this word signifieth to <hi>take care of a thing;</hi> will it follow thence that this care must needs be ruling care; when the word properly signifieth <hi>upholding,</hi> (to which indeed care is often need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) but it cannot be said that care is implyed in the word. I have been at the pains to look into all the places of the New Testament (as far as <hi>Stephanus</hi>'s Concordance could lead me) where that word, in any of its <hi>derivata,</hi> is used; and I cannot find one that hath any thing of the notion of ruling. Wherefore I must still abide in the Opinion which I have else where expressed, and have been by this my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist severely censured for it, that this Criticism of <hi>Grotius</hi> is odd and groundless.</p>
               <p>§ 8. These of our Episcopal brethren, who make the Bishops to be Successors to the Apostles in their Apostolick Office, will possibly say, that the Bishops are mentioned in the first place, in the Lists of Church Officers; <hi>viz.</hi> under the name of <hi>Apostles.</hi> Whether the Bishops be Successors to the Apostles or not, will fall in to be debated when I come to consider the second Chapter of this Book, which I am now examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: what I have now to do is, to shew that they are not meant by the <hi>Apostles</hi> mentioned in the Scriptures that are now under debate: which may plainly appear, if we consider first, that none of their own Commentators do so expound any of these places; nor can such a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy come into any mans head, when he considereth the Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a present Byass on his mind, and laboureth to bring the Sense of the Scripture out of the words, and not into them. Yea, <hi>Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 28. speaking of the Apostles there mentioned, have these words, <hi>Illos nempe eminenter sic dictos, à Christo in id vocatos, ut pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Ecclesiarum fundamenta jacerent.</hi> And <hi>Doctor Hamond</hi> saith, these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were called <hi>ut Ecclesias plantarent, &amp; regerent, eadem potestate quam Christus à Patre habuit.</hi> I hope none will say that this can be said of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or any ordinary and perpetual Officers in the Church. 2. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62347:20"/>
be denyed, even by them who make the Bishops a kind of Apostles, and allow a sort of Apostolick power to them, but that they are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of Apostles than the first Apostles were: none will say that they are wholly the same, more than the Pastors of the Church are the same with the Prophets that were in the Apostolick Church: they must then distinguish the Apostles into extraordinary, who were sent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by Christ, to plant Churches; and ordinary, who succeed to these, and whose work it is to rule the Churches that are already plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now to say that both these sorts are meant in these Lists, under the same name of Apostles, is to accuse the Spirit of God of darkness and confusion, in these Institutions where Light and Distinctness might be most expected: for in these Enumerations, he is instructing the Church what Officers she should own as of Christs appointment: but by the word Apostle she could never know that there are two sorts of Apostles to be owned: one sort all do acknowledge to be here meant; they who would have us believe that another sort of Apostles is also here meant, must give us some better ground for believing this, than a Synonimous word: <hi>I</hi> do not know how many sorts of Officers they may bring in under this name. If they may be allowed to divide the Apostolick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at pleasure, and call every one of them who have any part of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick work to do, a sort of Apostles: this is to expound Scripture at pleasure, and indeed to make it speak what we fancy. <hi>I</hi> conclude then, that Bishops have no Divine right for them, seing the Lord hath of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose told us what Officers he hath appointed to be in his Church, both at first for planting of it, and afterward for managing her Affairs to the end of the World, and no Diocesan Bishop, name nor thing, is to be found among them.</p>
               <p>§ 9. A third Argument for Parity, and against Prelacy, I take from the Commandment that Christ gives about the Administration of Church Discipline, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18: 17: that the offended Party (when other more private means of Redress do fail) should lay the case before the Church: whence this Argument doth clearly result; that Power which is by Christs Appointment to be exercised by many, is not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> lodged in one person; but Church Jurisdiction is a Power that by Christs Appointment, is to be exercised by many; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> in the hand of one person, to wit, a Prelate. The <hi>major</hi> cannot be called in question: for if it were otherways, Christ should bid men act contrary to his own Institution; which to imagine, is most absurd. For
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62347:20"/>
the <hi>minor Proposition:</hi> Christs Injunction is, <hi>tell it to the Church;</hi> which word doth always signifie a plurality of men met about some common work; never a single person acting by himself. I need not here debate with <hi>Erastians,</hi> who by the Church understand the <hi>Magistrate:</hi> nor with <hi>Independents,</hi> who hence argue for the peoples Church power: these my present Antagonists condemn, as well as I do. But our Debate is with them who are for Church Monarchy: whether over the whole Church, as Papists; or over the several Districts in the Church, as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists: both of them agree in this, that they place Church Jurisdiction in a single person; and by the Church, must here understand such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Against this conceit many Arguments may be drawn from the Text it self. First, the Gradation that Christ here recommendeth, in dealing with Offenders for their Amendment: that the offended person must first deal with the Offender by himself alone: next (that failling of its effect) he must take the Assistance of two or three: if this prevail not, he must bring the Matter to a greater number, to wit the Church. The learned <hi>Drusius,</hi> on this Text, citeth the Passage out of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which sheweth, that this Gradation was used in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and that as their Discipline, as the name of the Book importeth. After the Author hath enjoyned the first and second Step (as the Text doth) he addeth; <hi>Si nec hoc modo quicquam profecit, debet eum pudefacere coram multis, ejusque delictum publicare:</hi> which sheweth, that the third Step of Reprehension among them, was not to tell the Crime to a single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: wherefore when our Lords third Step is to tell it to the Church, it is not like he meant a single person, however of more Authority than the two or three.</p>
               <p>§ 10. A second Proof of this is, the word <hi>Church</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is never so used; but always signifieth a <hi>Plurality:</hi> why should it then be so used here? 3. When Christ speaketh of a Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sentence of this Church to whom the Complaint is made, and whom the stubborn Offender will not hear, he doth not speak of that Church as a single person: what <hi>ye</hi> shall bind, and what <hi>ye</hi> shall loose. 4. He speaketh of that Church which correcteth the Offender, as what may consist of a very small number, <hi>two, or three, v.</hi> 20. but giveth no hint that a single person can be so lookt on. 5. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this place of a Plurality; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62347:21"/>
Bishop, in his District: his words are, <hi>Per Ecclesiam non unus aliquis (nam hoc verbi ratio prohibet) sed plures Ecclesiae praesidentes, intelliguntur. Ut autem unus Ecclesiae summus Monarcha designetur per nomen Ecclesiae, fieri non potest, repugnat enim natura &amp; nomen Ecclesiae, quae est congregatio ex pluribus; &amp; in uno consistere, si propriè loquimur, non potest: repugnat deinde &amp; Patrum interpretatio, qui una voce non unum Pontificem, sed Episcopos &amp; praesidentes Eccelesiae; seu ut Patres synodi Basileenses loquuntur, Ecclesiae praesiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium concilium designari volunt:</hi> Here is a plain Confession out of the mouth of an Adversary. For it is evident that Complaints must be made to lesser Churches, and not to the Universal Church only: and why one man set over a Province may be called the Church, and one set over all the Christian Church may not get the same Designation, is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable. It is here objected by some, that this place is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> not of the Christian Church: and this they pretend to prove, because the incorrigible Offender is to be lookt on <hi>as an Heathen or Publican.</hi> To this I reply, first, if in the Jewish Church, where was an High Priest, there was not a Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; much less is there ground for it in the Christian Church. 2. That Christ gave this Direction for the Christian Church, (which then was presently to be set up) is evident; because this Injunction is given to the Apostles, who had no hand in the Government of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church; and the same power of <hi>binding and loosing</hi> which here is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be in them, is expresly given, and called the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, <hi>Mat. 16: 19: John</hi> 20: 23: This alluding to Jewish Customes, and expressing New Testament Discipline by looking on scandalous impenitent Sinners <hi>as Heathens and Publicans,</hi> is no Argument against what I have said; this being frequent with Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; yea with the Prophets, long before, to express Gospel matters by Old Testament terms.</p>
               <p>§ 11. <hi>Argument</hi> 4. The Churches even in the time of the Apostles, were governed by Presbyters acting joyntly, without a Bishop set over them; <hi>Ergo</hi> the government of the Church by a Bishop set over Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is not of Divine Right: The Consequence cannot with any shew of Reason be denyed: for the Apostles were more vigilant and faithful, than to suffer such encroachment to be made upon a Power that Christ had given to his Servants. It is a most irrational fancy, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in their own time, allowed Presbyters to govern the Church under their Inspection; but after their death appointed Bishops to rule alone.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62347:21"/>
For first, this had been to allow the exercise of a power in Presbyters, that not only they had no right to, but which did belong to others by Divine Institution. 2. What ground is there to say, that this ruling Power in Presbyters was but temporary, or that it ceased at the death of the Apostles? Especially considering that some of the Apostles did long outlive others of them; how should the expiring of that Power of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters be determined: nor do we read of any ceasing of what Power they once had. This is a Fiction that no account can be given of. Wherefore our Debate is about the Antecedent of this Argument; which I must prove by Instances.</p>
               <p>§ 12. And first the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was thus governed; not only by the Apostles connivance, but by his express Direction and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as in the case of <hi>the incestuous man, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. That a plurality of Church Rulers, and not a single person, had power to censure that man, is proved first; the Apostle, <hi>v.</hi> 2. reproveth their Negligence in that they had not cast out this man from among them by Excommunication; they were not duely affected with the Crime, and did not mourn for it; neither did set about censuring of it: both these were the effects of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not being so sensible of the evil of it, as they ought to have been: In this sense <hi>Ambrose</hi> understands this place: for on this occasion he saith, <hi>Si au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem quis potestatem non haber, qui scit reum abjicere, vel probare non valet; immunis est.</hi> So also <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> on the place <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>non accusat quod non ei significaret; sed quod non deplorarent ut tolleretur: ostendens quod etiam sine monitore id fieri opportuit, propter peccati evidentiam.</hi> What can be more plain, than that these Fathers lookt on a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Church Rulers in <hi>Corinth,</hi> as having the power of Church Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? Yea, that the Apostle thought so too; otherways he could not have charged them with neglecting this Matter. 2. The Apostle giveth his Opinion, that this scandalous person should be Excommunicated <hi>(delivered to Satan)</hi> by them assembled together; (not by one Bishop among them, and of this their assembling for this end, he saith two things; which imply their power: that his Spirit should be with them; that is his good Wishes, Approbation, and hearty Concurrance) <hi>Menoch: in locum; congregatis vobis quibus ego adsum praesens Spiritu, affectu, &amp; Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudine.</hi> Next, that this was to be done by them in the Name and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Christ, and with his Power, or Vertue, by which he would bless this his own Ordinance, and make it effectual: none of these could be said of this Act, if it were done by a Company of men who had no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62347:22"/>
power from Divine Institution. 3. The Apostle saith expresly <hi>v.</hi> 12. that <hi>they</hi> (not thou Bishop, but ye) <hi>judged them who were within;</hi> that is the Church Members. 4. The Apostle speaking of this Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication when it was past, saith, that it was the <hi>rebuke of many, 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 6. not of one Bishop. 5. He after directeth the Church Rulers to take off this Sentence, the man being now truly penitent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2: 7. which is an Act of Church Authority, and they could not take off the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence if they had not power to lay it on.</p>
               <p>§ 13. Our Adversaries make some Exceptions against this Argument. First, that the Apostle doth not enjoyn the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Elders to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the man; because he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I have judged:</hi> he passed the Sentence, and enjoyned them to publish, and execute it. This is said without ground: for it is evident, that the Sentence was not passed when this Epistle was written; as is clear from the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above adduced: the man was not yet purged out, he was not delivered to Satan: the Apostle saying he had judged already, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> signifieth no more but that it was his Opinion, in which, after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, he was determined, that the thing should be done: beside, that his judging did not exclude the Presbyters judging with him, more than when <hi>James</hi> said <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I judge,</hi> it barred the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Judgment of that Council that sat with him. Again they except, that these Presbyters were not at libertie to excommunicate this man or not, seing the Apostle had commanded it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was not in their power. Reply: the Consequence is naught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this necessity did not proceed from their want of power, but from the plain discoverie of their Dutie, held forth to them by the Apostle. Any Minister of the Gospel may require any person to do that which is a plain Dutie; and yet not deprive the person of his power in that Act. When the Prophets held forth the Mind of God to Kings about any Act, they did not take away their Regal power that they had for these Acts. 3. They alledge that this delivering the man to Satan, was not Excommunication; but an extraordinary inflicting some bodily Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, which only the Apostle, and others having the Gift of Miracles, could do: and therefore it cannot argue any power in the Presbyters of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Reply: This Exposition of the place (though I deny not some of the Fathers have used it) is without all ground, or example in Scripture; and a pure Invention to serve a turn. Again, the Apostle reproveth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that they had not done this; bids
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62347:22"/>
them, with his Spirit joyning with them, do it: but it was never heard, that they who wrought Miracles did it with the Concurrence of others: Further, this Punishment was inflicted by many, to wit the Elders of <hi>Corinth;</hi> but they had no power of working Miracles. Lastly, <hi>Erastus</hi> (the chief A better of this Opinion in these latter ages) held that this power was given to the Apostles, and some others, till there should be a Christian Magistrate in the Church, to punish Scandals: from this it would follow, that the Magistrate should now purge out by death, all the Scandals which the Apostle appointed to be purged out by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or <hi>delivering to Satan;</hi> such as Drunkards, Fornicators, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. which would make the Church like a Shambles.</p>
               <p>§ 14. Another instance of a Church governed by a Plurality of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and not by a Bishop, is that of <hi>Thessalonica. 2 Thess.</hi> 3. 14. where the Apostle enjoyneth them to <hi>note,</hi> or <hi>set a mark upon</hi> such as obey not the Apostles word, and to withdraw from them: this <hi>note,</hi> is the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Mark of Excommunication, which should make a persons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany be shunned by all Christians. <hi>Erasmus in locum, ut signamus boves cornupetas, quo vitentur:</hi> my Argument from this Text is this, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Presbyters at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> had power, and that by the Apostles allowance, to Excommunicate them who were disobedient to the Rules of the Gospel; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they, and not a single Bishop, did govern the Church. The Consequence is plain: the Antecedent is founded on the Apostles Injunction: he commandeth them to exercise this Discipline; which he would not have done, if they had not had Authority so to do. Neither doth he here design the person or persons, who were to be Excommunicated; but owneth them for proper Judges of that, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a general Rule by which they should judge, telling for what Crimes this Censure should be inflicted. The Prelatists labour to take off the strength of this Instance, by another reading, and Gloss, on this Text: they read it thus, <hi>if any man obey not our word, note, or signifie that man by an Epistle, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</hi> So that they make this to be the Apostles meaning: that they should write to him, giving him an account of the Scandals that should fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, to the end that he might Excommunicate the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and then the Church should shun their company: the Presbyters were to examine the Matter, and find it sufficiently proved; and upon their Information the Apostle was to pass Sentence.</p>

It must then be to put force on the Text, to draw it to express their gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice, by a Letter to the Apostle, of the mans faults. 3. It is evident that the Apostle speaketh of <hi>this Epistle</hi> of his; not of <hi>an Epistle</hi> to be written to him from that Church: for he saith not by <hi>an Epistle;</hi> but by <hi>the Epistle,</hi>

Upon this noting of that man, did immediatly, and necessar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, follow their abstaining from the company of the person so noted; as is clear in the Text: which cannot be said of their giving notice to the Apostle of any Scandal among themselves, because the Apostle (notwithstanding of their informatary Letter) might not think fit to Excommunicate the person accused, either because the Crime was not relevant, or the Proof not sufficient; but it must needs follow on their setting the Mark of Excommunication on him.</p>

They cannot alledge, that the Apostles might have used such a Power if they would. For that is to be proved: and further, their not using it, was a binding example to them who should come after them, from which they ought not to swerve. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the proof of the Assumption, I take notice of two Cases in which the Apostles used a singular Power, by themselves, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Church Discipline, or Correption, or other Church Acts. First, when a bodily Punishment was miraculously to be inflicted; as in the case of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> 2. When Discipline was to be exercised in a Church not yet constituted, nor furnished with them who had the ordinary Power; as many think, in the case of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus. Saravia,</hi> a great Patron of Prelacy, <hi>defen.

First, <hi>Paul</hi> did not ordain <hi>Timothy</hi> by himself; but with the Presbyters: though the <hi>laying on of his hands</hi> be mentioned by it self: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. yet, that the Presbyterie concurred is clear, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. The effect of the Imposition of Hands is ascribed to that of the Presbyterie, as well as to that of the Apostle; which is a clear Indication of a joint Power. 2. The Apostle did not, by himself, Excommunicat the <hi>Incestuous Corinthian;</hi> as hath been shewed. 3. The Apostles did not judicially determine the Question about observing the Law of <hi>Moses; Acts</hi> 15. by themselves, but with <hi>the Elders and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> They object that the Apostle by himself delivered <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> to Satan. It is to be proved by the Objecters, first, That these two men were Members of a settled and complete Church. 2. That if so, the Apostle did this by himself, without the Concurrence of the Presbyterie: neither of which can be proved.</p>

§ 17. <hi>Argument</hi> 6. We find no Superiority of Power that one had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the rest, in any sort of Church Officers; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not among the Pastors or Teachers of the Church neither. The Antecedent is clear; if we go through all the sorts of Officers mentioned in the Scripture: there was no Apostle had power over the rest, as all confess who are not for <hi>Peters</hi> and the Popes Supremacy. No such Disparity among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or Evangelists, or among the Governments, or ruling Elders, nor among Deacons. I confess after Ages brought in a Disparity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all these Orders, and invented new ones: it was no wonder then, that an <hi>Arch-Presbyter,</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> was brought in too: but no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture (which alone can found a Divine Right) for any such Disparity or Subordination. The consequence cannot be denyed; unless our Adversaries can prove, that this Disparity is Instituted by the Lord; though no such Disparity in the rest of the Orders be: which they shall never be able to do. It were strange, if the Lord should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Majority of Power of one Pastor over another, and yet not Hint that Disparity, when he is setting down all the Officers in his House: and while that he hinteth no Majoritie among any one of the sorts of Church Officers, this only should admit of such Subordination. I have brought these few Arguments for Paritie, and against Prelacy, that the Reader might see how slightly, and unfairly, my Antagonist dealeth with us, when he will have the World believe that we have no sufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, because he hath refuted one or two of them, which he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to single out, as easiest for him to deal with.</p>

               <p>I Took notice in the beginning of the former Section, that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor singleth out some of our Arguments, and these none of the most evident, and with a great deal of Confidence triumpheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, as if he had laid our Cause in the dust: I shall now try if even these Weapons, rightly managed, be able to wound his Cause; for as he representeth them, they can do us little service: but his unfair dealing will appear in this Conduct. Before I come to the Arguments themselves, I cannot overlook the general account that he giveth of the Arguments on our side, <hi>p.</hi> 15. That <hi>they may all be reduced to three Heads.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62347:24"/>
First, either they pretend that this Parity of Presbyters is expresly commanded by our Saviour. Or 2. They endeavour to support it by Consequences from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Texts of Scripture. Or 3. from some Testimonies of the ancient Writers of the Church.</hi> The latter two sorts of Arguments we do indeed use, but who ever pretended to the first, I know not. I confess, I no where read in Scripture Paritie of Presbyters named, nor such words as these, that the Church shall be in all ages governed <hi>communi Presbyterorum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silio,</hi> nor that it hath been <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> said, there shall be no Prelacy among Presbyters: and <hi>I</hi> am sure, the Scriptures that he mentioneth as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our Arguments of this sort, were never said by any of us, to be an express Command for Paritie; though we hold it to be a full and plain Command implyed, and which may be drawn out of the words by good Consequence. He saith <hi>p. 16. the Scots Presbyterians do more frequently insist on this</hi> (arguing from express command in Scripture) <hi>than any of the forraign Presbyterians:</hi> which appeareth to be an injurious Imputation, from what hath been said: for many of the forraign Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians do assert the Divine Right of Presbytrie as fullyas we do, though <hi>I</hi> cannot reckon the frequency of either their, or our insisting on it, that <hi>I</hi> may compare them, <hi>I</hi> am sure many more of them have written for it, than have defended it so in Print, in <hi>Scotland (I</hi> mean the Parity of Presbyters, which is the <hi>cardo controversiae;</hi> whatever difference may be between some of them and us, in some other things) <hi>Calvin. instit. lib. 4. c. 11. § 6. &amp; alibi.

               </p>
               <p>§ 2. The Argument from express command in Scripture which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth on, is <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 25, 26, 27, 28. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 42, 43, 44, 45. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25. We think here is a strong and concludent Argument against Prelacy and for Parity; though we did not call it an express Command. As a foundation for our Argument from this Scripture, let it be considered, that this Discourse of Christ is immediatly and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Apostles, to whom he was then speaking; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it may be applyed to all other Orders of Church Officers, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and extraordinay. It is a good consequence, Christ here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Prelacy among the Apostles; <hi>Ergo,</hi> among the ordinary Pastors of the Church likewise. And <hi>ergo,</hi> among the Elders, whose work it is to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62347:25"/>
rule. And <hi>ergo,</hi> among the Deacons: our Lord is not here saying that there shall be no diversity of Degrees, or Orders of Officers, in the Church; for he hath plainly Instituted the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. But among the Apostles there shall be no Soveraignty, nor Subjection, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among other Officers who are of the same Order, and whose work is the same. 2. Let it be also noted, that our Lord doth not here mention the Tyranny, or abuse of power, that was exercised among the Heathen Magistrats, over them who were subordinate to them; but only Dominion and Authority, which they might lawfully exercise: so that what he aimeth at is, that there was Subjection and Superiority among the Heathen Rulers; but no such thing should be among Church Rulers. 3. Though we deny not that there are, by Christs Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, divers Orders of Church Rulers; yet we see no ground to think that one of these Orders is subject to another, or is to be commanded by it: we hold that Ministers have no Jurisdiction over the ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but they are co-ordinate in the Government of the Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I state our Argument from this Text, I observe how groundlesly he bringeth this as the chief Topick that we use, and (overlooking all of our side who have learnedly and fully pleaded that Cause) he only citeth as pleading from this Scripture, Mr. <hi>David Dickson</hi> on <hi>Matthew</hi> who toucheth it very transiently, and on occasion of his commenting o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ 3. I shall now examine his Answers to this Argument. First, he saith that <hi>Christ here supposes Degrees of Subordination among his own Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as well as other Societies; and therefore,</hi> he saith, <hi>this Text referreth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Methods of attaining Preferment; that it must not be by force, violence, and other Arts that are so fashionable in secular Courts:</hi> thus he <hi>p.</hi> 17, and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 19. he commandeth them that they should not exercise their Jurisdiction as the Lords of the Gentiles, by a spirit of Pride and Domination.</hi> This and what
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62347:25"/>
followeth he seemeth to have borrowed from <hi>Grotius, de imp. summar potes. circa sacra. p.</hi> 339. who yet was as little for the Divine Right of Prelacy; as of Parity. To all this I oppone first, That Christ suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth here Subordination among his Disciples is <hi>grat is dictum.</hi> I deny not that there is Subordination among them (taking his Disciples for all Christians; but taking the word for the Apostles alone we deny it) and that both in respect of Degree and Authority. The people are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Rulers; one sort of Church Officers is inferior to another; which they may be, without being subject to their Authority: but there is no ground for inferring this Subordination from what is here said: for mens Ambition prompts them to make superior Offices in the Church, that themselves may enjoy them; as well as to aspire to these Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are extant and allowed. Again, Christ saith not, there shall be no Superiority in the Church; but <hi>among them,</hi> the Apostles This is evident from the occasion of this Discourse; which was the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous address of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> presented to Christ by their Mother; that they might be preferred to the rest of the Apostles, in that worldly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that they imagined Christ was to have on Earth: they aimed at such Authority as Civil Magistrats have, the Superior over the Inferior: our Lord telleth them his Kingdom was not of that nature; neither was there any such Subordinations to be among his Apostles. 3. That Christ here <hi>recommendeth Humility, and condemneth Ambition and Pride,</hi> cannot be denyed; the occasion given for this Discourse led him to it: but that this is the only Scope of his Discourse, is said without all Warrant: for he forbiddeth that Dominion and Authority that was among Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, to have place among them; which yet might be exercised by humble men. 4. That <hi>his scope is to forbid the exercise of their Apostolick or Episcopal Jurisdiction by a spirit of Pride and Domination,</hi> is also said with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book: That this he condemneth, we acknowledge: but that he only condemneth this, and not Monarchical Jurisdiction it self, is a groundless fancy, and contrary to the words of the Text, which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the one, but not the other. He telleth them also, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8. that <hi>they were all brethren:</hi> where <hi>Camero</hi> observeth that <hi>Damnat rem titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li; viz: magisterium &amp; authoritatem.</hi> 5. It cannot be said, that all the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers among the Gentiles, were proud and tyrannical; though not a few were such: but here Christ forbiddeth that Domination that was among the Heathen (yea it may extend to Christian) Magistrats, whether they obtain it ambitiously, and exercise it tyrannically, or not. <hi>It shall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62347:26"/>
not be so</hi> (as in the Civil State where Dominion and Authority is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised) <hi>among you.</hi> The two Brethren sought an Authority which they fancied would be in Christs Kingdom; not which he intended or insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted: and our Lord not only told them that no such thing was to be expected by any person in his Kingdom, that one Apostle should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, or one of the ordinary Pastors of the Church should have Jurisdiction over another; and so of the other Orders of Church Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: but he also reproveth their Ambition in so seeking such prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if any such thing were to be in the Church.</p>
               <p>§ 4. His second Exception against our Argument is, <hi>p. 18. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles exercised such Jurisdiction over inferior Ecclesiastics, therefore they did not so understand Christs words, as forbidding all Prelation in the Church.</hi> This is sufficiently obviated by what is already said: they did not understand it as forbidding all Prelation in the Church; but among themselves: <hi>It shall not be so among you.</hi> Yea, they did not understand it as forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Superiority of Degree or Order; but Jurisdiction over Church Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; such as is in the Civil State, over inferior State Rulers. His third Exception, which he saith <hi>doth bassle and expose this, Argument to all Intents and Purposes</hi> (big words, as his manner is, when the Matter is very improportionate) <hi>that he (our Lord) did that himself among them, which now he commanded them to do to one another; and therefore the doing of that toward one another, in obedience to the Command, should not infer a Parity; unless they blasphemously infer, that Christ and his Apostles were equal.</hi> This is far more easily <hi>baffled,</hi> and more <hi>exposed;</hi> if what hath been said be duely considered. But further that our Lord setteth before them an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Humility, and being far from ambitious Aspiring, doth no ways infer their Paritie with him; unless he were here only discharging Paritie among the Apostles; which we do not say, but have asserted the contrary. He is also condemning the Ambition and Pride that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>James and John,</hi> and which he well knew would be found in Church men afterwards; and with respect to that, he setteth his own Example of Modesty and Humility before them. Hence it appeareth that there is no <hi>Infatuation in owning the Scheme of Parity</hi> (as he fancieth <hi>p.</hi> 19.) but rather than drawing such a Consequence from that Scheme, deserveth that Reproach. That the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Fathers of the Church, carried as Servants under the Apostolical or Episcopal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, proveth nothing against us: beside that we own no Episcopal Dignity in the Fathers; but shall controvert it with him when he will,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62347:26"/>
If <hi>Walo Messalinus</hi> (as he saith <hi>p. 20.) layeth no great stress on the Argument from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Text,</hi> and mean, that we have stronger Arguments; I do not differ from him: and if <hi>Beza</hi> say, <hi>that here is not forbidden all Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> I have already said the same. He maketh yet a 4th Attempt on this Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21. That <hi>in the Jewish Church there was a Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, and Subordination, by Divine appointment: and if our Saviour had pulled down that ancient Policy, and commanded an Equality among the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the New Testament, he would not have stated the Opposition betwixt his own Disciples and the Lords of the Gentiles; but between them and the Priests of the Mosaick Oeconomie: as he doth when he reproveth the corrupt Glosses introduced into the Church by the Scribes and Pharisees.</hi> The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Reasoning will plainly appear, if we consider 1. That it is too great sawciness in us, to teach our Lord how to reason: If he think fit to make use of one Topick, and if it be to the purpose (as all that he saith must needs he, and what is here said is manifestly so) we ought not to presume to say he would have used another Argument, if he had so meant. Indeed if our Adversaries can make it appear that this way of Reasoning was not here apt, we shall yield that Christ did not mean as we think he did: But that can never be done. 2. He falsly supposeth that we disown all Subordination in the Church, and that we think Christ here did intend to condemn it. 3. The Old Testament had not been so pertinent an Example here, because it was now to be dissolved, our Lord would no longer allow it in the Church; whereas the Magistratical Authoritie, in the several Subordinations of it, was to continue; and he would have a Difference between the Church and State, to be continually visible in this very thing. Beside that the Old Testament Hierarchie is no more a Pattern for Episcopacy, than for Parity; unless our Author will say we must have a Pope, as they had a High Priest, with universal Authoritie over the Church. 4. Our Lords reproving the false Glosses brought in by the Scribes and Pharisees, is strangely drawn in here, and the Impertinency of it is unaccountable; for how could he mention any other as bringing these Doctrines, than the true Authors of them: as he else where warneth his Church of Heathen Doctrines and Practices, and then he nameth them, and not the Teachers of the Jewish Church. The other Text <hi>p.</hi> 21. we never used by it self, as an Argument against Episcopacy: and we deny that the Text now considered, hath been <hi>understood</hi> in his sense <hi>from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>

Presbyter, where Authority and Jurisdiction is mentioned. I confess I am unacquainted with such Passages of Scripture: I wish he had named some of them for our Instruction. We bring to the contrary <hi>Acts 20: 28: Phil: 1: 1: 2 Tim:</hi> 3: 1: all which himself mentioneth. The first thing that he opposeth to our Argument is, that <hi>p:</hi> 23: he proveth at great length, that <hi>the Jews, both in the first ages of that Church, and also afterward, did dichotomise their Clergy into Priests and Levites; though there was a High Priest above the other Priests, who also had their Subordinations. And therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Apostles and Apostolick men made use of the current Phraseology:</hi> thus he <hi>p:</hi> 25. I shall not contradict him in this Assertion: nor be much concerned what respect the Apostles had to the Phraseolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy used by the <hi>Jews.</hi> But nothing of this meeteth with our Argument; unless he will affirm, and prove, that this Dichotomy was so used as that no Distinction was ever made, either by Name, or any other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, of the High Priest from the rest; or of the Heads of the several Orders of Priests: <hi>David,</hi> by the Spirit of God, distinguished them from these Priests that were under their Charge. If he prove not this, he saith nothing to the purpose. and this he will not, I hope, attempt, the Scripture being so full and plain to the contrary; and that in all the ages of the Jewish Church, from <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Christ.</hi> If he will let us see these special <hi>Masteries and Jurisdictions whereby Bishops were in the New Testament, distinguished from Presbyters,</hi> as he confesseth <hi>p:</hi> 26. The High Priest was distinguished from the other Priests, even in these times when he saith the distinction of Names was least noticed, we shall pass from this Argument as inconcludent: but this he can never do; neither hath he attempted it: wherefore our Argument is not yet touched by him. I shall not adventure to list my self among his <hi>Ignoramus</hi>'s, whom he setteth that mark on, that <hi>think he pleadeth that there ought to be a Bishop above Presbyters, because there was a High Priest among the Jews;</hi> though some of his Brethren use this Plea, and himself in the very next words seemeth not to be very far from it, while he saith, <hi>but rather thus</hi> (I plead) <hi>that the Hierarchy that obtained in the Patriarchal and Jewish AEco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, was never abrogated in the new.</hi> If it be not abrogated, sure it standeth in force, and is of Divine Right to this day: and if so, we must have <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> not only a Bishop over the Presbyters of every Province, but a Pope over all these, for so it was in the Jewish AEcono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>

§ 8. He saith <hi>p.</hi> 28. that <hi>the first Presbyter, or</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in the Apostolick age, he that was vested with a</hi> Prostasia, <hi>was as much above the subordinate Presbyters, as the High Priest among the Jews was above other Priests.</hi> This is boldly asserted; but we see no proof for it. We deny not that in their Meetings there was one who presided; but that there was one distinguished from the other Presbyters who had this for his Work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, we find not: also that the <hi>Praeses</hi> in these Meetings, had the same power (either Extensive or Intensive) with the High Priest among the Jews, is an absurd and unproved Assertion. The Concession made by <hi>Salmasius</hi> maketh nothing against us; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>there was a</hi> Praeses: but that that learned Author held, that in the Apostolick age there was one person to whom the <hi>proto cathedria</hi> was constantly due, we deny; though we yield that in after ages this usage was brought in; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Superiority of Power. He saith <hi>p.</hi> 29. that <hi>there are such manifest and palpable Evidences of this peculiar Honour and Jurisdiction due to one of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Senate, in the Apostolick age, that the learned Sticlers for Paritie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it.</hi> His proof of this he bringeth from the <hi>Apocalyptick Angels,</hi> from <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and from the <hi>Succession of Bishops</hi> gathered about the middle of the second Century: and this proof he will have to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all contradiction.</hi> Here were a large Field for Observations, if one were in the humour to expose this Discourse. I shall take no further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his gross Mistakes, than the Vindication of Truth maketh neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. First, whoever they be that stickle for Paritie, and yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Jurisdiction due to some of the Ecclesiastical Senat; either in the Apostolick, or the next following Ages, they are not only not the learnedst men; but they cannot be reckoned men of a common measure of Understanding: what man of Sense will stickle for an Opinion, and yet expresly yield it to his Adversary: I deny not but some Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans yield, that early in the primitive times there was a peculiar Honour given to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but that any of them do carry it so high as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick age, is more than I know: I wish he had named them, and pointed to the places where these Concessions are found in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: far less do <hi>I</hi> know any that owneth a peculiar Jurisdiction; for that were indeed to yield the Cause: for the main thing in Dispute is, whether one of the Presbyters hath Jurisdiction over the rest. 2. It had been more suteable to the design and high pretenses expressed in his Book, to confound us, and rout our Cause, with these manifest and palpable Evidences; than to tell us of them in general: <hi>I</hi> profess <hi>I</hi> have hitherto
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62347:29"/>
seen no such Evidences in any of their Writings. 3. The Evidences that he mentioneth, the Angels in the Revelation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are neither pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable nor manifest Proofs of such Jurisdiction: he knoweth that all that hath by his Party been brought from these Topicks hath been Disputed, and has, I judge, been abundantly answered: and that Sticklers for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, both the learnedst and the less learned, have rejected these Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and denyed the Conclusion they were brought for: and <hi>I</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to debate them with him as they shall fall in. 4. That the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Bishops</hi> gathered in the midle of the second Centurie, should be a manifest and palpable Evidence for their peculiar Jurisdiction in the Apostolick age, is beyond my Comprehension: for the <hi>Catalogues</hi> do not determine what was their power; and these who made these Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, are not so infallible that their Assertion should be a manifest and palpable Evidence of the Truth of what they said.</p>
               <p>§ 9. That <hi>nothing was ever done in Ecclesiastical Meetings, Canonically, without the Bishops particular Advice, and Authority;</hi> (as he argueth <hi>p.</hi> 29.) is of no force: because first, we know not what he will call <hi>Canonically</hi> done: if he think nothing was <hi>canonically</hi> done without a <hi>Diocesan Bishop:</hi> this is to beg the Question, and not to argue for his Conclusion. 2. If he mean that nothing was done in their Meetings without a Moderator, who presided among them, and did, with the rest, authoritatively Consult and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; this we grant: but it maketh nothing for him. 3. What he meaneth by the Bishops particular Advice and Authoritie, <hi>I</hi> cannot well guess. If he mean that he Advised and Determined with the rest; that is what we hold. If, that he had a negative Vote; so that all the rest could do nothing without his consent, he ought not to call for Proof from us against that; the Probation is to be expected from him, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it. If, that he determined by himself, and the rest were but his Council, this we deny also, and he must prove it. It is enough, that we prove that others with the Bishop, Moderator, or <hi>Praeses,</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Affairs of the Church: for which the Arguments above brought may be thought sufficient. What followeth in several pages, is to prove, that the Jews and Grecians did sometimes Dichotomize their Clergy; yet at other times they mentioned the Distinctions of the High Priest from other Priests: so of the Bishops from the Presbyters. This would indeed weaken our Argument, if it had no more force than he giveth it; If we had argued simply from the Church Officers being sometimes divided into Bishops and Deacons, without distinguishing Bishops, or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62347:29"/>
Presbyters among themselves. But our Argument being taken not only from this indistinction of Presbyters in some, but in all places where they are mentioned; and also from the Scripture not distinguishing them by their Offices, Work, Qualifications, or the Injunctions that are given them about their Work: these Distinctions of Presbyters that some of the Ancients use, make nothing against our Argument: unless he can prove that when they mean Bishops as distinct from Presbyters, they ascribe also a superior power to them, which he often asserteth, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proveth. We confess that after the Apostles age, the name <hi>Bishop</hi> began soon to be appropriated to the <hi>Praeses</hi> in the Presbyterie; but in the three first Centuries the Bishop did not rule alone, nor had superior power to the rest. I have lately defended against another of our Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Brethren: and shall also endeavour it against the Assaults of this Author, when he shall please to attempt this proof. Mean while <hi>I</hi> am not concerned further to Answer what he insisteth on to <hi>p.</hi> 39. (where he engageth with another of our Arguments) than to examine some few Hints that seem to be intended as argumentative, wherewith his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is interspersed.</p>
               <p>§ 10. He telleth us <hi>p.</hi> 31. that <hi>Cyprian asserts the Jurisdiction and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the Episcopal power, upon all occasions, with great Courage and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> What my last Antagonist brought for this end, out of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that holy Martyr, I have endeavoured to Answer: with what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, it is not mine to judge; if this Author will either re-inforce the same Citations, or bring new ones, I shall not decline the Debate with him. That <hi>Polycarp:</hi> (as he hath it, <hi>p. 32.) distinguisheth himself from the subordinate Presbyters, while he inscribeth his Epistle, Polycarp, and the Presbyters that are with him. Who</hi> (saith our Author) <hi>if he had stood on a Level with these Presbyters, would never have distinguished himself from the Community of his Brethren.</hi> This reasoning (I say) is so remote from Concludencie, that our Author hath not consulted his own Credite in using it. For first, whatever prioritie of Dignity may be hence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as <hi>Polycarp</hi> being an older man than the rest, or <hi>Praeses</hi> in the Meeting; it is ridiculous to infer from this, either Superiority, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of power. 2. <hi>Polycarp</hi> might be the Author of the Epistle, and the rest Assenters to it; that might give occasion to his being named. 3. Will any say, that when a Letter is thus directed to a Presbyterie, for <hi>N. Moderator, and the rest of the Brethren of the Presbyterie of E,</hi> that this inferreth Episcopal Jurisdiction in the person of him who is so named?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62347:30"/>
Such stuff is not worth refuteing. P. 33. He telleth us that <hi>Hermas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth some who strove for the first Dignity and Preferment: and if then was no such Precedency there in the Church, there was no ground for his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. Apage nugas.</hi> Have not some striven for unlawful Preferments, as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did for a Dominion in the Church, like that of the Lords among the Gentiles? Yea, we deny not all preferment in the Church: may not some ambitiously strive to be a Minister, or an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yea, or a Deacon? All which are Preferments, if compared with the people: and may not a Presbyterian Minister strive to be Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, without designing Episcopal Jurisdiction. That <hi>Blondel, Salmasius, and Dally, laboured to support this Argument,</hi> as our Author represents it, is falsly asserted, <hi>p.</hi> 35. As is also, that <hi>this Opinion</hi> (about Parity) <hi>was never heard of before the days of Aerius.</hi> If he would attempt to prove all that he confidently asserteth, his Book would swell to a great Bulke Sir <hi>Thomas Craig</hi> (whose Memory is venerable in the learned World) must here also be lashed, <hi>as ignorant of Divinity, and of the Fathers,</hi> because he was prebyterianly inclined I find nothing more that is observable, or that can derogate from the strength of our Argument, as stated by us, in this his Discourse: only his unmannerly, as well as false, Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>p.</hi> 38. that <hi>the Ecclesiastical Levellers</hi> (so in reproach and contempt he calleth the Presbyterians) <hi>flee to this Argument as their first and last Refuge; and yet nothing is more frivolous and trifling.</hi> He may see, if he will be at pains to read what he pretendeth to refute; that they have other, yea better Arguments: and will find it hard to give a solide An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Argument, represented in its full Strength.</p>

               <p>HE mentioneth these <hi>p.</hi> 9. as our third Argument for Parity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he had thought fit to read what hath been written on our side; he might have found thrice as many more, and of more strength than any thing that he maketh us to say. But this, and the two Arguments above debated with him, are all that he will allow us to have on our side. His Introduction to this piece of his Work smells rank of such a temper of mind as I am not willing to name; while he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62347:30"/>
them who possessed the Government, and Revenues of the Church, <hi>Atheists and Enthusiasts;</hi> and that without exception or Limitation. Thus are all the Presbyterian and Congregational Ministers of <hi>England</hi> (as well as others) charactered by him. We will not retaliate; but the learned and religious world had, and have another Esteem of not a few who then were in the Ministry; and judge that Atheism, and other sinful Evils, have been diffused into the Church after that time; though we deny not that then it was too manifest among some. He saith that <hi>Blondel employed all his Skill to make the Antients contradict themselves, and all contemporary Records.</hi> This I pass as a piece of his usual and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Confidence. He saith, <hi>when Blondel's Book appeared, the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans concluded (before ever they read it) that it was all pure and undenyable Demonstration.</hi> And that <hi>his Countreymen</hi> (the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians) <hi>think they need no other Answer to what is written against them, but to say that Episcopacy, and all that can be found for it, is quite ruined by Blondel, and Salmasius:</hi> and yet <hi>that few of them read them.</hi> It is not manly so to despise an Adversary whom one undertaketh to refute; neither is it Wisdom to spend so many hours, as he hath done, to argue the Case with them who are so despicable: nor is it Christian so to undervalue others whose Praises are in the Gospel; which I am sure may be said of some eminent Presbyterian Writers; who now having served their Generation, enjoy their Reward: but it is his way thus to supply what is wanting in the strength of his Arguments. I wonder who told him that the Presbyterians did so extoll <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Book <hi>before they read it;</hi> or that few of them have read him, and <hi>Salmasius.</hi> Who of us ever said, that saying <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Salmasius</hi> had ruined Episcopacy, was a sufficient Refutation of it? May not we, without such blame, commend the Works of these learned Men, as well as he <hi>p.</hi> 40. telleth us that <hi>every Line of them is sufficiently exposed, and frequently;</hi> and for this cryeth up the <hi>Bishop of Chester.</hi> He saith, <hi>we shut our eyes against the clearest Evidences: that we think that</hi> Blondel'<hi>s Book may barre all Disputation on that Head:</hi> that <hi>we refuse to enter into closs Engagement with them.</hi> These are a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Words in which there is no Truth: and if we should Retort eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Syllable of them on himself (I say not on his whole Party, among whom, I know, there are learned Men, who would be ashamed of this manner of pleading their Cause) how should this Contest be decided? Some who have spent more of their Years in Reading, than this Author hath done; and also have given better proof of it; have not so insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62347:31"/>
over their Adversaries, as men of no Reading. There is also little ground given for his insisting on this, as one of our main Arguments; for tho the Presbyterians will not part with the Suffrage of the Fathers, while the Controversie is about paritie of Church power, and the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of one Presbyter over the rest; yet they use oftner to act the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive part, with respect to Antiquity, that is latter than the Canon of the Scripture: and which is of more weight, they never laid the stress of their Cause on Humane Testimony; but build their Opinion on the Sacred Writings. But seing he is pleased to lead us in this way, we are willing to engage with him (as <hi>closly</hi> as he will) on this Head: and to debate both on whose side the Fathers are, his or ours; and whether their Testimony be so convincing as he pretendeth it to be.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Although I do much dislike my Antagonists rude Treatment of so great a man as <hi>Blondel</hi> was, saying that <hi>he studyed to please the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, rather than the Presbeterians, because they were then more potent and numerous;</hi> (so <hi>p.</hi> 42.) and calling his Arguments <hi>childish Reasonings: p.</hi> 43. Yet I do not undertake to make it appear, that every Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he bringeth from the Fathers is fully concludent, by it self. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve also, that this Author, though he professeth to answer the Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons brought by <hi>Blondel,</hi> yet medleth but with a few of them, and these none of the most evident; except what <hi>Blondel</hi> bringeth out of <hi>Jerom:</hi> The first Testimony that he mentioneth is, the Inscription of <hi>Clements</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> written from <hi>Rome;</hi> which is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That is, <hi>the Church of God dwelling in</hi> Rome, <hi>to the Church of God dwelling in</hi> Corinth. <hi>Blondel</hi> hence concludeth, that there was no Bishop in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, seing no notice is taken of him. To this our Authors answer is, <hi>this would make for Independency, and that the Laity</hi> (as he speaketh) <hi>had an equal share in Jurisdiction with the Bishops and Presbyters.</hi> And that <hi>this would prove the equality of</hi> Softhenes, Timothy, <hi>and</hi> Sylvanus, <hi>with</hi> Paul; <hi>because he sometimes joineth them with himself in the Inscription of some of his Epistles.</hi> And that <hi>it was the Humility of</hi> Clement <hi>that made him so write.</hi> Answer 1. He mistaketh the Opinion of <hi>Independents:</hi> they have their Church Rulers, and do not put the Exercise of the Government in the hand of the Multitude: though, I confess, many of them give the people somewhat more than their due. 2. If this was an Epistle of a whole Church to a whole Church (as <hi>Blondel</hi> taketh it) there was no need of mentioning either Bishop, or Presbyters; and so equality of Jurisdiction of the people with them, cannot be hence inferred: but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62347:31"/>
if it was an Epistle of a Bishop to a Church, where another Bishop go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, as this Author will have it: It is an unusual Stile not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Bishop, at least of that Church to which the Epistle was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the Humility of <hi>Clement</hi> might make him not to distinguish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the people; but our Bishops would count it no Humility, but Rudeness, so to treat his brother Bishop at <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> nameth some of the Pastors of the Church with himself, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of some of his Epistles, as his fellow Pastors, who had joint, though not equal, Authority in the Church with him: but he never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth a whole Church into that Society with himself. By the Church, in both places, it may be rationally thought, <hi>Clement</hi> meant the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ruling Church, or the Church representative; and in that case it might have been expected, if he were for Episcopacy, that the Bishop, at least in <hi>Corinth,</hi> should have had some peculiar mark of Honour: as when a Presbytery among us, is addressed, the Stile is, <hi>to the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the rest of the Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. though no special Jurisdiction be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to the Moderator. But after all, I look on <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on this Passage, as rather an Introduction to what he had further to say from this Epistle, and a cumulative Argument, than to be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent by it self.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Another Passage out of the same Epistle of <hi>Clement,</hi> brought by <hi>Blondel,</hi> our Author taketh a great deal of pains about, from <hi>p</hi> 43. It so entangles him, that he cannot, with much strugling, get out of the Net. The words of <hi>Clement,</hi> cited by <hi>Blondel,</hi> are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is, <hi>wherefore they</hi> (the Apostles) <hi>preaching through Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Cities, placed their first fruits, whom by the Spirit they had tryed, to be Bishops and Deacons for them who should believe: neither was it a new thing; for of old it had been written of Bishops and Deacons, I will make their Bishops in Righteousness, and their Deacons in Faithfulness.</hi> From this Passage <hi>Blondel</hi> observeth first, that in <hi>Clement</hi>'s time there was Bishops in the Countrie, and in Villages, as well as in Cities. 2. That the City Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had no Authority over the <hi>chorepiscopos</hi> or Countrie Bishops. 3. That there were but two sorts of Church Officers, Bishops and Deacons; besides some other things which are not so much to our present design. Our Author, in his Answer, overlooketh the two former, which tend most to ruine his Cause (for the Bishops of that time could not be <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesans,</hi> but Pastors of Congregations, if these two Observations hold, as they plainly follow from <hi>Clement</hi>'s words) and he insisteth only on the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62347:32"/>
third, the <hi>Dichotomie</hi> of the Clergy: which hath less probative for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> than the rest: yet it hath more strength in it, than his Answers are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enervate: which I now shall make appear. His Answer is, that <hi>he hath already answered our Argument taken from the</hi> Dichotomie <hi>of the Clergie.</hi> Reply. Though we do not make that an Argument by it self, in all cases where it is found; yet in some cases (and this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) it is concludent. <hi>Clement</hi> is here giving account what Officers the Apostles settled in the Churches: and if they settled Bishops distinct from Presbyters, and Deacons, this account is very lame, and useless. His second Answer is <hi>p.</hi> 44, &amp;c. <hi>Clement, by Deacons, here understandeth all Ministers of Religion; whether Presbyters in the Modernnotion, or Deacons, who, by the first Institution, were obliged to attend upon Tables? And so by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Deacons, we may</hi> (saith our Author) <hi>understand Apostles, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Presbyters, and Attendents upon Tables.</hi> And then, at great length, he proveth that which no body denyeth, that <hi>the word Deacon, is used i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a great Latitude, for all sorts of Church Officers. Reply.</hi> The Question is not how the word Deacon may be used in some cases, &amp; on some occasions, but what <hi>Clement</hi> here understandeth by it: I affirm, that it is absurd to understand it here in that Latitude that our Author fancieth. For first, his meaning should be, the Apostles appointed in the Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that they settled, Apostles, Bishops, Presbyters, and Attendents on Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: so that every Church in every Village, must have its Apostle, and Bishop too; beside inferior Officers. 2. If <hi>Clement</hi> had so meant, it was superfluous to mention Bishops and Deacons too: it had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to tell the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the Apostles settled Deacons; that is, Officers in Churches; seing all sorts are signified by Deacons. 3: To say that Presbyters are to be understood by Deacons, rather than by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, is without all imaginable ground: the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is as largely used in Scripture, as that of <hi>Deacon:</hi> if we thus, at pleasure, expound Names, or rather Words, we may maintain what we will. 4. This <hi>Dichotomy</hi> being used on such a design, as to inform the people what were the ordinary Officers in the Church, by Apostolick Warrand, that they were to have regard to; it would not answer its end, if there were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops whom they and the Presbyters must obey: for either they were to understand that the Presbyters were comprehended under the word <hi>Bishops;</hi> but then they had no Instruction about the Ruling Bishop, and the Teaching Bishop, as distinct, and how they should regard each of them: or under the word <hi>Deacon;</hi> and then they were at as great a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62347:32"/>
loss, what sort of Deacons he meant; whether the Rulers or Servants of the Church. 5. Though the word <hi>Deacon,</hi> be often applyed to any who serve God in publick Office in his Church, (yea, or in the State) yet that ever the Rulers, or Teachers of the Church are signified by it, when it is used distinctively from some other sort of Church Officers (as it is here) is more than I know.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Another Answer he bringeth to this Passage of <hi>Clement, p</hi> 46. that <hi>Clement speaketh not of Ecclesiastical Policy, as it was at last perfected by the Apostles; but of the first beginnings of the Christian Church, immediatly after the Resurrection of Christ. Reply.</hi> If it be granted, that at first the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posties settled Churches to be ruled by Presbyters, and served by Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, as this Answer seemeth to yield; they must let us know the Grounds on which they believe that the Apostles did alter this Policy, and set Bishops over the Churches that they had once thus settled: we find no Warrand in Scripture for this Conceit; though I know that some of our Prelatick Brethren affirm, that the Churches were govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Presbyters, under the Inspection of the Apostles while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but after their Death, Bishops were appointed to rule over them. We may rationally expect that they should give us good assurance for this Change; which yet I have not seen: if they will bring Arguments for it, we shall consider them. A 4th Answer he bringeth <hi>p.</hi> 47. that <hi>Clement</hi>'s <hi>words cannot bear such Parity as Presbyterians plead for; because he doth also Dichotomise the Jewish clergy: among whom were the High Priest, Chief Priests, Priests, and Levites. Reply.</hi> If <hi>Clement,</hi> when he so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Jewish Clergy, were on purpose instructing us how, and by whom the Affairs of the Jewish Church were managed, this Answer were pertinent: but if this Distinction be used occasionly, without this design, it is not at all to the purpose: in the one case Distinction is required; in the other case, it is enough to express the thing in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and undistinguished terms. He bringeth yet a 5th Answer, <hi>p</hi> 47, 48. That <hi>Clement exhorting the Corinthians to Order and Harmony, setteth before them the beautiful Subordinations under the Temple Service; and immediatly recommends to them, that every one should continue</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in his own order. Reply.</hi> If this Reasoning be at all significant, it will conclude, there must be a Pope, as well as Bishops, in the Christian Church: as there was a High Priest over all the Priests, and other Jews. We must then understand <hi>Clement,</hi> that there must be Order in the Christian Church, as well as in the Jewish Church; and every one must keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62347:33"/>
the Station that God hath set him in: but it noways hence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there must be the same Degrees of Church Officers in the one that was in the other. What he citeth out of <hi>Jerome, Ep. ad Ewagr.</hi> admitteth of the same Exposition; and is plain to be the whole that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> intendeth by these words, <hi>quod</hi> Aaron <hi>&amp; filii ejus atque Levitae in Templo fuerunt, hoc sibi Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri vendicent in Ecclesia:</hi> viz. That, as in the Temple, there was a Subordination of the Levites to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, so should the Deacon be to the Presbyter, whom <hi>Jerome,</hi> through that whole Epistle, proveth, to be the same with the Bishop. But it is like we may afterward hear more of this from our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. A 6th Answer is <hi>p.</hi> 48, 49.

Reply.</hi> He no otherways distinguisheth them, than as the one word signifieth Office, or ruling Power; the other, the Age of them who use to be put into that Office: and though Presbyter is often used to signifie the Office; yet not when it is joined with, and distinguished from <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§ 5. It is unaccountable Tergiversation, that this Author, pretending to examine some of the most remarkable Testimonies brought from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity by <hi>Blondel,</hi> insisteth only on that which is of least weight; even in the Testimony already mentioned, as is above shewed: and likeways passeth over all the rest brought out of the same Fathers Writings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so much as mentioning them. <hi>Blondel</hi> sheweth out of the Epistle of <hi>Clement</hi> already mentioned, that <hi>Clement</hi> telleth us, that <hi>the Apostles knowing</hi> per Dominum, <hi>by Divine Revelation, that there would be Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the Name of Bishop; therefore they appointed Presbyters and Deacons to manage the Affairs of the Church: so far were they</hi> (saith <hi>Blondel) from thinking Prelacy the best, or only Remedie against Schism; as some did in after ages.</hi> He doth also shew, how <hi>Clement</hi> teacheth, that <hi>the Presbyters</hi> (or Bishops, for he often interchangeth these two Names as signifieing the same persons) <hi>were set in the Church by the Apostles, and after by other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men</hi> (so that the Apostles made no Change in the Government) <hi>that they were placed with the consent of the whole Church</hi> (not by the Bishop
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62347:33"/>
and Patron) and he pleadeth that <hi>such as had well done the work of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop should not be turned out, for the holy Presbyters who have finished their Course, need fear no Change.</hi> And after sheweth, how absurd it was that <hi>the most ancient Church of Corinth</hi> (it had then stood, as it is thought, about 25 years) <hi>should move Sedition against her Presbyters:</hi> some turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits among them withstood, not a single Bishop (of whom not a word in all this Discourse) but the Presbyters of the Church: and he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Seditious rather to depart, that the Flock of Christ might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Peace, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§ 6. He next taketh to Task what <hi>Blondel</hi> citeth out of <hi>Polycarp;</hi> which is, that writing to the Church of <hi>Philippi, he taketh no notice of their Bishop:</hi> that he biddeth them <hi>be subject to the Presbyters and Deacons, not mentioning the Bishop, but a plurality of Presbyters which was in that one Church.</hi> His Answer to all this is, first, that <hi>Blondel himself taketh notice that Polycarp distinguisheth himself from the rest of the Presbyters, while he saith,</hi> Polycarp <hi>and the Presbyters that are with him to the Church in Philippi:</hi> and that <hi>by this he assumes a kind of Prelation above the rest of the Presbyters at Smyrna.</hi> He fancieth that this is mighty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie to <hi>Blondel:</hi> but it had been more ingenious to tell us that <hi>Blondel</hi> brings this as an Objection against himself, and answereth it fully and easily, calling it <hi>nuda Conjectura,</hi> and giving several Reasons for <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi>'s naming himself, from <hi>his being the older man, and the older Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:</hi> And <hi>being ordained by an Apostle</hi> (which was a Dignity, though it gave no Superiority of Power) <hi>as being better known to the Philippians:</hi> and <hi>Blondel</hi> bringeth abundance of parallel Passages, where no Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Power can be imported. All this our Author passeth over in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Next he saith, <hi>this is still the Bipartite division of the Clergie,</hi> which is a mistake; for here is Subjection required to Presbyters in Commune; which could not all be <hi>Diocesans:</hi> and their Head, the Bishop, is not noticed: and his <hi>Dichotomie</hi> here is Argumentative; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as was above shewed of <hi>Clement)</hi> he is telling them what Church Officers they should respect: where the Bishop was chiefly to be mentioned, if such a person had been in that Church. He will prove,

Neither hath it any force, that single Successon are mentioned; for if there were more Flocks and Pastors in <hi>Smyrna</hi> there was one Moderator in the Presbyterie; who is mentioned as more eminent, though having but equal power.

                  <hi>Clement</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had Authority over all the Churches, and by that power might write Circular Letters to them. 2. Circular Letters may be written containing Advice or Information, where there is no Authority: and this was very proper for <hi>Clement,</hi> who resided in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City, which had Correspondence with all places in the Empire. The 2d <hi>palpable Evidence</hi> is, that <hi>Hermas reproveth some who were ambitious to exalt themselves, &amp; primam Cathedram habere:</hi> whence he wisely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth; <hi>If there be no Power, there can be no abuse of it.</hi> To which I answer, I wish there were no Ambition but among the Prelatists. May not one who is a Presbyterian in his Profession, strive to set up Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, that he may be a Bishop? Was there Episcopacy in the Church of <hi>Scotland anno</hi> 1660, and 61, when ambitious Men laboured, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to make <hi>a prima Cathedra,</hi> that themselves might possess it? And might there not be such in the days of <hi>Hermas;</hi> as there appeared to be afterward, and as was in the Apostles times, when <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 2. There is a <hi>prima Cathedra</hi> even among the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians; the Moderator's Chair, and there may be Ambition in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after even that pettie Preferment. The <hi>Principatus</hi> that he after mentioneth, may have the same signification: it doth not always signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Authority; but often a Superior Dignity. The next thing I observe is, he neglecteth (as is customary with him) that which seemeth to have the most strength, among the Passages cited by <hi>Blondel</hi> out of <hi>Hermas;</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§ 8. The Testimony of <hi>Pius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is next brought by <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> out of his Epistlle to <hi>Justus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienne:</hi> where he telleth him, <hi>Presbyteri &amp; Diaconi non ut majorem; sed ut Ministrum Christi te observent.</hi> My Antagonist taketh this only for an Exhortation to Humility. I know not whether his Superiors will think it inconsistent with Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be obeyed by their Presbyters; or if any of them will be so hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62347:35"/>
as to disown all Majority with respect to the Presbyters: that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is here insinuated, we grant; but that no more is required, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said without doing Violence to the words I shall not contend whether this Epistle of <hi>Pius</hi> be legitime; or spurious; but I suppose it may be safely asserted, that if it was written by a Presbyterian, that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is much older than this Author will allow. Another Argument <hi>Blondel</hi> bringeth from <hi>Marcion,</hi> being <hi>rejected by the Presbyters at</hi> Rome; <hi>and not admitted to their Communion:</hi> whence he inferreth, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was then governed by Presbyters in common. Our Authors answer is <hi>first, they denyed to receive</hi> Marcion; <hi>which is a better Precedent to regulate our Opinions and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ractices by, than the Petition of a lewd and profligate Heretick.</hi> Reply. If they had denyed on account of their want of Power without their Bishop, (for the <hi>See</hi> was then vacant) this Answer should have some sense: but they pretended no such thing; neither did they reprove him for his Address: if he had addressed to a single Presbyter to be received, he would surely told him that it was not in his power to Determine in that Matter: but when he addressed to a Colledge of Presbyters, they gave another Reason for their refusal; of which anone He bringeth a second Answer, with his wonted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: as if we were all <hi>out of our Wits</hi> who say not as he saith in this Matter: and indeed it hath need of this to strengthen it; for it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak of it self: it is, that <hi>in the vacancy of the</hi> See, <hi>the Colledge of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters might manage the ordinary Policy and Discipline of the Church; though they never medled with such special Acts of Jurisdiction as were always reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by constant Practice, and primitive Institution, to the Episcopal Order: though they might have received</hi> Marcion <hi>upon Repentance, in the vacancy of the</hi> See, <hi>I hope no man will thence conclude that they would have enterprised any thing of this nature and consequence, if their Bishop were alive, or if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were chosen in his room.</hi> Reply. 1. Here the Question is manifestly begg'd: that there were reserved Acts peculiar to the Bishop, <hi>by constant Practice, and primitive Institution:</hi> the Practice is what we are debating: and such Institution we desire to be instructed in: we find it not in the Bible; which can be the only ground of that Divine Right we are now contending about. 2. As the Question is begg'd on the one hand,; so he yieldeth it on the other, by owning Governing Authority in the Presbyters without a Bishop: if they have power, they have it from Christ, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath not given all Ruling Power to the Bishop, and made the Presbyters only his Council. Or let him shew us by what Rule
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62347:35"/>
of the Gospel, Authority which they had not before, devolveth on the Presbyters when the Bishop dieth. This Government by Presbyters without a Bishop is not Episcopal Government, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not contrary to Divine Institution (by this Answer) if the Church be governed without Bishops, which is inconsistent with the Divine Right of that Government. 3. I know not what Act of Jurisdiction is higher than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or excluding, and casting out Church Members: wherefore if Presbyters have this, we must see some special Warrand from Scripture, before we can deny them another part of Church power. 4 That they would not have acted so without their Bishop, if he had been alive, is said without ground: if he had been absent they might have done it: as I have else where shewed that the Presbyters at <hi>Carthage</hi> did in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s retirement. If he could be with them it was irregular to act without him, as being their <hi>Praeses;</hi> though having no majority of power. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pass from this Argument, I observe a greater strength in it, than <hi>Blondel</hi> hath mentioned, or my Antagonist hath attempted to answer: for clearing which, we must reflect on the History from which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is drawn: which is <hi>Marcion,</hi> the Son of a Bishop in <hi>Pontus,</hi> for a lewd Act that he had committed <hi>(ob illatum per summum nefas Virgini stuprum)</hi> was driven away from the Communion of the Church, by his own Father; on which occasion he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and attempted to be received into that Church: he was rejected by the Presbyterie; after which he preached his Errours in that City, and made great Disturbance. Now the Argument that we draw from this Passage is, not only that the Presbyterie did not reject his Petition as being incompetent Judges in that Case; but their Answer implyeth a Recognition of their power in this Matter: for they tell him, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>we cannot do it without the permission of thy worthy Father</hi> (nor this because of his Fathers Episcopal power, but) <hi>because there is one Faith, and one Agreement; the Bond of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> between <hi>Rome</hi> and that Church in <hi>Pontus</hi> (I think its Name was <hi>Sinope)</hi> and was that which they gave as the reason of their Refusal: seing he was cast out of one Church, it was not reasonable that he should be received into another without her consent. <hi>Romes</hi> Headship was not then known. But what followeth is yet stronger for our Cause; <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: <hi>we cannot go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our excellent Collegue</hi> (or Fellow Labourer) <hi>thy Father:</hi> where Presbyters look on a Bishop as their Collegue, and in no higher Degree; and that when they are speaking of the Exercise of Church Authority:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62347:36"/>
they plainly suppose, that they had the same power to take in, that he had to cast out: but they would not irregularly exerce that power, as they must have done if they had recived <hi>Marcion.</hi>

               <p>§ 9. Another of <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Citations, our Author answereth with a great deal of slighting and contempt; its taken out of <hi>Justine Martyr</hi>'s Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for the Christians; where he giveth an account of the Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that was among the Christians; and mentioneth no Officer in the Church but <hi>Praepositus &amp; Diaconus.</hi> His Answer to this is, <hi>Justine</hi>'s <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was only to vindicate the Christians from the Reproaches cast upon them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Meetings; he had no occasion to speak of the Hierarchy: the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans concealed their Mysteries as much as they could: and the Names of</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Presbyter <hi>as well as their Offices, were known to the Heathen.</hi> How to make the parts of this Answer hang together, I know not: if the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then knew their way, why did they conceal it? Neither is there any ground to think that they concealed their Mysteries, the Knowledge of which was the mean of convincing Heathens. Yea, the design of his Apology was to make their Mysteries known, that it might be seen how excellent they were. And to say that <hi>Justine</hi> had no occasion to speak of the Hierarchy here, is a mistake; for he did mention some of the Church Officers, and because he mentioned no more, it is like he knew no more He seems now to be weary of his undertaking (and no wonder, it hath succeeded so ill with him) and therefore <hi>p.</hi> 60. he telleth us <hi>how nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous it is to repeat more:</hi> and hudleth up some other Citations cited by <hi>Blondel</hi> in a general Answer; that <hi>it is a silly Quible to found an Argumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> on</hi> Dichotomies: and telleth us, <hi>the Names, as well as the Offices, were distinguished in the earliest Monuments of the Church,</hi> and for this he citeth <hi>Usher,</hi> mentioning <hi>Acta Martyrii</hi> S: <hi>Ignatii:</hi> but is not pleased to name Book, nor Page, of that learned Author; who hath written many things. The same he doth with <hi>Clemeus, Alexandrinus, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Origen;</hi> but neither words nor place he mentioneth: such arguings are to be neglected. <hi>Blondel</hi> also citeth <hi>Papias,</hi> calling all the Ministers of the Word, <hi>Apostles,</hi> and others from whom he had learned what he wrote, <hi>Elders or Presbyters.</hi> This Author will have it to be meant of their Age, not Office. I lay not much weight on this Testimony, more than he doth. But that <hi>Papias</hi> doth not mean the Age only of them whom he mentioneth, may be gathered from what he saith of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>John,</hi> whom he mentioneth (for after he had named <hi>John</hi> among the Apostles, he nameth another, <hi>John</hi> after <hi>Aristion)</hi> and him he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

                  </gap>. This cannot be meant of his Age, when he saith <hi>John the elder;</hi> for <hi>John</hi> the Apostle was older than he. It must then be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of his Office. And <hi>Euseb: lib: 3: c.</hi> 35. telleth us that there were two <hi>Johns</hi> buried at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and that the Monuments of both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his time. Being now weary with arguing, and it seems fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with what he could not well answer. He falleth to downright Railling, <hi>p.</hi> 61. he putteth on a Confidence beyond ordinary: this is the way of some when they are most at a loss. This Conduct will not take with wise and considering Men. He telleth of the <hi>unconquerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Prejudice</hi> (in the Presbyterians no doubt; because they will not yield to his Dictats, and what he looketh on as an Argument) and of their <hi>miserable Condition in reading the Ancients, with no other design than to distort their words.</hi> Before he taxeth us for not reading them, now we read them, but with an ill design. I must tell him, it is too much for him, either to judge how we are employed in our Closets, and what Books we read, or what inward designs we have in our reading. We think he distorteth the words of the Ancients (we judge not his designs in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them) he thinketh we distort them, let the Reader judge. Next he representeth us as having <hi>sold our selves to the Interest of little Parties; and shut our Eyes against the express Testimonies of these Fathers, whose broken Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences we torture and abuse, to support Novelties,</hi> and more of this Stuff; which it is not fit to answer, because of the Wise Man's Advice, <hi>Prov:</hi> 26: 4.</p>
               <p>§ 10. Now he will <hi>p.</hi> 62. have the Reader to make an Estimate of the <hi>Presbyterian Candor</hi> from two Instances. The first is, <hi>Blondel</hi> citeth the <hi>Gallican Church</hi> sending <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and calling him a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he was Bishop of <hi>Lyons.</hi> Our Author contendeth that he was not then Bishop; and that <hi>Photinus</hi> his Predecessor, was not then dead. This piece of Chronology, though maintained by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and <hi>Jerome, Blondel</hi> disproveth, by many Authentick Records, as he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And now where is the want of Candor in this case? Is every man who after diligent search into History, doth mistake in Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, about a Matter of Fact so disingenious; and that to such a Degree as this Author's Clamour would represent. This I say, supposing that <hi>Blondel</hi> doth mistake in this Matter. I think it not worth the while to examine the large Discourse he hath, and the manifold Citations to confirm his Opinion, finding that Debate somewhat Intricate (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Photinus</hi> was then alive or not, when <hi>Iraeneus</hi> was sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62347:37"/>
called a Presbyter) and the Matter of it is of no great Consequence. It seems our Author hath been at as little pains as I am at leasure now to take, about this Debate, but referreth you to Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> for satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet he hath the confidence to charge so great a man as <hi>Blondel</hi> was, with <hi>perplexed Conjectures,</hi> and <hi>affected Mistakes:</hi> we think it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian, nor Manly, nor Scholar like, so to treat the learned Men of his opposite Party. The other Instance, whereby he thinketh to prove <hi>want of Candor;</hi> yea <hi>Impudence,</hi> in the Presbyterians, is <hi>p.</hi> 63. that <hi>we sometimes cite</hi> Cyprian <hi>on our side; and can name nothing plausibly, but that wretched Quible of the bipartite Division of the Clergy.</hi> He thinks it <hi>needless to bring Testimonies against us out of</hi> Cyprian, <hi>there are so many:</hi> he calleth us also <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and supposeth <hi>that we have not read</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. Who can stand before such potent Ratiocinations? He referreth <hi>the Vindicator of the Kirk</hi> to a Book then expected. I suppose he meaneth <hi>I. S. his Principles of the Cyprianick age;</hi> which I saw long before I saw this Book of his: where indeed all that can be drawn from <hi>Cyprian</hi> (and much more) is carefully gathered together. And I refer him for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction about <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Opinion in the point of Church Government, to the Answer to that Book under the Title of the <hi>Cyprianick Bishop exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</hi> In which Book I shall take this occasion to confess a Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Mistake, (this Author would have the Charity to call it the want of Candor, or what else he pleaseth to impute to his Adversary) it is <hi>p.</hi> 20, near the end, <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Optatus,</hi> are said to live in the same Age with <hi>Cyprian;</hi> whereas they lived in the next Century: this was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by an over hasty Glance into the Chronological Tables: I hope the Reader will pardon this Digression. Thus my Antagonist leaveth <hi>Blondel</hi> in quiet possession of the far greatest part, and most evident Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, that he bringeth out of the Fathers for Parity: some will think he had better not begun this Work, than thus leave it imperfect; if others have answered all <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Citations, what he hath done was needless, if not, he doth his Work but by halves.</p>
               <p>§ 11. I shall add some other Testimonies out of the Fathers; which our Author, at his leisure, may consider <hi>Chrysost: on 1 Tim.</hi> 3. asketh the Question, <hi>why the Apostle passeth from giving Directions in, and about, the Qualifications of Bishops, immediatly to Deacons, omitting Presbyters:</hi> and giveth this Answer, that <hi>there is almost no difference between a Bishop and a Presbyter: and the care of the Church is committed also to Presbyters,</hi> (which maketh it evident that <hi>Chrysost:</hi> did not think that Bishops ruled alone)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62347:37"/>
only he maketh the difference to be in <hi>Ordination;</hi> which he is so far from looking on as of Divine Institution, that he maintaineth, saith <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that, <hi>in the Apostles time, Presbyters ordained Bishops.</hi> This same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor on <hi>Tit. 1. Homil.</hi> 2. by the Elders whom <hi>Titus</hi> was to <hi>ordain in every City,</hi> understandeth Bishops; <hi>because</hi> (saith he) <hi>he would not set one over the whole Island:</hi> and after; <hi>for a Teacher should not be diverted by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of many Churches; but should be taken up in ruling one:</hi> where he maketh the Teacher and Ruler to be the same person: also assigneth but the Government of one Church to one man: both which are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Diocesan Episcopacy. <hi>Ambros: in Tim:</hi> 3. 9. hath this Passage; <hi>qui tanta cura Diaconos eligendos praecepit, quos constat esse ministros Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; quales vult esse Episcopos, nisi, sicut ipse ait, irrepraehensibiles:</hi> where he plainly supposeth all the Church Officers, who are not Deacons, to be Bishops: and a little after, <hi>Post Episcopum tamen Diaconatus ordinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem subjecit, quare? nisi quia Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri una ordinatio est; uter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que enim Sacerdosest; Episcopus tamen primus est; ut omnis Episcopus Presbyter sit, non tamen omnis Presbyter Episcopus; hic enim est Episcopus, qui inter Presbyteros primus est: Denique Timotheum. Presbyterum ordinatum significat; sed quia ante se priorem non habebat, Episcopus erat.</hi> All this seemeth to be a Description of a Presbyterian Moderator: for he giveth the Bishop no Prelation but that of Precedency, or Priority, to a Presbyter: and that, not by a new Ordination, which should give him a superior power; but a Seniority, or Priority of Ordination, which was the way of a Moderator's being set up at first; but was after changed into Election; when it was found, that sometimes, the oldest man was not the fittest man for that Work. From all this, it is clear, that in the time of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros:</hi> (which was in the fourth Century) Majority of Power in a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop above a Presbyter, was not lookt on as <hi>Juris Divini;</hi> nor that a Bishop must have (after he is ordained a Presbyter) a new Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Consecration; whereby he getteth Jurisdiction over his fellow Presbyters, and their Flocks: I do not deny but that <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth, in some things, mistake the primitive Order of the Church: and misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Scripture account that is given of it, wherefore he ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously confesseth on <hi>Ephesians</hi> 4. 11. thus, <hi>ideo non per omnia conveniunt scripta Apostolica ordinationi quae nunc est in Ecclesia:</hi> yet he giveth ground to think, that even then, the Distinction between Bishop and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not arrived at a Majority of Power, or sole Jurisdiction. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve here also, <hi>obiter,</hi> that <hi>ordinatio,</hi> in the primitive times, did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

signifie authoritative setting apart one for a Church Office; which our Author else where doth with much zeal plead. If the Reader please to add to these, all the Testimonies cited by <hi>Blondel</hi> (which out Author thought not fit to medle with) he may see abundant cause to think, that our Opinion about Paritie is not so <hi>Novel,</hi> as this <hi>Enquirer</hi> fancieth it to be. Though I lay little weight on the Opinions of the School-men, in the controverted Points of Divinity; and especially, in the Point of Church Government: yet considering, that they owned the <hi>Roman Hierarchy,</hi> a Testimony from them, or other Papists, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be a Confession of an Adversary, extorted by the force of Truth, <hi>Lombard: lib: 4: Sententiar: dist:</hi> 4: after he had asserted seven Orders of the Clergy, when he cometh to speak of Presbyters, <hi>p: 451.

               <p>THis learned Author hath singled out the Testimonies brought by Presbyterians out of these two Fathers, and promiseth <hi>p.</hi> 65, to <hi>examine them more narrowly, as being the chief strength of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, that is to be found in the Writings of the Ancients.</hi> I shall adventure to examine his Examination. He taxeth <hi>Blondel</hi> for inscribing his Book, <hi>Apologia pro Sententia Hieronimi, as if the Presbyterians Doctrine had been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly espoused by Jerome;</hi> and bringeth this Argument against this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Blondel. At this rate</hi> (saith he) <hi>his Contemporaries were very much to be blamed who placed</hi> Aerius <hi>among the Hereticks, and yet on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions make honourable mention of</hi> Jerome, <hi>if he taught the same Doctrine for which</hi> Aerius <hi>was condemned for a Heretick.</hi> This reasoning is of no weight: for it is well known on how small grounds some in the fourth or fifth Centuries were listed among the Hereticks. 2. It is no rare thing in the World, to heighten the same Action, or Opinion in one person, which they excuse or extenuate in another: We know how the Pope
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62347:39"/>
condemneth the same Principles as Heresie in <hi>Calvine,</hi> which he passeth no such Censure on when they are taught by the <hi>Jansenists:</hi> and how <hi>Alvarez</hi> chargeth <hi>Calvine</hi> with Heresie, for the same things that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self holdeth: and is at much pains to shew the difference, where indeed there is none. <hi>Jerome</hi> was a man of great esteem, so as it seems <hi>Aerius</hi> was not. 3. It is thought by many, that <hi>Aerius</hi> managed his Principle more unpeaceably than <hi>Jerome</hi> did: that he opposed himself more fiercely to the growing Usurpations of that time; and made a Schism about the Matter. And it is evident that many of them who are by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> called Hereticks, were at most, but Schismaticks. Neither do I by this yield, that Presbyterians now may be called Schismaticks; for I know not that <hi>Aerius</hi> was justly so branded, on account of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     </gap>
                  </hi> But he thinketh <hi>Jerome</hi> mistook in this, and in that Period (which he taketh to be in the Apostles time, before Bishops were setled in the Churches) the Apostles governed the Churches which they had plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by their personal and Apostolical Authoritie <hi>I</hi> must examine this before <hi>I</hi> proceed It is not to be denyed, that when the Apostles, by their preaching, had converted a Company of people to Christianity while they were not formed into Societies, and had no Officers to teach and govern them, they managed the Affairs of these people, by their own Authority; and it could not be otherwise But here are three mistakes. 1. That the Apostles first setled Teaching Presbyters in these newly converted Churches, who might teach them, but not rule them; and afterward set Bishops over them to rule them: this is a groundless Fancie, nor can any shadow of Authoritie be given from Scripture for it: if he shall offer any thing as a proof of this, we shall consider it. We think that the Apostles setled Presbyters among the new converted So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, both for teaching them, and ruling them; and that the Apostles gave these Elders Direction, by the infallible Spirit, both what they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62347:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should teach, and how they should govern: the latter needeth no proof: the former we prove from <hi>Acts 14. 23. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. where we read of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Elders <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and the other Scriptures above cited <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. § 12, 14. by which it is made appear, that these Elders ruled the Church, as well as instructed her, as at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> and else where. Another mistake is, that the Apostles by themselves governed any particular Churches that were setled, and had Presbyters among them. The contrary is evident from what hath been proved of the Elders governing the Churches: and from this, that our Adversaries can produce no such Instance. <hi>Paul</hi> had indeed the care of all the Churches on him, whether they had Officers or none: but it doth not thence follow, that he ruled them all, or any of them, perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: his care was that they might be well taught and well ruled, by them who were appointed to that Work; over all whom he, and every one of the Apostles, had a <hi>Superintendency.</hi> A third mistake is, that the Apostles in their time, made a change of the Government that they had setled in the Church; by setting up Bishops, where formerly they had setled Teaching Presbyters, and had ruled the Churches themselves: and particularly that at <hi>Corinth</hi> upon the Divisions mentioned 1. <hi>Ep. Ch.</hi> 3. a Bishop was set up there, as this Author hinteth, <hi>p.</hi> 69. Can he, or any man else, give any thing that looketh like a Warrant for this Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Surely if such a Change had been made by the Apostles, we should have had some hint of it in their Writings, or in the History of their Acts.</p>
               <p>§ 5. This Author hath an other observe, in the same page, as wilde, and wide from the Truth: that <hi>Jerome</hi> thought that the <hi>Superintendency</hi> of Bishops above Presbyters, was occasioned by the Contentions at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth;</hi> so he thought that this Remedy of Schism, was appointed by the Apostles themselves; and that it was not the Invention of after Ages: but the Apostles by their own experiance immediatly found the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Paritie; and therefore appointed, that <hi>unus praeponeretur caeteris.</hi> This is strange Confidence, and little Evidence of that Candor which he so much desiderateth in <hi>Blondel,</hi> and other Presbyterians. Can he produce any Word, or Passage in <hi>Jerome,</hi> from which this may be inferred? Yes, he pretendeth to prove it: after he hath stated this as the present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, <hi>whether it was</hi> Jerome'<hi>s Opinion that the Apostles themselves set up Episcopacy as the Remedy of Schism; or that Parity continued sometime after the Apostles; and the Church in after Ages set up Prelacy, because Parity was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62347:42"/>
apt to breed Schism.</hi> The former he maintaineth, we hold the latter. That <hi>Blondel</hi> saw, that <hi>Jerome</hi> thought that the Apostles turned the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from Paritie to Prelacy, is a strange Assertion, when the great design of his Book was to prove the contrary. And the proof of it is yet stranger; <hi>Blondel entereth a Caveat, that none should think that the Apostles themselves appointed the Remedy of Schism mentioned by Jerome.</hi> Is it not a good Consequence? This is an absurd Thought, saith <hi>Blondel, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> I believe it was <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Opinion. <hi>Blondel</hi> maintaineth, and so do I that not only it is not true that the Apostles in their time appointed the Remedie; but that <hi>Jerome</hi> was not of that Opinion.</p>
               <p>§ 6. His first proof, that such was <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Opinion, is <hi>p.</hi> 7. Jerome <hi>thought that the occasion of the change that was introduced into the Ecclesiasti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62347:42"/>
is to prove, by Testimonies of the Apostles, that Bishop and Presbyter are one: how is this consistent with his thinking that the Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the contrary? this were to make the learned <hi>Jerome</hi> to speak, yea to think, the most palpable contradictions. 3. Is it imaginable, if <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> had thought that the Apostles first for a time setled Paritie, and then by degrees (or otherwise) changed it into Prelacy, that he would be at so much pains to tell us where the Apostles did the former, as in all the places he citeth: and yet not point to one place in all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, where this Decree for a Change should be found? He may believe what he will, who can be perswaded of this? If <hi>Jerome</hi> had thought that the Apostles then decreed Prelacy when the Debates arose at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth;</hi> and that it was done on occasion of these Debates, and as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of them, he had been very absurd, and pleased himself with a groundless Fancy: for when the Apostle was reproving these Schisms, and labouring to cure them, and prevent the like among Christians, he hath not one word of Prelacy as a remedie of them: but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, reproveth the Presbyters of that Church, for being defective in the exercise of their Church power, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. of that same Epistle; and <hi>cap:</hi> 12. 28. telleth them what Officers were to continue in the Gospel Church, and no mention of Bishops among them.</p>
               <p>§ 7. Another thing in this Answer is most absurd; that he calleth this Apostolical Decree, <hi>consuetudo Ecclesiae:</hi> a Decree and a Custome are two different things: nor was it ever heard of (till this new Master of words arose) that a Decree was so called: Custome may follow on a Decree; and the same thing may be decreed which hath antecedently obtained by a Custome; but to say a thing <hi>(ex: gra:</hi> the setting up of Bishops as the remedie of Schism) had its Original from Custome, and to mean it had its Rise from a Decree, is to speak <hi>non sense:</hi> which no wise man will impute to that learned Father. Wherefore it is evident that <hi>Jerome,</hi> by <hi>consuetudo Ecclesiae,</hi> meaneth the practice of the Church after the Apostles (for to say it was the practice in their time, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with what he confesseth to be <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Opinion, that the Church was then governed by Presbyters) which came in by degrees, <hi>paulatim.</hi> 3. It is an unaccountable Absurditie, to make an Apostolical Decree, or Practice, so opposite to <hi>dispositio Dominicae veritatis,</hi> as are Parity and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy. Were not the Apostles guided by the Spirit of Christ? Is it then imaginable, that He appointed Parity, or did not appoint Prelacy; and the Apostles finding Parity inconvenient, would appoint Prelacy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62347:43"/>
could <hi>Jerome</hi> mean, that Bishops were not appointed by any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given out personally by Christ while he was on earth; but by the Apostles after his Ascension: for that had been impertinent, and nothing to his purpose. For what different influence could that have on Bishops, to keep them from undue exalting themselves above the Presbyters (which is manifestly <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Scope in these words) whether they were instituted by a personal Command of Christ; or by his Apostles guided by his infallible Spirit; for the Sense would be, Bishops are not above Presbyters by Christ's appointment; but they are above them by the Apostles appointment: which either sets these two Appointments in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position the one to the other, or maketh the words to be ridiculous and absurd. 4. That the Apostles only <hi>had power to erect the Ecclesiastick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi> and that there was no other obliging Decree at that time, is true but it doth not hence follow, that <hi>Jerome</hi>'s <hi>toto orbe decretum est,</hi> is meant of such an Apostolick Decree. It is rather meant of a Resolution <hi>(decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est</hi> doth not always signifie an authoritative Sentence passed) through the several Churches, in most parts of the World (so <hi>toto orbe</hi> may we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be restricted) to set up a constant <hi>Praeses,</hi> whom they particularly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bishop. The Phrase <hi>toto orbe decretum est,</hi> cannot be understood of a Decree made in one place (as that of the Apostles must be) though for the whole World; but of what was done in the several places of the World.</p>
               <p>§ 8. That <hi>Jerome</hi> only alludeth to the Divisions at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and did not look on them as the immediate occasion of the Change that we made, I further prove. 1 The Schisms that <hi>Jerome</hi> speaketh of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> introducing the Change, were made by the Presbyters; who had bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the people, and every one set up a Faction with these whom he had baptized: his words are plain; <hi>postquam autem unusquisque quos bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizaverat suos putavit esse, non Christi, toto orbe decretum est, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Divisions at <hi>Corinth</hi> were among the people, not among the Pastors I hope he will not say that <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> fell out about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the people among them, as their Followers disagreed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jerome</hi> could not mean this Schism, though he allude to it 2. It is not to be imputed to the Apostles that they would setle one Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and so quickly change it into another, as they must have done, if the change were on occasion of the Schism at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which fell out soon after the setling of that Church; and while other Churches were not yet setled. They no doubt foresaw the Divisions that would be, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62347:43"/>
did, at the first setlement of Churches, provide what Remedie the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost thought fit for that Church disease. Especially, is it imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that after they had found how ill Paritie succeeded at <hi>Corinth,</hi> they would setle other Churches on that Lubrick Foundation, which must quickly be razed, and a new one laid. The Apostle wrote his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to <hi>Corinth,</hi> wherein he reproveth their Schism, from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in the year of Christ 51. as is commonly thought: and about that time (for he stayed at <hi>Ephesus</hi> two years) he was setling that Church in Paritie (for we find many Bishops or Presbyters in that one City; as <hi>Jerome</hi> observeth: calling them that were called from <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Miletum</hi> by the Apostle, <hi>Presbyteros Ecclesiae ejusdem)</hi> now can any man think that he would have thus setled the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently setled a Bishop in it, if at the same time he had found the want of a Bishop to be the cause of the Tumuits at <hi>Corinth;</hi> and a Bishop to be the proper Remedy of them.</p>
               <p>§ 9. The next Attempt that my Adversarie maketh on <hi>Jerome,</hi> is to prove that he held Episcopacy to be as old as the Apostles days, from his words, <hi>Epistola ad Luagrium; Nam in Alexandria, à Marco Evangelista, usque ad Heracleam, &amp; Dionysium Episcopos, Presbyteri unum ex se electum, &amp;c.</hi> Here he saith, <hi>Salmasius</hi> leaveth <hi>Jerome,</hi> and doubteth of the Truth of this History: which he need not think strange; seing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also chargeth <hi>Jerome</hi> with a Mistake, <hi>p.</hi> 69. And I think none of us ever judged <hi>Jerome</hi> to have had an unerring Spirit to guide him in all that he wrote. But I shall not question the Truth of what he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; it may be the peculiar Name of Bishop to the Moderator, or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Presbyter,</hi> began at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as the Name of <hi>Christian</hi> did at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er may be said of the Evangelist <hi>Mark,</hi> who founded the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and it is like, by his extraordinary power, ruled it at first by himself; and that but for a small time; for he left <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and preached and planted Churches in <hi>Lybia, Marmorica,</hi> and many parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Beronius</hi> sheweth. That <hi>Jerome</hi> did not include <hi>Mark</hi> (as <hi>Dounam</hi> absurdly saith) among the Bishops so chosen at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is evident: for how could the Presbyters chuse him to be their Head, who had an extraordinary Commission, and had been the Instrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting them, and who by his extraordinary power, had setled them in a Presbyterie, for the rest, if our Author will draw any thing from <hi>Jerome</hi>'s words for his purpose, he must make him flatly contradict all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62347:44"/>
that he had said, and laboriously proved, concerning the equality of Bishop and Presbyters: wherefore, they who came after <hi>Mark,</hi> and were chosen by the Presbyterie, were only set <hi>in excelsiori gradu,</hi> they had the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, were Moderators, and had the Name of Bishops given them usually, whereas the rest were called Presbyters: but that they had, so early as <hi>Marci tempore,</hi> Jurisdiction over their Brethren, the Presbyters who chused them, <hi>Jerome</hi> doth not say, nor can it be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from any of his words. And I do not question, but that in other Churches, as well as <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Presbyters chose a Moderator, and, may be, he continued during Life; only <hi>Jerome</hi> thinketh that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction was more taken notice of there than elsewhere; or sooner had the Note of a peculiar Name given to the <hi>Praeses.</hi> If this Sense, that our Author dreameth of, were put on <hi>Jerome</hi>'s words, they must either contradict the whole of his Epistle, which is to prove that Bishop and Presbyter were one, till Ministers contended among themselves, and a Superiority came in <hi>paulatim,</hi> upon that; or it maketh <hi>Jerome</hi> to say, that Parity was observed in all other Churches till these Dissensions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose; but at <hi>Alexandria</hi> was Prelacy: which we cannot impute to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> without making him absurdly contradict all Antiquity; which doth represent Uniformity in the Church in this Matter; and not such Discord. It is further evident, that <hi>Jerome</hi> did not mean, that there was a Prelate, with sole, or superior Jurisdiction, set up at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> in that he was chosen by the Presbyters from among themselves; and ordained also by them: he had no Prelation above them, but what they gave him: whereas a Bishop must be ordained by other Bishops: again, this is not spoken of by <hi>Jerome</hi> as a thing that the Presbyters must do, as being of Divine Institution; but what themselves chused.</p>
               <p>§ 10. He hath another Exception against our Argument from <hi>Jeromes</hi> Authority, <hi>p.</hi> 74. that he asserteth that <hi>the Apostolical Traditions were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Old Testament.</hi> Where saith he, <hi>two things are asserted. 1. That the Hierarchy of the Christian Church is founded upon Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is an absurd Inference. <hi>Jerome</hi> did indeed think that the Government of the Church at first, was founded on Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contained in the Scripture: but he is so far from making it to be a Hierarchy (in the Prelatical Sense) that he opposeth that, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for Parity. The second thing he observeth is, that <hi>the Apostles had the Model of the Temple in their view, when they erected this Plat-Form and Polity in the Church; the Bishop was the same with the High Priest in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62347:44"/>
Temple: and our Saviour made no Change but what was done did necessarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from the Evangelical AEconomy which he was to stablish in the room of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical worship. Hence the Ancients so often reason from the Jewish Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to regulate the practice of the Christian Church.</hi> Here are diverse things to be examined, 1. How far Christ and his Apostles had respect to the Jewish Model, when they framed the Government of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Church, I shall not now determine. I suppose they did as a man doth when he pulleth down an old House, to build a new one: he doth not tye himself to the Dimensions, the Form, nor number of Stories, or Rooms: yet what was in the old House that was for his design in the new, he will readily observe. We are sure the Gospel Builders neither intended to reform, or patch, the old Jewish Church Fabrick. Such methods in Building, use to impare the Beauty, as well as usefulness, of the Fabrick. It is certain that they did wholly demolish the Fabrick to the Foundation; (I mean, as to what was instituted, and not of the Law of Nature) as the Apostle sheweth <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. where he telleth us of the <hi>change of the Priesthood,</hi> and also <hi>of the Law.</hi> And it is certain that the use of Priests, and of Levites to (whose Work was to serve the Priests in their Sacrifices) ceased, as soon as Christ offered up his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice once for all. Wherefore, as there was a new Priesthood (to speak in his Dialect) to be set up; which had another sort of Work to do; to offer up spiritual Sacrifices: So our Lord and his Apostles accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated their Institution to what was needful, and convenient for that design; and had no further regard to what had been in the Jewish Church. Hence if he can shew that there is the same use of Bishops under the New Testament, that there was of the High Priest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Testament, he gaineth this Argument: but this, I hope, he will not attempt. The High Priest was a Type of Christ, as He is the Head of the Church, and as He offered up that one Sacrifice, which all the inferior Priests under the High Priest's Conduct and Authority, were especially employed in. Must we therefore have a multitude of Bishops in the Christian Church, to represent a Saviour for every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, under whom the Presbyters offer up spiritual Sacrifices? 2. That <hi>the Bishop is the same with the High Priest,</hi> is not only said without all Scripture Warrant; but is most absurd: for the High Priest was one in the whole Church of God; but the Bishops are many in the Gospel Church of Christ. And indeed this way of Reasoning will either esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Pope as Head of the Universal Church, or it is wholly insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant. 3. That our Saviour introduced no Change but what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62347:45"/>
for the Evangelical AEconomie, is first said without Book he used his Libertie, nor did he tye himself to the old Pattern. Next, the new AEconomie did require this change that there should be no High Priest: because one man could not so manage the Affairs of the whole Christian Church, as he could do of the Jewish Church. 4. <hi>Jerome</hi> doth not here infer a Prelacy among Presbyters, from the Subordination of Priests in the Temple: his whole purpose is to shew that Deacons, the Servants of the Church, were inferior to Presbyters, the Rulers of it; and this he setteth forth by the Similitude (not binding Pattern) of the Levites being inferior to the Priests, whom they served in the offering of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: wherefore he doth not tell us that the Bishops were what the High Priest was; and the Presbyters what <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons were, and the Deacons what the Levites were; but he sets <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons on the one side, and compareth them with the Bishops or Presbyters (whom he had been proving to be the same) and the Levites on the other side to whom he compareth the Deacons. 5. If he can shew us that any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That, Jerome <hi>citeth the genuine Epistle of</hi> Ignatius; <hi>in which the Divine Original, and Institution, of Episcopal Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Jurisdiction above Presbyters, is frequently and plainly expressed</hi> And after, <hi>when we find him citing the Epistles of Saint</hi> Ignatius <hi>as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine words of that holy Martyr, it must be acknowledged that he never dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any Interval, after the Apostles, in which the Church was governed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Parity of Presbyters.</hi> This is a strange way of reasoning: <hi>Jerome</hi> saith that <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote such and such Epistles, <hi>Ergo,</hi> though he teacheth Doctrine flatly contradictory to what they contain, yet he taketh for certain Truth all that is said in them: neither will this follow from <hi>Jerome</hi>'s believing that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was a good man, and a holy Martyr good Men may have different Apprehensions of things, and yet own the Writings of one another to be genuine. All that <hi>Jerome</hi> saith is, that <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> wrote an Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> another to the <hi>Magnesians, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not cite one word out of them for Episcopacy, nor can any man assure us that these Epistles now Extant are the same that <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote, and that <hi>Jerome</hi> mentioneth; or that they are not vitiated. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

will not digress to debate about <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles, whether they be spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or legitimate; whether they were by <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr, or by an other of that Name, long after: but I much question what our Author confidently asserteth, that <hi>the Divine Original and Institution of Episcopal Eminence or Jurisdiction above Presbyters, is, in them, frequently and plainly expressed.</hi> When he shall think fit to produce the places where this is done, we shall consider them.

That he saith there, <hi>Episcopi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud nos tenent locum Apostolorum;</hi> cannot prove his point: for the same may be said of all Presbyters; and <hi>Jerome</hi> saith so expresly of them, <hi>Ep. ad Ocean:</hi> as I cited § 3: they succeed to the Apostles in that part of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62347:46"/>
Church power that is competent to them: and he cannot prove that Bishops succeed to them in all the power they had: but the Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this will fall in afterward. That <hi>Jerome</hi> speaketh about an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Prince,</hi> or <hi>Governour,</hi> is also inconcludent: for the Fathers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times speak as big words of Presbyters. He citeth also <hi>Ep. ad Paulinum, Episcopi</hi> (saith he) <hi>&amp; Presbyteri habeant in exemplum Apostolos &amp; Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licos viros, quorum honorem possidentes habere nitantur &amp; meritum.</hi> All that he can draw from this is, that there was such a Distinction in <hi>Jerome</hi>'s time; which is not denyed: but <hi>Jerome</hi> doth not here define what power the one of these had above the other. He had been telling <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> how Men of other Professions laboured to imitate them who had excelled in their way; and instanceth the <hi>Roman Captains, Philosophers, Poets, Orators;</hi> and this he applieth to Church men; that they also should follow the best Examples: it were ridiculous to strain it to this sense, that Bishops should imitate the Apostles, and Presbyters the Apostolick men: especially seing our Author will say that many of these were Bishops. His <hi>exors &amp; ab omnibus eminens potestas,</hi> he mentioneth by so indistinct a Citation, that I know not where to find it; and therefore shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.

I oppose the Answers I have given to the several things he there mentioneth; which duely considered, let the Reader judge what ground there is for his Triumph that he concludeth this Discourse with.</p>
               <p>§ 13. Our Author proceedeth <hi>p. 80, &amp; seq:</hi> to vindicate <hi>Augustine, that he was no Presbyterian.</hi> And, pray, who ever said he was one? That way was past its Meridian in the World a little before his time: only we bring his Authority to prove, that some great Lights of the Church did not look on Episcopacy as of Divine Right; or to have been in the Church from the Apostolick Age. He prefaceth this Dissertation with a Digression (as himself calleth it) containing insolent Contempt of, and Reproach against the Presbyterians; calling all that have written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Salmasius, the little Bouffoons of the Party:</hi> he must here understand the <hi>London</hi> Ministers. the five eminent Men under the name of <hi>Smectymnus, Rutherford, Didoclavius, Gersom Bucer,</hi> and many others. If Presbyterians did incline to act the part of <hi>Bouffoons,</hi> this Book, and many others like it, might furnish them plentiful Matter. He char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them with <hi>Impiety, p:</hi> 82. calleth them <hi>factious and unmortified Men:</hi> their Opinions, <hi>Dreams:</hi> saith, <hi>they have nothing more in their view than to gratifie their Revenge, and other Passions:</hi> imputeth <hi>Impudence and Irreligion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62347:47"/>
to them,</hi> on account of this their Opinion. And his Confidence swelleth so high as to tell us, how <hi>astonishing it is that so much is written for Parity: If we believe the Ecclesiastical Records, there remaineth no Debate that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is Divine, Apostolical, received without Interruption, and that by the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Church. That Scepticism will (by natural Consequence) pull down things more sacred, than the outward Hedge of Government:</hi> If his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prove to bear any Proportion to his big Words, there can be no standing before him. He had been wiser if he had asserted less, and proved more: and if he had managed this Controversie with a more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Mind, it may be his success had been no less. I will not contest with him in Railling, nor huffie and bold asserting what is in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie: but am willing to reason the Matter fairly and calmly. The Passage out of <hi>Augustine</hi> which <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Salmasius</hi> bring is, <hi>Ep.</hi> 19. which is <hi>ad Hieronymum: quanquam secundum honorum vocabula quae jam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae usus obtinuit, Episcopus Presbytero major sit, tamen in multis rebus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus Hieronymo minor est.</hi> I freely yield to my Antagonist, that <hi>the design of that Epistle is to invite</hi> Jerome <hi>to use all freedom in their Epistolary Conversation:</hi> and I add that this was needful, considering the higher Character (in the common estimation of that Age) that <hi>Augustine</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained, above <hi>Jerome,</hi> a Presbyter; and therefore I lay not the stress of our Argument on his owning <hi>Jerome</hi> to be in some things above him; nor do I think that <hi>Augustine</hi> lookt on himself and <hi>Jerome</hi> as standing on a Level, in respect of Dignity, as then it was esteemed: but I place the force of our Argument on these two; the one is, <hi>Augustine</hi> insinuateth no Prelation that he had above <hi>Jerome,</hi> even according to the Sentiment of that Age, but what was <hi>secundum honorum vocabula:</hi> he had a higher Title, he giveth no hint of a Superior Jurisdiction, that he, a Bishop, had above <hi>Jerome,</hi> a Presbyter: which had been much more pertinent, and full as consistent with the Modesty and Humility that he expresseth. The other is, that even that superior Honour, he doth not derive from Divine Institution, or Apostolical Tradition, or constant Practice from the beginning; but from the Custome of the Church that then (that is in that Age) prevailed.</p>
               <p>§ 14. After setting down at length this Testimony from <hi>Augustine,</hi> he undertaketh to shew that <hi>the latter Sectaries</hi> (so he is pleased to dignifie the Presbyterians) <hi>mistake his meaning, and that</hi> Augustine <hi>never thought that Parity obtained in the Christian Church.</hi> He endeavoureth then to prove, that by <hi>usus Ecclesiae,</hi> Augustine <hi>meant no other thing, than the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62347:47"/>
Practice of the Christian Church from the beginning: and that this Notion is very familiar to him, that Catholick and universal Customes had their Rise from Apostolick authority.</hi> Before I consider what he saith on this Head, I shall suggest one Consideration that will make it wholly unserviceable to his Design: <hi>viz.</hi> that our Argument is not built simply upon the Phrase <hi>usus Ecclesiae:</hi> but partly in his distinguishing Bishops from Presbyters in respect of Dignity, not Jurisdiction; partly on his mentioning <hi>usus Ecclesiae</hi> not which <hi>semper obtinuit, sed</hi> which <hi>jam obtinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it.</hi> He speaketh not of universal Practice, nor of perpetual Practice; but for a Practice that in his time had become common. I shall now attend to what he pretendeth to bring for his Opinion about <hi>Austines</hi> meaning: he telleth us <hi>p.</hi> 85. that <hi>this Father complained that many Usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had crept into the Church that were burdensome and uneasie, of which they knew the Original; but for such Customes and Constitutions as were received universally, in all Churches, from the very first preaching of the Gospel, these he always considered as Sacred, and inviolable, and of Apostolick Authority:</hi> and of this sort, he saith, <hi>Austine thought Episcopacy to be:</hi> and he bringeth in <hi>Augustine</hi> reasoning thus: that <hi>what was confirmed by universal Custome in the Christian Church, could have no beginning latter than the Apostles:</hi> his words are, <hi>quod universa tenet Ecclesia, nec conciliis institutum, sed semper retentum, non nisi authoritate Apostolorum traditum rectissime credimus.</hi> He telleth us again <hi>p</hi> 87. to make his Assertion surer, as much as repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it can do; that <hi>usus Ecclesiae in</hi> Austine's <hi>Language, signifieth nothing else than the universal Practice of the Christian Church, which obtained in all Ages, and in all places, and therefore must needs spring from no lower Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than Apostolick authority.</hi> And hence he pleadeth, that <hi>unless we can shew what Council, Provincial or AEcumenick, introduced Episcopacy, it must be purely Divine.</hi> To all this I oppose a few Considerations. First, that upstart Customes of whose Original we can give account and these that are immemorial, are not only to be distinguished, but differently regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I think it is very reasonable: and this learned Father did wisely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it; but that so much weight is to be laid on this Distinction, that every thing is to be accounted Divine, the first Rise of which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not account for, I cannot assent to that; nor do I find that <hi>Austine</hi> was of that Opinion. There were Customes, even in the Apostolick Church, which he will not say were of Divine Institution, and yet he cannot tell when and by whom they began: such as the <hi>Love-Feasts;</hi> to which I may add the <hi>osculum pacis,</hi> which though the manner of it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62347:48"/>
by the Apostle, that it should be done holily, without Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie or Lasciviousness; yet I think few will say, the thing was enjoyned; for then all the Churches should sin in neglecting it. And if there were such Customes that then crept in, why might it not be so afterward?</p>
               <p>§ 15. I observe 2. From his Discourse, that there is no ground to think that <hi>Augustine</hi> thought every Custome Apostolical, of which the Original, or time of beginning, could not be shewed: because that were to make Custome, and not Scripture the Rule of our Faith and Practice: and it would likewise infer the Infallibility of the Church, not only in her Decrees, but in her Customes: which is a stretch beyond the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists themselves. If this Doctrine be true, no Custome of the Church can be contrary to, yea, nor without Warrand from Apostolick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: it is not to be thought that <hi>Austine</hi> thought so, who every where pleadeth for having Recourse to the written Word of God, where there is any Controversie about our Faith or Practice. The words cited cannot be so far stretched; but are to be understood, in Subordination to the Scripture; where a Custome hath always, and universally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and it is not inconsistent with the Scripture Rule; that may be indeed lookt on as of Divine Original, if it be in a Matter that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nearly concerned in. If we should yield this Doctrine about the Influence of Customes, as a Rule of Faith and Practice; yet it must be understood to comprehend the Custome of the Apostolick Age, together with that of after times: for to say that after the decease of the Apostles no Custome could creep in which was not Divine, is a bold Assertion. If while the Apostles watched over the Church, some Weeds might grow; much more after their decease, <hi>while men slept,</hi> it might be so: 4. If his Doctrine about Customes in general, were never so unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; how will he prove that Episcopacy is such a Custome, or that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> lookt on it as such? Herein lyeth our present Debate; and he fancieth <hi>Austine</hi> is on his side, because he extolleth Custome; if he can prove that <hi>Austine</hi> thought that <hi>universa Ecclesia semper tenuit,</hi> that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop hath Jurisdiction over Presbyters, we shall part with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lean no more to <hi>Austines</hi> Authority. This he hath not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, and we are sure he can never perform it. 5. We are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to tell what Council introduced Episcopacy. But we can prove, first; that it might come in an other way, as the <hi>Tares grew when Men slept;</hi> he might with as good Reason, when we see Tares growing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Wheat, prove that these Tares are good Wheat, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62347:48"/>
tell when, or by what particular Hand, they were sowen. Did not our Lord foretell that Corruptions would insensibly creep into the Church, by this Parable of the Tares? Sure Decisions of Councils are not the only way of corrupting the Church. 2. If we prove that Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy is contrary to Apostolick practice, and to Scripture rule, it must needs be evil; though it have come in by no Council: if we find a Thief in the House, or a Disease in the Body, we may look on them as such, though we cannot tell how the one got into the House, nor give account of the procatartick Cause of the other: now as to what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test about, if we do not prove that it is not the way that Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth, or that the Apostles allowed, we must yield the Cause. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to what he further offereth, I must take notice of a word that he seemeth to smother, and yet it looketh like an Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 86. about the middle he saith, Austine <hi>intended no more, but that now under the Gospel, by the constant and early practice of the Church, from the days of the Apostles, the Character and Dignity of a Bishop, was above that of a Presbyter.</hi> He putteth, <hi>now,</hi> in a different Character, and expoundeth it by, <hi>the days of the Gospel.</hi> This Interpretation is a doing Violence to the Text; for if <hi>now</hi> be so understood, he must tell us when the time was, that the Distinction of these <hi>honorum vocabula, Episcopatus &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterium,</hi> were not in use. Were they one and the same under the Law? Or is it imaginable that <hi>Austine</hi> would after 400 years, or there about, speak so of that Distinction, if it were no newer? He citeth also 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 16. We have no such Custome, nor the Churches of Christ:</hi> doth he think this Scripture so clear and express an Assertion of his Conclusion, that he saith not one word for bringing it to his purpose: the Apostle is there speaking of things wherein Custome is indeed the Rule, as having the Head bare, or covered, wearing long or short Hair: it doth not thence follow (if the Apostle did there make it the Rule) that it must also be the Rule in other things, <hi>p.</hi> 88. he pretendeth to convince us further, that <hi>Austine distinguished the Custome of the Universal Church, from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of particular places, and he maketh the one mutable, the other not so.</hi> He needed not be at pains to convince us of that Distinction. I know no body that doubteth of it, nor that reject the Customes that are truly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal, unless they clash with Scripture. But he should rather have tryed his Skill in convincing us, that Episcopacy hath been so used in the Church, or that <hi>Austine</hi> meant such a Usage, by his <hi>usus Ecclesiae.</hi>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62347:49"/>
§ 16. Another thing our Author undertaketh, for vindicating <hi>Austine,</hi> is, to prove that <hi>he doth positively assert that the Succession of Bishops in the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>did begin at</hi> Peter; <hi>and thence argueth against the Donatists; that their Error was a Noveltie, because in all this Succession of Bishops there was no Donatist: if</hi> (saith my Antagonist) <hi>there was a Period in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church after the days of the Apostles; in which the Church was governed without Bishops, by a Paritie of Ecclesiastical Officers, the Donatists might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite that Argument, by denying such a Succession.</hi> This is one of the silliest of all Arguments: it is <hi>captio ab homonymia:</hi> there was a Succession of faithful Men, who taught and ruled the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for so long a time, among whom was no <hi>Donatist:</hi> it followeth indeed that the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Donatists</hi> was a <hi>Noveltie;</hi> but doth it follow that in all that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, that Church was governed by Prelates, with Jurisdiction over Presbyters? unless he can prove that every one named in that Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ruled the Church by himself, without the joint Authority of the Presbyters, he saith nothing to the Purpose in hand. He cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the word <hi>Bishop,</hi> signified in the Scripture Dialect, and in the Age that followed, any Church Ruler: and therefore that these men are called <hi>Bishops,</hi> cannot prove their sole, nor superior Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Austines</hi> Argument from this Succession, is equally strong against the <hi>Donatists,</hi> whether these called <hi>Bishops,</hi> were such as do we now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish by that Name from other Presbyters, or were the Ministers of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or were Moderators of the Presbyterie there. If he had taken his argument from <hi>Austines</hi> naming but one Bishop in <hi>Rome</hi> at one time, it would have seemed to have more of sense. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so, it would not be so concludent; for naming of one who might be the oldest, the most eminent, or the <hi>primus Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Praeses</hi> in the Meeting, doth no ways infer that he had Jurisdiction over the rest. From this our Author inferreth, <hi>p.</hi> 90. that <hi>usus Ecclesiae,</hi> in <hi>Austines</hi> sense, is the practice of the Church from the days of <hi>Peter.</hi> I think none else can see this Consequence; for in the one place he is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Bishops and Presbyters; in the other place (and they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Books) he hath no occasion to take notice of that Distinction: nor is there any Affinity between the one Passage and the other. He further argueth, that <hi>Austine</hi> reckoneth <hi>Aerius</hi> an Heretick, on account of his Opinion about the Identitie of Bishop and Presbyter. This I have taken notice of above, § 1. It is no way to our present purpose, <hi>Austine</hi> disliked the Opinion of <hi>Aerius,</hi> as contrary to the Sentiments that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62347:49"/>
then prevailed, <hi>Ecclesiae usu:</hi> doth it thence follow that he thought E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy was <hi>Juris Divini?</hi> Whether his unseemly Reflection on Mr. <hi>Andrew Mellvil,</hi> be a better proof of our Authors Christian Temper, and Veracity, or of his Skill in close reasoning, I leave it to the Reader to judge. His repeating the Argument from Succession of Bishops, <hi>p.</hi> 91. doth not make it stronger. When he can say no more that looketh like Argument, he (according to his laudable Custome) concludeth this part of the Debate, with Railling and abusive Reflections; and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently asserting his Conclusion, <hi>ad nauseam usque. Few of the</hi> Scots <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians read any of the Ancients: they consult</hi> Blondel <hi>and</hi> Salmasius, <hi>and go no further than</hi> Smectymnus: he telleth us of <hi>their incurable Peevishness: they think to understand the Fathers by broken Sentences, torn from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour places, when they have neither the Patience, nor good nature, to consider what the same Author saith else where:</hi> he calleth them, <hi>bauling People,</hi> and their way <hi>Confusion, and aequality. It is not only new but absurd; supported by Dreams and Visionary Consequences: their Doctrines contradict the common Sense of Mankind, as well as the universal and uninterrupted Testimony of all Christian Antiquity.</hi> Thus he bantereth his Adversaries, when he cannot beat them out of their Principles, by the force of Argument, in this way of Debating I am resolved he shall have the last word: which uses to be a pleasant Victory to Men, or Women, who fight with this Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</p>

It might be expected that this Gentleman, who when the Presbyterians hold Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be of Divine Right, requireth of them <hi>plain Proofs, else they must be lookt upon as Impostors, p.</hi> 13. should give us very plain and positive Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for what he doth thus magisterially Dictate; and which he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the Foundation of his Opinion concerning the Divine Right of Episcopacy: but here we are disappointed. He hath not attempted to prove that the nature of the Apostolate is not an Aggregate of all these, preaching Power, with Administration of the Sacraments, Supreme Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Church, and that with Rule over all Churches, an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Call, extraordinary Gifts, Infallibility; to have seen the Lord. If one should assert that they who have all these are Apostles, and none else are Apostles; and so that these are the Properties of an Apostle, which agree to Apostles, <hi>omni, soli, &amp; semper;</hi> and consequently they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly taken, are the most essential Attribute of an Apostle, by which we must judge of the Essence of that Office (for we know not the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things, but by their first, and essential Properties) how will our Author disprove this Opinion to establish his own?</p>
               <p>§ 3. I shall set before the Reader the Opinions of others (on both sides) about the Matter of the <hi>Apostolate;</hi> or the distinguishing Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of an Apostle; that he may be the better able to judge of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Opinion about it; which yet is not his, but is borrowed from the Papists. But <hi>I</hi> first observe, that Christs twelve Disciples, who are by way of Eminency called Apostles, arrived at that height of Church Dignity and Power, by degrees: they were first called to be Believers: and afterward were sent forth as Preachers; Christ having bred them to that Work by their Converse with Him, for some time: in neither of these Degrees, had they any Church Power, except that of Preaching, and Baptizing: they were no Church Rulers; for there was as yet, no Gospel Church to be ruled, but they were still subject to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was exercised in the Jewish Church: at last our Lord, after his Resurrection, gave them their Apostolick Commission; by which they were clothed with the Authority that belonged to that Office; and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62347:51"/>
sent them out, both with Authority to Teach, gather, and setle, and to govern Churches; and their complete Ordination, or solemn setting them apart for that Office, by which also, they were furnished for the Discharge of it, above what they had been before, was when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was poured out on them, on the day of <hi>Pentecost:</hi> they got their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 10, 20. but the pouring out of the Spirit on that day, was as it were putting the Broad Seal of Heaven to their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; as may be gathered from <hi>Act:</hi> 1: 4, 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 44. It is true, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, beside the Twelve, got some Drops of that heavenly Shower, but they had not the same Commission with them, and therefore the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that they got did neither authorize them, nor fit them for Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Work. Another thing that I here observe is, that though the Name <hi>Apostle</hi> be given to others in Scripture, yet there were some to whom that Name was given in a peculiar manner; though the Word is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time used at large, yet it is applyed to them, so as by it they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from other Church Officers: hence the Apostle not only taketh that Designation to himself, in the Inscriptions of his Epistles, but taketh pains to prove that he was an Apostle 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 9. 1, 2. Now our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, wherein consisteth the nature of that Office that they had, who by way of Eminence were called <hi>Apostles;</hi> or what are the Characte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that they may be distinguished by from other Church Officers? If we can arrive at any Light in this, it will help us to understand whether the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops be Apostles, as some plead, or their Successors, as others imagine.</p>
               <p>§ 4 I begin with the learned Bishop of <hi>Worcester Iren. p</hi> 209. where he discourseth of the common use of the Word, but <hi>p.</hi> 210. he telleth us, <hi>that the Twelve were called Apostles, from their immediat Commission that they had from Christ, and that our Lord made use of the word</hi> Sending <hi>(as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them) in the proper and peculiar sense.</hi> And he is so far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Apostles and Bishops to be the same, that he maintaineth, that <hi>

               <p>§ 5. I have seen a Manuscript of a learned Minister of this Church, now deceased, which, by an accident, hath stuok in the Birth, (I mean the Press) for some time: the design of which is to prove (and I think he doth it solidly) that the proper distinguishing Character of an Apostle is, <hi>he was commissioned by Jesus Christ in an immediate way, to gather</hi> and <hi>to plant Churches; and to institute all Christs Ordinances, in them: to teach them to observe all that he hath commanded.</hi> So he, <hi>p:</hi> 61. That Apostles were appointed for the erecting and building of the Church, as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officers are for the constant care of it, and administring the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of it. And <hi>p.</hi> 64. he maketh the Power of the Apostles, to be instituting the Ordinances of the Church, Ministerially, under Christ, whereas the Power of all other Officers lyeth in executing what is by them instituted. the Apostles Power of Executing these Institutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from this, that every superior Church Officer hath the Power of all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62347:52"/>
inferior Officers. He further sheweth, that the Office of an Apostle differed from all the extraordinary Offices that were in the Church, in the beginning of the Gospel, particularly, the Evangelists (whose Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice had the most Resemblance of the Apostolate) in that 1. They had not the same Mission with the Apostles (the one was immediatly from Christ, the other was from Him, by the Apostles: though their Gifts were sometimes immediate, and extraordinary.) 2. They were not under the infallible guidance of the Spirit, as the Apostles were; but were directed and ordered by the Apostles. 3. They had not their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Instructions from Christ immediatly, as the Apostles, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the <hi>Epist to Tim:</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> 4 They had not the Power of conferring the Gifts of the Holy Ghost by laying on of Hands, as the Apostles had. My design in all this is to shew, that we have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to take this our Authors Doctrine about the nature of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office, how ever confidently asserted by him, on his bare word; seing so many of all sorts of Protestants are against him in this: for his talk of the uniform Testimony of Antiquity for what he saith, we look on it as a groundless Fancie; that he can never make out. I find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that some of the Ancients call Bishops, and some of them call Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, <hi>Apostles,</hi> in a large sense; that is Christs Ambassadors: but that some of them think, or say, that the Office of them who now rule the Churches, is the same with that of them who at first planted them, I find not: when he shall please to produce some of these Testimonies that he pretendeth to be uniform, they shall be considered.</p>
               <p>§ 6 I cannot pass over without correction, an Argument he hath <hi>p.</hi> 99. to prove that it was not necessary to make up an Apostle, that he be immediately called to the Apostolate by our Saviour; <hi>for</hi> Matthias <hi>was not immediatly ordained by our Saviour, but by the Apostles; who had power to continue that Succession to the end of the World. A.</hi> It is most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly said, that <hi>Matthias</hi> was ordained by the Apostles; for if they had had power to ordain an Apostle, why made they use of <hi>Lots?</hi> They did not so in the Election or Ordination of any other Church Officer. I think <hi>Lightfoots</hi> Opinion will find moe to assent to it, his words are, <hi>Apostoli non poterant Apostolum ordinare impositione manuum, prout Presbyteros ordinabant, sed sorte utuntur, quae erat veluti immediata manuum Christi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio in eum.</hi> Nor doth it make against this, that it is said <gap reason="foreign">

He telleth us, <hi>p:</hi> 100. <hi>that the ordinary and perpetual Power that Christ gave to his Apostles, was derived by them to their Successors.</hi> Here he supposeth that the Apostles had an ordinary and perpetual Power; which is that we now contend about; for we maintain that their Power was extraordinary, and ceased with them; and that it was an inferior sort of Power which their Successors got. He telleth next, that <hi>the name also was derived to others beside the twelve.</hi> That hath been already granted, that that Name, in a large sense, was given to others: yet in another sense it was restricted to the Twelve. But he is very unhapy in his Proof of this uncontested Truth; by Instancing <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 25. where <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is called the <hi>Messenger,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of the Church of <hi>Philippi:</hi> for it is plain from the Text, that he is so called as being sent by the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> and not as sent of God to them (tho we deny not but that in that sense he might be called an Apostle) for in that he is said, with the same Breath, to be he that Ministred to <hi>Pauls</hi> wants; and seeing it is as evident from the Text, that he was then with <hi>Paul</hi> and not at <hi>Philippi;</hi> it appeareth that he had been sent by them to <hi>Paul</hi> with some token of their bounty, for the Apostles subsistance. Thus <hi>Grotius</hi> expoundeth this Place: who saith, that <hi>they who gathered and carried the sacred Money were called</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and likewise, he saith, that <hi>the Philippians had sent Money to Paul by Epaphroditus, which he received, because being in Bonds, he could not then work with his hands</hi> For the same interpretation are <hi>Beza, Piscator, Zanchius, Uorstius;</hi> yea, <hi>Estius,</hi> who citeth <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> for it; and <hi>Cajetan.</hi> But he undertaketh to prove his sense of the word, by this Assertion, that <hi>an Apostle, in the New Testament, never signifieth a Messenger sent by men to men; but always a Messenger sent from God to men.</hi>

This he extendeth to other places, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. This assertion is wholy groundless: yea, it is false, as I have already proved with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Epaphroditus.

What he excepteth against this is frivolous; for they are not called <hi>the glory of Christ</hi> on account of this Employment; neither could they be called <hi>the glory of Christ,</hi> simply, on account of their being sent by him to the people; yea, or being Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: but they are so called, because of their <hi>holy conversation,</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful discharge of their Office,</hi> what ever it was, in the Church.

He took notice, it seems, that his Adversaries make <hi>Universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Apostolick Jurisdiction</hi> to be one distinguishing Mark of their Office, which Bishops cannot pretend to; and therefore Bishops have not the Substance of the Apostolick Office. Hence he laboureth to take this Scruple out of the way, <hi>p.</hi> 101, 102, 103, 104. And 1. He telleth us <hi>the narrowness of the Limits of these Provinces assigned to the secondary Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> (he meaneth the Bishops) <hi>did not alter the nature of their Office, from that of the twelve Apostles; more than the Kings of</hi> Juda <hi>lost the Honour of sitting on the Throne of</hi> David, <hi>after the Revolt of the ten Tribes.</hi> Here is a gross Mistake of the Question, which is not, whether the largeness or narrowness of the Charge that a Church Ruler hath, do alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Office; but whether a limited and particular Charge do not so differ from that which is universal and extended to the whole Church of Christ, as that he who hath the one Charge and he that hath the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in the same Office. Will any Papist say, that the Univers<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Bishop who sitteth at <hi>Rome,</hi> hath the same Office in the Church, and no higher than any poor Bishop in <hi>Italy</hi> or elsewhere? The Similitude brought from the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> is impertinent to this purpose: if one had the Empire of the whole World, and lost that, and got the Crown of one particular Kingdom; I think his Office is not what it was. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, if we should yield all that he here alledges, it were no loss to our cause: for we do not make <hi>universal Jurisdiction</hi> the only Character of an Apostle; but that complexly, and in conjunction with others: as is above shewed. Another Consideration that he hath, is, <hi>the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had not equal Bounds and Provinces for their Inspection, but some travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led further than others; yet this did not change their rectoral Power, or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: no more did the confining Bishops in the exercise of their Power, to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower Limites, make their Power to differ from what the Apostles had: that Restriction not being by the nature of the Power it self; but from the various Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities and Circumstances of the Church, the Rules of Order, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Converts, which obliged them afterwards to more personal Residence.</hi> I reply to this, 1. Here is a wide Door left for <hi>his Holiness of Rome</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Church by: and it is observable, how naturally, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, this learned Author, and some others of his Gang, do shew their Byass to that side. If nothing but Order, and Circumstances, and not Divine Institution, do confine Bishops to their Sees, whether larger,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62347:54"/>
or less extended; and every one of them have, <hi>actu primo</hi> (as may be deduced from this Doctrine) universal Jurisdiction; why may not the exercise of it be committed to one of them; and the rest be subject to him? Some think that this belongeth to good Order, (though ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pastors be related <hi>actu primo,</hi> to the Universal Church; yet they have not that Jurisdiction that the Apostles had, who needed no more but their intrinsick Power to warrant its Exercise in any particular place.) 2. It is without all warrant to suppose that every Bishop hath universal Power over the Church of Christ, as every Apostle had: they have not that Commission, <hi>go teach all Nations:</hi> this was the peculiar work of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, to travel and plant Churches: the work of Bishops (if such an Office be in the Church) is to stay at home, and feed that part of Christs Flock which is committed to them. 3. It is falsly supposed that the Apostles had so their several Provinces as that they were confined to these: the World was the Province of each of them; though by mutual Consent, or by the immediat Conduct of the Holy Ghost, who guided their Motions, (as may be gathered from <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 7, 9, 10.) they went into several places of the World; yet so as they observed not that Division very critically; for we find them meeting sometimes; and though <hi>Peter</hi> was the Apostle of the Circumcision, yet <hi>Paul</hi> often preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Jews 4. The confinement of the ordinary Pastors to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Charges is not the effect of Prudence, and Agreement of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, alone; but it is Gods Appointment, (though the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Bounds of their several Districts in particular, be a work of men) for Christ hath not only set Pastors in the Church, but he hath set them over their particular Flocks, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 18. so as they have the charge of them, and must give account of them; and not of the Souls in all Churches.</p>
               <p>§ 8. His Notion, <hi>p.</hi> 103. that <hi>the Apostles divided the World among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Lot,</hi> I know is to be found in <hi>Eusebius, Dorotheas,</hi> and <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> and some others of the Ancients; and some latter Writers have taken it on trust from them, as this Author doth: neither shall I be at pains to disprove it; it is done learnedly and fully by <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet, Iren: p. 232. &amp; seq.</hi> by eight Arguments, that this Author will not easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: and particularly he sheweth, that <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 25. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of a District appointed at first for <hi>Judas,</hi> and he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from it was alloted to <hi>Matthias:</hi> which our Author taketh for an uncontested Truth, <hi>p.</hi> 103. Another thing I observe is, <hi>p.</hi> 104. that he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62347:55"/>
saith, <hi>neither the Apostles, nor their immediat Successors, were so confined to particular Sees, but that proportionably to the Exigencies of the Catholick Church their Episcopal care and Superintendency did reach the whole, as far as was possible; and as Christian charity did require or allow, notwithstanding of their more fixed and nearer Relation they might have to particular Churches:</hi> which he proveth by <hi>their Epistles to other Churches,</hi> and by <hi>their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels:</hi> and he concludeth, that <hi>the confinement to a particular See, doth not proceed from the nature of the Priesthood, but from the Rules of Prudence, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Oeconomy, and canonical Constitutions.</hi> I first take notice, that this is still beside the Purpose, for it can never evince that the Bishops are Apostles, unless he make it out that no other Mark can be assigned in respect of which they differ. We say, that though Bishops and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were Universal Officers in the Church, there are other things wherein they differ, as hath been shewed. 2 That the Apostles had a fixed and nearer Relation to one particular Church more than another, is denyed, and he can never prove it. The contrary is proved abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly by the Author last cited. It is true, some of the Fathers do sometimes call <hi>James</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> but that is with respect to his Residence, not to the confinement of his Authority: he was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to stay there, as the place which Christians did resort to from all parts of the World (not in Pilgrimage, but on many other Occasions) that he might there superintend the Affairs of the Universal Church. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb. lib: 2. c:</hi> 23. and <hi>Jerome de viris illustribus,</hi> say, he was by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles ordained the first Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> but this they take out of <hi>Egesippus</hi> (as themselves confess) a most Fabulous Writer, and both of them relate out of him, several things concerning the same <hi>James,</hi> that all do look on as idle Dreams. 3. It is also without warrant, that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth, that the first Bishops were not confined to their Sees, more than the Apostles were. If he understand of the Evangelists, we shall debate the case afterward. If of ordinary Pastors of the Church, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but that they had a regard to neighbouring Churches, which were not furnished with Pastors, or otherways had need of their help (so do Ministers at this day, and ought to do) and this is all that can be inferred from their <hi>Epistles,</hi> or their <hi>Travels,</hi> which he mentioneth: but that they had universal Jurisdiction, as every one of the Apostles had, we deny, and he hath brought no Proof of it. 4. Who ever thought that the Confinement of a Pastor to a particular Charge, doth proceed from the <hi>nature of the Priesthood?</hi> if one Pastor could feed Christs
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62347:55"/>
Flock, more were superfluous: neither doth it proceed from mens Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Church Canons; but from Christs Institution, built on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural necessity. He directed his Apostles to ordain Elders in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in every Church.</p>
               <p>§ 9. He cometh now <hi>p.</hi> 105. to discourse of <hi>Succession to these Apostles,</hi> whose Office he had taken so much pains (to what purpose let the Reader Judge) to describe: and fixeth the Debate in this Question, <hi>Whether the Apostles committed their Episcopal Jurisdiction and Apostolick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which they exercised in particular Churches, to single Successors, duely and regularly chosen, or to a Colledge of Presbyters, acting in the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ecclesrastical Affairs, in perfect Parity and Equality?</hi> And this he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to be the genuine State of the Controversie, and so do I; if some of his Prejudices, and unwarrantable Suppositions be cut off from it. For correcting this State of the Question, let it be observed first; that we will never own that the Apostles had any Successors in the whole of what was essential to the Apostolick Office: particularly, that rectoral Power that every one of them had over all other Ecclesiasticks: we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that this was transmitted to Church Rulers who came after them. This our Author supposeth; whereas he should have proved it. That all that Power that was necessary for the Church, was transmitted from the Apostles to their Successors, we acknowledge: such as Power of Preaching, Administring of Sacraments, Ordaining Ministers, Ruling the Church: this they left in the Church; whether they left this Power to one in every Church to Rule the rest in these Administrations, or to many equally, is the Question. I join all these Powers together; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Brethren with whom we now debate, our <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, put them all in the Bishops hands alone, to be parcelled out to his Curats as he pleaseth. So that Presbyters may not preach, baptize, nor do any thing else in the Churches, without his allowance; they make the Bishop the sole Pastor of the Diocess. Wherefore our Author to this Question should have premised another, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles have any Successors at all, in the plenitude of that Power that they had over the Churches? He taketh it for granted, we deny it: and prove what we say. 1. The Apostles had their Power both as to its being, and extent, and that toward persons and things or actions, by an immediat Call: The Lord by himself, without any act of the Church interveening, pitched on the persons, made them Church Officers, and told them their work, and set the bounds of their Power. Now if any
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62347:56"/>
pretend to succeed to them in the plenitude of this Power, they must instruct the same immediat Call, or shew that the Lord hath left Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in his Word, for clothing some persons with all that Authority: but this neither the Bishops, nor none else can pretend to. Not to an immediat Call; for then they must shew their Credentials. Nor to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Warrant for all the Power of the Apostles; where is their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for going through the World, in their own personal and intrinsick Authority, to order Affairs in all Churches where they come, or for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting Gospel Ordinances; and appointing new Officers in the Church, that were not in it before: or even for ruling over their Brethren? This last I know they claim: and we shall debate it with them; but these others also belonged to the plenitude of an Apostolick Power. We have indeed sufficient warrant in the Word, for Men to Teach and Rule the Church; and these things are necessary to be, and a Power for doing that was needful to continue in the Church to the end of the World; but for other Powers that the Apostles had, they were only needful for planting the Gospel; not for Churches planted: neither have we Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about propogating such a Power in the Church.</p>
               <p>§ 10. Another Argument. The Apostles in their own time, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided their Power and Work among several sorts of Church Officers: they appointed Elders, some for Teaching and Ruling, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; some for Ruling only, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. They appointed also Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, to have a care of the Poor; which was also a part of their Power but they appointed none to succeed in the whole of their Power. This Conduct they could not have used, if they had been to have such Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. If they made diverse sorts of Church Officers to succeed them, every one in his share of that work that is alloted to him. All which was done by the Apostles: and if they have not told the Church, that every one of these Officers must act in dependency on one, who is over them, as the Apostles were over all: how can we imagine that there is one Officer in the Church (by divine or Apostolick appointment) who hath all the Power that they had, and to whom all must be subject as to them. 3. The Fathers do not only make Bishops to be Successors to the Apostles, but they say the same of all Church Officers, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they did not think that any person succeded to them in the plenitude of their Power. The consequence is evident, for parcelling out their Succession, and one enjoying it <hi>in solidum,</hi> are inconsistent; the <hi>Ant.</hi> I prove by several Testimonies. <hi>Ignatius Ep: ad Trall: Presbyteros vocat

                  </gap>, <hi>in the place of the Council of the Apostles. Irenaeus advers Haereseslib: 3: c:</hi> 2. saith, <hi>traditionem quae est ab Apostolis per successionem Presbyterorum custodiri:</hi> and <hi>lib: 4: c:</hi> 43. enjoineth, <hi>ut Presbyteris qui in Ecclesia sunt, &amp; ab Apostolis successionem habent, auscultemus.</hi> And <hi>c: 45.

Ep</hi> 4: affirmeth, <hi>omnes praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitos</hi> (and it is known that he giveth that Title also to Presbyters) <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria ordinatione Apostolis succedere. Jerome</hi> (who was no Bishop) own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself for one of the Successors of the Apostles, <hi>dist: 35: cap.

He hath these words, <hi>non Laicis spiritualia dona tradita sunt; sed vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis Domini, vicarii domini sunt qui vicem Apostolorum tenent:</hi> which ye see he saith of all the Clergy.</p>
               <p>§ 11. Another thing I dislike in this state of the Question is, that he supposeth the Apostles exercised their Jurisdiction in particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. I have above shewed, that this they did not ordinarily, in Churches already planted, and furnished with Officers. A third thing is, that he supposeth us to maintain a <hi>perfect Parity</hi> among Presbyters in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Ecclesiastick Affairs. This I also cleared, <hi>S.</hi> 2. § 5. that we own a temporary Disparity, though not a Jurisdiction, in our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory Moderator. These things being cleared, the Question is to be understood of that ruling Power that was in the persons of the Apostles, and is now necessary to continue in the Church. The Question is, whether, when the Apostles setled Churches, and committed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them to Officers who were to continue in Succession in all the Ages of the Church, they committed that ruling Power to a single person, or to a Colledge of Presbyters? He saith it was committed to a single Bishop, I maintain it was committed to a Colledge of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without any Disparity of Power, or Jurisdiction among them. And I further add, that neither did the Apostles give more of this Power to one of the Presbyters above the rest, neither did they allow them to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62347:57"/>
transfer that equal Power into the Hands of another, and suffer him to rule over them. Some light Velitations he hath (before he came to his main arguments) for proving his Point. And 1. From <hi>Christs promise, that the Apostolick office shall indure perpetually; and this promise was made to them, not in their Personal, but in their Spiritual capacity</hi> I suppose he aimeth at <hi>Mat:</hi> 28: 20. where there is not one word of the Apostolick office in the Plenitude of that power they had. It respecteth their power of Teaching, Baptizing and Ruling; and the promise implieth that there shall be some to the end of the World who shall be imployed in that work; and it ensureth Gods presence to them who are so em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; but it saith nothing, directly nor indirectly, how much of the Apostolick Power these Successors shall have. His second Hint of an Argument is, that <hi>Christ loved the Church as much after the decease of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles as before.</hi> A. It thence followeth that he did not let them want whatever spiritual Authority and Jurisdiction was needful for them: but it no way followeth, that the Apostolick Power, in all its Latitude, must continue; because though that was needful for planting the Church, it is not needful for her watering, and her continuance. That <hi>the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies he is to bring were universally received, and the Church knew no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Government for 1400 years;</hi> as he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 106. is one of his bold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations, which must stand for Argument, to his easie Believers.</p>
               <p>§ 12. He undertaketh to prove that <hi>the Apostles transmitted their Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power immediatly to single Successors,</hi> both by Scripture, and by the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Records. The first Scripture Proof is, from <hi>Timothy being Bishop at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>at</hi> Crete. This his Argument he prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth somewhat confusedly: but we must follow whether he leadeth. He bringeth nothing for proof of their being Bishops there, but that <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle besought</hi> Timothy <hi>to abide at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>when himself was going into</hi> Macedonia, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 3. with Acts</hi> 20: 3, 4, 5. And then, after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off (as he fancieth) one of our Exceptions against his Argument, he proveth, that <hi>the work that they did was competent to a Bishop.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that our Writers commonly bring, is from <hi>Timothies</hi> non resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and travelling with <hi>Paul.</hi> His refutation of this, <hi>p.</hi> 107, is, that <hi>Timothy after he was established Bishop at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>did often wait on the Apostle</hi> Paul, <hi>his spiritual Father, to assist him in the Offices of Religion but such occasional Journeyings cannot infer his being disengaged from his Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Authority at</hi> Ephesus: Philip <hi>was as much a Deacon when he went and preached at</hi> Samaria, <hi>as when he served Tables at</hi> Jerusalem. <hi>The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62347:57"/>
have not lost their Title to their particular Flocks, when they are imployed to visit the Court, or Forreign Churches. The Ancients laid no weight on this Objection, for Concil: Chalcedon: Act: 11: reckoned 27 Bishops from</hi> Timothy <hi>to their own days.</hi> The Reply to all this is easie. 1. He doth not propose our Argument fairly, nor in its full Strength: for then; this his Answer would appear trifling. We plead, that it cannot be made appear that ever <hi>Timothy</hi> was fixed at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as Pastor of that Church; but that he was only sent to it, as <hi>Pauls</hi> Deputy, for a small time, to do some Work there. <hi>I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, 1 Tim:</hi> 1: 3. cannot import a fixed Charge: but on the contrary; that his being first sent to that Place was lookt on as a Temporary Imployment; and the Apostle finding need of his being longer there than he at first thought, doth now length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out his Commission for some longer time. If he had been fixed at <hi>Ephesus</hi> as his particular Charge, and in a Pastoral Relation to that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that was to end only with his Life, such a Desire for his staying longer in that Place had been very impertinent. Again, the Strength of our Argument lieth in this; that we find <hi>Timothy</hi> not only now and then in other Places, Labouring in the Work of the Gospel (that I confess is consistent with a fixed Charge) but the Course of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Labours was, to be imployed else where, and we have little, or no more of him at <hi>Ephesus</hi> than what is mentioned in this place. We find that as soon as <hi>Paul</hi> returned to <hi>Ephesus</hi> from <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that he sent <hi>Timothy</hi> thence to <hi>Achaia,</hi> himself staying at <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 19: 22: After <hi>Paul</hi> came from <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Macedonia</hi> again, and returned thence unto <hi>Asia,</hi> we find <hi>Timothy</hi> with him; not at <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20: 1, 4: After which we never read that <hi>Timothy</hi> wrote, came, or returned to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> We find that <hi>Paul</hi> sent him to <hi>Corinth, 1 Cor:</hi> 4: 7: and 16: 10: 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1: 19. And to <hi>Philippie, Philip:</hi> 2. 19. And to <hi>Thessalonica, 1 Thess:</hi> 3: 2, 6. Also he joyneth with <hi>Paul</hi> in Writing his second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which was written at <hi>Philippie,</hi> and was sent, as also the first, from the same Place: and in that to <hi>Philippie</hi> written from <hi>Rome;</hi> and in the first to <hi>Thessalonica</hi> from <hi>Athens:</hi> and in the second. He is also mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in these Epistles, as being elsewhere: but we read no more of his being at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> He joyneth with <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> from <hi>Rome.</hi> He was at <hi>Corinth</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Rom:</hi> 16: 21: with the Postscript of the Epistle. He was in <hi>Italy</hi> when the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was written, <hi>Heb:</hi> 13: 23: But in the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> which was written from <hi>Rome,</hi> long after the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62347:58"/>
time that <hi>Timothy</hi> was supposed to be made Bishop, no word of him, neither as being at <hi>Rome,</hi> saluting them; nor as being at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> saluted by <hi>Paul.</hi> And it is strange, if when <hi>Paul</hi> speaks so much to the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> at <hi>Miletum, Acts</hi> 20: 17,—that he taketh no special notice of him their Bishop. Beside, he telleth <hi>Timothy</hi> that he had sent <hi>Tychicus</hi> to <hi>Ephesus, 2 Tim:</hi> 2: 12. and that about the same Work that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned <hi>Timothy</hi> to do there; and mentioneth him as sent to them, <hi>Ephes:</hi> 6: 21, 22. So that there is full as much ground to say that <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as to assign that See to <hi>Timothy:</hi> and more ground to make <hi>Timothy</hi> Bishop of several other Churches above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, than of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 13. I hope, 2. These Reasons against <hi>Timothies</hi> being Bishop at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> are not taken off by telling us of <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon Preaching at <hi>Samaria:</hi> for it is probable, that <hi>Philip</hi> was now Called to an higher Office; and so might leave his Deaconship to another: or, he might return to his Work at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> seing we read not of such a constant Course of his being elsewhere, as we find in <hi>Timothy.</hi> Neither is it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell to a <hi>Presbyterian Ministers visiting the Court, or Forreign Churches.</hi> If they be constantly Abroad, and especially, if they were never more set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a particular Place, save that such a Man was sent to Preach, and do other Ministerial Work there for a time, we think it a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against their Pastoral Relation to that Place. If the <hi>Council of Chalcedon, Act</hi> 11. mention twenty seven Bishops in <hi>Ephesus</hi> (which I find not in <hi>Caranza,</hi> nor is it said by the Council, <hi>Bibthoth. Concil.</hi> but by one Man, <hi>Obiter. Leontius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Magnesia, Tom. 4. p.</hi> 700.) it signifieth no more than that <hi>Timothy</hi> setled that Church (which he might do in the short time he stayed there) and from that time there had been so many Bishops, that is, Ministers, or Chief Ministers who were Presidents in their Presbyteries, during that time. This can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove <hi>Timothy's</hi> fixed Pastoral Relation to that People; nor the sole, or superior Jurisdiction of them who came after him. He next labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> from <hi>the Power he was to Exercise, and the Work he was to do there;</hi> which he asserteth to be, <hi>all the Power and Work they claim for a Bishop.</hi> And he insisteth at length, from the Epistles written to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to shew what was his Power and Work. We do not contest with him about this; as himself confesseth, <hi>p.</hi> 104. surely <hi>Timothy</hi> could do as much as any Bishop can lay Claim to: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we deny his being fixed there; and we deny that he Acted as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62347:58"/>
fixed Officer; but as the Apostles Deputy, set there for a time, to do what the Apostle might have done, if he had been personally there. He was an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and as such Acted in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and wherever else he was imployed. That these Epistles were Directed to <hi>Timothy;</hi> only with Respect to his Work at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> is by some imagined, without all ground. He was imployed here and there by the Apostle, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had Work, he was to manage it according to these Directions. It is an inconsequential Argument that our Author bringeth, <hi>p.</hi> 108. to prove <hi>Timothy's</hi> particular Relation to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that 1 <hi>Tim: 3: 14, 15: It is told him, that the Apostle gave him these Directions, that if he should tarry longer from coming to him, he might know how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself in the House of God.</hi> For all this may agree to any Church, as well as to that of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> and it cannot be said (which followeth) of <hi>Ephesus</hi> alone, that that Church was <hi>the Pillar and Ground of the Truth:</hi> Wherefore, the Apostle intended these Injunctions not for <hi>Timothy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; but for all Pastors of the Church: far less for <hi>Timothy</hi> only while at <hi>Ephesus;</hi> but for him in whatever part of the Lords Vineyard he should have Occasion to Labour. Neither do we now Debate, whether <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> had a particular Relation to the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (which may be granted while he abode there) but whether he had a fixed Relation to it, so as he had not afterward to other Churches whereto the Apostle sent him: or whether he was Related to it as an Itinerant <hi>Evangelist,</hi> or as as an ordinary and fixed Bishop.</p>
               <p>§ 14. He argueth also <hi>p.</hi> 109. that <hi>his Power was not temporary or transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but successive and perpetual, and derived to others in solidum, as he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it himself:</hi> and this he proveth, because <hi>he is injoyned to commit it to faithful Men who should be able to Teach others also.</hi> Here is still a Mistake of the Question; which is not about the Perpetuity of <hi>Timothy's</hi> Power; which I believe he had wherever the Apostle sent him about the Work of the Gospel: but the Question is about the Perpetuity of his Abode at, and Pastoral Relation to <hi>Ephesus:</hi> which is not proved by his Power of Ordaining Ministers. He demandeth <hi>p.</hi> 109, 110. somethings to be granted to him: some of which I freely yield. 1. That <hi>this Power of Timothies was lawful.</hi> 2. That <hi>he exercised it at Ephesus; viz.</hi> for a time. 3. That <hi>it was committed to him alone, and not to a Colledge of Presbyters.</hi> This I yield so far, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had a Vicarious Apostolick Power, that was superior to that of the Presbytery: but it is no Consequence, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> had such a Power at <hi>Ephesus</hi> for a time, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Presbytery was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62347:59"/>
not ordinary Rulers of that Church. I proved §. 7. That the Apostle setled a Colledge of Presbyters for the ordinary Government of that Church, and that from <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. 4. That <hi>there is no mention of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to which Timothy was accountable for his Administrations.</hi> The first part of this I deny: the grounds are mentioned in the place cited. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, it is like there was no such Colledge at <hi>Ephesus</hi> then; for <hi>Timothy</hi> is Directed about Chusing and Ordaining them: 1 <hi>Tim 3. 1 &amp;c.</hi> The second part I freely yield, that <hi>Timothy</hi> could not be accountable to any Colledge of Presbyters, nor to any Man, except the Apostle who sent him: but this maketh nothing for such Exemptions to a Bishop; unless he could prove, each of them that they have a Personal Mission from an Apostle, or immediatly from Christ. 5. That <hi>the great Branches of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Power was lodged in Timothy's Person:</hi> this I yield, understanding it of that Power that Bishops pretend to. 6. That <hi>this Authority was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in it self temporary, transient, or extraordinary; but such as the necessities of the Church do make necessary in all Ages.</hi> This also, <hi>sano sensu,</hi> I yield: it must always be lodged somewhere: but that there must be a single Person en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with such Power, I know no lasting necessity for that. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his Question <hi>p. 110. Why do they say, that in the discharging of an ordinary Trust, there is need of an extraordinary Officer. A.</hi> We say an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officer was needful at first, till ordinary Men were by him Authorized, and Impowered to propagate this Trust; but that being done, we plead for no such need; but Debate against it. Against <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy's</hi> Episcopal Relation to <hi>Ephesus</hi> further Arguments may be brought; from the Apostles putting the Government of that Church in the hands of Elders, <hi>acts</hi> 20. 28. 28. which must be after they were setled by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> and that in his presence, he being then with the Apostle. Also, from the Apostles declaring to these Elders all the Council of God, Acts 20. 27. and yet he told them nothing of so important a point, as of the chief Pastor whom they must obey: a point that our Brethren lay so much stress on, as that they make the Beeing of Ministers and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to hang on the Succession of Bishops. From the Apostles not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Timothy</hi> when he writeth to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> From his telling them that they should see his Face no more, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 25. and yet not a word of leaving <hi>Timothy</hi> to take care of them, but laying it on the Elders, but I shall not enlarge on these.</p>
               <p>§ 15. He alledgeth, with the same Confidence, and as little Strength of Argument, that <hi>the same power was committed by Paul to Titus, in Crete.</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62347:59"/>
And here <hi>p.</hi> 111. he maketh a very faint Attempt against our Plea, that <hi>Titus</hi> (we say the same of <hi>Timothy)</hi> was an Evangelist: which he very discretly, <hi>more suo,</hi> calleth <hi>a ridiculous Subterfuge.</hi> I shall examine what here he bringeth to back this Confidence; and then shew that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titu</hi> were Evangelists. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Saith he, <hi>It is no where said in Scripture, that he was one of them who were called Evangelists. A.</hi> He should have described to us them who in Scripture are called Evangelists: The word is divers ways used in Holy Write: neither do we argue from the Name, that either he, or <hi>Timothy</hi> (to whom this Name is expresly applyed, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5.) were Evangelists: but we argue from their Work and Circumstances, together with the mention that is made of such an Office being in the Church, in the beginning of Christianity. There are others beside them, whom we can prove to have been Evangelists, who, may be, get not that Name expresly given them in the Scripture. Next he argueth, <hi>the Work of an Evangelist hath nothing in its nature opposit to, or inconsistent with the Dignity and Character of either Bishop, Presbyter, or Deacon.</hi> What if all this were yielded? what gaineth he by it? <hi>Titus</hi> being an Evangelist might do all the Work that our Adversaries ascribe to him; tho he were no Bishop, and tho his being a Bishop were not inconsistent with being an Evangelist; what we design is, that doing such Work doth not prove him to have been a Bishop; seing he was an Evangelist; who hath all that power that <hi>Titus</hi> is said to have. Beside, <hi>Saravia</hi> (who hath said more for Episcopacy than this Author hath) <hi>de Ministr. Evang. grad. C. p.</hi> Saith <hi>nam quemadmodum major Apostoli authoritas fuit quam Evangelistae, &amp; Prophetae &amp; Evangelistae major quam Episcopi vel Presbyteri, ita Titi &amp; Timothei, qui Presbyteri &amp; Episcopi erant, major fuit authoritas quam Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terorum quos oppidatim Apostolica authoritate crearant.</hi> He maketh Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists to be a higher degree than the Bishops; if then <hi>Titus</hi> was an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, is it imaginable that he was afterward degraded to be a Bishop? Do we ever read that an Apostle was turned to an Evangelist; or a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to a Presbyter; or he to a Deacon: unless some of these were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded for some fault. Wherefore if <hi>Titus</hi> had the Character of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist, it is not like he was setled at <hi>Crete</hi> as an ordinary Bishop. Further he describeth an Evangelist; out of <hi>Euseb. lib. 3. C. 37. hist. Eccles.</hi> That <hi>he is a person that preached the Gospel to such as had not before heard of it; at least were not converted by it. Eusebius</hi> is not by him fairly cited, <hi>C.</hi> 33. (not 37.) he is giving account of such as builded the Churches planted by the Apostles (as his own words bear; therefore they did
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62347:60"/>
not only preach to them who had not heard the Gospel) he saith <hi>they fulfilled the Work of Evangelists, that is</hi> (saith he) <hi>they preach Christ to them who as yet heard not of the Doctrine of Faith; and published earnestly the Doctrine of the Holy Gospel.</hi> Which sheweth that <hi>Eusebius</hi> calleth them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists, whom the Apostles imployed to Water their Plantations (as <hi>Apollo</hi> did after <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 6.) also whom they sent to preach to the Unconverted; or any way to preach the Gospel. His <hi>at last</hi> is his own addition to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> not the words of that Historian. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> hath said nothing that can exclude <hi>Titus</hi> from being an Evangelist. I do not deny that any ordained Minister may preach the Gospel to Infidels, and on that account be called an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist, in a large sense; as may also every on that preaches the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: but we now speak of an Evangelist in the more restricted sense, as it signifieth a Church Officer whom Christ had set in his Church, distinguished from Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, <hi>&amp;c. Eph.</hi> 4. 11. That it is no where insinuated that <hi>Titus</hi> was such an Evangelist, he alledged <hi>p.</hi> 111. but we prove from the Work he was imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that it is more than insinuated. He proveth that one may do the Work of an Evangelist who is much higher than an Evangelist (which is a Truth, but very impertinent to his purpose) because <hi>Daniel did the Work of the King; who was no King but much lower than a King: a very wise Consequence indeed;</hi> That <hi>Philip the Evangelist had no power to confirm, or ordain, he affirmeth, p.</hi> 112. which is both false; he had power to ordain when any of the Apostles sent him about that Work: and <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had it not otherwise. (For the power of Confirmation, we know none had it: there being no such Ordinance, in our Authors sense, in the Apostolick Church) It is also wide from this purpose, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles might send the Evangelists clothed with what power they thought fit to impart to them. <hi>Paul</hi> might send <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders, and <hi>Philip</hi> might be sent elsewhere, on another Errand; and yet both be Evangelists. That most of the Primitive Bishops were Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, is true, in the large sense, as before: but not in the strick sense: neither is this to our present purpose: for he saith nothing unless he can also make it appear that all the Evangelists, in the Primitive Times, were Bishops. But what followeth is wholly false: that <hi>any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop or Presbyter, who now adays converteth any Jew or Pagan, are as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evangelists as any of them who were so called in the Primitive Times.</hi> If it were so, every such Minister should be a Church Officer of a distinct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

doth particularly call Evangelists, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. as so distinguished.</p>
               <p>§ 16. That we may more fully and distinctly take off what our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries pretend to bring for <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> being Bishops; and not Evangelists; I shal shew what is the true Notion of an Evangelist; whence it will appear plainly, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were such: and that there is no ground from what is said of them in Scripture to think, that they were ordinary Officers in the Church, or Diocesan Bishops. I deny not that the word Evangelist is sometimes taken for any Preacher of the Gospel, who bringeth the good News of Salvation to Mens Ears. Yet it is often taken <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for, 1. One who wrote the History of the Life and Death of Christ; and that by the infallible Guidence of the Spirit; and so <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are called Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists. 2. For an extraordinary Officer who was imployed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles for planting Churches, and propagating the Gospel. That there was such an Officer distinct from all others, both extraordinary, or temporary, and ordinary, or permanent, is evident from that place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. Our work is then to enquire what is the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Character of this Church Officer, from all others. Also that some are called Evangelists peculiarly, and by way of Distinction from other Officers of the Church, as <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 21. 8. Of whom <hi>Grotius in locum,</hi> saith, <hi>qui cum olim de numero Diaconorum fuisset, factus est Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3: 17. Let us then see what Light we can get in this matter from Scripture, or from Antiquity, or by the help of later Writers. The Scripture not only giveth us account (as hath been said) that there was such an Officer in the Church; but that some were sent hither and thither by the Apostles, and that about such a Work as could not be done but by Apostolick Authority; as is evident in <hi>Timothy</hi> (as is shewed §. 12.) and <hi>Titus;</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> made his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in his Travels, <hi>Gal:</hi> 2. Whose Journeys and Imployments the Reader may satisfie himself about, from <hi>Smectym:</hi> §: 3: <hi>p:</hi> 38. (That I may shun the pains of Transcribing) <hi>Tichycus, Softhenes, Luke, &amp;c.</hi> several of them are mentioned by <hi>Euseb: hist: lib: 3: C:</hi> 33. It is evident that these Men can be Ranked into no other Class of Church Officers, neither ordinary nor extraordinary. Wherefore they must be Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists: and from the account that we have of them, we must gather what was the Power, the Work, and the Characteristick Note, of an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62347:61"/>
that <hi>he was an extraordinary Officer in the Church, needful for the first planting and setling of the Churches, who was imployed by the Apostles, and by them authorized to do what ever work, or exerce what Acts of Power, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves, who imployed them, might have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 17. For what account of them is to be found among the Ancients, it is to the same purpose: they make them no fixed Officer, but itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. They ascribe to them Apostolick Power; and make them subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat to, and delegated by the Apostles; for this see <hi>Euseb: hist: lib:</hi> 3: C: 33: (or as some editions have it 37:) who telleth us of some who <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>—3ly, Evangelists who went about every where preaching the Gospel, as Priscilla and Aquila.</hi> Later Divines, both of the Episcopal and Presbyterian side, tread in the same steps. <hi>Grotius</hi> not only is clearly for this Notion of Evangelist, on <hi>Acts</hi> 2: 8: above cited; but on 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4: 5: he calleth them, <hi>adjutores Apostolorum; quae</hi> (saith he) <hi>magna sane dignitas, Scultet: &amp; Piscat: in 2 Tim. 4. Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stae proprie dicti erant, tempore Apostolorum, qui itinerum eorundam &amp; labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum socii erant, qui ad diversas missi sunt Ecclesias, ut fundamenta jacerent, quales Philippus, Sylvanus, &amp; alii. Estius in Eph.</hi> 4. 11. saith, <hi>they were praediti singulari dono Evangelium predicandi. Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Hamond</hi> on the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62347:61"/>
same Text, they were <hi>adjutores, vel comites Apostolorum.</hi> From all this it may be concluded, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Evangelists in the strict sense of that word: and considering the nature of their Office, and their Travels mentioned in the Scripture, they were not fixed to any particular Charge: and consequently were not Bishops, in the sense that we use that word. If my Adversary will prove them to be Bishops, he must bring Arguments to prove their Office to have been ordinary and permanent in the Church; and that they were fixed in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Pastoral Relation, each to some Flock: which is no ways done by what he hath yet said.</p>
               <p>§ 18. I now proceed with my Antagonist, who <hi>p.</hi> 112. bringeth a new Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>James the Just was Bishop of Jerusalem,</hi> and he saith, <hi>it is not material to his design, whether he was one of the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, or not:</hi> One would think that this is more to his purpose than he is aware of: for he is proving the Succession of Bishops to the Apostles, and if <hi>James</hi> was an Apostle, this instance can never prove such Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But I pass this. I think he was one of the twelve, because he is so called, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 19. and 2. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh there of the Apostles in the strickest sense; for he cannot mean he had seen no Preacher of the Gospel at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> save <hi>Peter,</hi> and that he speaketh of that <hi>James,</hi> who abode at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when the rest of the Apostles left it, is not to be doubted. That <hi>James</hi> stayed at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and did not travel as the rest of the Apostles, I have acknowledged, §. 4. and there have given account how it came to pass. That he had all the Power that our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren give to their Diocesan, we deny not: The Apostolate included that, and more. That he might be called a Bishop, and was sometimes so stiled, we may easily grant: for that word is sometimes used general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for all Church Rulers, and not only Apostles, but their, and our great <hi>Master</hi> is so called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. But none of these Concessions, nor all of them in Conjunction, will prove that <hi>James</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in the sense of the word that is now current; that is, that he was an ordinary Ruler of the Church, inferior to an Apostle, and an Evangelist, whose Jurisdiction was limited to one District, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all the World. Let us now hear his Proofs for <hi>James's</hi> Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy at <hi>Jerusalem. 1. It is uniformly attested by the most ancient Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, particularly, Clem. Alexandr. and Hegesippus.</hi> I can easily yield him a great many more Witnesses; and persons of more Credit than <hi>Hege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus,</hi> and of more Antiquity than <hi>Clem. Alexandr.</hi> tho I will not yield,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62347:62"/>
that all his Adversaries grant it, in his sense. <hi>Salmasius</hi> (whom he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) saith nothing, but that <hi>he abode at Jerusalem.</hi> The Answer to this Argument is easie, the Ancients called <hi>James</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (as they also called some other Apostles who abode not so long in one place) because of his Apostolical Authority which he there exercised; which included in it all that Authority that any of the Ancients (or Moderns either) ascribe to a Bishop: and usually they began their Catalogues of Succession with some Apostle, or Apostolick Man: as <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> tho it is certain he did not reside there: and it is a Question whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was there. And indeed it was usual with the Ancients to speak of things long before their time, in the Dialect that was current among themselves. His Argument from this Denomination is naught, unless he can make it appear, that <hi>James</hi> had his Authority, not from his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolate; but by his being ordained a Bishop. I wonder to find that such a Learned Man as <hi>Downam</hi> asserteth that <hi>James,</hi> before his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination as Bishop, had Authority as an Apostle; but had no Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over that particular place; but was a Pastor <hi>sine titulo:</hi> for this strange fancie will infer, that <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the Apostles never had Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction any where; seing they were no where ordained Bishops: nor doth the Scripture give account of any such Ordination of <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 19. We have further Argument from <hi>p. 113. Peter when he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of Prison commands that these things be made known to James, Acts 12. 17. Where</hi> (saith he very wisely) <hi>the deference paid to Saint James is visible: and taken notice of elsewhere frequently, as Gal: 1: 19: and</hi> 2. 1, 9. Truly the Papists have many Arguments that have a fairer shew than this hath for its Conclusion, for <hi>Peters Supremacy.</hi> I wonder that a Man pretending to Learning, is not ashamed of such an Argument. Was not all this respect due to <hi>James</hi> as an Apostle; how then doth it prove him to have been a Bishop: is there any thing that looketh like Jurisdiction (which yet we deny not to <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem)</hi> cannot Men be civil to a Person so eminent for Grace, Gifts, and his Character, but they must make him a Diocesan Bishop? but the strongest Argument is yet behind: <hi>Act. 15. He pronounceth the Sentence by his Episcopal Authority. A.</hi> He might far rather do it by his Apostolick Authority: but there was no need of either of them; he did it as being chosen Moderator of that Meeting: and that he exercised no Episcopal Authority in this Case, is evident; for the rest of the Apostles were present, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2, 4, 6, 22. And it was never heard of (but among Papists) that one Apostle had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62347:62"/>
over another, or over all the rest: much less that a Bishop should have Authority over Apostles. I am afraid this Author unawares doth so stretch the Episcopal Authority, that he will make it break, and be contemptible. He telleth us, <hi>Calvin holdeth all that he saith, on Gal:</hi> 2: 9: in saying that <hi>James was preferred to Peter, because he was Hierosolymitanae Ecclesiae praefectus.</hi> He disingenuously leaveth out <hi>Calvins, fortassis;</hi> which sheweth that he was not positive in that matter. But I shall positively yield him what <hi>Calvin</hi> doth but doubtingly, and let him make his best of it. Let it be granted that <hi>James</hi> was chosen Praeses of that Meeting, because of his Residence at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and being the chief Governour of that Church where the Meeting was held, (not as Bishop but as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) this can prove no Preference to any of the Apostles; Presiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in such a case doth not infer a Superiority of Power. It rather shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Apostles did not there act in their Apostolick Capacity, but in a Parity with the other Elders; with whom they are always joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Chapter, when spoken of. Our Author now making a Transition to another Head of Arguments, cannot go out of his Road, in concluding with insolent Contempt of his Adversaries. <hi>I do not</hi> (saith he) <hi>now insist on these imaginary and superficial Exceptions that are made by our Adversaries.</hi> If they were such, they were well suted to some of the Arguments he hath last used.</p>
               <p>§ 20. Another Argument he beginneth, <hi>p.</hi> 114. and prosecuteth it in some Pages following, is taken from the <hi>seven Angels of the seven Asiatick Churches;</hi> by whom he understandeth <hi>the Bishops of these Churches:</hi> if they were so, the Consequence is, <hi>that Bishops were setled in the Churches by the Apostles: and that these Churches were not by Divine Right ruled by a Colledge of Presbyters.</hi> This Argument hath been much tossed; and in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, urged with more Strength, by others of his Party, than he giveth to it. For clearing the Truth in this Matter, I shall give my Opinion, and lay down the Grounds of it; and then Examine what he saith in Enforcing and Vindicating this his Argument. I find three Opinions among the Presbyterians about these <hi>Angels.</hi> The first is, that by <hi>Angel</hi> is meant the Collective Body of the Church; for this our Author citeth <hi>Salmasius, Walo. Messal. p. 184. Ambrosius Ausbertus,</hi> is also cited by <hi>Smectym:</hi> and <hi>Aretas Caesariensis</hi> by <hi>Turret.</hi> his Words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also <hi>Ticonius</hi> was of this Opinion, as is said by <hi>August. de Doct. Christian. lib. 3. c.</hi> 30. And it is certain, that not only all the Members of the Churches were concerned in what is written in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62347:63"/>
these Epistles; but <hi>John</hi> was commanded to write them to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 11. And in the Conclusion of every Epistle, all the Church Members are excited to hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches, and not to the Ministers only, which yet doth not prove that by <hi>Angel</hi> is meant the Church: their Concernments in these times were entrusted to the <hi>Angel;</hi> not that they were the <hi>Angel.</hi> Another Opinion is that of <hi>Beza, Reynolds,</hi> and others; who take <hi>Angel</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for a single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but maintain, that not a Diocesan Bishop is to be understood, but the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Moderator of the Presbytery, by whom the Epistle was to be communicated to the rest of the Pastors, and by them to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and indeed it is certain, that the Word may be so taken; and if we should yield this to our Brethren, it cutteth the Nerves of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, unless they can prove; that these single persons had Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the rest of the Pastors of these Churches. Which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do from the Epistles themselves; for all the Reproofs and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations may be intended for the Colledge of Presbyters, tho addressed to them by the Praeses. Nor can the Direction of the Epistle to a single person prove what they intend: there is nothing more ordinary than to address a Community by the Praeses of their Meeting: if a Letter be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Moderator of a Presbytery for the use of the Presbytery, doth this Entitle him to Episcopal Jurisdiction? The third Opinion (to which I most incline) is, that <hi>Angel</hi> is here to be taken <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Collectively,</hi> for the Colledge of Presbyters; so that to the <hi>Angel</hi> is (in our Phrase) to the Moderator and remanent Brethren. In the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the old Translation of the Bible (which expresseth the sense of the old Church of <hi>England,</hi> in this matter) they are called Ministers So it was understood by <hi>Aretas, Primasius, Ambrose: Gregory</hi> the Great <hi>Beda, Haymo;</hi> and many others, saith <hi>Owen of Ordination,</hi> C. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>§ 21. I shall first prove that it may be so taken: next, that it mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

consisting of Priests and People, is called <hi>a Beast, the Whore:</hi> So an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Number is put for a great Multitude; the Enemies of the Church are called <hi>four Horns,</hi> and her Deliverers <hi>four Carpenters, Zech.</hi> 1. 18, 20. The Directions given to Judges are often in the singular number, <hi>thou shalt do so</hi> and so: hundreds of Instances of this nature may be given Whence it is easie to conclude, that there is no Absurdity, nor is any Violence done to the Text, if by <hi>Angel</hi> we understand the Rulers of the Church, or the Colledge of Presbyters. My next work is to prove that <hi>Angel</hi> must be so understood, for which I bring these Arguments, 1. The Lord here useth a Title that doth not signifie Rule, or Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but Gods Messenger to the People: as also, <hi>Rev</hi> 1. 16, 20. These <hi>Angels</hi> are called <hi>Stars,</hi> which importeth their Teaching, or holding forth Light to the People; both which are common to the Presbyters: seing then he doth not use a word of Authority, whereby the Bishop is pretended to be distinguished from the Presbyters; but of Embassy, and giving Light; whereby the Presbyters are distinguished from the people; this word cannot be taken for a Ruling Bishop, but for Teaching Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. It were a strange thing, if our Lord designing to single out one person from all the rest of the Church, would design him by that which is common to him with many others, and not by that which is peculiar to himself. It doth also strengthen this Argument, that both in the Old and New Testament, they whom God sent to his People to reveal his Mind to them, are called <hi>Angels, Jud. 2. 1. Hag. 1. 13. Mal. 2. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 10. Yea the <hi>Legions of Angels</hi> who are imployed to Encamp about the People of God for their Safety, are called the <hi>Angel of the Lord, Psal:</hi> 34: 7.</p>
               <p>§ 22. Argument 2. It is not without a Mystery, that <hi>Rev:</hi> 1: 20: our Saviour in opening the Mystery of the Vision, speaketh twice of the seven Churches; but shunneth calling the <hi>Angels</hi> seven: he saith not, the seven Stars are <hi>the seven Angels of the Churches;</hi> but <hi>the Angels of the seven Churches:</hi> as by the <hi>seven Spirits, Rev:</hi> 1: 4: and 3: 1: is meant the Spirit of God, sufficient for the needs of all the seven Churches; so here, the <hi>Angels of the seven Churches</hi> must be the Pastors whom the Lord hath provided for the use of his Churches; tho they were not one only for every Church, but more. Argument 3. It is manifest from <hi>Acts</hi> 20: 28: (and I have evinced it § 3. of <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.) that there were more Presbyters, or Bishops at <hi>Ephesus</hi> than one: If then Christ wrote to the Rulers of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> under the Title of <hi>Angel,</hi> he could not mean a single
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62347:64"/>
person. It cannot be denyed, that they who are called Overseers of the Church of <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20: 28: are they whom Christ here calleth <hi>Angel:</hi> the same thing is expressed in the one Place in a more plain Stile, in the other in a more Obscure and Mystical Stile. Argument 4. Our Brethren will not deny, that there were more Church Officers imployed in Teaching each of the Churches than one Bishop. Now these must either be comprehended under the <hi>Candlestick,</hi> or under the <hi>Star:</hi> they cannot be a part of the <hi>Candlestick;</hi> for they give Light, as the <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> doth not, but by the <hi>Candlestick</hi> is meant the People to whom the Light shineth: they must then be comprehended under the <hi>Star,</hi> and consequently under the <hi>Angel;</hi> whence it followeth that the <hi>Angel</hi> is a Plurality of Persons. So that we may conclude, that as by <hi>Candlestick</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> understood the Collective Body of People, so by <hi>Star,</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood a Body of Church Officers, and not a single Bishop. Argument 5. Many things are said in these Epistles, which cannot be Expounded with respect to a single person: as at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the <hi>Angels forsaking his first Love</hi> is threatned with <hi>removing the Candlestick:</hi> that is, Unchurching that People: can we think that such a fearful Judgment could be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the Sin of one Bishop, if the rest of the Elders and People were free: and this we must say, unless we acknowledge that the <hi>Angel</hi> to whom the Epistle is Directed is not a single person, but a Community. The same may be said of several other Churches; would the Lord <hi>spu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> out</hi> all the Presbyters and People of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> for the Hypocrisie of one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. Argument 6. There are several Passages in these Epistles wherein a Plurality is expressed; as that which is meant by <hi>Angel,</hi> to whom the Epistle is addressed: as <hi>the Devil shall cast some of you into Prison:</hi> can that be Expounded, some of thee Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> or some of your Pastors, and People? and <hi>unto you I say,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and the rest in Thyatira:</hi> is not there a plain Intimation of a Plurality, under the Name of the <hi>Angel?</hi> by <hi>the rest in Thyatira</hi> must needs be understood them who are distinct from the <hi>Angel,</hi> and the <hi>Angel</hi> must be who ever is distinct from these who are called <hi>the rest?</hi> and yet beside <hi>the rest,</hi> there is a Plurality, <hi>you.</hi> My An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist hath an Answer to this Passage, such as it is; which I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, when I come to Examine his Vindication of his Argument. <hi>Smectym. Sect.</hi> 13. out of <hi>Fox, Meditation on the Revelation</hi> (which I have not seen) citeth <hi>August. Ep. 132. Sic enim</hi> (saith he) <hi>in Apocalypsi legimus, Angelus, &amp;c.

               <p>§ 23. I shall now examine what my Adversary bringeth, offensively, or defensively, for his Opinion about these <hi>Angels,</hi> 1. He falleth on <hi>Walo Messalinus,</hi> who <hi>p.</hi> 184. interpreteth <hi>Angel,</hi> by <hi>Church:</hi> calling <hi>V. G.</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, the Church of Ephesus;</hi> and he giveth the reason, because the Christians in each of these Towns were <hi>purior &amp; sanctior pars urbis, atque adeo magis spiritualis;</hi> therefore that part was compared to an <hi>Angel.</hi> Tho I do not owne this Notion of the Learned <hi>Salmasius,</hi> yet I judge our Authors calling it a <hi>silly Subterfuge,</hi> and his ridiculing of it, to be pretty ridiculous: he maketh the meaning be, <hi>the seven Stars are the Angels of the seven Churches, that is, the Churches of the seven Churches.</hi> By his favour, it hath no such sense <hi>(Salmasius</hi> can hardly be Taxed with Nonsense, even by Men of more Critical Skill than this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is) it should be thus Paraphrased, the seven Angels are the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the seven Towns: and it is evident, that according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Learned Writer, the <hi>Angels</hi> are not distinguished from the Churches, but from the Towns wherein they were. Also, when the Epistle is addressed to the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the meaning is not, to the Church of the Church of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> but to the Church which is at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> even as the <hi>Virgin Daughter of Israel,</hi> is not the Nation of the Nation of <hi>Israel;</hi> but that Nation which is called <hi>Israel.</hi> Mystical Expressions must not be strained by Critical Wits: some Atheists, by this method, have endeavoured to draw Nonsense out of the most Profound, and Instructive Parts of Scripture. Our Author hath not dealt very fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Salmasius,</hi> in this matter; for he understandeth by <hi>Angel,</hi> the Church Guides <hi>signanter,</hi> and also the whole Church; his words are, <hi>per Ecclesiam</hi> (having said that <hi>Angelus</hi> was <hi>Ecclesia) non tantum Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum ordinem intellexit Joannes, sed universum in quaque civitate fidelem popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, ut mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62347:65"/>
cannot be called a Company, a Multitude, or a Colledge of <hi>Angels;</hi> but one single <hi>Angel</hi> praesiding in their Ecclesiastical Meetings.

Here is an odd Consequence, there is an Apostrophe used to a single person, in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle expresly Directed to a Community, and that in plain and proper Language, <hi>Ergo,</hi> when in a Mystical Speech an Epistle is Directed in the singular Number, in a borrowed Term, we may not understand a Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tho when the Writer of the Epistle speaketh more properly, he speak expresly to a Plurality. What tho the Conclusion of the <hi>second Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> had been to a Plurality; doth it thence follow, that a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Word in the singular Number, may not be Plurally taken? the contrary would seem to follow more natively. But he is guilty of a double Mistake here, one is, that the Conclusion of that Epistle is to all the Faithful; the last words are, <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit; grace be with you</hi> Where he is mentioned expresly as the Person to whom the Epistle is Directed: and the People of God with him are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred also expresly: it is not alike, when the Word is used in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of an Epistle, which, tho singular, is capable of a plural Sense; and in the Epistle a Plurality is expresly spoken to. His next Fancy is most groundless, that the Bishops of the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches are called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in Imitation of the <hi>High Priest,</hi> who was Dignified with that Name: and for this he citeth <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. at the 7. <hi>v.</hi> For tho we should grant that <gap reason="foreign">

Further, it is a bad Consequence, the <hi>High Priest</hi> was called an <hi>Angel,</hi> and the Church Rulers are called <hi>Angels, Ergo,</hi> every one of them had the same Jurisdiction that hehad: this is a loose way

That this Hypocrisie was the Fault of the People as well as of the Angel, may be gathered from <hi>v.</hi> 4. where <hi>a few,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>a few,</hi> in that Church, are excepted from that blame.

For what sense could it make, I will make all the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> to know that I search the Reins and Hearts; but to you, the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> and to the rest in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> I say: these of <hi>Thyatira</hi> were a part of the Churches of <hi>Asia;</hi> how then can they be called <hi>the rest,</hi> as distinguished from them. Beside, he had been speaking of the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> in the third person: It were then strange, if with the same breath he should speak to them in the second person. I insist not on his calling <hi>Beza's</hi> sense of the <hi>Angel,</hi> that a Praeses is meant, <hi>ridiculous, and contrary to the sense of all Antiquity;</hi> such Confidence and Contempt are the Flowers of his Rhetorick. Neither doth <hi>Beza</hi> speak of <hi>a Weekly, or Monethly Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,</hi> but pleadeth against his being perpetual: which this Author should have opposed with Reason, or Scripture, not with Taunts. We make no Argument of the seven <hi>Angels</hi> not being called Bishops: his refuting of it is idle work. That <hi>Polycarp</hi> was then Bishop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> (as he saith <hi>p.</hi> 118.) is no more certain than that <hi>Timothy</hi> was then Bishop of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi> and if the Good that is said of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> sute to the one History, the Ill that is said of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> will as ill agree to the other.

               <p>§ 26. He hath now fallen on an easie way to determine the whole Question, <hi>p.</hi> 118. It is pity it came not sooner, that all this Labour might have been saved. But it may be this Birth also may miscarry. <hi>Parturiunt montes,</hi>—the Question seemeth to me to be in the same State, and his Opinion to labour under the same Difficulties, as before this Invention was hatched. His easie way lieth in three Enquiries. <hi>Whether the Ancients affirmed that the Apostolical Power was derived to the Bishops as their Successors. 2. Whether they insist frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this Succession of single Persons to the Apostles in Particular Sees, when they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62347:66"/>
reason against Hereticks. 3. Whether we may not with Safety and Confidence lean on their Authority, and Tradition, in an Affair of this Consequence?</hi> If ye will give our Enquirer leave to Dictat magisterially the Answers to these three Questions, our whole Debate will soon, but not soundly, be at an end: but if we contest every one of them (in his sense) with him, we cannot so soon conclude this Dispute as he imagineth: For his first Enquiry, it must not be made, nor the matter determined so indistinctly as he doth. It is not denyed that Bishops succeeded to the Apostles; but the Question is, whether these Bishops had the same Jurisdiction over Presbyters and People, that the Apostles had? The Ancients some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with the Scripture, called all Presbyters Bishops; sometimes, by a Custom that early crept into the Church, they restricted that Name to the Praeses in the Meeting of Presbyters: and the Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Praeses had the Apostolick Power in his single person, or it was diffused equally among the Members of that Colledge in which he did praeside? This being premised as the state of this Question about Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Apostles; I hold, that all that Apostolick Power that was needful for the Churches once planted, and must be continued to the end, was communicated, not to the Praeses alone, but also to the rest of the Presbyters: and that all of them were the Apostles Successors, in that respect: he is for the contrary Opinion.</p>
               <p>§ 27. Let us now hear his Reasons, Two things he brings for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or what else I do not well know. One is, <hi>It is evident that the Ancients affirmed that the Apostolical Power was derived to the Bishops as their Successors, from the Catalogue of Bishops in the Apostolick Sees, by the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Records of the Church.</hi> This is no dreadful Argument: for, 1. Among all the Sees he mentioneth (I need not transcribe them) there is not one in which an <hi>Apostle</hi> was said to sit, but that of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> the rest indeed were excellent Men who first praesided in these Churches: but not <hi>Apostles;</hi> and therefore their Sees can no more be called Apostolick, than that of <hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>York, &amp;c.</hi> whose Bishops this Author recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be the Apostles Successors, tho not so immediatly as those men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. 2. These Catalogues that he mentioneth, were not so early made as he would insinuat: they do indeed begin with early things, and guess at what past in, or near, the Apostles Times: but we do not find that such Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ion of the Succession of Bishops was made for near three hundred years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er Christ; except some little account by <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> and these that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nt, are so perplext, and do so disagree with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62347:67"/>
that nothing can be concluded from them, with any certainty: particularly in the Succession at <hi>Rome,</hi> there is no certainty that <hi>Peter</hi> was there, nor who were after him; the same might be shewed of others of them. 3. No more can be proved from these Catalogues, but that in the first Ages of the Church, there were such men who Ruled and Taught these Churches, whom after Ages called Bishops: but the Catalogues neither tell us what Power they had; nor whether they ruled these Churches alone, or in Parity with the rest of the Presbyters. As <hi>Gers-Bucer</hi> expresseth it, <hi>p. 423. Non queritur an Episcopi continua successione us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad Nicenum Concilium Ecclesias gubernaverint, sed quales Episcopi suerunt; &amp; quid imperii aut potestatis in Ecclesiam aut Presbyterium habuerunt.</hi> That one only is mentioned is no proof of sole power: for, 1. That is not always done, <hi>Irenaeus lib. 3. C.</hi> 3. beginneth the Succession at <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. In their Catalogues they mentioned the Eldest, or the Praeses of their Meeting, or the Man of most Fame for Grace or Gifts. For their Design was not to number all the Pastors of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but to shew a Succession of Pastors, and of sound Doctrine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we find such Records of Succession in all Churches, but in some that were of most Note.</p>
               <p>§ 28. His second Enquiry and Observation, <hi>p.</hi> 119. is, <hi>In what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the Ancients spake of Bishops, who are said to have succeeded to the Apostles:</hi> where he bringeth a number of Citations litle to the purpose in hand. His first is <hi>Irenaeus: Et habemus annumerare eos qui ab Apostolis instituti sunt Episcopi in Ecclesiis, &amp; successores eorum usque ad nos, qui nihil tale docuerunt, neque cognoverunt, quale ab his deliratur.</hi> What can be hence inferred, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that there were Sound and Orthodox Men, whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calleth Bishops, from the Apostles time: which is not to our Question. That <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> Reasons from this against the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> is not probative of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors point: what he addeth out of <hi>Irenaeus, Quos (Episcopi) &amp; successoru relinquebant, suum ipsorum locum Magisterii tradentes;</hi> is not concludent: for, 1. This is not spoken of a single Bishop in one place; but of all the Pastors of the Churches: whom we maintain to have been a Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 2. Or this <hi>Magisterium</hi> may well be understood of their Teaching Authority; for that was to his purpose; that they whom the Apostles Authorized to Teach the Church, Taught not the Doctrine of the <hi>Valentinians.</hi> For what he saith that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> carefully distinguishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bishops and Presbyters, he hath cited no place for it: and if he had, it importeth no more, but that special notice was taken of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62347:67"/>
Praeses, beyond the rest of the Presbyters: it can never prove sole, nor superior Jurisdiction. Another Citation out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (that <hi>I</hi> may not transcribe all the words) is no more, but that <hi>Apostoli illis tradiderunt Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesias:</hi> which we deny not: seing it may be understood of all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and indeed <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith the same of Presbyters, <hi>lib. 4. C.</hi> 43. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Author will have it understood of Bishops, because of their Age: on the contrary, <hi>I</hi> plead, that it should be understaod of Presbyters by Office? because Preaching Power was committed to them, and not to Bishops only: and it is of that he is speaking; as that by which the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> and other Heresies were condemned. Another Testimony out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> we must obey them <hi>qui successionem habent ab Apostolis—qui cum Episcopatus successione Charisma veritatis certum, secundum placitum Dei ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceperunt. I</hi> see nothing to prove that all this may not be applyed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Presbyter, or Pastor of the Church; nor is there any Shadow of Ground for his Inference, <hi>viz. Ye see here, that the Episcopal and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dignity are one and the same, in the Language of Irenaeus.</hi> None can see this, unless the Eyes of his mind be Tinctured with prejudice. For 1. <hi>Episcopatus successio</hi> is competent to all Presbyters, in our Opinion: which he should refute, not suppose it to be false. 2. Here is not the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Dignity mentioned by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> but a part of it, to wit <hi>Charisma ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis certum;</hi> which <hi>I</hi> think he will not say is peculiar to Diocesans: the Church would be ill served, if they only had the Gift of Preaching the Truth: seing they cannot preach to all their People: and in our days seldom preach to any of them. He bringeth another wonderful Argument, which he speaks of as what may supersede his insisting on what he is discoursing: <hi>the Prophesy</hi> (saith he) <hi>which threatned that the Bishoprick possessed by a notorious Malefactor should be given to another, was lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fulfilled when Matthias was advanced to the Apostolate, in the Room of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das. I</hi> am so slow as that <hi>I</hi> cannot perceive what he aimeth at by this, unless he would infer, <hi>Matthias</hi> succeeded to <hi>Judas, Ergo,</hi> the Bishops, and they alone, succeed to the Apostles: which is much more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than what he a litle before he charged <hi>Beza</hi> with. If he lay stress on the word <hi>Bishoprick,</hi> it is <hi>captio ab homonymia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 29. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is the next Father whom he adduceth, as a Witness that the Bishops succeed to the Apostles. All that he bringeth from the Writings of that Learned Father, and Holy Martyr, I have lately An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, in a Debate on this Subject, with <hi>I. S.</hi> I am not willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat: yet I shall point at Answers to what he citeth. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62347:68"/>
                  <hi>Apostolos, id est, Episcopos &amp; Praepositos, Dominus elegit.</hi> His Objection hath its own Answer; <hi>Cyprian</hi> distinguisheth between <hi>Episcopos &amp; Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positos:</hi> the President Bishop and the Presbyter; and he calleth them both Apostles; because they succeeded to the Apostles. I hope he will not make <hi>Praepositos</hi> to be Exegetick of <hi>Apostolos,</hi> least he make <hi>Cyprians</hi> sense to be, <hi>Apostolos, i. e. Episcopos, i. e. Praepositos.</hi> Another Citation, <hi>quod enim non periculum metuere debemus de offensa Domini, quando aliqui de Presbyterie, nec Evangelii, nec loci sui memores, neque futurum Dei judicium, neque nunc sibi Praepositum Episcopum cogitantes, quod nunquam omnino sub Antecessoribus nostris factum est, totum sibi vendicant.</hi> This may seem plausible to such as know not the occasion of these words; which was: while <hi>Cyprian</hi> was retired from <hi>Carthage,</hi> because of the Persecution, some of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, without the rest, took on them to absolve some of the Lapsed: this <hi>Cyprian</hi> complaineth of, as justly he might; yea, he had cause to complain, that their Bishop (that is, constant Moderator of their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery) was neglected in this matter; for that cause should have been determined in <hi>consessu Presbyterorum;</hi> which should have been called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him; as <hi>Praepositus illis,</hi> that is, by their Choice, made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Praeses of their Meeting: There is no proof here of a solitude of Power: nor of <hi>Cyprians</hi> Succession to the Apostles (which is the thing that our Author citeth it for) more than the rest of the Presbyters did. The special notice that is here taken of his being neglected, proceeded from the Genius of that Age, wherein perpetual Presidency had set the Bishop a little higher in Dignity above the Presbyters, than they had been from the beginning. Another Citation (which also misseth the mark, <hi>viz.</hi> Succession to the Apostles) is, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>Ecclesia super Episcopos constituitur, &amp; omnis actus Ecclesiae per eosdem gubernatur;</hi> and saith, this is <hi>Divina lege fundatum.</hi> All this may be understood of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Bishops, that is, all the Presbyters: and if ye will take it of the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prianick</hi> Bishop, that is, the Praeses, we assent to it as truth; provided we understand not these Bishops in their single Capacity, but in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with their Presbyters: the Church is set on all Pastors who teach sound Doctrine, with respect to her Soundness in the Faith, and Edification in Holiness: on the Presbytery, or ruling part, (among whom, in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, the Praeses, or Bishop, was specially taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, tho he did not rule by himself) with respect to her good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and that all this is <hi>Juris Divini,</hi> I no way doubt. If our Author can make out sole Jurisdiction from these words, he must bring better
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62347:68"/>
Arguments than I have yet seen. Again, <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, the Bishops suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Apostles <hi>vicaria ordinatione.</hi> This is also granted, and may be understood of all Pastors of the Church; and we deny it not of the <hi>praesides Presbyteriorum,</hi> who were peculiarly called Bishops: they succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Apostles as Ministers of the Gospel; but that they either had the Plenitude of Apostolick Power, or that their Presidency, as a distinct Office, or superior Degree, was by Succession from the Apostles, we deny; and it is not proved from <hi>Cyprians</hi> words. Their ruling power they have, with the rest, by Divine, or Apostolick Institution: that there be a Presidency, is of the Law of Nature; and hath Scripture exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the person who should preside, is to be chosen by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; nor do we find any warrant from Scripture, either that he should have power superior to the rest, or that this Presidency should always be in one person. He bringeth also <hi>Tertullian,</hi> saying, <hi>percurre Ecclesias Apostolicas, apud quas ipsae adhuc Cathedrae Episcoporum suis locis praesident: habes Corinthum, habes Ephesum, habes Romam.</hi> This Testimony impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no more than that there continueth in the Churches, planted by the Apostles, a Government to this day. <hi>Gathedrae</hi> cannot be strained to signifie a Bishop with sole Jurisdiction: the Notion of that word is sufficiently Answered by a Judicature in the Church, where one presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: which we say should be in every Church. He is so consident of his Conclusion, that he desireth us <hi>to read</hi> Cyprian <hi>himself</hi> (we do it, Sir, and think not fit to take all on Trust that is cited out of him by your Party) and he thinketh <hi>the Disingenuity of</hi> Blondel, <hi>and his Associats will appear to the highest Degree.</hi> I desire, on the other hand, that he would read him with an Unbyassed Mind, and then all this Airy Confidence will evanish. That he asserteth, <hi>p.</hi> 123. that <hi>the Authority of Bishops over Presbyters, Deacons, and Laity, will appear to them who read Cyprian,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, except in the sense that I yielded in the Book above pointed at: they have joynt power with the rest of the Consistory over one another, and over the whole Church.</p>
               <p>§ 30. I proceed with him <hi>p.</hi> 123. to his second Enquiry: <hi>Whether the Ancients insisted frequently on this Succession of single Persons to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in particular Sees, in their Reasoning against Hereticks.</hi> I acknowledge that they frequently Reasoned from the Doctrine that had been taught by persons succeeding to the Apostles in particular Churches: and that they named particular Men, or single Persons in that Succession: but that they laid any weight on their being single Persons whom they so
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62347:69"/>
named; or that they lookt on these as the only Successors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in these Churches, we deny; and have not yet seen it proved. It is the same thing, as to the Strength of their Reasoning, whether one Minister, or more, had the Power of Governing these Churches. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we should yield him all that he is here enquiring for, it doth not advantage his Cause, nor hurt ours; unless it be made appear that the single persons so named, were the sole, or supreme Rulers in these Churches: which I am well assured is not proved by any of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that he bringeth. His first Citation is out of <hi>Tertull.</hi> whose Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is plainly this, that the Hereticks could not shew the beginning of their Churches, as the Orthodox could do, from persons placed then by the Apostles; as <hi>Polycarp</hi> was by <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and others in other places: and he addeth, <hi>perinde utique &amp; caeterae exhibent, quos ab Apostoli in Episcopatum constitutos Apostolici seminis traduces habeant.</hi> Here is no one word of Singularity of Power: and it is certain, that <hi>the Apostolici Seed of sound Doctrine</hi> might be transmitted to Posterity by a Plurality of Presbyters, as well as by single Bishops: yea, and better too; for if one erred, the rest might correct him; but if the Bishop erred, there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Another Testimony of <hi>Tertull.</hi> he bringeth, <hi>Ordo tamen Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum ad originem recensus in Joannem stabit authorem.</hi> There is nothing here but what hath been already Answered: there was an Order, or Succession of Bishops, whereof <hi>John</hi> the Apostle was the Appointer of the first of them: but he doth not tell us of their sole Jurisdiction. He argueth <hi>p.</hi> 126. that <hi>if the imaginable Interval of Parity had been known, after the Apostles, and the Succession of single Bishops interrupted, this Argument had been weak, and the Hereticks might have insulted. A.</hi> I deny that either he, or the Hereticks could have any such advantage: because the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did not argue from the Singularity of the Persons succeeding one to another, they had no occasion to consider that, in this Debate; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62347:69"/>
than to instance in one person so succeeding in a Church, where there were more: it was enough to confound the Hereticks, that such Doctrine was constantly taught since the Apostles days, and they could tell them by whom. What followeth <hi>p.</hi> 126, 127. is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the same thing: about which I shall trouble him no more, let him tell it over again as oft as he will. He needed not tell us <hi>p.</hi> 128. that <hi>the Successions of single Persons Governing particular Churches, and their Jurisdiction and Preheminence, is acknowledged by some of the Gallican Church;</hi> we know there are Worthy Men in that Church; but we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought them all infallible.</p>
               <p>§ 31. His third Enquiry is, <hi>Whether we may safely lean on the Authority of the Ancients, in an Affair of this Consequence?</hi> he saith, <hi>no doubt we may; and ought.</hi> I affirm that this matter may admit both of further Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of some Doubting: and that it is blind Confidence to be so positive, without clearing the State of the Question. And there is the more need of distinguishing in this Case, because our Author seemeth, in pursuing this his Enquiry, to confound two different Questions: one is, whether we may lean to the Accounts they give of the Succession of Bishops since the Apostles days? Another is, about the Antiquity of Episcopal Government, as he wordeth it, <hi>p.</hi> 131. It is one thing to owne a Succession of Teachers in a Church, whome some Men will call Bishops; another to owne that the Government of the Church was managed by them alone. I shall here propose and apply five Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. The Ancients and their Writings are to be distinguished. Some of them lived in, or near to the Apostolick times: others of them some Ages after: the Credibility of the former, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> is far greater than that of the later: Because they had better <hi>causam scientiae;</hi> and because, tho Tradition, without Writing, may, at first, and under the best advantages, soon, and easily be corrupted; yet by length of time, and passing through many hands, it is more apt to be depraved; and that even without design. For the Writings ascribed to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, some of them are Spurious, and only bear the Names of Famous Men. Others of them are corrupted, and interpolated; tho they were really done by them whose Names they bear: others of them are Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious; so that it is <hi>sub judice,</hi> whether they be credible Testimonies, or not. A second Distinction is, of the things about which we debate: our Author indeed doth distinguish, in the Progress of the Debate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Matters of Fact, and Matters of Opinion, or Principle:</hi> of which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62347:70"/>
I distinguish things on which our Faith, or our Duty doth depend; from these things that we are not so concerned in, being mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Historical Passages, or Debates about Natural or Politick Things; in Matters of Fact of the later sort, we are to believe the Fathers as credible Historians; and regard them (at least some of them) as Men of Learning; yet so as not to believe their Histories, nor receive their Conclusions against Sense and Reason: for the former sort of things, I look on their Testimony as insufficient, to perswade the Mind, or clear the Conscience: Scripture, not the Fathers, must be the Rule of our Faith, and Religious Practice. Distinction third, These things that we Debate about, are either determined in Scripture, or not: if not, much regard is to be had to thess Holy and Learned Men; who had much of the Mind of God in many things: yet, as was said before, we must not blindly follow them, over the Belly of Sense or Reason. If they be, Scripture light must be our Guide, not the Opinion of the Fathers. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction fourth, The Testimony of the Fathers is either Unanimous, or they are Divided: in the later case, we cannot follow them; but must examine which of their Opinions is best founded. In the former, their Testimony may occasion a great prejudice, and may readily byass the Mind; yet it should not determine us against Scripture Light, they all being fallible Men. Distinction fifth, The Opinions of the Fathers are either clearly delivered, or we must guess at them, from dark Hints. As the one sort can no way command our Faith: so neither the other is to be received implicitly.</p>
               <p>§ 32. Out of these Distinctions, this State of the present Question resulteth, whether the Testimonies of the Fathers be a sufficient ground on which we may determine, whether Episcopacy or Parity be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church that Christ hath instituted. My Antagonist is for the Affirmative, I am for the negative: for which I give these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, 1. We have no concurrent, nor unanimous Testimony of the Fathers on either side; for all the noise that is made of the Universality and Perpetuity of this Tradition, and Unanimity about it. If they can prove what they confidently affirm in this point, we shall quit this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Many of the Fathers have said nothing on this head: few of them have have written on it directly, and of purpose; and what they have said, is but indirectly, without considering the State of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie; which I am perswaded, was not brought into Debate in the Primitive Times: many of the Excellent Men of the first Ages have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62347:70"/>
written nothing: many of the Writings of that time are perished: there are different Opinions in this Debate among them, whose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings we have; which arose from the Change of the Practice that had been in the Apostolick Age: whence then should we have this Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they talk of? for this last (the rest are certain enough) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to what hath already been said in this Disputation. 2. What most of the Fathers say on this head, is obscure, and hard to be understood: their Expressions being suted to the Customs and Dialect of that time, which was plain enough to them who then lived; but not so to us, who know not their Idioms, nor the Customs that they relate to, as then known things: they also used words in a far different sense than we do: As <hi>Merit, Pennance, Bishop,</hi> and such like. It is sometimes far easier to clear the Point in Debate from Scripture, and Reason, than to clear the Expressions of some of the Fathers about it. 3. The Uncertainty that we are at about the Genuine, and Spurious; the Pure and Corrupted Writings of the Fathers, make their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unsafe to be the solitary ground of our Faith, or Practice, even in this matter. Who knoweth not what Debates are among Learned Men on this Head? and how Conjectural all the Knowledge is that can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the most diligent Search? And surely it is no Wisdom to build our Opinion in a Matter of Religion, wherein we either please God, or sin against him, on such a Sandy Foundation: Of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus</hi> who flourished about <hi>an.</hi> 130. and is said to be <hi>Sextus a Petro,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Antiochia, lib. 3. ad Autolycum,</hi> near the beginning: he is shewing the Certainty of what Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; compared with the Stories about the Heathen Gods, and hath these words, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. 33. Our fifth Argument we take from the Fathers disowning each himself, and all others, beside the Prophets and Apostles, from having sufficient Authority to determine in the Controversies of Religion; not exempting that about Church Government. This our Writers have made so evident against the Papists, that it is a wonder that Protestants should use such a Plea. And indeed the Papists get much advantage by this Conduct: for the same Arguments that our Author, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, use in this Debate, they improve in the other Controversies; and with the same advantage. For if the Scripture be not sufficient Light to us in this, I see not how it can be thought perfect in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Debates: if unwritten Traditions be found necessary in the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62347:71"/>
one case, it will be hard to lay the same aside in some others. I have adduced some Testimonies of Fathers to this purpose, <hi>Preface to</hi> Cyprianick <hi>Bishop Examined:</hi> to which I shall now add, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. lib. 2. contr Manichae.</hi> of the Scriptures he saith, 161. <hi>Si quid velut absurdum noverit non licet dicere, author hujus libri non tenuit veritatem; sed aut codex mendosus est, aut interpres erravit, aut tu non intelligis.

               <p>§ 34. For further Confirmation of this Truth, I shall transcribe a few heads of Arguments, out of a <hi>Manuscript</hi> written by a Learned Divine of this Church; Entituled, <hi>Some Propositions collected out of the Writings of Divines about Church Government:</hi> because few can have access to read the Manuscript it self: He proveth, 1. That the Testimony of the ancient Historians is not in every thing, and particularly in that point of the Hierarchy, probably true, because, 1. Even E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Writers of the best Note, deny their Testimony to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally true: <hi>Sutliv. de Pontiff. lib. 2. C. 11. p. 148.

Many of these old Histories are lost, as that of <hi>Egesippus,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth: others are vitiated, some carelesly written, as <hi>Socrates</hi> testifieth of <hi>Eusebius's</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, <hi>lib. 1.

That <hi>he took more care to praise the Emperor, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the Acts of that time.</hi> Also several things are in <hi>Eusebius</hi> which he did not write, for he citeth <hi>Sozomen, lib. 3.

The Testimonies of the Ancients in this are not harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He further proveth. 2. That these Testimonies cannot found a Theological Conclusion: For, 1. They are no part of the Canon of Scripture, on which ground Protestants reject Testimonies from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha. 2. Their Writings contain some things that neither Party assenteth to. 3. Their Sayings were not probative in their own time, <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither in ours; seing we and they have the same ground of Faith. 4. A Theologick Conclusion must be built not on Topick, or uncertain grounds: <hi>Reynold Colla.</hi> with <hi>Hart, C. 6. Praeter authores sacros nullus Historicus certus esse potest, i. e.

               <p>§ 35. Let us now hear what he bringeth for this his Opinion; where in he is so positive and confident: one might here expect strong Reasons; but behold, <hi>pro auro paleas.</hi> He telleth us, <hi>p. 128, 129. The Apostolical Churches had their own Fasti, in which were recorded the Succession of their Bishops, and the Names of the Martyrs: and that there are many Apostolical Monuments beside: in which Egesippus, &amp;c. could not be mistaken. A. 1. Euseb.</hi> was of a contrary Opinion: he could find none of these <hi>Fasti:</hi> but was forced to <hi>go in an untroden Path,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> shewed §. 31. 2. He should have given some evidence for this confident Assertion: for we know not where to find these <hi>Fasti,</hi> without his Direction. <hi>I</hi> deny not that in some after Ages they began to keep Records in Churches; but that in the Apostolick and next succeeding Age, they had them, we find not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and these are times of which we, with <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and others, complain of, as to the Uncertainty and Defectiveness of History. 3. The Memory of the Martyrs was early Recorded: we do not find that the Succession of Bishops was so. 4. Suppose the Records of both had been early and exactly kept, this can give no Light in the present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, unless they had Recorded what Jurisdiction they whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bishops did exercise: which he doth not so much as alledge out of

                     </gap>i.</hi> 5. It is confessed by all, that <hi>Hegesippus</hi> was a very Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Author, and took many things on Trust, which he neither found in the <hi>Fasti,</hi> nor any Apostolical Monuments. For <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertull,</hi> they say nothing for his Cause but what we are ready to contest with him; even supposing their Authority to be as great as he will make it. For <hi>Clement,</hi> he is mistaken about him, as <hi>I</hi> shewed before, out of <hi>Scalliger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 36. Next he advanceth a Distinction (and ingeminateth it) of <hi>Theorems and Matters Fact:</hi> he confesseth, <hi>in the former that the Ancients might mistake; but not in the latter:</hi> that <hi>it is impossible that they should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and they would not impose upon Posterity; seing such things were obvious to the Knowledge and Observation of the meanest Christians: we must not think that they Lied in these, or Conspired to propagate a Lie to Posterity: for they were Men of such Sanctity, defended the Truth with their Blood, many of them had miraculous Gifts; they were Unanimous in delivering this their Testimony.</hi> A few Considerations will easily dissipate this Mist, 1. He supposeth the Unanimity of the Ancients bearing Testimony to Episcopacy being the way setled by the Apostles: which is utterly denyed: he taketh it also for granted, that that was universally practised in, and since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Age, till of late: which is also said without all ground; if he will prove either of these, we shall insist no more on either Arguments, or Defences from Antiquity. If he will take it for certain, and despise all that we bring out of the Fathers, and all our Exceptions to what he and his Party bring; we must leave it to the Judicious Reader to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as he seeth cause. 2. He doth most unreasonably suppose, that, if we think the Testimonies of the Fathers was insufficient to determine us in that matter, that therefore <hi>we impute Lieing to them;</hi> or that they designed to impose upon Posterity. For one may mistake, and misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present a History, and yet not lie, or design to deceive others: because he speaketh as he thinketh; the Error is in his Understanding, not in his Will. Doth this Author think that <hi>Jerom</hi> told a Lie, or designed to impose on others in that wherein he imputeth Error to him, as is above said; <hi>I</hi> suppose he will not owne such Thoughts of that Holy and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Person: wherefore it is most absurd to impute to us that we count some of the Fathers, yea, or all of them, Liars, because we think they might err, even in Matter of Fact: It is well known that Matters of Fact are frequently misapprehended, and thence misrepresented, even by them who would be loath to tell a Lie: if this were so; <hi>I</hi> could prove him, and some others of his Party, to be notable Liars; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

will be far from asserting: is there not much false History of things done in the time when they are reported or written; much more it may be so at great distance of time, when Reports pass through many hands, <hi>viresque acquirunt eundo.</hi> Wherefore the Sanctity, Zeal for Truth, and other Excellencies of the Fathers are no ways impeached by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as insufficient to be the Rule of our Faith, or Practice, in the things that concern Religion. 3. For the Miraculous Gifts of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, about whose Testimony we now Debate, I think he will find it hard to prove them. I deny not that some extraordinary Gifts did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church some time after the Apostles, but can this Author tell us who had them, or that the Fathers who have left Writings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them were so Gifted? Beside, their Gifts, if they had such as he alledgeth, could not prove what he intendeth, unless he could make it appear that they had such infallible assistance as the Apostles had: which I think he will not attempt to prove.</p>
               <p>§ 37. I fourthly observe on this part of his Discourse, that his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is wholly impertinent to this purpose; and that the Fathers were capable to be deceived in this Matter of Fact, no less than some Theorems, or Matter of Principle: because, 1. This matter doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it a <hi>Principle,</hi> or <hi>Theorem, viz.</hi> That Episcopacy was instituted by the Apostles: now this might arise from misinterpreting some Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Apostolick Writings: if they say the Church was governed by Bishops in the Apostles time, which is Matter of Fact: they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so say it was appointed by the Apostles, which is Matter of <hi>Jus</hi> or a <hi>Theological Theorem:</hi> and this must depend on their understanding some Passages of Scripture, as holding forth that Truth. For Example, <hi>I left thee in Crete, unto the Angel of Ephesus,</hi> and such like: now they might misunderstand some other Scriptures as is confessed; why not these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. None of the Fathers is so positive as to say that he saw a Bishop exercising sole Jurisdiction in the Apostles time: wherefore their Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Factum</hi> (if any such there be) must have been built on their Misapprehensions of the <hi>Jus:</hi> and if they be not infallible in the one, they could not be so in the other. 2. This <hi>Factum,</hi> that Bishops alone governed the Church, and not Presbyters with them, (for that is our Question) and that in, and next after the Apostles times, must come to all, or at least to most of the Fathers by Tradition: for none of them could see the Practice of the Church in all these Ages, about which we dispute: but Tradition is very lyable to lead People into Error, as every
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62347:74"/>
one knoweth: if the Fathers might mistake about what is written in the Scripture, as is confessed, how much more might they err in that which they have but by Tradition; which their Fathers have told them, and which is not so Recorded in Scripture, but that they might misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it? 3. Whereas our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 130. ascribeth Fallibility to the Fathers in Doctrines and <hi>Theorems,</hi> because <hi>these might depend on their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinative and Intellectual Faculties, and they had no Priviledge against Error of that Nature:</hi> may not the same be said of this Matter of Fact that we now debate about? the Management of Church Government is such a thing as a Man cannot understand, nor rightly apprehend merely by Sense, and without the use of Ratiocination. How can we understand what is the Power and Jurisdiction of one Man over others, without inferring it from the Acts we see him do, with respect to them? I find my Antagonist often out in his Reasoning in this very thing. He rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of a Bishop set in a higher Seat than the Presbyters; Church Acts spoken of as done by him, without mentioning the Presbyters: he findeth in Catalogues of Successions in Churches one mentioned and no more; and such like: here his <hi>Intellectual and Ratiocinative Faculty</hi> inferreth, that one Bishop ruled these Churches, and the rest of the Presbyters had no hand in the Government, further than advising: here is ill Logick, and false Reasoning: and in that he will not say that he is infallible. It cannot then be denyed, but that the Fathers behoved thus to reason from what they saw and heard: if then they might err in the use of their <hi>Intellectual and Ratiocinative Faculty,</hi> what should hinder but that they might err in this matter: which maketh his Distinction wholly void. He saith, <hi>p. 131. We must either receive this Historical Truth, or say that no Age, or no Society of Men in any Age, can transmit the Knowledge of any Matter of Fact to the next Generation. A.</hi> 1. It is not absurd to say, that no Humane History about Matters of Fact can so transmit what was done in former Ages, as to be a sufficient Foundation for our Faith or Practice, in any part of Religion, without, or contrary to Scripture; tho it may give ground for a Historical Certainty in things that are not of that Concernment. To apply this, we maintain that Episcopacy is beside, and contrary to the Scripture (and if he will beat us out of that Hold, we shall yield him the Fathers) wherefore, if all the Fathers in one Voice, and that plainly and positively, would say (which yet they have never done) that Episcopacy is of Divine Right, we are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to believe it, because we know they may err, and the Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62347:74"/>
err. 2. The Consequence is naught. There are Matters of Fact that are purely such; that Men see, or hear; and cannot mistake about them, if their Sense be sound, and other Requisits to right Sensation be not wanting: these may be so transmitted by Humane History, to Posterity, that we need not fear to be deceived about them; but have a Moral Certainty: but it doth not hence follow, that such Matters of Fact, as must be known, not only by Sensation, but Conjoyned Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, can be so transmitted to Posterity, by mere Humane Testimony, as that we are obliged on that Testimony alone, to build an Opinion, or engage in a Practice, that Religion is so nearly concerned in, as it is in the Matter under Debate. The Ordinances that we owne, must have surer ground than is necessary for many Historical Truths, that we do not, nor ought to Question.</p>
               <p>§ 38. He affirmeth, <hi>p.</hi> 131, 132. that <hi>Episcopacy was from the beginning, by Divine Authority, a Copy of the Jewish AEconomy, transmitted from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to single Successors, perpetually to be preserved in all Ages:</hi> that <hi>it was uniformly setled by the Apostles in all Churches.</hi> All this he hath said over and over again: but hath not proved one word of it. Neither is any thing here said to our present purpose, unless he prove that the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Fathers alone, is a sufficient ground for us to believe all this: for that is the present Debate. He saith, <hi>nothing is answered to all this, but that they</hi> (the Presbyterians) <hi>say the Ancients were Erroneous in several things.</hi> And is that nothing? I have shewed that they were no more under infallible Conduct in this, than in other things. That <hi>they who transmitted to us the Knowledge of the Polity setled by the Apostles, were sufficiently acquainted with the Apostolical Constitutions, and that these Customs and Constitutions were not only preserved in the Ecclesiastical Records, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to their Eyes in the dayly Practice of the Church:</hi> this he affirmeth, <hi>p.</hi> 133. I suppose to prove that the Testimony of the Fathers alone is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for our Faith, that Episcopacy is <hi>Juris Divini.</hi> Most of this is already Answered, being but a Repetition of what he hath said before. I further <hi>A.</hi> 1. These Fathers were acquainted with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Constitutions by their Writings (for he will not say that they were Eye Witnesses to Apostolick Practices; tho it is alledged that one of them saw <hi>John</hi> the Apostle; that will not prove such acquaintance with his, or other Apostles way) we have their Writings, as well as they had; and seing it is confessed, that they were not infallible in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Expounding Scripture, it is reasonable that we should
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62347:75"/>
see with our own Eyes, and not with theirs, and we should not implicitly believe the Fathers in telling us that the Apostles meant so and so in their Writings. 2. We think the Apostolick Constitutions are best preserved, and most purely, yea infallibly, in the Apostolick Writings, these are the Ecclesiastical Records that we lay more weight on than the <hi>Fasti</hi> of the Churches that he saith, were in the after Ages. 3. That the dayly practice of the Church did convey to the Eyes of the Fathers the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Apostles, we utterly deny: for Practice and Institution are two different things: for the one is not always a good commentary on the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in the Apostles times, the <hi>Mystery of iniquity</hi> began to work, Practice began to vary from Institution: and in the very thing we now speak of, there were Efforts to carry Practice beyond the Rule; when <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, affected to be <hi>primus Presbyter:</hi> and we may rationally think, that this Ferment did (when the Apostles were gone off the Stage) gather strength among Men who were not so hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor mortified as they should have been. Practice doth often dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from Principles (as we see in dayly Experience) and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this very thing might deceive some of these Holy Men, and make them judge a miss of the Apostolick Constitution; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make their Sentiments no safe Rule for our Guidence in this Matter. Beside all this, we cannot yield that the Practice of the Church was such as our Author fancieth, in the times of the first of the Fathers: or, that they do so represent the Practice of the Church as he imagineth. He insinuateth another Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 134. That <hi>the Fathers found the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of single Successors in all the Apostolical Churches, governing Ecclesiastical Affairs, and this Succession not asserted as a thing that was then opposed, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supposed;</hi> and inferreth, that <hi>a Tradition so stated, and conveyed, is as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and Infallible as any thing of that Nature can be. A.</hi> That the Fathers found this, or that they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>erted it, is denyed: what he else where bringeth for proof of this is answered. Again, if the Fathers had found this, they had erred: we maintain that they were Men capable to mistake, and to find what was not to be found. Further, it is not probative, that the Fathers did not find this way opposed, but supposed: both because the Degeneracy from the Apostolick Constitution that there was in the Primitive Church came in insensibly; it wrought as a <hi>Mystery,</hi> unobser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 7. (I do not understand that Scripture exclusively of other things, but inclusively of this) and were as the <hi>Tares, when Men Sleep.</hi> Also because, if there were Opposition made, it might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62347:75"/>
and not transmitted to Posterity, by the Influence of the Party which had the Ascendent. Yet for all this; we deny that the Fathers of the first Ages had that Jurisdiction of Bishops that he talketh of to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or that it was in their days.</p>
               <p>§ 39. What followeth, <hi>p.</hi> 134, 135, 136. seemeth to be designed as a <hi>Herculean</hi> Argument: it is brought from <hi>the dangerous Consequence they run upon, who derogate from the Authority of this Traditional Conveyance, in a Matter of Fact: for by the same reason, we must question the most Sacred things in our Religion.</hi> And for an Instance of this, he sheweth that <hi>the Canon of the Scripture was not universally received before the Death of the Apostles, but some Books questioned, these Books were received upon Search made by the Church, and finding that they were agreeable to the Apostolick Standard; and that the Original Conveyance of such Books was supported by the Testimony of Apostolical Persons, or Holy Men who Conversed with such. If we receive some Books of Scripture on the Testimony of the Ancients, how dare we dispute their Fidelity in a Matter of Fact, relating to the Polity of the Church? So that, on the whole Matter, either we must receive their Testimonies in this, or we must question the Authority of some Books now received into the Canon: for it may be objected against this last Tradition, that it was so opposed by Men of great Name, but the other was always universally received:</hi> I have heard that A. M. D. D. hath been jealoused as inclining to Popery, tho his Accusers failed in their Probation: he here (and in some other Passages of this Book) seemeth to prove what they could not make out. This <hi>Medium Stapleton,</hi> and many others of the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctors, use, to prove that the Church, not the Scripture, is the Ground of our Faith, because without the Church we cannot know which Books of Scripture are Genuine, and which are Spurious: just as this Author telleth us, we cannot know this but on the accurate Search made by the Church; upon which Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny some books are received into the Canon which at first were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. I advise him to read <hi>Whitaker</hi> against <hi>Stapleton;</hi> especially his <hi>Duplicatio: lib. 2. C.</hi> 26. where this Controversie is solidly handled, as it is also in many other Protestant Writers. It is observable that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Prelacy must be defended by the same Arguments: and that this Author hath no better Evidence for, nor firmer Faith of the Divinity of the Scriptures, than he hath of Episcopacy: that his Faith in both is built on the Authority of the Church. I mention the Divinity of the Scriptures, because the whole of it is made up of its Parts, the several Books; and if our Belief, that this Book is a part of the Canon, <hi>Ex Gr.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62347:76"/>
Ruth;</hi> be built on the Churches Authority, so it must be with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book, and another, and so of them all. I must here then digress a litle from defending Presbytery to the Defence of Protestantism, against this my Antagonist. Let me not here be mistaken, as thinking that our Certainty of the Christian Doctrine in general, were no greater than that we have about this or that Book of Scripture being Canonical: We have sufficient, though not equal Certainty of both: Or as holding that the Authentickness of the several Books of Scripture were alike evident: some of them bear more manifest Marks of Divinity, or Motives of Credibility, than others do: And yet in them all, there is what may satisfie us, that they are from God. Or thirdly, As of Opinion that the Testimonies of the Christians of the first Ages are of no use, not Conducive to our Certainty in this Matter: I owne with <hi>Chemnit. exam. Concil. Trident. pt. 1. p.</hi> 86. That as <hi>Scriptura habet authoritatem principaliter, a spiritu sancto; deinde a Scriptoribus,</hi> so, <hi>postea a Primitiva Ecclesia tanquam teste.</hi> No doubt the Concurrent and Harmonious Testimony of the first Ages is a strong Plea: but we rest not on that Ground alone: for if we did, our Faith should be resolved into the Authority of fallible Man: Yea, we should reject some of these Books, which we now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as Canonical; which were for some time questioned: we affirm then against this Author, that the Books of Scripture were not received by the Church, upon the Testimony of Men singly: Which he either must mean, or his Argument is not to the purpose. I argue then against him out of his own words; the Church having made an <hi>accurate Search</hi> into the Doctrine of these Books, and finding it was agreeable to the Apostolick Standard, and that the Original Conveyance of such Books was supported by the Testimony of Apostolick Persons, or other Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here himself doth not make the Testimony of the Fathers a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of our receiving these Books: but what the Church found in them by Searching: So that indeed he overturneth the Sufficiency of the Foundation that he would have us build on, by laying another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side it. If he will let us see Episcopacy to be suteable to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Standard, we shall embrace it; but cannot owne it without that, tho all the Fathers in one Voice, should plead for it. Again, the Church after her Scrutiny; and these Apostolick and Holy Men who bare Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to the Conveyance of these Books, either had some ground for owning them as Divine, or none; but because they thought so, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I hope he will not say: if he say the former, we shall receive these
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62347:76"/>
Books, not on their sole Authority; but on these Grounds that they went upon. If he say the present Church received them from the Church of former Ages, he must needs sist somewhere, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Whatever Person or Church he sist in, the Argument recurreth with respect to them. Further, if we receive the Books of Scripture because of the Testimony of the Church, our Faith, both of their being from God, and of the Truths contained in them, must be resolved ultimately into the Veracity of fallible Men; and not into the Veracity and Authority of the Infallible God: unless he will make the Church infallible, as his Complices in this Opinion do: and even that will not help him, seing this Infallibility cannot be proved. And if it could, I ask whether these infallible Persons, who, after the Apostles, searched what Books were Authentick, had the Knowledge of this by Means, or by Revelation? the latter the Papists do not pretend; the former will serve us, using the same Means for this Knowledge. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ask, whether they who conveyed these Books to us could be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or not? The latter he will not assert, for he hath told us they may be deceived about <hi>Theorems,</hi> and that such a Book is Canonical, is such: if they could be deceived, it is not fit for us to build our Faith of a thing of so high Concernment on their Opinion. I conclude, that the Books of Scripture are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and our Faith that they are Gods Word is built, not on the Testimony of the Church; but on the Veracity of God who speaketh: and we know that God speaketh in them, from the Motives of Credibility that the Scripture it self affordeth; of which our Writers against the Papists bring not a few. If he can give as good ground for Episcopacy as we can give for the Books of Scripture being the Word of God, we shall receive the one as well as the other.</p>
               <p>§ 40. His next Work, which beginneth <hi>p.</hi> 136. is to <hi>consider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of the Learned Presbyterians in this controversie: which yield some Propositions that not only shake, but quite overturn the whole Fabrick of the new Doctrine.</hi> It is well that there are some Learned Men among them: he sometimes speaketh of them, without Exception or Discrimination, in another Strain: and even here, what he giveth with the one hand, he taketh away with the other: for it is no great Evidence of Learning for to overturn the whole of what one taketh pains to build. I, in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of this Contest with him, must enter my Protestation, that I will not owne any Proposition, tho advanced by the Learnedest of the Presbyterians, that hath <hi>a mischievous Tendency:</hi> and if any such Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

What he next citeth, out of the same Author, <hi>p.</hi> 17. is so far from his purpose, that it sheweth litle Skill, or Consideration at least, that he mentioneth it: <hi>Salmasius</hi> saith <hi>the Apostles sometimes called themselves Bishops and Presbyters, that they might put the Honour on them to whom they committed the care of the Churches, to seem to be equal to them.</hi> May not this be meant of Presbyters, as well as Bishops, that the Apostles so honoured them. For our Argument from the Confusion of Names of Bishop, and Presbyter, which he thinks is here overturned: the Reader, before he come this length, will see this Cavill to be groundless; if he consider how we manage that Argument. He citeth him also saying, that <hi>the Ancients called Timothy Bishop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and Apostle.</hi> I have above shewed in what sense both these are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, without any Inconveniency to our Cause, see <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. § 3. It is as litle to his purpose, that he further citeth from <hi>Salmasius,</hi> that he saith <hi>James, whom the Ancients say was ordained Bishop of Jerusalem, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the lesser Bishops, as now one Bishop is over many Presbyters.</hi> He was over the Bishops that is Presbyters, in the Quality of an Apostle: that the Ancients called him a Bishop, I have shewed how that is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, in the place last cited. He is at him again, in his <hi>p.</hi> 181. of <hi>Wal. Messal.</hi> that he confesseth <hi>the Form of Government was changed after the Death of Peter, and Paul, tho not soon after; yet in the end of the first Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and beginning of the second.</hi> If <hi>Salmasius</hi> mean (as I am confident he doth) that a Change unto perpetual a Praesidency, and Majority of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Notice, did then begin to creep in, I confess the same: let our Author make his best advantage of it: if he think that Bishops were then set up with sole or superior Jurisdiction, I dissent from him: tho even this would not overturn our Cause, which is built on Scripture, not on the Opinion or Practice of the Ancients that were after the Apostles.</p>

§ 41. He next, <hi>p.</hi> 138. brings some concessions of <hi>Blondel, apol. p.</hi> 3. that <hi>Episcopacy of one over many Presbyters did not prevail before the year,</hi> 140, This is a foul misrepresentation: <hi>Blondel</hi> is there speaking of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, in which one said, <hi>I am of Paul, &amp;c.</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> that this could not be proved to be before the year 140. Now it is probable that Episcopacy, as the supposed remedy, was not presently applied on the first appearance of the Malady: but that other means were used. <hi>Blondel</hi> saith, <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 76. that <hi>in great Cities, where were many Thousands of Christians, they had but one Church;</hi> this saith our Author, <hi>could not be without a Bishop over them.</hi> Which I deny: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie is ordinary at this day: all the Congregations may be under one Presbyterie, and their Moderator; which in that place he calleth <hi>unicum concessum.</hi> in some places many Meetings are counted one Parochial Church; which I cannot so well understand. Yet neither way over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth Presbyterie; nor doth necessarily infer Episcopacy. He next Citeth <hi>Bocharti Phaleg.</hi> which is a Mistake; the Words are in his Epistle to <hi>Dr. Morley P. mihi</hi> 34. nor are his Words fully Cited: he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assenteth to <hi>Jerome, Apostolorum aetate inter Episcopos &amp; Presbyteros nihil fuisse discriminis; &amp; communi Presbyterorum Concilio Ecclesias fuisse administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas:</hi> then follow the Words Cited by the <hi>Enquirer,</hi> asserting the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Episcopacie.

§. 42. I Answer then 1. This his Supposition we will never yield, unless we see more reason for it than yet hath been proposed: we deny that the Authors he hath cited have made such concessions as he supposeth: and if any of them have, let him answer the Absurditie that followeth on it, we are not concerned, we cau yeild no further than, the Apostles, having settled the Government of the Churches in paritie among Presbyter, and Nature having made a reses necessarie in their Meetings; soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (the remains of the History of these Ages causeth that we cannot t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We can easily give a rational dilineation of such a Change, as was indeed made from the Apostolick constitution, and practice of the first times. We do not ascribe it to a <hi>general Council,</hi> nor to <hi>a Conspiracie of all the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their scattered and Persecuted State,</hi> to make that Change. Nor do we derogate from the <hi>Holyness</hi> and <hi>faithfulness</hi> of the first Pastors of the Church who were settled by the Apostles: let him please himself with all he saith to prove the Absurditie of thinking that a Change could be wrought that way. But 1. We are persuaded that a great Change there was, by compareing the Practice, and some Canons of <hi>Cent.</hi> 5, 6, 7. &amp;c. with the Apostolick Writings. 2. We think there is no impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in such a Change as I have acknowledged: considering the corruption of Men, yea the sinful infirmities of good Men; some of whom may be apt to Usurp; and others to overlook evils that are not easily observable in their Progress.

This Change did not come suddenly, nor all at once, and therefore was not so obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to everie ones Observation: that it was not complained of by any
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62347:78"/>
we cannot say; not having the compleat and distinct Records of the first Ages: farre less can it be affirmed that it was not observed by some who might Lament it in Secret; but for Peace sake, and because the things they had to Complain of were dark and doubtful, and but small, and almost insensible Declensions from what had been before, they would make little noise with their dissatisfactions. It is well known that thus Degeneracie hath grown in latter Ages of the Church: and I wish it be not at this Day. Verie often a well Reformed Church doth thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, whose Maladie is like latent Diseases which are little observed till they be past Remedy.</p>
               <p>§. 43. I adde 4. The true Account of this Change of the Church is given by way of Praediction, by our Lord himself on the Parable of <hi>the Tares of the field, Matth. 13. 24. &amp;c.</hi> this with other Corruptions, grew while the Guids of the Church <hi>slept,</hi> which case, in some degree or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is incident to the best of Men; and as, in process of time, the Ministers of the Church grew more remisse, this evil had the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to grow. Of this I have Discoursed else-where; <hi>Rational Def. of non conformitie.</hi> I shall now attend my Antagonist, endeavouring to Run down this apprehension of things with many hard Words: which amount to no more but this, that <hi>it was impossible to be brought about, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the observablenss and suddeness of the Change, and the Faithfulness of the Guids of the Church that then were set over her.</hi> All which is already Answered. His ingeminating his Question about the possibility of this Change, <hi>P.</hi> 142. his saying, that <hi>this cannot be imagined, if we believe the other parts of Evangelical History;</hi> are but words that evanish into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, on supposition of the Account that I have given of it: for we deny that the Evangelical History, whether Sacred, or Humane, giveth us Account of such a constitution of Episcopacy as he imagineth, in the first Ages. That <hi>no Historian took Notice of it, though it was most memorable, p.</hi> 143. is still his rotten Hypothesis, that this Change should have been made suddenly, and all at once: and I adde the History of the time of the Rise and Progress of this is defective, and uncertain, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Sect.</hi> 32. We do not say that <hi>it was Agreed upon by some ambitious Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks,</hi> as he P. 144. such Men might carrie it on in their several places, without Consultation; Nature, and a corrupt Heart, prompting them to it, and the World and Satan tempting them: yea, it might in some degree, be promoted by better Men than these, unawares; taking that for their Due which was not so: for its being <hi>submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62347:79"/>
to tamely</hi> (which he mentioneth <hi>ibid.)</hi> that was not to be wondered at, because of the Humility of some, and minding other work for the Peoples Edification, leaving the the Ruling part too much to them who inclined to it; and their not observing this Change, which by in insensible Degrees, made its Progress so in the dark.</p>
               <p>§. 44. He <hi>p.</hi> 145, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> draweth some absurd Consequences, by which he laboureth to load our Assertion, that the Apostolick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paritie, was in after Ages, changed into Prelacie. The 1. is, that <hi>they who were marked for the Sacred Function by the Lord Christ, after some Experience, Judged it necessary to Change Parity for Prelacy. 2. That this Change was brought about, not in any of the ordinary Methods by which things of that nature are transacted among Mankind, but instantly, and in a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner. 3. That the immediate Successors of the Apostles were all Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (this we hold) <hi>but that these Presbyterians (most of them Martyrs for Christianitie) preferred Prelacy to Paritie. 4. That in their Opinion, there was no other Remedie againstSchism and Confusion.</hi> He saith, these Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are evident, and necessarie, if their (the Presbyterians) Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis be allowed. Such Consequences from our Opinion we utterly deny; and Challenge him to Prove their Dependance on it. The judicious Reader will easily see, that they all are Grounded on his fond Conceit, that we hold that this Change was made suddenly, openly, and all at once: if he find us Maintaing that, let him load our Opinion with as many absurd Consequences, as he can devise. And we neglect his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Repetition of his continual Cant, <hi>p.</hi> 145, 146. about <hi>the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Consent of the Christian Church, and its being received without Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> But to establish this last Notion, he telleth us, that none before <hi>Aerius, opposed Episcopacy;</hi> of whom, and his Actings, he taketh the liberty to give such Account as he thought sit for his design: that <hi>his Motive was Ambition, and missing of a Bishoprick: was dull, had no Parts:</hi> This (in this learned Authors opinion) must needs be the native Consequent of his being a Presbyterian: for he reckoneth them all such. I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a more true account of <hi>Aerius,</hi> §. 16. <hi>of</hi> §. 6. Established on better Authority than he in this Narrative pretendeth to, which is none but his own. He needed not to spend a whole <hi>page</hi> to tell us what he meaneth by the <hi>Impossibility</hi> that he ascribeth to the Change we speak of, let him understand it as he will, we are not concerned, who have given account of that Change which maketh it both possible and easie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. <hi>p.</hi> 148. He hath another Argument (if it be different from what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62347:79"/>
he hath said before) <hi>we must not say that the primitive Church immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Succeeding the Apostles so soon Apostatized from their Original Establishment, else we have no certain Standard to know what is Genuine, and what is Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions in the whole frame of our Religion:</hi> This he enforceth by telling us, <hi>they might Change other things;</hi> and <hi>if the first and best Christians were not to be trusted in matter of Fact, they are less to be trusted in matter of Opinion.</hi> Here we have yet more plainly expressed, the <hi>Popish</hi> Principle, that the Churches Authority is the ground of our Faith: we do not so Trust the first and best Churches (except the Apostles) as to make them the rule of our Religion, either in their Historical, or other Writings: We give that Deference to the Scripture alone. Again, we impute no such Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie to the first and best Saints; but to them who, at some distance, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them; as hath been declared: and we know, that in after Ages, even among them who go under the name of the Fathers, other things were Changed, as well as Church Government.</p>
               <p>§ 44. That our Reformers from <hi>Popery</hi> (whom he calleth the first Presbyterians, <hi>p.</hi> 149.) did not plead a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> is no Argument against us: for few of his Party, to this day, plead for a Divine Right to be on their side, as he and some few others do. And himself and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, made no noise with it, when the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> and the <hi>Test</hi> were in Fashion: our Reformers did not disowne it, and they had not the Occasion, and may be, not the Light, to assert it, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had. Whereas it is palpable, that Interest maketh some of his Side to change their Note. If <hi>Beza wrote smoothly to the English Episcopal Clergy, and some more freely to Mr. Knox, and Mr. Melvil;</hi> I know no blame in that piece of Civility (unless he can say, that <hi>Beza</hi> ceded in many of his Principles, to please the <hi>English Church;</hi> which cannot be alledged. His imputing <hi>Force and Violence</hi> to us, and fancying that <hi>no Records can be true or genuine that are against us,</hi> we pass, as angry and empty Words, but no Arguments: we owne all genuine Records that can be made appear to be such; whether they be for us, or against us: but build not our Faith on any of them, except such as are contained in the Scriptures of Truth. And here he bringeth in, <hi>p.</hi> 150. the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie about <hi>Ignatius's</hi> Epistles; and imputeth to <hi>Dally</hi> and others, that <hi>they reject them on no other ground, but because they owne Episcopacy.</hi> It is not fair dealing to impute such Prevarication to a Person of <hi>Monsieur Daillies</hi> Worth, after he is laid in the Grave. He will not pretend, <hi>p.</hi> 156. to debate the matter about the Authority of these Epistles; but <hi>p.</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:62347:80"/>
150. and what follow, runneth out in a high Commendation of Doctor <hi>Pearson,</hi> on that Subject, and many confident Assertions, that what he hath said cannot be Answered. I shall be far from derogating from the Learning and Critical Skill of that Author. But am not convinced by his Arguments. I am sure there is not that Evidence, nor Certainty in them, that is sufficient for us to build on, in a Matter that Religion is so nearly concerned in, as is the Government appointed by Christ in his Church. He telleth us <hi>Monsieur L'Arroque</hi> attempted to Answer the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chester, but not to the Satisfaction of his own Party: and his Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Answered by Nourry.</hi> The truth is, <hi>L'Arroque</hi> was prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by some of the Episcopal Party, (as witnesseth the Translator of <hi>L' Arroques</hi> Historie on the Eucharist, in his Life, <hi>p.</hi> 5.) by some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arguments, from the Unseasonableness of Debates among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, to desist from that Work, and it never was perfected: therefore it might be the more easily answered: and we cannot judge what Esteem it would have obtained: it seems they dreaded the Strength of it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>we ever were able to bring one plausible Argument for that Cause;</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der must judge; we will not in this, stand to his Decision, which he confidently maketh <hi>p.</hi> 141. he declineth <hi>(ibid.) renewing the Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these Epistles:</hi> wherefore I hope I may be excused if I do so too. And he asserteth that their Cause loseth nothing by their being laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side: as I also affirm, that our Cause may be maintained, if they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be really what he would have them to be. Some Citations out of them I have answered <hi>Cyprianick Bishop Examined.</hi> And if he had thought fit to produce moe, it is like they might be found to do no hurt to our Cause. Or if he had cited what he talketh of out of <hi>the Acts of the Martyrdom of Ignatius,</hi> he might have received what should satisfie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. A Distinction between Bishop (that is Moderator) and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and Deacon, we owne, as well as these Acts do, which is all he mentioneth as making for him, in these Acts. He citeth <hi>Wal. Messal. p.</hi> 153. asserting, that <hi>these Epistles were written in the beginning or middle of the second Century</hi> (this is but the Guess of the Learned <hi>Salmasius)</hi> but our Author doth not tell us that <hi>Salmasius,</hi> in the same place, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth, that they could not be written by <hi>Ignatius;</hi> from some Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities that he maketh appear to be contained in them. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman mistaketh, when he saith, <hi>he that wrote thom could not represent Ecclesiastical Policy different from what it was in the days of Ignatius,</hi> that is to say, he could not mistake. He should have proved this, by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62347:80"/>
demonstrating that that Person, tho he knoweth not who he was, had the Gift of Inerrability: and if he ascribe that to a Person whose other Characters he knoweth not; he might as well say, that no Writer of that Age could misapprehend what was the Principle and Practice of the former. Is it not possible, that this Person might be another <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes;</hi> who, while there was some Tendency to a Declension from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, did zealously forward it; and run a little before the soberer and better Men of that time; and that his Zeal for the Opinion he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up might make him misapprehend, or misrepresent, what was the Opinion of the true <hi>Ignatius?</hi> it is a Dream, that <hi>it followeth from the Concession,</hi> or Guess, <hi>of Salmasias, that that Author gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a true Idea of the Ecclesiastical Policy of the beginning of the second Century:</hi> and another, that <hi>he must represent Church Policy as those in his own days thought it to be in the days of Ignatius:</hi> there was nothing in all the Presbyterian Writings so <hi>visionaire</hi> (to use his own word) as this is. For could not this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Person differ in the Apprehension of this Matter, from most, yea, from all his Contemporaries? and it is strange that our Author should suppose that this personate <hi>Ignatius</hi> was a <hi>Martyr,</hi> or a Bishop; as he doth <hi>p.</hi> 154. He pleadeth next for the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> from the Diligence and Authority of <hi>Eusebius;</hi> and saith, that <hi>he hardly could be imposed upon in an Affair of this Consequence. A.</hi> This is to beg the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to say that the Church was in this imposed upon: he should prove that the Churches then thought these Epistles to be written by <hi>Ignatius.</hi> for <hi>Eusebius,</hi> I think few, who are vers'd in Antiquity, will lay so much weight on his Historical Authority as this Author doth. Himself giveth ground to suspect some things that he wrote; as I shewed before: and others have observed yet more ground for it. It is a pleasant Argument, <hi>the Church was careful to gather up some hard Bones of Ignatius, that the Lyons had left, Ergo, they were more watehful over the Remains of his Mind, viz. his Epistles.</hi> If we have no more Certainty about the Epistles, than we have about the genuine Bones of that Holy Martyr, and other Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; few wise Men will be much moved by Arguments brought from them. That <hi>Polycarp</hi> made a Collection of these Epistles, and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> cited them, proveth no more but that good Men may be imposed on by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Writings. <hi>Eusebius rejected some suppositions Books, after accurate Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;</hi> were a good Argument, if it could be made out that he reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all such: the contrary whereof is well known. For his <hi>Belief that the Orations of Cicero are genuine,</hi> let him enjoy it; but if he build his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62347:81"/>
Faith on any Article of Religion, or his Practice of Piety towards God, on that Certainty, I cannot do so too. Whether <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote these O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or not, is neither a Matter of such Moment, nor so contested by plausible Arguments, as what we now Debate is.</p>
               <p>§ 45. What remains of my Antagonists Discourse on this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie about Episcopacy, is a Recapitulation of what he hath already said; in nine Questions: which he seemeth to set down as so many Trophies of Victory over all his Adversaries; and a few other Hints for strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Cause. His Questions need litle Animadversion: all that is contained in them being already Answered, and his Opinion in these things disproved: whether concludently and solidly or not, the Reader will judge. His first three Questions do all suppose that we are against Prelacy, merely from <hi>the Dichotomy of the Clergy</hi> used in Scripture, which is a false Supposition: I have proposed our Argument with more strength, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. §. 5. so as it is no way touched by what he here saith: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no loss to our Cause if we give a negative, or affirmative An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, to these Questions, whether he shall chuse. To his fourth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <hi>I</hi> Answer, that Apostolick Power, as to its permanent Branches, was perpetual and successive (my Answer must be Tautological, because his Question is such) but not so, as to all its Essential Branches. As to its <hi>necessary Branches;</hi> if he mean what is necessary to the Beeing, or Idea of an Apostle, I deny these to be Perpetual and Successive. To the second part of this Question, <hi>I</hi> Answer negatively; that this Power was not transmitted, <hi>in solidum,</hi> to single Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors in particular Sees; but to a Colledge of Presbyters. Question fifth, <hi>Where Superiority is forbidden;</hi> is most impertinent to our Debate: seing he pleadeth for a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> for it; he should bring either a Command for it; or what is equivalent. The <hi>Popes</hi> Monarchy over the Church is not more forbidden, than the Superiority of one Priest (as he speaketh) over another; both of them must be <hi>Juris Divini,</hi> in his Opinion. I retort his own Argument, if Parity be not plainly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (which I am sure he cannot shew) then the Fancy of a <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in favours of Episcopacy (such as is exclusive of all other Forms of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Government) is Groundless and Chymerical.</hi> It is enough to us, that Christ hath instituted Parity, and he hath not allowed Men to change it: we think this a sufficient Prohibition of the Superiority that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for. His sixth is a heap of Questions, to which <hi>I</hi> Answer, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the universal Tradition for Prelacy that he fancieth, and say, a more universal Tradition might be demanded. We deny also that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62347:81"/>
from universal Tradition (exclusive of Apostolick Tradition; if he can bring that he hath done his Work) is in this Case, either the most proper, or most necessary. Scripture Command, or Example, is both more proper, and more necessary. For the seventh, we do not pretend there was such a <hi>great Change so suddenly,</hi> as he fancieth we do; and therefore are not concerned to Debate the Possibility of it. <hi>I</hi> have said enough on this head, § 41. To his eighth, we affirm, that <hi>Jeroms</hi> Opinion is fairly and truly represented by Presbyterians: and have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered what he saith to the contrary, <hi>Sect. 6. §. 7. &amp; seq.</hi> His last Question about <hi>Ignatius's</hi> Epistles may be retorted on himself, whether there be any solid Argument brought for them: <hi>sub judice lis est.</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self declineth that Debate, as <hi>I</hi> also do. It is enough to us, that even the Testimonies out of these Epistles are not concludent: and if the Epistles were Authentick, their Authority is but Humane and Fallible: and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Prejudice against Divine Institution: and indeed cannot make Faith where the Question is <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi> as here it is.</p>
               <p>§ 46. <hi>I</hi> now proceed to consider some immethodical and incoherent Notions, with which he concludeth this Chapter. He telleth us, <hi>p. 160. Presbyterians owne a Praesidency since the days of the Apostles</hi> (he might have added, and in their days too) <hi>so that the Quarrel is not so much against E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy, as against the Extent of their Diocess, and Increase of their Power; over what it was in the Primitive times.</hi> Now he will prove their Power over Presbyters to have been much more absolute, than now it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be: for <hi>nothing was to be done without the Bishop; a Presbyter might not Baptize without his express Indulgence: as Tertull witnesseth.</hi> This Testimony of <hi>Tertull. I</hi> have answered, <hi>Cyprianick Bishop Examed,</hi> §. 49. By Bishop may either be understood the Moderator, not in his single Capacity, but with the Presbytery: none might act within their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict, but by their Allowance: or a Parish Minister, none might Baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his Parish, but by his Consent. He next citeth <hi>Dyonisius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> writing to the <hi>Gnossians, exhorting Pinytus, their Bishop, not to lay the heavy burden of Caelibacy (I</hi> suppose that he meaneth by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>on the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that is the Clergy:</hi> whence he wisely inferreth the Power of <hi>Piny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to have done this. And citeth on his Margin, <hi>Euseb. hist. Eccles.</hi> but neither Book nor Chapter, nor the place of <hi>Dionysius</hi> where the words may be found. <hi>A. Euseb. hist. lib.</hi> 4. C. 23. hath a part of an Epistle of <hi>Dionysius</hi> to <hi>Pinytus,</hi> and his Answer to him, where he checketh <hi>Dionysius</hi> for that Advice to him. But nothing of all this importeth the Power
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62347:82"/>
of <hi>Pinytus</hi> to forbid Marriage: he might say on this burden by preaching the necessity of <hi>Caelibacy,</hi> without Authoritative imposing it. Yea, he might impose it as <hi>Praeses,</hi> by the concurrent Authority of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without sole Jurisdiction. He mentioneth likeways the <hi>Canon. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol.</hi> and <hi>Ignatius's</hi> Epistles, but citeth nothing out of them: so that he cannot expect an Answer. As to the Extent of Diocesses, we no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make an Argument from it, than we maintain that a Pastor of a Church should have no larger Charge, than he can dispense the Word and Sacraments to; and that he should not do this by Deputies under him. We lay no Stress on the word Diocess, nor on the unequal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a Pastors District, provided he pretend to no Power over his Brethren; nor have a Charge that he cannot manage without such Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over others.

               <p>§ 47. A strong Argument for Diocesan Episcopacy (as he thinketh) he manageth, <hi>p: 164: &amp; seq:</hi> from <hi>James</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem; who was over many Congregations; for the Increase of Christians was such, as that they could not meet in one place.</hi> The Answer hath been before given; <hi>James</hi> was no ordinary Bishop, but an Apostle: and had Jurisdiction, not only over the Christians in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and in <hi>Judea;</hi> but in all the World. He telleth us, that <hi>we use many Evasions; but he thinketh it then only seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to Answer them, when he knoweth which of them we most trust to.</hi> If <hi>I</hi> had dealt so by his Book, no Answer had been given to it. <hi>I</hi> know neither which of his Arguments he most trusteth to; nor which of them doth best deserve that regard. If he had answered all that we say, he could not have missed what we most trust to: he should deal with our Arguments and Exceptions, not according to our Esteem of them; but according to the Influence they may have on the Debate now in hand. As for the Debate between <hi>Clarkson</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> we are not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it; it is not material whether there be more or fewer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in a City, provided their Pastors be not subject to one, but Co-ordinate among themselves.

               <argument>
                  <p>Animadversions on the Book called the Fundamental Charter of Presbytery.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Had resolved not to meddle with the ill Natured Author of <hi>the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Charter of Presbytery,</hi> further than I have done in answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his malicious Preface; <hi>Appendix to Cyprianick Bishop Examined;</hi> judging it more proper for some States Man, or one who is versed in the Law: his Book being a direct Refutation of an Act of Parliament, which he treateth very saucily: but finding, that they neglected his Book, and think it below them, unless they could also find his Person; and considering the affinity of what he treateth with what I have been now controverting with another (if not the same) Author, here speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more dareingly, from behind the Curtain, on second thoughts, I judg'd it not amiss to take notice of what he sayeth, in some short a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversions (such as I have already made upon his Preface) in so far as he opposeth Presbyterian Government. I intend not to explain an Act of Parliament (I know the hazard of that from the experience of others) but I designe to shew how far the Presbyterians own what he opposeth: insisting only on what seemeth to be argumentative in his Book, and overlooking the Virulent Sallies of his Pen; which touch not this matter. He divideth his discourse into <hi>eighth Enquiries:</hi> I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what he saith on each of them.</p>
               <p>§ 2. His first <hi>Enquiry</hi> is, <hi>Whether the Church of Scotland was Reformed solely by Persons Cloathed with the Character of Presbyters.</hi> I observe two Mistakes (to give them no worse Names) in thus stating the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. First, it is enough to us, if our Reformers were mostly, though not solely Presbyters: if a Bishop or two joyned in the Reformation, it doth not hinder that Persons of inferior Degree in the Church that then was, were the Men on whom lay the weight of this Work. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is not so much material what Character our Reformers bare when they were yet <hi>Papists,</hi> as what Station they had in the Reformed Protestant Church in this Nation: or what Order they endeavoured to set up in this Church, when they had withdrawn from Subjection
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62347:83"/>
to the <hi>Roman Hierarchy:</hi> for our Concernment is to know what were the Principles of our Reformers, being now Reformed, (for before their Conversion they were all Episcopal) and how they setled this Church with respect to her Government. But to gratifie my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a little, I so far yield to the State of his Question, as to maintain, that few, if any, had an Active Hand in the Reformation, who had been <hi>Popish Bishops:</hi> but they moved in a lower Orbe in the <hi>Popish Church,</hi> who were helped of God to be Instrumental in that blessed Work. If he would have cleared the Question, he should have told us what he meaneth by Presbyters in the <hi>Popish</hi> Notion of that Word: For that Antichristian Society had left scarce either Name or Thing of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Offices that Christ had appointed in his House, but confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all, and builded a <hi>Babel</hi> of their own devising. To prove that our Reformation was not by Presbyters, he telleth us of <hi>eight Prelates in the Reforming Parliament 1560, who all turned Protestants:</hi> this is little to the purpose; for 1. The Reformation from Popery had made some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress before that time, Preachers, and some private Men, did more for the turning Persons to the Truth, than Parliament Men did. 2. Eight in all <hi>Scotland</hi> was but a small Number: if there had been no more Hands at the Work, it had gone slowly on. 3. Among all these eight, there were but two Bishops, the rest were Prelates indeed, in the <hi>Popish</hi> Sense; Abbots, and such like; but I hope this Author will not say they were such as Protestants count Prelates; or that they have superior Power in the Church, to Presbyters. 2. He telleth us, that they who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured most in the Reformation, were not in Holy Orders, and nameth some of them. <hi>Ans.</hi> Then I hope they were no Bishops. It is true, many of these worthy Men had no Ordination in the Popish way, nor were they Presbyters in that Church; but when they turned Protestants, they were made Presbyters, and not Bishops. Yea, <hi>Claud. historic. def. of the Reformation, part 4. page</hi> 15. saith, that <hi>in many Nations</hi> (among whom he nameth <hi>Scotland) the Reformation was made by the Consent of the greatest part of their Pastors: to wit Monks, Preachers, Priests, Curats, Canons, &amp;c.</hi> And it is as certain as History can make it, that not a few of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clergy turned Protestants; whereas himself confesseth there were but two Bishops, <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Galloway.</hi> Some of them, and these of good Note, and who were eminently blessed with Success, were but Lay-Men, (as he frazeth it) who by their private Labours converted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and were at last Authorized to Labour in the Gospel more publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62347:83"/>
by such Ordination as then could be had; but they were never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to be Bishops. Let me digress a little, to observe that the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Dun</hi> (by this Authors account) was after made a Superintendent; but never received into Holy Orders, by any thing that appeareth: whence <hi>I</hi> infer, that in the Opinion of that time, a Superintendent was not the same with a Bishop: which our Brethren use to plead for. <hi>I</hi> shall not insist on the further Proofs he bringeth of his Answer to the first Enquiry: they amount to no more, but that there were but few Ministers: and many Reformers were Lay Men: to all which <hi>I</hi> Answer; this sheweth that Presbyters, and Persons of an inferior Rank to Bishops, had a far greater Hand in the Reformation than Bishops had. It was far otherwise in <hi>England;</hi> where the State carried on the Reformation; whereas in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the greatest, both in State and Church, opposed it as long, and as much as they could: and even the two Bishops whom he mentioneth, did rather comply with the Reformation, than actively promote it: notwithstanding of all which, it is unbecoming a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, to call our Reformation <hi>violent, and disorderly:</hi> as he doth, <hi>p.</hi> 7. out of <hi>Spotswood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. The second <hi>Enquiry</hi> is, <hi>Whether the Scots Reformers, what ever were their Characters, were of the present Presbyterian Principles? whither they were for the Divine Institution of Parity; and the Unlawfulness of Prelacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pastors of the Church?</hi> here he taketh a great deal of Liberty to Comment, and try his Critical Skill, on the Article of the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which he had undertaken to baffle. In which it is not my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to interpose: <hi>I</hi> am little concerned in this whole Enquiry: if it be granted that Parity, and not Prelacy; was the Church Government that they chused. If this Debate have any Influence on the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between us and our Brethren, it will make more against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves than against us: for not only our Reformers were further from owning a Divine Right of Prelacy than of Parity; but they chused this, and rejected that: notwithstanding that they had been bred in the owning of it, under Popery. We think it was a great Testimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by them to Parity, that they shewed so much Zeal for it, as they did, though they had not that Light about it, that after times afforded. It is certain, that that Dispute which had so long, by the Tyranny of the Bishops, been buried and forgotten, (except among the Church in the Wilderness, which few knew of, the <hi>Waldenses)</hi> could not at first be so fully understood, as by further Enquiries it came to be. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62347:84"/>
it is evident that our Reformers lookt on Parity as <hi>Juris Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini,</hi> though they did not much insist on the Debate about that: for in <hi>the Book of Policy, Chap.</hi> 1. they have these words, <hi>this Ecclesiastical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is granted by God the Father, through the Mediator Jesus Christ, unto his Kirk, gathered</hi> (not to a single Bishop) <hi>and hath ground in the Word of God, to be put in Execution by them, unto whom the Spiritual Government of the Kirk, by lawful Calling, is committed.</hi> Here it is plain, that they are not for Indifferency of the form of Government: and <hi>chap.</hi> 2. There is this Article; <hi>and to take away all occasion of Tyranny, he</hi> (that is God) <hi>willeth that they should rule with mutual consent, as Brethren, with equality of Power, every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Function.</hi> And after, <hi>there are four, ordinary Functions, or Offices, in the Kirk, the Office of the Pastor, Minister, or Bishop; the Doctor, the Presbyter or Elder, and the Deacon.</hi> Where it is evident, that they own no Bishop Superior to any ordinary Minister; but make the Identitie of them to be of Divine Right.</p>
               <p>§. 4. I think it not worth the while to make a strict Examination of the Proofs he bringeth, that our Reformers were not for a <hi>jus divinum</hi> of a Paritie, for if it were yielded, it doth not hurt our Cause. And his Arguments are verbose, tedious, and insignificant. I shall only point at them, and the Answers that may be made to them. There is, <hi>p. 9. &amp;c. no such Controversie was then Agitated in Europe; the Popes Supremacy was Debated, but not Prelacy;</hi> Ans. <hi>nihil sequitur,</hi> our Reformers assert the Conclusion as I have shewed: but they and others were taken up in debateing greater Matters with the Papists: He doth falsly assert, <hi>p.</hi> 10. that <hi>Churches, when they are Reformed, set up a Church Government sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Model of the State, as in Geneva, which was a Common-wealth, they set up Paritie.</hi> For who readeth <hi>Calvins</hi> Writings may see, that they built on another Foundation; even Divine Institution, and our own Countrey is an instance to the contrary: Paritie was in the Church, and Monarchy in the State. He calleth it <hi>impudence</hi> to cite <hi>Calvine for this jus Divinum:</hi> but if the Reader be at the pains to look into the Citations that this Author hath scraped together, to shew <hi>Calvin</hi> to be for Indifferency of the form of Church Government, he will soon see on whose side the <hi>impudence</hi> is. He confesseth that <hi>Beza foundeth upon Scripture:</hi> 131. but alledgeth that <hi>he no where calleth Episcopacy absolutely or simply unlawful.</hi> If Christ hath instituted a Form, as it must be if one Form be built on Scripture; I see not what is further necessary to prove an opposite Form, inconsistent with that, to be absolutely or simply unlawful. He
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62347:84"/>
telleth us, <hi>ibid.</hi> that <hi>Beza saith, that humanus Episcopatus is tollerable, if duely bounded, by the pure canons of the ancient Church:</hi> and I say the same: for then it would be no more but a Presidencie; which doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Paritie. He citeth also a number of seeming concessions out of <hi>Calvine:</hi> but they amount to no more than the lawfulness of a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Church; which is not our Debate. If <hi>Beza was not for separating from a Church because it was Episcopal;</hi> no more are we: unless that Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Church impose unlawful terms of Communion on us. His second Proof is, <hi>our Reformers had no peculiar Motives, or occasion for adverting to the evil of Prelacy: nor interest to determine them to Paritie: nor were more sharp sighted to see the evil of Prelacie than other Reformers.</hi> Ans. a thousand such Arguments as this cannot conclude against a plain Matter of fact: I have shewed that they were for the Divine right of Paritie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in vain to tell us that they had no Motive to be of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He falsly supposeth that other Reformers were not of the same Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; seing most of them except <hi>England,</hi> set up the same Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He argueth thus, <hi>none of the Confessors, or Martyers, or they who had most hand in bringing the Reformation to perfection, have given that as their Opinion.</hi> And here hath a long Discourse of some other Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that several of them vented, <hi>they Declaimed loudly against the Bishops of these times; but what is that to the Order, p. 8. they Declaimed against the Shavelings as well as against Bishops; against Presbyters as well as Bishops, p.</hi> 19. And he hath a long Debate, with some of our Historians, about the Opinion of <hi>John Knox</hi> in this matter, which, meerly to save time, I shall not concern my self in. Ans. It being evident, that in our first Setlement of Discipline, our Church declared for the Divine right of Paritie, negative Arguments from the Writing, or sayings, of private Men are insignificant: and it is less to the purpose, to tell us of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinions which have no relation at all to this Matter. He cannot so much as alledge that any of them have said, or Written any thing to the contrarie, directly or indirectly. For his Debate about <hi>John Knox,</hi> I judge he hath said nothing that can satisfie any imbyassed Reader, that these Historians had not ground to think that <hi>Master Knox</hi> lookt on Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy as a sinful thing, and against Christs Institution; That imparitie was Established by the <hi>first Book of Discipline,</hi> is falsly supposed, <hi>p.</hi> 22. Superintendencie is no sufficient Proof of it; of which after.</p>
               <p>§. 5. His next Proof beginneth <hi>p.</hi> 38. and is managed in a large Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical acount, of what influence <hi>England</hi> had on our Reformation
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62347:85"/>
from Popery: whence he inferreth, that <hi>our Reformers proceeded on the same Principle with the Reformers of England.</hi> Here he undertaketh two things; 1. To shew <hi>what influence England had on our Reformation. 2. That our Reformers were generally of the same mind with the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in several momentous instances relating to Constitution and Communion, the Government and Policy of the Church.</hi> For Ans. to this Argument; it is wholly inconsequential, if he never so fully Prove all that he hath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; except the last, about the Government and Policy of the Church: and even that signifieth nothing, unless he Prove that by the influence of <hi>England</hi> our Reformers were for prelacy; and not for Paritie; and that as Instituted by Christ. Wherefore I pass over the laborious proofs he brings of the other things, and shall consider his last Article; and what he saith for what he hath asserted about it. The Reader, without my Animadversion, will take notice of his unmanly depressing of his Native Countrey, and fawning on another Nation. This assertion that we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is not proved by our Reformers <hi>Communicating with the Church of England</hi> (which he insisteth on from <hi>p.</hi> 7.) it only proveth that they thought Episcopacy did not unchurch a Society that was otherwise sound in the Faith. And if some three or four of them did <hi>serve in the Church of</hi> England <hi>under Bishops</hi> (for which we have no more but <hi>Arch-Bishop Spotswoods</hi> word) this might either be by the Indulgence of the Reforming Bishops, not requiring of them these Terms of Communion that the late Bishops did of these who got Places under them: or it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth no more but that one or two Men of a Partie were of more La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in their Principles than the rest were. For what is said of <hi>some of them approving the English Lyturgy,</hi> is less to his Question, which is only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Government. We never thought that our Reformers, at first, were all of the same Principle with us in all things: I am sure they were far from being of all the Sentiments of the present Episcopal Church. Yea them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had afterward, other thoughts of some things, than they had at first: as <hi>Luther</hi> held many Popish Opinions at first, which afterward he rejected. I observe further, that in many of his Historical passages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some of these Reformers, his best ground for what he affirmeth is, <hi>it is not to be imagined,</hi> that they did so and so: or <hi>it is to be presumed.</hi> We must then believe the Truth of Matter of Fact on his fancy, that so it must be. If I thought it worth the while, I would Examine these Histories more narrowly. But I could easily yield him all, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to our Cause: seing the Principles of our Reformers are better
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62347:85"/>
known by their publick Deeds, than by the private Sayings, or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of two or three of them; and these not sufficiently attested. These good Men did much rejoyce in the Reformation of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as also in her casting off the load of humane Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, by which she had been burdened; but that all, or most of them, were satisfied with their Government and Discipline, is the Question; and is not Proved by what he hath said. It is least of all Concludent, that <hi>these of the Church of England had good Opinion of the Church of Scotland:</hi> which he laboureth to Prove, <hi>p.</hi> 80. and it is unaccountable, that <hi>p.</hi> 81. he layeth on so much stress on our Reformers saying of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>they were of the same Religon with us:</hi> which he puteth <hi>in majusculis:</hi> we say the same of them at this day: and I hope they think not otherwise of us: and yet we think Paritie to be <hi>juris divini.</hi> If he can find a Contradiction here, let him try his Skill to discover it. It is an odd method that he useth, <hi>p.</hi> 85. he will prove that <hi>the Scots Reformers were for Episcopacy, because it was natural for the English, who had assisted in the Reformation to demand it.</hi> And I Prove they were not for it, because, <hi>de facto,</hi> they did not setle it, but a way inconsistent with it. Let the Reader judge whether of these two Arguments is most concludent. We do not find that the <hi>English</hi> made such a Demand, and if they did not, they acted like discreet Neighbours, not to impose on their Brethren, who had other sentiments of the Matter, and who agreed with them in the main points of Religion. And if they made such a Demand, the Event shewed that it was not listned to. For his Citation of <hi>Buchannan, p.</hi> 88. that <hi>Scoti ante aliquot annos Anglorum auxiliis è servitute Gallica liberati, Religionis cultui &amp; ritibus cum Anglis communibus subscripserunt:</hi> himself confesseth that no other Historian hath mentioned it; and he hath taken care that we shall not be able to Examine <hi>Buchannans</hi> words, by mentioning <hi>Buch.</hi> 7. 14. in a Book of so many diverse Editions: who can hope to find the place? I know not what <hi>Buchannan</hi> could mean by it; but it is evident, if the <hi>Scots</hi> did so subscribe, they did not act accordinglie; which was no Sign of their Inclinations that way: It is nauseous to repeat, with him, so often, <hi>the Godly Conjunction, the Unity, Peace, and Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that was then made between England and Scotland;</hi> and to set forth this as a Demonstration: Yea, a Set of Demonstrations, that <hi>the Scots Reformers were Episcopal:</hi> nothing can be more ridiculous than to talk at this rate, in the Face of Matter of Fact, that they settled Parity as soon as they could settle any Order in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:62347:86"/>
§ 6. He undertaketh, <hi>p.</hi> 96. and forward, to prove, that <hi>at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the English Lyturgy was used in this Church.</hi> If this should be granted, it cannot prove that the <hi>English</hi> Church Government was used also: they wanted qualified Ministers, so that there was need of some help to them, in Praying and Instructing the People publikly; and it may be, there was no other that they could, at that time, use, and they had not so fully discovered what might be, and afterward was, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against in it; and therefore used it for a time: but I think he will not deny, that as soon as they could, they laid it aside; and made use of that more Unexceptionable Form of <hi>Geneve;</hi> till at last, that was difused also, as a Man layeth by his Crutches, when he getteth Strength to go by himself. He sheweth wonderful Skill in Logick. <hi>p. 98. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood</hi> had said that the <hi>English</hi> Lyturgy, which was read in the new Colledge in <hi>Saint Andrews, was not of any continued Practice in time by past, since the Reformation; Ergo,</hi> it was practised at the Reformation. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be said of the Consequent, the Consequence is no better than this, I never used to smoak Tobacco in any continued Practice since I was born, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I did it when I was born, <hi>p. 101, &amp;c.</hi> he telleth us of another Principle, wherein our Reformers agreed with them of <hi>England:</hi> that <hi>the Church had a great Dependence on the State: that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Civil State to reform the Church: that the People might appeal from the Church to the Civil Magistrat, &amp;c.</hi> this is still, <hi>extra oleas va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari.</hi> I shall not so far digress from the purpose in hand, as to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the present Presbyterians hold as to these Assertions: nor need I compare the Opinion of our Reformers with ours in this matter: if he can charge us with Hetrodoxy on this head, we shall Answer him when he will. This whole Discourse is impertinent: it doth not prove that our Reformers were for Episcopacie: and if it did, it is no good Consequent; that we should be for it too. I have alreadie said, that we never thought our Reformers were, in all things, of the same Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the present Presbyterians: and I am sure, that he hath far less cause to think that they were for all that the present Prelatists hold. Another thing more he sheweth; that <hi>the Scots and English Reformers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in this, p.</hi> 105. that <hi>they took for the Rule of Reformation, the Word of God, interpreted by the Monuments and Writings of the Primitive Church.</hi> And here he enlargeth in the Commendation of this Rule, and oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargeth the Presbyterians with all <hi>the Horrid Rebellions, and Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Divisions, unaccountable Revolutions, both in Church and State, which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62347:86"/>
have Unbinged all the Principles of Natural Justice and Honesty, and Disabled, nay eaten out, the Principles of Christianity among us; that now we are not so much disposed for any thing, as for Atheism.</hi> Which Strain I find is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with Men of his Stamp: but it is most disingenuous Dealing: for the World knoweth where the Fault of our Divisions dothly: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Atheism, Immoralitie, and Injustice have thriven more under the Influence of Prelacie, or of Presbyterie. For the <hi>Revolution</hi> that he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be so angry with, the Presbyterians think it their Glorie to have Countenanced it: and the Bodie of the Prelatists (in <hi>England</hi> I mean, not in <hi>Scotland)</hi> will not disowne their Accession to it; nor will they look on it (as this Author and some others do) to have <hi>Unbinged the Principles of Natural Justice and Honesty.</hi> The Rule of Reformation that he had mentioned, he saith <hi>he will bring in again by and by,</hi> where we shall attend him.</p>
               <p>§ 7. He telleth us, <hi>p. 106, &amp;c.</hi> of his Performances, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulateth; and concludeth, in the highest Measure of Confidence that Words can express, that <hi>our Reformers were not for the Divine Right of Parity.</hi> I am so dull that I cannot see this Point proved, for all that he hath said: and if it were proved, it is nothing to our main Cause; we never said that they were in all things, either as Presbyterians, or as Prelatists are now, in their Opinions; all that we assert is, that they were for Paritie, and practised it as the Government of the reformed Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and it is more than probable, that they were for its <hi>Divine Right.</hi> In what followeth, his Confidence ariseth yet higher, and that in the Entrance of what now he is attempting, and about which he maketh very large Promises, <hi>p.</hi> 108. where he pretendeth to <hi>give plain, positive, direct, and formal proofs of his Assertion, to as high a degree, as the nature of the thing is capable of, or can reasonably bear.</hi> For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this; his first Attempt is, <hi>in a Petition of the Reformers to the Government; this is one Article, as it is set down by Lesly, de rebus gestis, Scotor. lib. 10. p. 504. Ut Episcopi deinceps &amp; Pastores, illi Dominorum ac No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilium cujuscunque Diocesis, hi parochorum assentione, ac voluntate ad beneficia cooptentur.</hi> There is nothing Answerable to the Evidence so confidently promised by him: it is no <hi>positive, plain, &amp;c.</hi> Proof: the matter could bear more, <hi>viz.</hi> if <hi>Lesly</hi> had said, that however, the Schismaticks, (as he calleth them) were for abolishing the old Doctrine, that they were for keeping up the ancient Hierarchie. But that this is no sufficient Proof of his Conclusion; I shew, 1. Supposing <hi>Lesly's</hi> Veracitie, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62347:87"/>
fair Representation of the Address that the Reformers made, no more can be concluded from it, but that it is supposed, that the Revenues of Bishops could not quickly be alienated, and that some must be chosen to enjoy them, that they might be so and so chosen: here is not a Word of chusing Bishops to Exercise that Office over, or among the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants: and it is well known, that the Rents of Bishops, Abbots, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and other Dignitaries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did continue; and Men were chosen to the Name, and Rent, of these Places, who did not Exercise the Power that Men under these Names had in Popery. 2. Himself confesseth, that this Article of the Petition is otherwise ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in <hi>Buchannan,</hi> and <hi>Spotswood; viz. Ut Ministrorum electio juxta anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Ecclesiae consuetudinem penes populum esset.</hi> Here is no Word of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: and one may think, that we have more Cause to Credit these two Protestant Historians than <hi>Lesly,</hi> a Papist; who, on all Occasions, sheweth his Spite against Protestants: especially <hi>Spotswood,</hi> an Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, would not have neglected to make use of this seeming Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to his Cause. This Author hath no other Shift to take off the Edge of this Exception, but to tell us, that <hi>Buchannan minded Matters of State most in History: and Spotswood is very defective in many parts of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story:</hi> which is indeed to say, that neither of them is to be much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but <hi>Lesly</hi> is the Man: if it be so, we must look on the whole of our Reformation, with a very unfavourable Eye. Whither this will seem absurd to this Author, or not, I know not. He is at a great deal of Pains to prove, that <hi>Lesly did not Forge this Article;</hi> and bringeth no fewer than six Arguments to prove it: which I judge not worth my Labour of Examining them: only this Reply I return to them all: what if he Misworded the Article, though he did not Forge it? the other Historians have the same Article, only they have not the Word Bishops, in which lyeth the whole force of our Authors Argument.</p>
               <p>§ 8. His next Argument, which beareth <hi>positive, plain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Evidence,</hi> is from another Petition of our Reformers, set down in the History commonly ascribed to <hi>John Knox, p.</hi> 131. a large Portion of which he Transcribeth; I shall Compendize it, without taking any thing from its Strength on his Side: they require that <hi>the ill Lives of Prelates, and the State Ecclesiastical, may be Reformed; and Declare that they envy not their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, nor covet their Possessions; but desire their Reformation:</hi> and they add, that <hi>we are content, that not only the Rules and Precepts of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but also the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, and the Godly and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62347:87"/>
Laws of Justinian the Emperor, decide the Controversie betwixt us and them:</hi> and they <hi>earnestly desire, that notwithstanding the long Custom they had to live at their Lust, they may be compelled either to desist from Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Administration, or discharge their Duties as becometh true Ministers.</hi> Let us now hear what Improvement he maketh of this Passage to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: he telleth us, that <hi>here our Reformers lay down a Complex Rule for Reforming of the Church:</hi> and we refuse not to try it with our Opposites, in the Controversie about Prelacy, by this <hi>Complex Rule:</hi> but with these two Limitations, which cannot be made appear to be inconsistent with what is there expressed by our Reformers: one is, that all the Parts of this Complex Rule, be not lookt on as of Co-ordinat Authority; but that the rest be subordinate to the Holy Scripture: we are not afraid of the Verdict of the Fathers of the first Ages; but if they should be found in any thing to recede from Scripture, we reject them. The other is, that the Laws of <hi>Justinian,</hi> which our Reformers mention, be rather lookt on as a Rule concerning the Temporalities of Church Men, than their Spiritual Jurisdiction. He next saith, that <hi>our Reformers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Clergy should live and rule, and discharge their Trust, as they did in the days of Justinian: and now,</hi> saith he, <hi>if they who so Petitioned, were for Parity, and not for the Continuance of Prelacy, I must confess my Ignorance to be very gross. Ans.</hi> I shall not determine whither Ignorance, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else hath led him into a gross Mistake of the Meaning and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of these Petitioners: but a Mistake seemeth to be evident. They were not so absurd, as to make the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Law the Rule of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: we know how that hath been altered, and reformed oftner than once; whereas the Rule of Religion is unalterable by the Authority of Men; wherefore they can mean no more, but that they are willing that Prelates should enjoy their Benefices, (this for Peace sake they yielded too) as they were setled by the good Laws of <hi>Justinian:</hi> (where a Limitation even in that is insinuated) and that the Lives and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Pastors of the Church, should be regulated by Scripture and the Writings of the Fathers in Subordination to that, <hi>Justinian</hi> lived in the sixth Century, when Prelacie was far advanced in the Church: wherefore they had Acted very absurdly, if they had been for that way, and yet so quickly settled among themselves (contrarie to the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Friends in <hi>England,</hi> to whose Assistance they owed very much) a way so opposit to that. Our Reformers, the Nobilitie, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and Ministers, were neither so unfaithful, nor so changeable, as to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62347:88"/>
be influenced by one or two Men to such an absurd Course. I add to all this, that it is most absurd to say, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> took the Writings of the ancient Fathers for the Rule of the Reformation, or for any part of it: for indeed, by that Rule, there will be found a Canonical Nullitie in the Power of all their Bishops; on account of their being chosen by the Magistrat, and sitting in Parliament: for <hi>Canon. Apost.</hi> (confirmed by <hi>Concil. Constantinop. 6. Canon</hi> 29. revived by <hi>Con. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ 9. After mentioning another Petition of the Reformers, which containeth no new matter, he cometh from <hi>p.</hi> 119. to prove, that <hi>the first Church Government that our Reformers settled, was not Paritie, but Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency:</hi> All that he saith on this head, hath been often answered; and it hath been made plain, to the Conviction of them who will see, that <hi>Superintendency,</hi> as set up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was nothing like <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> that it was never intended to be continued; but used for the present Necessitie: and that it was never lookt on as inconsistent with their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Paritie in Opinion: but we must submit to the Drudgerie of Repetitions; seing he will have it so. I take notice of his forgetting what he had said a little before (as I observed §. 2.) <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Dun</hi> was made a <hi>Superintendent,</hi> though it doth appear that he was never in Holie Orders: whence it evidently followeth, that on this Authors Supposition, the Reformers lookt not on <hi>Superintendency</hi> as a Government any otherwise warrantable, but by the Force of Necessitie. Two things he undertaketh about <hi>Superintendency.</hi> 1. To shew <hi>their Power and Disparity from other Ministers.</hi> 2. To <hi>dissipate the Mists cast on this matter by Presbyterians.</hi> For the former, he telleth us of <hi>a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stock of Prerogatives, or Preheminencies above other Church Men. As 1. They had larger Districts. 2. They were to be Nominated by the Council, and Elected by the Nobility and Gentry, &amp;c. within their District. 3. They were not to be Censured, but by the Ministers and Elders of the whole Province, over which they were Appointed. 4. They were to be Admitted</hi> (which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calleth Ordination) <hi>by other Superintendents. 5. They were to be Translated by the whole Church. 6. They must be two years, at least, in the Ministry, before they be Superintendents. 7. He had a greater Benefice than other Ministers. 8. Every one of them was a constant Member of the General Assembly. 9. He was to try Candidats for the Ministry, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eaders. 10. He had the Power of Collation, on Presentations. 11. He had Power to plant Ministers in the Churches where the People were negligent. 12. He had the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62347:88"/>
Power of Ordination. 13. Ministers were subject to him, in all lawful Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; he was to be obeyed. 14. He had Power of Visitation of Churches. 15. He might depose Ministers. 16. He might translate Ministers. 17. He might nominat Ministers to be Members of the General Assembly. 18. He had Power to hold Diocesan Synods. 19. To appoint Fasts within his own Bounds. 20. To modifie Stipends. 21. To receive Appeals. 22. He had Power of Fineing, in case of undue Appeals. 23. To determine intricate Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Government. 24. To judge of Divorces. 25. To enjoyn Pennance to greater Criminals. 26. To restore Criminals. 27. He had the Power of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. 28. To delate attrocious Criminals to the Civil Magistrat 29. They had great Power over Schools and Colledges. 30. They were the Licensers of Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 10. <hi>Quae non prosunt singula, juncta juvant;</hi> here is a large Muster Roll, to Fright the Reader with a numerous and long Train, that might have been, to as much advantage, drawn into a narrower Compass. I shall first, Make some general Observes on all this Heap of <hi>Prerogatives.</hi> Next, Examine them particularlie, but very succinctlie. For the former, I observe, 1. That the Power of <hi>Superintendents</hi> was at first more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and independent on the rest of the Ministers, than afterward; because at first there were hardlie any qualified Ministers; but only Readers, or such as could Catechise the People, newly come out of <hi>Popery;</hi> but when there was a better Stock of qualified Ministers, and yet the Church but meanlie provided, the <hi>Superintendent</hi> was obliged to rule with their Concurrence; and was little other than a constant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator: and his Power was by every General Assembly, abridged, till that Office was at last abolished, as no longer needful in the Church. 2. It is not denyed, but that there was an Imparitie between a <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent</hi> and another Minister: but this was lookt on by our Reformers, not as a standing Office, nor as having any Foundation, but that of present Necessitie: so that it did no way derogate from that Paritie, that they lookt on as the Way that the Church should be Governed; and as what they intended, when their Case should allow it. But of this more afterward. 3. All this cannot make the <hi>Superintendent</hi> and the Bishop, to be the same Officer in the Church; because the one is pretended to be an Officer appointed by Christ, and his Soveraign power over the Presbyters, is by Divine Appointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other is set up by Men, and more or less Power is given to him, as they think fit. The one is accountable to none but Christ, the other is accountable to the Presbyterie, and may be Censured, yea Deprived by them. The
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62347:89"/>
one is lookt on as what should always continue in the Church; the other was designed but for that Exigency of the Church, to be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side when that was over. 4. Not a few of these <hi>Prerogatives</hi> are either asserted, without Ground; or Misrepresented. To make out which, I proceed to the second thing I proposed; <hi>viz.</hi> To Examine them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie: for the first, <hi>The Extent of their District</hi> is no Argument for such Disparitie as he pleadeth for: they had each of them, their proper Charge, as other Ministers; where they were ordinarilie to Labour; but had larger Districts for Visitation. 2. Their <hi>Nomination by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and Election by the Nobility and Gentry,</hi> is asserted without Ground. Neither doth he Cite any Authoritie for it, nor do I find any thing to that purpose in any of our Historians. 3. <hi>A Superintendent could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, but by the Ministers of the whole Province:</hi> This necessarilie follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Charge, or Power of Visiting, being of that Extent. In that he was deposeable by the Ministers, it is evident he was no Bishop, in the Notion that our Brethren have of a Bishop. 4. The same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was for his <hi>being Elected by the Ministers of the Province.</hi> What our Author saith of the <hi>Ordination</hi> of the <hi>Superintendent,</hi> is a foull Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation; as any one may see in the place he citeth, <hi>Spots. hist. lib. 3. p.</hi> 159, 160. Nothing is there mentioned, but Election and Trial; but on the contrarie, it is expreslie said, <hi>other Ceremonies than this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, the Approbation of Ministers and Superintendents, with the publick Consent of Elders and People, we do not admit.</hi> Whence it is evident, that he had no new Office, nor Ordination, above a Presbyter.</p>
               <p>§ 11. His fifth Prerogative is, <hi>He was not to be Translated from one place to another, but by a Council of the whole Church.</hi> This is no Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Jurisdiction. The Extent of his District, to a Province made this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie: there being no Judicature above his Province, but a <hi>General Assembly.</hi> 6. It is least of all Argumentative, that <hi>he was to give good proof of his Qualifications, by being some time in the Ministry:</hi> because the want of due Qualifications in the Generalitie of the Ministry, was the Rise of his Office: therefore he must be the best qualified that can be had. 7. His <hi>greater Benefice</hi> is no Argument: he had more Work, and Occasion for Expense, by Travelling to Visit Churches, than the rest had. It is falslie alledged, that <hi>Spots. p.</hi> 210. saith, <hi>it was agreed, 1567. that the Superintendent should succeed to the Beneflces of the Popish Bishops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived:</hi> there is not such a word in that place: only there, and in the former page, it is agreed, that <hi>the Church should be restored to her Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:62347:89"/>
8. There <hi>being constant Members of the General Assembly,</hi> saith no more, but that there being so few qualified Ministers, these few choice Men were needed in the Assemblies of the Church. 9. His <hi>trying Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Readers,</hi> was from the present necessities of the Church, when Presbyteries could not be had to do it: 10. His <hi>giving Collation</hi> did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on the former Power. 11. The <hi>jus devolutum</hi> for planting a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster fell to him, and his Council. He could not place a Minister by himself, as our Bishops pretended to do: but by the assistance of such Ministers as were fittest to judge, these were his Council; this also was for the present necessity, and want of Ministers to make a Presbytery. 12. His <hi>power of Ordination,</hi> our Author passeth very slightly, and with a general alleging of several Acts of Assemblies. It is like a <hi>Superintendent</hi> might Ordain by himself, when no other Minister could be had to joyn with him: but as soon as Presbyters could be had, it was not so. Our Reformers used no other Ceremonie in Ordination, but Nomination, and Tryal, and Approbation; and it is evident that these were to be performed by the <hi>Superintendent,</hi> with the rest of the Ministers; for <hi>Spotsw. p.</hi> 155. sheweth out of <hi>the Book of Discipline,</hi> that this Tryal and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation was to be performed <hi>by the learned Ministers appointed for their Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> then not by one Man alone. 13. Subjection to him (which our Author is pleased to call <hi>Canonical Obedience,</hi> was a necessarie conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of his Office; but it is to be observed, that in the Assemblie 1562, out of which he allegeth this Passage, <hi>Superintendents</hi> were Tryed and Censured by the Assemblie: and it was appointed that at every Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, they, and Ministers, and Elders should be Tryed, as to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; which looketh not like Episcopacy. 14. His <hi>power of Visitation</hi> was indeed his main Characteristick; but doth not prove Episcopal <hi>juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> it being delegated to him by the Church, and he being Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to her for it. 15. His <hi>power of Deposing</hi> is expresly said to be given him by the Assemblie, and he is ordered to report his Diligence to the next Assemblie; which last, our Author overlooketh. 16. His <hi>Translating of Ministers</hi> is no more, but that his Consent, or that of the whole Church must be had to a Transportation: it was then necessarie when there was no Presbyteries to Judge of such Matters. 17. He great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistaketh when he saith that <hi>the Assemblie Enacteth that Ministers for the General Assemblie should be brought with the Superintendents, &amp;c.</hi> which he will have to be Nominating them, and he alloweth the rest of the Synod but a Consent: whereas <hi>Spotsw. p.</hi> 219. words it, <hi>such as the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62347:90"/>
shall choose in their Diocesan Synods.</hi> If he could choose them by himself, there needed no Synod for this end: that Expression can sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no less than the Synods suffrage in the Election. <hi>My Lord Gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> is no Spiritual Power, and therefore, impertinently here brought in 21. <hi>Appeals</hi> was made to him, and his Synodal Convention: here is no sole Jurisdiction. 22. His <hi>power of Fineing</hi> is no Spiritual Power. 23. <hi>Determining Cases of Conscience, and otheir Questions,</hi> was never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him alone; but in the Synod, and to them. Yea, Questions so determined were to be reported to the General Assemblie next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sewing; so that <hi>Manuscript</hi> that he so often Citeth, <hi>p. 14. 24. To judge of Divorces</hi> is a civil Power: and not to our purpose; 25. It is clear, by his own Relation, that the <hi>Injunction of Pennance</hi> (as he calleth it) is to be by the <hi>Superintendent</hi> with the Synod. 26. <hi>Restoring of Criminals,</hi> or <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi> did the same way belong to him. 27. <hi>Notifying Criminals to the Magistrat</hi> is no part of Jurisdiction. 28. <hi>Excommunication</hi> was not to be done by his sole Authority; but by his Advice. 29. His <hi>Power over Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</hi> And 30. His <hi>Licensing of Booke;</hi> both of them Depend on the Civil Power: and are not to our present purpose. These short Notes may shew how little cause there is for his Triumph, with which he conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this his Enumeration of the <hi>Superintendents Prerogatives.</hi> They prove a Disparity between him and other Ministers, I confess; which the Church in that her State thought necessarie for a time: but on the other hand, it is evident that some of them Prove as much Disparitie from, and inconsistencie with the <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of a Diocesan Bishop, which our Brethren plead for, as belonging to him, <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>

               <p>§. 12. His next Work from <hi>p.</hi> 140. is to <hi>dissipat the Mist wherewith the Paritie Men are so very earnest to darken the Prelatical Power of the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:</hi> he mentioneth Three of their Exceptions.

Is, <hi>it was not intended to be a perpetual standing Office; but was Temporary, and for the then Necessities of the Church.</hi> For this he Citeth <hi>Calderwuod,</hi> and <hi>Petrie</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting this; with whom I do cordially joyn.

                  </gap>e this, he taketh in by force, a Similitude from <hi>the Presbyterians making Address to King James;</hi> a rare, but useless piece of Wit. Ans. If he be concerned for no more than this,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62347:90"/>
we are agreed: And he yieldeth that our Reformers were not Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, but Presbyterian: who in a case of extream Necessity, gave, for a time, more Power to one Minister, than another, but made them all equal assoon as that Necessity was over: It is such an Argument as if there were but one Congregation, with their Minister, and Elders, in an Island; they manage Church Discipline by themselves; but assoon as they encrease, and there are moe People and church Officers, and more Congregations, they set up a Presbyterie, to which all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and their Pastors are Subordinate; will any say that they are <hi>Independents,</hi> because they were forced to Act <hi>Independentlie</hi> at first? there is as little reason to conclude that our Reformers were Episcopal, though they were forced to use a kind of Prelacie for a time. Beside that I have above shewed some considerable Differences between the Prelacie of <hi>Superintendents,</hi> and that of Bishops, which our Brethren plead for.</p>
               <p>§. 13. His second Undertaking is, to shew that <hi>we have no sufficient Ground in the Records of these times, for pretending that the Office of Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents was designed to be Temporal.</hi> To prove his Assertion, he saith, <hi>he hath seen no more insisted on to make out this, but a Phrase in the first Head of the Book of Discipline, at this time.</hi> He transcribeth the whole Passage out of <hi>Petrie, Cent. 16. p.</hi> 218. and so must I, <hi>what was their</hi> (the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents) <hi>Office,</hi> saith he, <hi>appears by the first Book of Discipline, wherein it is written thus, we consider, that if the Ministers whom God hath endued with his singular Graces among us, should be appointed to several places, there to make continual Residence, that then the greatest part of the Realm should be destitute of all Doctrine; which should be not only the occasion of great Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, but also dangerous to the Salvation of many: and therefore we have thought it a thing expedient,</hi> at this time; <hi>that from the whole Number of Godly and learned Men, now presently in this Realm, be selected ten or twelve. (for in so many Provinces we have divided the whole) to whom Charge and Commandment should be given to Plant and Erect Kirks, to set, Order, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Ministers (as the former Prescribed,</hi> to wit, the former Head) <hi>to the Countries that shall be appointed to their Care, where none are now.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is added, <hi>these must not be suffered to live as their idle Bishops have done, neither must they remain where they gladly would; but they must be Preachers themselves, and such as may not make long Residence in one place, till the Kirks be Planted and provided of Ministers,</hi> &amp;c. To this our Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, by giving us a Sense of his own of these Words in the <hi>first Book of Discipline, viz.</hi> that <hi>because there were then so few Qualified for the Office of

Superintendencie, the Ten or Twelve were, by far too few for the whole Kingdom, yet at that time they thought it expedient to Establish no more: and though, when the Church should be sufficiently Provided with Ministers, it will be highly reasonable that the Superintendents should have Places appointed them for their continual Residence, yet in that Juncture it was necessary that they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly travelling into their Districts, to Preach and Plant Churches.</hi> Before I Examine what he saith to Prove this to be the true Gloss of that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, I shall Prove it to be contrarie to, and inconsistent with the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage it self. And 1. There is nothing in that Discourse that doth so much as insinuate the scarcitie of Men fit to be <hi>Superintendents,</hi> but of Ministers fit to Preach to the People; they no way hint that this Setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was fallen upon, because they could not get Men to Oversee other Ministers, but because they could not get Men to Preach to the People in every Congregation, Therefore, they resolve that the few well Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Men that they had should not only each of them, have a fixed Charge of his own, but should be obliged to Preach in other Parishes, and be Impowered to Place Ministers in them, assoon as they could be had. 2. It is a groundless Fancy that they thought Ten or Twelve <hi>Superintendents</hi> too few for the whole Kingdom; for when Ministers increased they made no moe: yea, when afterward, in the times of Defection from our first Establishment of Church Order, they set up Bishops, the Church did not think Twelve too few for the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 3. He doth exceedingly Mistake the Change that our Reformers did intend, as insinuated in that Passage: It was not that <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> should be continually Resident in one Place, wheras they were at present to travel within their District: for in this present Setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had their proper Charge, where they were to Preach, and might Reside there three or four Months, and enter upon their itinerat Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation again: which Course, if they should Break off, they could not do the Work of a <hi>Superintendent;</hi> which was chiefly to Visite and Plant Churches. When this was done, and Places generally provided with fit Pastors, their Work and Office was at an end. 4. <hi>At this time,</hi> doth evidently relate to the Peoples want of Preaching, as the Motive to this Appointment; and to the Planting of Churches, as the End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it. Wherefore, when this End is attained, and <hi>that time</hi> no more Existent (I mean of that Exigence of the Church) there was no more use for them: and the Event Proved, that as that End was by Degrees attained, their Power was gradually Lessened, till they were wholly laid
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62347:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aside. 5. The Words cited make it evident that this was not intended for a lasting Prelacy in the Church; far less for an Episcopacy standing on a <hi>Jus Divinum;</hi> For the Assembly where this <hi>Book of Discipline</hi> was Established, do give them <hi>Charge and Commandment:</hi> they do appoint their Work, set Limits and Bounds to their Power: they Command them in the very Circumstances of their Work; this would be thought strange Presumption in a Meeting of Ministers thus to treat their Bishop. 6. To say that their Authority was designed to be perpetual, but these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions about some part of their Work was to be Temporary; is to speak at Random; and to put what Sense we please on other Mens words; it is to tell us what this Author would have the Reformers to mean, not what is the plain Import of their Words: For the <hi>Commandment and Charge</hi> (these are the Words of <hi>the Book of Discipline)</hi> by which they were made <hi>Superintendents,</hi> did include one part of what is Injoyned as well as another part of it: and when ever this Work that was Injoyned them ceased, their Commission behoved to be renewed: as is obvious to any who readeth the History of our Reformation: their Injunctions were often Changed, till they had no more Work to do, and then they were Abolished.</p>
               <p>§ 14. Let us now hear how this Author will Prove that the Passage under Debate must have the Meaning that he hath put upon it. His first <hi>Argument: the Composers of the first Book of Discipline</hi> (in which that Passage is) <hi>were generally to their Dying day, of Prelatical Principles.</hi> Ans. 1. The Consequence is naught: for however the first Draught of it might be framed by the Six Persons whom he Nameth, out of <hi>Knox, p.</hi> 287. yet let the Reader turn over to the next <hi>page,</hi> where a <hi>Formula</hi> is set down according to which it was Subscribed, and he shall find that they Approved it conform to the Notes and Additions thereto: and it was well known, that some Papers being Amended and Licked over and over again, by many Persons, (as this was) have at last Differed much from what the first Compilers intended. Another thing also may be Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that Form of assenting to <hi>the Book o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Discipline:</hi> that they were careful to Reserve <hi>to Bishops, Abbots, and Priors, and other Prelats, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefic'd Men, which else have Adjoyned themselves to us</hi> (say they) <hi>to brook the Revenues of their Benefices during their Lifetimes; they sustaining and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Ministry and Ministers, as is therein specified, for Preaching of the Word, and Ministering of the Sacraments.</hi> Here the Bishops (even such of them as were Protestants) are put in the same Categorie with Abbots
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62347:92"/>
and Priors; and there is no Provision made for their Spiritual Power, but for their Temporal Goods; and no Successors are intended for them: only they are provided for while they live: yea the Administrators of Word and Sacraments are here contra-distinguished from the Bishops, as well as from Abbots and Priors. Doth any thing here look like Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Principles? yea is not the whole Strain of this Passage contrarie to them? therefore, whatever the first Compilers of the Book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline might be, it is evident, the Approvers of it were not of the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Principles. <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. He sheltereth his Assertion under the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie of Prelatical Principles: if he mean these Men were for <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents,</hi> who had a Temporarie Limited Prelacie, we shall not Debate that with him: if he mean that they were for a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of the Prelacie, that he and his Partie owne; or for a Perpetuitie of any other sort of Prelacie, we shall consider his Proofs for that; which are, <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram and Willock were Superintendents, and so was Spotswood; of whom his Son saith, he was a constant Enemy to Paritie:</hi> this proveth nothing against what I have said; except he can assure us that Arch-Bishop <hi>Spotswood</hi> could not, through Prejudice, and Respect to the Cause he had Espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; mistake and misrepresent his Fathers Opinion in that. <hi>Dowglas</hi> (another of them) was Arch-Bishop of <hi>Saint Andrews.</hi> That proveth him an Apostate from the Way he had owned; and we know how he, and his Way was disliked by the rest of his former Associats: <hi>John Row,</hi> another of them, <hi>defended the Lawfulness of Episcopacy, at a Conference ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the General Assembly,</hi> 1575. Here is a pitiful Shift, and foull Misrepresentation. The Truth of the Storie is (even according to <hi>Spotswood,</hi> as well as <hi>Petrie;</hi> not to name <hi>Calderwood,</hi> lest he alledge that I have read no other Historian) a Question arising in the Assemblie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lawfulness of Episcopacie: six Brethren were appointed to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Question in a Conference, three were appointed to be on the one side, and three on the other; it was <hi>Master Rows</hi> Lot to be on the side of the Lawfulness of Episcopacie: can any Rational Man thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that he was of that Opinion. And if he were of that Opinion, there is enough said to take off any Inference that could thence be made against us. <hi>John Knox</hi> was the other of these Compilers, whom he will make Prelatical; now when he hath been dead a long time; though he was known to be far from such Sentiments while he lived.</p>
               <p>§ 15. For a second Proof of his Sense of the Passage cited out of <hi>the Book of Discipline, p. 145. Knox assignes a quite other Reason than the then Necessities of the Church, for the Establishment of Superintendency. Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62347:92"/>
and Overseers</hi> (saith he) <hi>were nominated, that all things in the Church might be carried on with order and well: this reason is perpetual. Ans.</hi> How weak is this Consequence: for <hi>this reason is perpetual,</hi> that there should be Governours in the Church; because <hi>all things might be carried with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and well:</hi> but it is no reason for that sort of Governours; except in so far as the present case made them necessarie; so that, compare this Passage with that of <hi>the Book of Discipline</hi> above cited, the Sense must be, <hi>Superintendents</hi> were, <hi>at this time,</hi> nominated, that <hi>all things in the Church might be carried with good order and well;</hi> there being then no possibilitie to constitute Presbyteries, by which things could be so managed. He citeth another Passage out of the same Book, <hi>p.</hi> 289. that <hi>John Knox, in a Sermon, asserted the Necessitie (and not the bare Expediencie) of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents. Ans.</hi> Doth this prove a perpetual Necessitie of that Office? it was then not only expedient but necessarie? and this was all that was asserted. Again <hi>John Knox's</hi> words are, <hi>there was a Necessitie of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents or Overseers:</hi> that is, there must be a Government in the Church, and another they could not then attain that they could be satisfied with; and therefore they must set up <hi>Superintendents.</hi> If we duly consider this Passage, it maketh much against him: for supposing the Necessitie of Governours, they might have thus reasoned, if they had been for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, we must have Governours, nothing hindreth to set up Bishops; therefore they are necessarie <hi>at this time;</hi> but this they did not do: therefore they were not for Bishops. But they well reasoned; there must be Governours; but at this time we cannot have Ministers to set up Presbyteries, therefore at this time <hi>Superintendents</hi> are necessarie. He bringeth another Testimonie out of <hi>Knox, p.</hi> 110. (it must be miscited, nothing to that purpose is in that place) <hi>exhorting England that every one of their Bishopricks might be made ten: which</hi> he saith <hi>is a Comment on the Passage in Debate:</hi> and saith, <hi>hence it is clear, that he was for many Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks. Ans.</hi> Nothing but Prejudice could suggest such a Sense of his Words: he is Writing to a People which had settled Bishops among themselves; he did not attempt to alter their Settlement (he knew it was in vain) but he advised them to what might make that way most useful, and what might have brought it as near as possible to the way he was for. I could tell him of just such another Passage in <hi>Doctor Wild's loyal Nonconformist,</hi> though he was for no bishop at all, in our Modern Sense.</p>
               <p>§ 16. He bringeth a third reason, that <hi>this Sense of the Period accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth exactly with the whole Tenor of the first Book of Discipline: where,</hi> he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62347:93"/>
saith, <hi>there is nothing more for the Temporaryness of Superintendency, but much to the contrary.</hi> Let us see then what we can further find (beside the words <hi>at this time)</hi> in <hi>the Book of Discipline,</hi> for <hi>Superintendents</hi> being set up early, for the present Necessitie of the Church. And first, the reason for setting them up, which the Book it self giveth, is temporarie: to wit, the Paucitie of Ministers, and the Necessitie of having the Gospel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in all the parts of the Nation. If the Foundation be temporarie, so must the Superstructure: but this is made the Foundation of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: as is expressed in these words, <hi>and therefore we have thought it expedient, &amp;c. 2. The second Book of Discipline</hi> is a Proof of this beyond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: for it owneth no Officers in the Church but Pastors, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops or Ministers, every one of which was to be fixed in a particular Congregation: and Doctors, and Elders, and Deacons: and these are said to be <hi>such as ought to continue in the Kirk, as necessary, for the Policy and Government of it; and no more Offices ought to be received or suffered in the Kirk of God, established according to his Word; therefore all the ambitious Titles invented in the Kingdom of Antichrist, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Discipline</hi> was but an Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the first, and a Suteing of it to the riper Age that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had then attained: but, it is manifest, that settling <hi>Superindents</hi> by the first Book, was not designed for Perpetuitie. I shall now Examine what he bringeth against the designed Temporari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Superintendents:</hi> the first thing alledged is, <hi>the necessity is brought for being not so strict in examining Superintendents as afterward must be:</hi> I see not wherein this is contrarie to the Presbyterian Gloss (which he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>p.</hi> 145.) seing the necessitie of setting them up had been before as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>itie of qualified Ministers for the Parishes: and now another necessitie is alledged for taking such <hi>Superintendents</hi> as they could get: where is the Inconsistencie of these two. Next, they appoint, that if su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cient Men <hi>cannot be had, Provinces wait till they can be provided, rather than set up insufficient Men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 3. Rules are laid down for supplying the Vacancy, if a Superintendent die. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ns.</hi> To both these; no more follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but that <hi>Superintendency</hi> was to endure for some time: foreseeing that the present necessitie was like, in some degree, to continue for some years: but this is no Argument for its Perpetuitie, or necessitie in all Cases of the Church. 4. <hi>After the Church is settled, and three years past; Directions are given for chusing Superintendents. Ans.</hi> This Passage is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62347:93"/>
only by <hi>Spotswood;</hi> whom I might reject as an insufficient Witness, as well as he casteth <hi>Petrie,</hi> or <hi>Calderwood,</hi> when <hi>Spotswood</hi> doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with them: But I need not such Defence: by <hi>the establishing of the Church</hi> the Reformers cannot mean the compleat Establishment, and being furnished with a sufficient number of well Gifted Ministers: for what needed three years delay after that, before they would require such Choise of <hi>Superintendents:</hi> wherefore, by the settling of the Church must be understood the peaceable Exercise of Church Government, as well as other Ordinances, allowed them by the Magistrat, which then they were contending for: or the peaceable Settlement of the <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency;</hi> that now they were Erecting: that though at present, they must put into that Office such as they could find, they would after that three years, be more exact in their Choise, hoping that, by that time, more qualified Men might be found: this proveth a Design of Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for some time; but not of Perpetuitie of <hi>Superintendency. 5. The Book of Discipline supposeth Colledges and Superintendents to be of equal Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: for the Superintendent was to have a hand in Election of Principles and Rectors, and in Auditing Colledge Accompts. Ans.</hi> If this Argument had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Force, it would prove that Apostles, immediatlie sent by Christ, must continue as long as Churches and Ministers; because they were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Erect the one, and Ordain the other: Yea, he needed no other Argument to prove their Continuance, but that they were to Visit Churches, and plant Ministers; and therefore must continue as long as that were to be done: and so they should for ever shut out, (in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of our Reformers) not only Presbyteries, but the Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: they were to do that Work in the present Exigence: it doth not thence follow that they must continue as long as that Work was to be done.</p>
               <p>§ 17. He hath yet a fourth Argument, to prove that <hi>Superintendents</hi> were designed by our Reformers to be perpetual in the Church. It is taken from some Passages in <hi>Knox,</hi> and the <hi>old Scots Liturgy,</hi> about the Form and Order of the Election of <hi>Superintendents.</hi> 1. The <hi>Necessity of them</hi> is asserted: which I have answered before: Next, <hi>The People are asked if they will obey and honour him as Christs Minister so long as he is faithful: not</hi> (saith our Author) <hi>so long as the present Exigence requireth. The admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Superintendent and of a Minister was one: the whole Form maketh the one to be of Divine Institution, as well as the other: he is said to be called of God, and owned as a Minister of Christ, they who will not submit to him, are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62347:94"/>
said to rebel against God, and his Holy Ordinance. In the Prayer after his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> they composed this Form. Ans.</hi> 1. This is not a Form composed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers to be used on all such occasions: as appeareth by the History it self that he citeth: to which he <hi>(Knox p.</hi> 289.) prefixeth this Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>The Form and Order of the Election of the Superintendent and all other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters; at Edinburgh, March the 9. 1560. John Knox being the Preacher:</hi> also because, in the Prayer, <hi>Lothidn</hi> is mentioned, which could not be in a general Form: This Method <hi>John Knox</hi> at that time used. It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> like it was usual to proceed in this Method: to use these, or the like Questions, to Pray to that Purpose: and if there was then a prescribed Form in that Infancie of the Church, it neither helpeth his Cause much, nor hurteth ours. 2. He acknowledgeth that the Form of Electing and Admitting Ministers and <hi>Superintendents</hi> was the same: and it is evident from the Inscription but now mentioned: which is an Evidence that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency</hi> was not then lookt on as a distinct Office from the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but it was an Application, or Modification, of the Ministerial Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which at that time was necessary. He will not say, that a Bishop nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no other Ordination or Consecration, beside that which maked him a Minister: which is a good Argument to prove that our Reformer did not look on the Distinction of Minister and <hi>Superintendent</hi> as perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and of Divine Right, as the Prelatists do that of Bishop and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 3. My main Answer is, the account that we have in the place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is of the Election and Admission of a Person to the Sacred Office of the Ministry, whither he be to be a <hi>Superintendent</hi> or not: and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it is not by this Admission that he is distinguished from other Ministers further than that his Ministerial Charge is made larger and more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive as to its Bounds: wherefore all the Expressions that my Adversa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> the Chief Charge of, to be their Pastor. Now the Question is not whither this Pastoral Charge, whither in one or more Congregations be Gods perpetual Ordinance; but whither it be such an Ordinance,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62347:94"/>
that the Pastoral Charge of one Person should extend to so many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and whither this Pastor by himself should have Power to Plant Ministers: we say this last was a prudent Constitution of the Church, which that present Exigence did force them upon: by this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission then he was made a Minister according to Christs Institution, and a <hi>Superintendent</hi> too, so far as that Office includeth the Ministry: but wherein it differed from the Ministerial Office, it was of Man and not of God.</p>
               <p>§ 18. He hath yet a fifth Agrument, <hi>p.</hi> 150. which according to his wont, of using the highest Confidence, and biggest Words, when the Strength of his Reasons are lowest, he calleth <hi>Irrefragable.</hi> It is drawn from <hi>several Acts of General Assemblies:</hi> some of which <hi>address to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for Maintainance to them:</hi> others <hi>for Increasing their Number,</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them where none were before: and that when the Church was of four years standing; and when the Number of Qualified Men were somewhat Increased.</hi> One Petitioned, that <hi>all the Popish Clergy should be dispossessed, and that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents, Ministers, and other needful Members, should be Planted in their Places.</hi> Whence he very wisely inferreth, that <hi>Superintendents were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Members of the Church, and that they were to succeed to the Popish Bishops.</hi> This is mentioned by <hi>Spotswood;</hi> but by none else, as himself observeth. <hi>Some Superintendents in the year 1574. would have Dimitted, but the General Assembly ordered them to continue in their Function.</hi> I am so dull as not to see the Strength of this <hi>Irrefragable</hi> Argument; I can see no Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that can be drawn from any thing, or all that he hath said, but that the Churches found the necessity, which occasioned the setting up of <hi>Superintendents,</hi> not to be over in four years; nor wholly in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years: though Qualified Men Increased, yet their Number was very unproportionate to the Necessities of the Church. I look on the Increasing of their Number (which must be a Lessening of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricts) not as tending to perpetuate them; but on the contrary, it was a reducing them by Degrees, to the State of other Ministers; by restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them to a fewer Number of Parishes, and so at last to one. That they were <hi>needful Members of the Church,</hi> at that time, I doubt not; but this doth not prove their designed Perpetuity: that they were to <hi>succeed the Popish Bishops,</hi> is a wild Fancy; that is no more said of them than of other Church Officers, who were to be Planted in the Places where these Bishops had been, and were to be Maintained by their Revenues. He concludeth this head, as is usual with him; with Confident Rehearsing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62347:95"/>
what he hath made evident. The Judicious will judge of his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; and mine too. I agree with him in what followeth, <hi>p.</hi> 153, 154. That <hi>the Superintendents, when Churches were provided, were no more to travel among them;</hi> but I affirm, when they were sufficiently provided, their Work was Confined to one Parish; and that Office ceased in the Church: of which before.</p>
               <p>§ 19. He advanceth now, <hi>p.</hi> 154. to another piece of his Work; to consider our Reasons for the Temporariness of <hi>Superintendency.</hi> The first of them, that he nameth is, the <hi>Force of Necessity,</hi> there being so few Men qualified for the Ministry, scarcely one in a Province: against this he bringeth several Replies, intermixed with an unbecoming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and bitter Reflections. The first is, <hi>this Reason is inconsequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, because that necessity might have been answered by dividing the Nation in as many Parishes as there were qualified Men, and Lessening them as moe qualified Men could be had. Ans.</hi> The course that was taken, was materially the same that he proposeth: only it was necessary, that within these great Parishes, the Minister, or <hi>Superintendent</hi> of it, (call him as you will) should have Power over the Readers and ill qualified Ministers who were set in the several little Parishes, and who could neither dispense the Word suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, nor govern the Church; and should have Power to plant quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Men, as soon as they could be found in these lesser Parishes: and this was the Office of a <hi>Superintendent.</hi> I hope the Reader will see, that this Reply to our Reason is insignificant, and that our Reason is not shewed to be inconsequential. His second is, <hi>this Reason destroyeth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for that could not be the Model that our Lord instituted, which cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the ends of its Institution; as in this case Parity could not do: for here the Church is reduced to that State that the Governours thereof forced by necessity, must lay it aside for a time, and establish a Prelacy. Ans.</hi> This is stranger Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity than what he chargeth in his next Reply on our Reason. It sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, if it have any Sense in it, that all Gods Institutions and Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, do so serve for all the cases that can fall out, that no necessity can excuse a temporal receding from the Observance of them. Which to be evidently false, shall be made appear in Answer to his third Reply (which upon the matter is the same with this) the Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that himself, and other Prelatists, is for, is lyable to the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; and according to his Logick, is <hi>none of Christs Institution.</hi> He, and the rest of them, maintain, that by the Laws of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, there can be no Ordination of a Presbyter without a Bishop,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62347:95"/>
and yet they think themselves warranted by Necessity to allow Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without a Bishop: <hi>Downam,</hi> in his Sermon about Episcopacy, hath this Passage, <hi>posita enim Ecclesia, aut in universum Episcopo destituta, aut conferta Hereticis aut Idolatricis Praelatis, quales Papistici sunt, a quibus nulli Orthodoxi Ministri ordinationem sperare debent, dubitandum non est quin prisci Patres, in tali necessitatis casu ordinationem sine Episcopo fact a permiserint, licet non ut regularem, ordinarii Ecclesiae regiminis regulis respondentem, efficacem ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; quae justificari possit, ubi deest Episcopus.</hi> (I have not his Sermon by me in English, and therefore use the Latine Translation) And he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Concil. Antioch. C.</hi> 10. for it, and pleadeth for it by several Reasons. Here that Learned Person, had in great Esteem in the Episcopal Church, maketh two Cases of Necessity, in which the Model he pleadeth for as Christs Institution, must be receded from. And if Prelatists may allow Presbyters to Ordain in Case of Necessity, why may not Presbyterians allow a single Person to Ordain under the same Force and Cogency? Also <hi>Forbes. Iren. p. 158. &amp; seq.</hi> not only asserteth, but proveth the Force of Necessity to warrant such things: withal asserting the <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi> of Episcopacy: and he insisteth at length to prove this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from Scripture and Antiquity; that Presbyters may Govern and Ordain in want of a Bishop.</p>
               <p>§. 20. His <hi>Third</hi> Rply is, <hi>it is strange Divinity, that Paritie is of Christs Institution, and yet may be laid aside in case of necessity:</hi> and here he falleth heavily on, <hi>G R.</hi> for asserting what this may be inferred from: and taketh occasion to reproach him. I find no more shew of reason in this part of his Discourse (though there be many bitter and harsh words in it) but this, that <hi>if we may do so in one thing, we may do so in all things.</hi> Ans. I shall shew that this is no <hi>strange Divinity,</hi> and then Answer his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against it. It is not rare Divinity; for I have already shewed that <hi>Dounham</hi> and <hi>Forbes</hi> (Men of the first Rank among his own Partie) teach the same. That it is is not against Scripture nor Reason (and therefore not strange) I Prove, 1. It is taught by Christ himself: it was Gods Command that the Sabbath should be strictly observed, the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth no express exeption from this Rule: yet our Saviour maketh the case of Necessity to be a just Exception; in that he Defended his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>plucking the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath day:</hi> and that by other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, where Necessity had the same influence: <hi>Luke 6. 1, &amp;c. David</hi> appoved by Christ, in the place cited, thought it no <hi>strange Doctrine:</hi> it was the Institution of God that none should eat the <hi>Shew Bread</hi> but the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62347:96"/>
Priests: <hi>David</hi> and his Men were no Priests, and yet their Necessity did warrant their eating of it. The Apostles thought it no <hi>strange Doctrine:</hi> who (though they knew that the Jewish Ceremonies were abolished, and become unlawful to be used after the Resurrection of Christ; and though <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Galatians</hi> when the case of Necessity was now over, that <hi>Christ should profit them nothing if they were Circumcised;</hi> yet they enjoyned the Observation of some of these Ceremonies, and pleaded Necessity for it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. and 29, verses. <hi>Paul</hi> Circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> Acts 16. 3. used the Ceremonies proper for the Jewish votaries, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 23, 24. enjoyned forbearance to them who observed the Jewish Ceremonies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. though out of that case of Necessity, he severely condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Observation. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11. 2. Reason, as well as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth plead for this influence of Necessity, on humane Actions. For 1. Necessity (I mean such as the Providence of GOD without our sin, bringeth us into) is a Declaration of GOD'S will; now this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contrarie to that Declaration of his will that is made in his Word; when the Word and Necessity seem to clash (for they can never be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconsistent, being both from GOD) and if in that case we should sin by yielding to Necessity, we should be under a Necessity of sinning; which no Divine will say a man can be under, without his own fault: To take the present case for an Example: let us suppose Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Paritie is Christs Institution; suppose also that there are so few Ministers that there cannot be Men got to supplie Places, but such as are palpably insufficient for the Work: here is a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ordinances must be neglected, or unduely managed, by these Men; or on the other hand, they who are Qualified must be set over these for a time, to Preach now and then in their Places; to Direct and injoyn them what is right, to Plant the Places with Qualified Men when they can be got: all which is supposed to be cross to the letter (I do not say to the Meaning and Design) of the Institution; in the first Case, the Church should sin in neglecting that which is the main Design of all Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Institutions, <hi>viz.</hi> Edification, and Saving of Souls; therefore, she doth not sin on the other hand, by crossing the Letter of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: otherwise she should be under a Necessity of sining, without her own fault bringing her under that Necessity. 2. Although our LORD did forsee all the Cases and Circumstances, in which his Church was to be unto the end of the World, and could have fully Provided for them all, by giving distinct Laws suted to every one of them; yet infinite
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62347:96"/>
Wisdom thought fit to give Laws for regulating the ordinary cases of the Church, leaving these that are rare, and Extraordinary to be Managed according to the general Rules of Scripture, and sound reason, because distinct Laws for all possible Cases, would have swelled the BIBLE to a bigness which would have made it less useful to us; and of this it may be said, as of a Case not unlike to it, <hi>John 20. 30, 31. The World could not have contained,</hi> at least Men could not have Read, and Retained, the Contents of all <hi>the Books that should have been Written;</hi> no doubt, when GOD made the Law forbidding that the <hi>Shew Bread</hi> should be eaten by any but by the Priests, he forsaw what case <hi>David</hi> and his Men would be in: but he thought it not fit to provide for that Case by an Express Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Law; but left it to be Ordered by his more general Laws: Even so it is in the Case that we Dispute about.</p>
               <p>§. 21. I shall now Answer his Reason brought against this yielding to Necessitie, in cases of Divine Institution which is, that <hi>if Necessitie can oblige Christians to forsake, or to cross Institution in one Case; why not in all Cases.</hi> The Consequence that this his Question implyeth, we simply Deny. And I may Confidently say, that himself, in his cooler thoughts, will be ashamed of it at least he will have few Men of Sense, whether Learned or unlearned, that will allow such a Consequence. Farless, that will Joyn wit him in what followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>crossing Institution when forced to it by the Law of Necessity; what is it else than to open a door to Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticism, to Infidelity, to Apostasie; and to all imaginable kinds of Antichristian Perfidie, and Villanie?</hi> To clear this Matter, and to still this Noise, and that the Reader may understand this Debate about the Force of <hi>Necessitie</hi> better than this learned Author seemeth to do: I shall shew when Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie may warrant an Action, which without such Necessitie were unwarrantable, and when not. 1. It is not feigned or pretended Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie that can have this Force: we are far from thinking that it is a sufficient Excuse when on hath done an evil thing, to say there was Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie for it, I could not shun it; if our Reformers did but pretend Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie for setting up <hi>Superintendents,</hi> or if we do but pretend it for them; if my Antagonist can prove (as he hath alleged) that there was no Necessitie for it, but that if they had been for Paritie; they might have Promoted the Gospel without thus diverting from it, <hi>for a time;</hi> we shall quit this Argument; GOD is Judge in that case, whether the Necessitie be real, or only pretended; And in many cases, Man may Judge, and Punish them who break the Law, and pretend Necessitie
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62347:97"/>
for their Action. 2. It must be a Necessitie of GOD'S making, not of our own bringing on; as I hinted before; If either a Church, or a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, do sinfully bring themselves under a Necessitie of Transgressing the Law; the sinful Cause maketh the Action sinful which is consequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to it. 3. The Necessitie that we shelter our Actions under must not only be of the Means, nor only of the End, but of both. I suppose a Man cannot save his Life, his Libertie, or Estate, but by doing what is sinful, or omitting what is a Moral and perpetual duty, or is such <hi>hic et nunc</hi> Here is the Necessitie of Means, but it cannot excuse him because there is no Necessitie of the End, it is not necessarie that we should Live, be at Libertie, nor that we have Estates; there is neither an absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of these nor comparative Necessitie: none of them is so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie as it is to keep a good Conscience, and to please GOD; and shun sin. Again suppose the End be necessarie V. Gr. to advance the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Religion; but this End may be attained to by means that do no way cross any of GOD'S Institutions; to do what is cross to Institution, in that case is no way Excusable: For there is no necessitie of the Mean. If my Antagonist can shew that either the End of setting up <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> was needless; or that that could be attained without encroaching a little on Paritie, <hi>for a time;</hi> then shall we no more plead Necessitie for what they did; but judge that they were not for Paritie in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. 4. We distinguish, with respect to the Force of Necessitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these Actions which are Moral from their Nature, and these that are Moral only by Institution. How far Necessitie may Warrant, or not Warrant an Action against the Moral-Law, I shall not now Dispute; our present Debate, not being concerned in that Question: it is evident that there are some cases in which Necessitie, even in such Actions, hath place, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons Marrieing their Sisters; of which <hi>Lyra</hi> and <hi>Menochius</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. say, <hi>Initio mundi necessè fuit Sorores Fratribus nubere.</hi> And it is also certain that no Necessitie can dispense with some other Actions that are naturally Moral; such as Blasphemy, Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in Matters of Institution, the LORD hath not so strictly bound his People, nor made his Institutions to clash with the natural and indispensible Commands that he hath laid on them: as is evident, in <hi>David's</hi> case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned: If Institution, in some Circumstances that the LORD hath cast his People in, do clash with the Moral Dutie of saving Life: this Moral Dutie superceedeth the Obligation of Institution, in that time, and in that case, much more when present Circumstances make
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62347:97"/>
Institution to clash with the great End of Institution; as in the case in hand: without dispensing with Paritie in this case, the End of Church Government had been lost; <hi>viz.</hi> the Edification of the Church, and Promoting the Reformation. If any should object, that this is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing with the Law of GOD: I Answer, it is not Mans dispensing with GOD'S Law; but his Judging that GOD, in that Case, dispenseth with his own Law; or as <hi>Aquinas 2. 2. Q. 88. Art. 10. Fit ut hoc quod erat lex non sit lex, in hoc casu,</hi> and 1. 2. <hi>Q. 96. Art. 6. Qui in casu Necessitatis agit praeter verba Legis, non judicat de ipsa Lege, sed judicat de casu singulari in quo videt verba legis observanda non esse.</hi> And indeed, to denie all Influence of true, real, and innocent Necessitie, to change the Moralitie of some Actions, especially these that relate to Instituted Worship, were to put Mens Consciences on such a Rack, as there were some times, no possibilitie to attain to well grounded Peace. And on the other hand, I hope what is said will Defend this Opinion from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid consequence that he is pleased to draw from it: especially when we consider, that this influence of Necessitie must be but for a time; not perpetual: because it is not to be thought, that any of GODS Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are so contrived, as to be always unpracticable: or that the LORD will bring his Church, or any Person, under such a lasting Necessitie, that they never can do what he hath Commanded, they using their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavours to observe all that he hath Commanded, as is injoyned <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 20. I shall not Determine what Necessitie of Omission one may be perpetually under; but I understand not how this can be with respect to possitive Acts contrarie to Institution.</p>
               <p>§ 22. He dealeth with a Second Plea that he imputeth to us, <hi>p.</hi> 157, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why our Reformers are not to be thought Episcopal in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, notwithstanding of their setting up <hi>Superintendents,</hi> which is; that these <hi>Superintendents</hi> did very much differ from Bishops, in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that our Adversaries have of Bishops: The Author of the <hi>Ten Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions</hi> calleth that a <hi>New Modell of Episcopacy.</hi> To take off this <hi>Calderwood</hi> bringeth some Differences between them and Bishops: and <hi>Vindicat: in Answer to the Ten Questions,</hi> mentioneth also some of them, and Addeth what after he confesseth to be Material. All which he is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>ridicule,</hi> with his wonted Insolencie: but I am consident the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader will easily discern who is most Ridiculous; he that Proveth a <hi>Superintendent</hi> not to be the same with a Bishop, from his Election, Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and Admission: that he had no new Consecration, as Bishops
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62347:98"/>
must have, and so was in no Superior degree to a Presbyter: that there were no <hi>Arch-Superintendents</hi> as there were Arch-Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or he who compareth these to <hi>the ordinary Habit of the one, with the State and Grandeur of the other in their distinguishing Marks:</hi> which yet, if not set down in such scurrile terms, as he useth, may make a great Difference between the Temper of the one sort of Men and that of the other; though not of their Office or Power. If our Reformers had intended to continue that sole Jurisdiction of Prelats in the Church, which they found settled in it under Poperie, this Change that they made, even in these things, is unaccountable: nor can a Reason be given why they kept not to the old District that the Bishops had before Governed. It is as evident, as any thing can be made at such a distance of time, that the <hi>Superintendents</hi> never had that absolute Power in the Church that our Episcopal Brethren now allow to their Prelats. Though we denie not that they had a Frelacie, and more Power than We now give to single Presbyters; and have given the Reason why it was so, and of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence with the design of our Reformers, that the perpetual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church should be by Paritie. The main Difference between the two sorts of Church Rulers which we insist on, and which himself acknowledgeth to be Material, he falleth upon, <hi>p.</hi> 159. and sayeth he <hi>must be serious in it;</hi> is, <hi>Superintendents were made obnoxious to the Tryal and Censures of Ministers within their own Dioces.</hi> The Truth of which, and that it <hi>neither was so with Bishops in the Primitive Church, nor should be so now,</hi> he doth freely Profess. But he putteth his Wit to its utmost stretch, to get a fair Answer to it. He bringeth no less than Five Answers, whereas one good one had been Worth them all. His first Answer hath some what of Ingenuitie in it. He condemneth our Reformers in this; and sayeth, <hi>it was a great Error in their Constitutions,</hi> and declames against it with great Vehemencie, that <hi>Governours should be Subject to the Censure of their Subjects;</hi> and sheweth a great deal of Zeal for absolute Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in Church and State: into Debate about which I shall not now enter: only I take Notice, that here he fairly gives up that part of our Controvesie, that he hath been at a vast deal of pains about; that our Reformers were Episcopal in their Principles. With which I am sure, this is wholly inconsistent. If he had thought of this sooner, and Acted consequentially to it, after this Thought came into his Head, he he might have saved a greas deal of pains to himself, and Me: and near the Half of his long Book might have been spared. His <hi>second</hi> Answer
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62347:98"/>
                  <hi>is, this was put in their Constitution from a Principle about civil Government owned by them, that the King is Major singulis, but Minor omnibus:</hi> which he also Ridiculeth. Neither am I concerned to Debate this Principle, it doth not belong to our our present Controversie. But what he assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is a groundless Conjecture; we have better ground to think that they lookt on this as according to the Laws of the Gospel; which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth Church Domination. His Third is, <hi>they made also Ministers Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureable by their Elders;</hi> and from thence taketh occasion to Reproach them, as having little Skill in Church Policy: nor will I degress into these Debates; only I take Notice, that what he saith is no Answer to our Exception, but rather a Confirmation of it: if both a <hi>Superininten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> was Censureable by the Synod, and the Ministers by the Eldership; it doth evidentlie follow, that the <hi>Superintendents</hi> and the Bishops power were not the same. A Fourth Answer is, <hi>this was never put in Practice.</hi> Reply, It will be very hard for him to Prove this Negative: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was or not, it sheweth that our Reformers did not intend Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy when they set up <hi>Superintendents.</hi> His Fifth is, <hi>this Constitution doth not infer Parity.</hi> Reply, We do not say that <hi>Superintendents</hi> were in absolute Parity with other Ministers; we confess a disparity of Power, for that time. All we plead is, that our Reformers were not for Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, even in that case of Necessity: and the Imparity that they were then forc't to; they did not intend should always continue.</p>
               <p>§. 23. The other Plea he mentioneth hath its Rise from his own fancie: it was not used by us: what he citeth for it, was not used either for its Advantage, or disadvantage, but an occasional Observation cast into a Parenthesis, to shew that it was merely the Deed of the Church; however, it might afterward be taken notice of by <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Our Author now, <hi>p.</hi> 166. imagining that he hath dispelled all the Mists cast by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians on what he pleadeth for, about the Principles of our Reformers, with respect to Church Government; proceedeth to give us Accompt of a <hi>second Modell that Church Government was cast into:</hi> But as an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to this, he falleth on the Mistakes and weaknesses of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, with the Preface of a pretended unwillingness to expose them so; the sincerity of which pretension the Reader may Judge of, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the whole of this Discourse is wholly Impertinent; for we are to consider their Actions rather than guess at their Motives: if the Reader also reflect on his <hi>page</hi> 7. where he reproacheth our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>a violent and disordered Reformation.</hi> Their weakness he exposeth
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62347:99"/>
in two things: one is, that <hi>they went on this Principle, that the best way to Reform the Church was to recede as far from the Papists as they could: to have nothing in Communion with them but the essentials, the necessarie and indispensible Articles and Parts of Christian Religion, what else was in its nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and not positively and expresly Commanded in the Scripture, if it was i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fashion in the Popish Church, was therefore to be laid aside, and avoided as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Corruption, as having been abused, as made Subservient to Superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi> Here is a false representation of our Reformers, and that in three things. 1. This Principle was never held nor Practised by them, in the Latitude nor extensiveness that he mentioneth: they indeed were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Religious Ceremonies devised by Men,</hi> as on other Grounds, so on Accompt of their being <hi>Symbols of Idolatrie and Superstition,</hi> and having been so used: but there were many parts of Religion that were not fundamental, but of inferior Note that they did not so deall with. 2. They never Rejected any thing that was truelie a part of true Religion, and was peculiar to it, whether it were of greater or lesser Moment, onlie on the Ground he mentioneth: but always were able to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasons for their Opinion or Practice. 3. They always were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive what could be, by good consequence, proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though it were not positively and expresly Commanded, I advise my Adversarie, if he have little regard to the reputation of the Reformers, that he would be more careful not to Wound his own, by speaking what is not Truth. For the Principle it self, duly stated according to what I have said, I am willing to Debate it with him; but that is not his business, but rather to expose it by Invectives. The next thing that he Representeth them in as weak, is, <hi>they were for the Revenue that had belonged to the Church in Poperie, to be Imployed still for the Churches use.</hi> I think, this Debate is little to our purpose, and therefore I wave it,</p>
               <p>§ 24. His next Attempt is, to prove that there was a <hi>second Model</hi> of the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the publick Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reformation; and that this was Episcopacy. And here he bringeth a Labyrinth of History, in which it is hard for any Man to follow him: rejecting what ever disliketh him; and casting Dirt on all that have written the History of our Reformation, not sparing <hi>Spotswood</hi> himself, when he doth not please him: only he hath had the hap to light on a <hi>Manuscript,</hi> out of which he alters, adds, and contradicteth all the other Accounts that we have of the Affairs of our Church; whence that <hi>Manuscript</hi> came, what Authority it hath; whither it be
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62347:99"/>
his own, or any other Mans, he is not pleased to tell us. He calleth it <hi>his Manuscript,</hi> whether he would have us take him for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or for the Owner of it, I cannot determine: nor do I see what Title he hath to it on either Account; I have the present use of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript,</hi> which (as I am credibly informed) is the very individual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that he had, which now belongeth to the <hi>University of Glasgow:</hi> Whether any other Copies of it be extant, I am uncertain: It was Transcribed by <hi>William Laing</hi> Reader of <hi>Ebdie</hi> Kirk, in the year 1638. It containeth the Acts of the General Assemblies from 1560 to 1616 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive, and other things relating to Church Affairs. I shall in a few Words shew how little Advantage he hath by this <hi>Manuscript,</hi> by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is far from setting forth our Reformers as enclined to Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prcy: and by pointing at some of his false Citations out of it; for the former, it will be evident to them who without Byass, consider the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Passages: <hi>Assembly 1562 p.</hi> 6. not the <hi>Superintendent</hi> alone, but they with the Ministers and Elders, are to <hi>expone to the Kirk, the State of the Kirk among them, and note Offences; that the Kirk may find some Remeed for them; p. 7. Superintendents as well as other Ministers are removed, and tryed in Order to Censure by the Assembly:</hi> so also <hi>p.</hi> 8. and almost every where: This looketh not like Episcopal Jurisdiction; <hi>p. 7. Sess.</hi> 4. the Assembly giveth Power to <hi>Superintendents, to transport Ministers,</hi> but with this express Limitation; that <hi>it be done in the Synod, and with Consent of the most part of the Ministers and Elders. Ibid. Sess.</hi> 3. Speaking of <hi>Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such as have unduly entered into the Ministry,</hi> it is said, <hi>this Act is to have strength as well against them that are called Bishops, as others, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any Ministry in the Kirk:</hi> Where even the Name of Bishops (as then used) seemeth to be disliked, and their Prelation disowned, and their Subjection to the Ministers met in an Assembly supposed, so far were they from owning sole or superior Jurisdiction in them. <hi>Assembly 1565. p. 21. Ministers must be tryed</hi> (at their Entry) <hi>by Learned Men of the Kirk, such as are presently the Superintendents appointed thereunto:</hi> where the Perpetuity of the <hi>Superintendents</hi> Office, and Power is disowned: they for the present, not always, were to do that Work: also that their Power is derived from the Assembly, not Divine Institution, is plainly insinuated. <hi>Assembly</hi> 1566. A Petition to the Council with Expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against <hi>the Queens restoring the Arch-Bishop of Saint Andrews to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction:</hi> where they affirm that <hi>the Causes for the most part judged by his usurped Authority belong to the true Kirk, Ibid.

The Bishop of <hi>Dunkel rebuked for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Lords Supper on Work days.</hi> They were then so Shy of a fixed and perpetual Prelation among Ministers; that it was Enacted, <hi>Anno 1575. p.</hi> 70. at the end, that <hi>to shun Ambition and Inconveniency to the Kirk, Commissioners for Visiting Provinces should be Changed every year.</hi> In the beginning of that <hi>Assembly,</hi> when the Tryal of the Doctrine and Conversation of <hi>Bishops, Superintendents,</hi> and other Ministers was menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>John Dury</hi> one of the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh, Protested that the Tryal of Bishops prejudge not the Opinion, and Reasons that he, and other Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren has to oppone against the Office and Name of a Bishop.</hi> This is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Pitch that his <hi>new Model</hi> of Episcopacy (as he calleth it) came to from 1571. to 1575, when (we deny not) there was a Declension from the Purity of Church Government, endeavoured by some Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Ambitious Church Men, their Tools. But from this time Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry began to Revive, and gather Strength, till at last it was fully set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: For in the <hi>Assembly</hi> 1575. it was questioned whether the <hi>Office of Bishops was Founded on the Word of God, p.</hi> 71. and some appointed to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate on either Side. <hi>Bishops are appointed to chuse a particular Flock, where they must ordinarily Labour.

That none Vote in Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies but Superintendents, Commissioners, and Ministers brought with them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Commissioners of Shires, Burghs, and Universities: And that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Commissioners be Chosen at the Synodal Convention, with Consent of the rest of the Ministers, and Gentlemen Conveened at the Synod.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Manuscript</hi> (it is <hi>p.</hi> 10.) saith, that <hi>every Superintendent within his own Jurisdiction, cause warn the Shires, Towns, and Parish Kirks, to send their Commissioners to the Assembly, declaring to them the Day and Place.</hi> Here is nothing like what he Citeth: and if it were so as he saith, it could not infer the <hi>Superintendents</hi> Nominating the Commissioners to the Assembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is plain that they were Chosen by the Synod: and that the Synods Consent was no less an Act of Authority, than if it had been said, it must be done by their Vote. These things out of that <hi>Manuscript,</hi> I
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62347:101"/>
have here cast together, because I had finished this Work before it came to my hand, and therefore could not so conveniently dispose them in their several Places.</p>
               <p>§ 25. I shall not any further take notice of this Historical Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, than to make some short Remarks on it, hoping that a History of these Affairs may ere long be ready for the Press, from which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a full Account, with more Truth and Candor, than what is to be found in his Discourse. 1. I deny not (nor do I know any that ever denyed) but there was so much ground for his telling us of a <hi>second Model</hi> of the Government of the Church; that the first Endeavours of the Reformers, for shunning the old Hierarchy that was under Popery, met with some Interruption and Opposition; the Causes were evident, the Covetousness of some Courtiers, and other States Men; and the Ambition and Unfaithfulness of some Church Men: there were At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to set up Episcopacy, and they had some degree of effect; but they were always opposed; and the Designs of the Prelatical Party could never succeed, as they wished; but at last, after much Wrestling, Presbytery was settled in its Vigour, in the year 1592. Wherefore his tedious Citations to prove that the Church did some things that cannot well be reconciled with Parity, in that Interval of her Declension and Confusions, was needless Labour, which I do not envy him the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of, seing he was pleased so to imploy his Leasure Hours; I have elsewhere Debated some of these Passages, with the same Author (if I mistake not) nor do I find any thing that now he bringeth which is new, save insolent Contempt, and ill Words; which I can easily beat from a Man of his Temper; nor will I make equal Returns to these his Complements. 2. I observe, that when <hi>p.</hi> 143. he is giving account of the Alteration that was endeavoured, toward the setting up of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy; he bringeth Reasons for the States Men, and Reasons for the Church men, that might move them; and that with as much Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as if he had been at the Consult; <hi>the States Men considered that Episcopacy was still established by Law; the Ecclesiasticks made one of the three Estates; and to take it away was to shake the Civil Constitution; and they might have been called to an account for it, when the King should come to Age; who was then Minor:</hi> But this is a pure Fallacy: the Bishops were still by Law possessed of their Temporalities, Revenues, and Parliamentarie Priviledges; but not of their Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction: it was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of these, not of this, that the Courtiers were accountable for,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62347:101"/>
with respect to the Civil Constitution. That <hi>this was the best way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Right of the Church;</hi> is said without Book; unless he can prove that Christ gave her such Rights; her Civil Rights might have been, and afterward were, otherwise preserved. It was very evident, that many of the States Men were Acted by other Motives, (I do not say all of them were for a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> or Acted Conscienciously) even to get the Revenues in their hands. Which he doth plainly enough confess, while <hi>page</hi> 189. he telleth us of their <hi>Playing their Tricks, and Robbing the Church.</hi> For the Reason that he maketh the Clergy go upon, <hi>viz. The ill Effects of the former Scheme, laid in the first Book of Discipline, that had arisen to the Church:</hi> there is no Hint given by him of any such ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as apprehended by the Men of that Time; except that they who designed a Change for their own Ends, would readily pretend some such thing; neither he, nor any else, can prove that any Detriment to the true Interests of Religion, did arise from it: It is evident, that some Church Men had a design to advance themselves; though they were disappointed, as to the advantagious part of their design, they got the Titles, and the great Men got the Revenues; which he would fain deny or dissemble: but it is so evident, that he must contradict our plainest Histories, if he deny it. 3. That another was Moderator in the General Assembly, than a Bishop, is brought as an Argument that Prelacy was not got to its height, even by the greatest Efforts the Party could make at that time. All he saith to this is, <hi>that George Buchannan was chosen Moderator in the General Assembly 1567. which yet inferreth not the Ruine of Presbytery.</hi> The Strength of this Evasion is soon taken off: the Episcopal Church look on Bishops as so far above Presbyters; that it is Essential to them to Rule, and the Presbyters to be Ruled by them; so that for a Bishop to be a single Member of an Assembly, and a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter to be Moderator, is inconsistent with the Bishops <hi>Prerogative;</hi> but Presbyterians hold no such distinguishing Principle; they think a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is in a superior Order above a Non-Preaching Elder: but do not think that the one hath Jurisdiction over the other; but that both have equal Ruling Power: and therefore, though it be now so Customary, that only Ministers preside in our Meetings, that it would be thought odd, if it should be otherwise, yet for a Ruling Elder (such as <hi>Master Buchannan</hi> was) and a Man of his singular Eminency, to preside in a Meeting, is not against any Principle of Presbyterians, that I know of; (tho the Way we use is most Rational, and Decent, and there is no
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62347:102"/>
Reason for receding from it.) But to make this Observation yet stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>Calderwood p.</hi> 56. (if I may Name him without Firing this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Choller; and being Charged with <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>knowing no other History)</hi> telleth us, that never one of them had the Credit to be Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the General Assembly; which is a Token (I shall not speak in his Dialect, <hi>an infallible Demonstration)</hi> that their Episcopal Jurisdiction was not then owned by the Church.</p>
               <p>§ 26. A fourth Observation I make on his Historical Debate is, that he endeavoureth to prove, against <hi>Petrie</hi> and <hi>Calderwood;</hi> that <hi>the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles at Leith were approved by the General Assembly; that Episcopacy was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> approved; that it cost much Stuggling before it could be Abolished.</hi> What he gaineth by all this I know not. The Opposition that was made to that Way did soon appear, and it was soon abolished: that it is said, that <hi>it was not allowed by the General Assembly,</hi> is only meant of the first Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly that sat a few Weeks after the Agreement at <hi>Leith;</hi> though afterward the Party grew stronger and got it approved; I know none that asserteth that it was never approved in any General Assembly, though his Proofs that he bringeth for its being approved, might tempt one to think that it was never approved, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>they sat in Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and voted, and that even as Bishops:</hi> Their sitting and voting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that they were tollerated: what he meaneth by sitting and voting <hi>as Bishops,</hi> I do not well understand: that Reduplication must either import the Exercise of the Episcopal Authority, or it is a Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sense, or Signification: now that they Exercised Episcopal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in any of the Assemblies, I do not find, nor doth he attempt to prove it. The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Saint Andrews, being present, and first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a Committee,</hi> (as <hi>p.</hi> 203.) is such an Argument for Episcopal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, as the Papists use not a few for <hi>Peters Supremacy:</hi> that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents are continued (ibid.)</hi> is a weak Argument, for <hi>the Assemblies approving Bishops of the second Model,</hi> as he calleth it. It is another such Argument, that <hi>the Assembly declare what they mean by the Names Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Deans, &amp;c. and wish these changed into Names less offensive:</hi> that <hi>the Articles agreed on at Leith</hi> (which contain his <hi>second Model) are voted by the Assembly to be received but for an Interim.</hi> These and some more of the same, or like Importance, are his Arguments for the Approbation of Episcopacy by the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> at that time. I do not say they Acted as Men for the Divine Right of Parity: it was a time of Temptation, and many yielded too far: but there was a Party that did
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62347:102"/>
not thus Comply, and who prevailed to get this Yoke cast off at last: many of the Acts of the Assemblies that he citeth, do Direct the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Limit their Power, and appoint them to be subject to the General Assembly; and to have no more Power than <hi>Superin endents</hi> had: this looketh like no good Will to Episcopacy: but a Hedging it in, when they could not, for present, cast it wholly out. But he will prove, <hi>p. 212, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>all this was out of no Dislike to Episcopacy:</hi> and that by <hi>a Petition consisting of nine Articles, drawn by the General Assembly, 1574. Wherein Bishops are several times mentioned, and that as Acting as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, in Naming Ministers for Places;</hi> (where yet <hi>Superintendents</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> are also mentioned, as equally concerned in that Work) <hi>yea in one of these Articles, it is desired, that Qualified Ministers might be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for vacant Bishopricks.</hi> This proveth no more, but that the major part of this Assembly thought fit, that seing Men, bearing the Name of Bishops (for little more they had) were for an <hi>Interim</hi> tollerated in the Church, their Places should neither be vacant, nor filled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient Persons. All this may well consist with a Dislike of that Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power of Bishops that some were Aspiring to, and that my Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist pleadeth for.</p>
               <p>§ 27. Our Author thinks he hath now done his Work, and proved that <hi>Prelacy was privatly and publickly liked, from the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> it seems he hath argued himself into a Belief of it, (such is the Efficacy of Prejudice) which few else will be perswaded of. He thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his further Work needless (and I think it had been more for his Credit to let it alone) it is, to prove that <hi>Presbytery met with Opposition:</hi> and I could seldom observe that any good Design was carried on, but Satan raged against it, and found Instruments against it: his former Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Discourse he justly calleth <hi>Nauseous, p.</hi> 216. But what followeth is much more so; and yet worse: for he falleth to downright Railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Master <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> in not only a nausebus Gingling Strain of Words, but with such Unmanly Bitterness, as a tender Conscienced Christian would abhor; yea a Person of common Morality would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of: and is only fit for the Scolding Women that have lost all Shame. The foull Misrepresentation of Matters of Fact, which have some Semblance of Truth in them, that this Narrative aboundeth with, I leave to the History, that I hope may appear ere long, to correct them: I am no further concerned than with what is Argumentative: of which I can find nothing here: for we deny not that there was then, as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62347:103"/>
now, an Episcopal Party, who were loath to let go their hoped for, or enjoyed Church Preferments. That after Master <hi>Melvil appeared was the first time that any appeared for Presbytery in Scotland, or against Episcopacy,</hi> is a daring Assertion; after which we may expect whatever he shall think to be for his Interest; considering what hath been already addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of <hi>the Book of Discipline.</hi> One who readeth this his Historical Discourse, may easily perceive what Shifts he is put to, for proving the <hi>Regent Mortons</hi> Change from Episcopacy, to favour Presbytery; and to prove his Intentions in some of his Actings, and that by a long Train of Arguments. To prove that <hi>England, though Episcopal, did endeavour to promote Presbytery in Scotland. To prove the Ignorance of the Clergy of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land at that time.</hi> To prove <hi>Beza to be ignorant of the Government and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the ancient Church, (p.</hi> 248.) and that not out of his own Book, (which it seems he had not read) but out of his Adversary, <hi>Saravia:</hi> and indeed he proveth <hi>Beza's</hi> Ignorance by such Instances as will serve for any Presbyterian, and conclude them all to be <hi>Ignoramus's,</hi> which I know is this Authors Opinion, oftner than once or twice expressed. I pass with a transient Observation, his bitter Sarcasm against Days of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Fasting and Humiliation, often appointed by Presbyterians, <hi>p.</hi> 254. It had been good his own Party had used them oftner; and that they and we had improved them better. I take notice also of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so very great a Difference, between <hi>the Meetings of Ministers and Elders for Exercises</hi> (that is, for Interpretation of Scripture) <hi>and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries which were set up:</hi> on account whereof, he representeth it as a great deal of Ignorance in one who affirmed, that <hi>the real Exercise of Presbytery, in all its Meetings, lesser and greater, continued, and was allowed, in the year</hi> 1572. I deny not but that there was a Difference between these two Sorts of Meetings, as there is between a Child and a full grown Man, <hi>viz.</hi> The Meetings for Exercise, or Presbyteries, (call them what ye will) did at first meddle with fewer Acts of Church Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than afterward: yet they Acted with Authority. For the <hi>Ministers and Elders met to interpret Scripture;</hi> I hope the Elders were not Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by publick Teac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ng, as well as the Ministers: the People, no doubt, were also present at these Exercises, as Hearers, but the Elders are mentioned as Constituent Members of a Meeting, wherein the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had no Share, which must be an Authoritative Meeting. King <hi>James</hi> the sixth was far from his Opinion about these Meetings; who in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> 1603. in the second days Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62347:103"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 78, 79. when Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> moved that the Clergy might meet once every three Weeks for <hi>Prophesying:</hi> as Bishop <hi>Grindal</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops desired of her late Majesty; the King being stirred at this, said, <hi>that they aimed at Scottish Presbytery.</hi> He looketh on it as ridiculous that <hi>G. R.</hi> had reckoned that <hi>Presbyteries were from the beginning,</hi> and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth that he hath no other ground for so saying; but that <hi>Calderwood</hi> had said, that <hi>the Kirk of Scotland had four sorts of Assemblies, ever since the beginning,</hi> of which this must needs be one. But I can tell him of other Grounds on which he might reckon this Meeting a Presbytery; one is the General Assembly 1579. as the <hi>Manuscript</hi> he so often citeth, hath it, <hi>p.</hi> 95. did expresly determine that <hi>these Meetings were Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries:</hi> another is, what is above said: and a third is, that even in times of Episcopacie in <hi>Scotland;</hi> these Meetings were called the Exercise, and yet they pretended to Presbyterial Power in them; though it was in Subordination to the Bishop. That <hi>Calderwood</hi> sayeth that <hi>Presbytries succeeded to these Meetings, importeth no more, but that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytries were after set up with more Power and Freedom than they then had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Superintendents, or Bishops.</hi> When he cannot contradict Matter of fact, with respect to the prevailing of Presbytrie; he falleth to down right railing at the Assemblie, which condemned Prelacie, for <hi>boldness, folly, iniquitie, preposterous Zeal;</hi> if more Reproaches had then occurred to his Fancie, it is like we should have had them; it is neither good Manners, nor a token of a good Cause thus to fall from Reasoning to Scolding. I leave him now after he hath again mistaken the Question, to please himself with re-counting his Exploits, and to tell the World what he hath made appear, in not a few <hi>pages.</hi> After which, he bringeth two Witnesses for Confirming what he had so long insisted on; The first of them is, an Author with whom I am not acquainted, but seemeth to be of his own Sentiments; So that what he sayeth of the Opposition made to Presbyterie in <hi>Scotland;</hi> is no more to us than what <hi>A. M. D. D.</hi> himself hath said; especially seing we have not the Reasons, but the bare Assertion, of that Author. The other is <hi>King James the sixth,</hi> to whose Testimonie brought also by the Author of <hi>the Ten Questions,</hi> I did then Oppose, and still do, his own Explication of what he sayeth, in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Edition of his <hi>Basilicon doron,</hi> that <hi>he meant none but such as Anabaptists, and Familists:</hi> And a contrair Assertion of that same Royal Author, whereby he highly extolleth the Presbyterian Government in <hi>Scotland;</hi> by saying, and that frequently, that <hi>no Error could get footing there</hi> (in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62347:104"/>
while Kirk Sessions, Presbyteries, Synods, and General-Assemblies stood in their Force.</hi> He concludeth his Second Enquiry, with making a great Improvement against us (as he thinketh) of our saying that the Bishops set up, in that he calleth his <hi>second Model,</hi> had no more Power than <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents;</hi> whence he Argueth, <hi>Superintendents had the essentials of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Power; but the Assembly at</hi> Dundee, 1580, <hi>Condemned Episcopacie; and they Condemned also Superintendencie; whence it followeth, that they (and our present Presbytersans follow their Steps in this) not only forsook, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Principles of our Reformers.</hi> This he seemeth to hug as a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Argument, before which the Presbyterian Cause can never stand. But the Answer is plain and easie, and may be gathered from what hath been abov-discoursed. That Assemblie did, (and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians do) condemn <hi>Superindendencie,</hi> as what ought not to continue in the Church; nor ought to be in the ordinarie cases of the Church; but they did not condemn it as what was never lawful to be used for a time, in an extraordinarie Exigent. And we affirm (which our Author hath not yet disproved) that our Reformers were not for <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> perpetual continuance in the Church.</p>
               <p>§. 28. Our Authors Third Enquire is, <hi>whether Prelacie, and the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie of any Office in the Church, above Presbyters was a great and insupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Grievance, and Trouble to this Nation, and contrair to the Inclinations of the generalitie of the People, ever since the Reformation.</hi> He hath verie just Sentiments of this Matter, when he sayeth that <hi>if his Determination of the former Enquirie be true, this Question will soon be dispatched;</hi> for indeed it hath a great Dependence on what is already Discoursed. He might, if so it had pleased him, saved the labour of this tedious Debate, in which there is little else but a litigious Jangle, about what can hardly othewise be Determined than by what hath been alreadie said; unless we could (which is impossible) have the Vote by Pole, of all the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of the Nation, and that in all the Times, and Changes since the Reformation. The Parliament hath given us their Sentiments about this Matter, and if any be not willing to rest in the Judgment of so wise an Assemblie of worthy Patriots, come together from all parts of the Nation to consult about its weghtiest Affairs, he may, for me, abound in his own sense. I know this hath been generally the thoughts of Presbyterians, yea, of sober Episcopalians in some other Churches, and I could give the Opinion of some of the greatest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62347:104"/>
was the fittest Church-Government for <hi>Scotland.</hi> But if our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will maintain he contrarie, I judge they mistake: but shall not think them Hereticks on this accompt. I would have him also consider; that what ever might move the Parliament to make use of this Motive to Abolish Episcopacie, and Establish Presbyterie; the Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> never thought the <hi>Aversion of the People</hi> from Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, nor their <hi>Inclinations to Presbytrie,</hi> to be the <hi>Fundamental Charter</hi> by which they have a right to that Government. We rejoyce that the State was pleased to allow, and countenance, by their Authority, this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church; but we think, it standeth on a surer bottom, than either the Opinion or the Authoritie of Men; and much surer than <hi>the Inclinations of the Mob:</hi> even the Institution of Christ declared in the Scriptures of truth; which Grounds I have laid down in this Work; if he can Beat us from these, we shall become his willing Proselyts; and quit (though we will not Revile it as he doth) this Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as no sufficient Ground for our Faith and Practice in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I know not whether it favoured more of Contempt of the State, or of the Church, or was more designed to ridicule, or to refute Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, that he Choosed such a Title for his Book as he hath done? but we are <hi>in utrumque parati;</hi> to despise his Mocking, and to Answer his Material Arguments, though we have neither leasure nor Inclination to Blott so much Paper as he hath done, about Matters that be remote from the main Question.</p>
               <p>§. 29. His Proofs of <hi>the Peoples Inclination</hi> towards Bishops are much of a size of strength with what we have already heard, <hi>Petrie</hi> commends the State of the Church in the year 1576: and <hi>Spotswood</hi> speaketh of the Respect that the <hi>Superintendents</hi> had: <hi>Beza</hi> also, and <hi>Knox</hi> rejoyced in that State of the Church: Ans. I believe, so should the Presbyterians of our days have done if they had then Lived: There was a Glorious Reformation that was cause of great Joy, and though <hi>Superintendencie</hi> was no desireable thing in it self, yet in that time of the Churches great Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, it was no small Mercie, and Matter of Joy, that there were a few worthy Men to manage the Affairs of the Church, when as many as were needed could not be had; and it was just that these Men should be had in great Esteem: yet it is no good Argument, the People Inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have <hi>Superintendents</hi> when it was simply needful, therefore they inclined to have them, or Bishops, perpetuated in the Church. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Argument is, even in after times, and the more advanced State of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62347:105"/>
Presbyterie, when Ten or Twelve were severely dealt with by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat and Six or Seven more called to <hi>London,</hi> for their forwardness in that way, <hi>yet all things went peaceably in Scotland:</hi> as if People were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways well pleased with what passeth when they make no Disturbance to the Government: he must in Justice allow us the use of the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Aversion of all <hi>Scotland</hi> from Episcopacie, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Presbyterie, seing the Nation have these years past, been in Peace, though he, and some of his Partie Complain of the hardest usage that can be. That Episcopacie prevailed, 1610, Proveth no more for the one side, than the prevailing of Paritie, 1592, and again, 1690, Proveth for the other side. Yea, submitting to Episcopacie, so far as to sit in Synods, and Presbyteries with a Bishop, was no Argument of Approving it, in the case of the Church that then was; when the Judicatures of the Church were in their Integritie, and Bishops thrust in on them: It was another Case at the last Erection of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie, when all Church Meetings were laid aside by Civil Authority, and were called again only by the Bishops Authority. He Chargeth <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood.</hi> (and <hi>G. R.</hi> for the great Crime of following him in this piece of Historie) that he had said, that <hi>it was Statute in Parliament, 1565, that no other Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical be acknowledged within this Realm than that which is, and shall be, within this same Kirk, Established presently, or which floweth therefrom, concerning Preaching the Word, Correction of Manners, or Administration of the Sacrament.</hi> If I should Confess that I find not these Words in the Act which <hi>Calderwood</hi> citeth: yet our Author should not have so much Advantage against him, or <hi>G. R.</hi> either, as he Boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of; unless he will Condemn his Darling Historian <hi>Spotswood</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: who sayeth, <hi>p.</hi> 214. that <hi>the matter of Policy and Jurifdiction of the Church was refeered to the consideration of certain Lords delegated by the Estates:</hi> there is as little of this in the Act that he Citeth, as there is of what <hi>Calderwood</hi> had mentioned: whence these two Historians had their vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for what they say, it seems my Antagonist cannot tell; nor could I, till I met with an old Edition of <hi>King James the si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Where Parliament 1569, <hi>Act</hi> 12, the Words are expresly set down. It seems his Party dreaded the Force of this Citation; and have taken care to stifle it: For in Edition <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 1682, called the <hi>little Acts of Parliament,</hi> that Act (being the <hi>12th</hi> Chapter, Parliament, 1567) is wholly left out. That <hi>Superintendencie</hi> was then in the Church; is no Argument
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62347:105"/>
that Prelacie was settled in the Church; as what was intended should continue; but they were then intending another sort of Jurisdiction, as the event did shew. What he so critically carpeth at, <hi>p.</hi> 293. about a Citation out of <hi>Leslyes</hi> Historie; is pure quibling; it was not denied that Popish Bishops sat in Parliament, but rather acknowledged; yet <hi>Lesly</hi> was cited to shew that it did not long continue so. If there be any material Change in that Citation from the Authors Words, let the Reader judge; after all the frivolous Critticism he hath made. The Reader may observe how exact a Historian this Man is, who hussily Bantereth others with defectiveness that way: for he telleth us, <hi>that Meeting of which</hi> Lesly <hi>sayeth, that the Ecclesiasticks were Excluded, was not a Parliament; but at most a Privy Council: Lesly</hi> supposeth it to be a Meeting that had the Legistative Power, which I thought had been in the King and Parliament; and that <hi>they made such a Law as was the Fountain of all the Heresies,</hi> (i. e. the Protestant Religion) <hi>and other evils that followed.</hi> That he calleth it <hi>Concilium,</hi> is nothing contrarie to what I say; seing Parliaments are often so called in Latine,</p>
               <p>§ 30. For his fourth Enquirie, he manageth his Answer to it, with such undecent Reflection both on the Church and on the State; that I judge others are meeter to deal with him about these things than I, or any in my capacity; and the Matter (as himself confesseth) not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of Argument; nor any publick Deed being extant (except the Act of Parliament which he so petulantly exposeth) by which it might be Determined: I see no ground here for Debate, but our Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and his Denial; and I know he will lay no more weight on the one, than we lay on the other. For what he is at a great deal of pains about, to refute what <hi>G. R.</hi> and another who writ the <hi>farther Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> had said very transiently, and without intending a laborious Paper combate about a Matter so remote from the vitals of our Controversie with the Episcopalians, I say, all that Rapsodie that he hath written on this Head, I am content to refer it to the judicious and unbyassed Reader; to consider whether our Cause, or this Authors Reputation as a Wise Man, and one exercised in matters of solid Reason or Learning, do more Suffer by it; it is Truth, and the Ordiances of Christ that I am set for the Defence of, not Men, my self, nor others; unless it were in Matters that may reflect blame on the Cause that I own. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall wholly pass over this Enquirie: if any one who hath more leasure than I have; or is more inclined toward Eristick jangle, will
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62347:106"/>
take him to Task, and deal with him at his own Weapon, he may do it. I say not this, as either being convinced by his Reasons, or seeing them to be Unanswerable. I am still in the Opinion I was in before, concerning the <hi>Inclinations of the People of Scotland;</hi> especially the Soberer sort of them, and these of the best Lives, with respect to Episcopacie and Presbyterie. Only this <hi>I</hi> confess, that I believe there was never a time since the Reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi> arrived at any degree of Consistence, or Stabilitie, wherein the Inclinations of the Generalitie of the People were less cocerned about any thing of Religion, either the more Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, or the less Substantial part of it; on the one side, or on the other; so Fatal impressions the Flood-gates of all manner of Profanness, and Looseness that had broken out in the late Times, under Prelacie, had made on the Minds of Men; and to such height Irreligiousness arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Yet I Affirm, that the real Respect that Men had to Religion, in any of the concernments of it, were rather on the Presbyterian, than on the Episcopal side. I shall say less of his fifth Enquirie, for I freely confess, that neither <hi>the Inclinations of the People for Presbyterie, nor Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy being a Grievance to the Nation;</hi> nor <hi>our being Reformed by Presbyters,</hi> if all this were true, evident and certain; none of these, nor all of them in conjunction, could by themselves, infer that Prelacie should be Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: nor (I am confident) did the Parliament ever intend to have them so considered Wherefore, if my Antagonist, or any for him, can prove that Prelacie is the Ordinance of Christ for the Gospel Church: we shall part with all these Arguments for its Abolition, and shall cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own it: but if that cannot be done (as I am sure it cannot) and if these Propositions be true; they afford an Argument for the Aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prelacie, that he will never be able to Answer. And I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss this Enquirie; and indeed this whole Book, after I have Noted a few things (without insisting on Debates) out on a Discourse that he beginneth afresh, <hi>p.</hi> 333. about the <hi>Principles of our Reformers:</hi> he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for their <hi>fallabilitie: he is not for all they held or did:</hi> we say the same of both. Only I take Notice, that here he overthroweth the Argument that he had so much insisted upon against us; that our Reformers were not exactly for the whole of our Way. Though I do not pretend to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all the Principles that were held by our Reformers: yet many of these which he blameth them for might easily be Defended; if it were not to Digresse from our present Controversie about Church Government. The Reproaches that he casteth on <hi>Master Knox</hi> deserve Correction; I
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62347:106"/>
wish, some may undertake it. His Challenge to us, <hi>p.</hi> 344. to <hi>shew wherein they have deserted the Reformers, so far as they Agreed with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, or, what is an Approach toward Poperie,</hi> I say, Episcopacie is an Instance of both: but this being the Matter of our main Debate, the Decision must depend on that. He undertaketh to make it appear that <hi>the present Presbyterians have receded from the Principles of our Reformers, in 1. The Faith. 2. The Worship. 3. The Discipline. 4. The Government of the Church.</hi> In stead of this last, he insisteth on their laying aside the Bishops from voting in Parliament. I cannot now degresse to consider what here he sayeth; though he insisteth on them at great length; for I diverted into the Considerations of this Book, onely in so far as the Controversie I have with him (or who ever is the Author in the other Book) is concerned. And there are some of these that are also there Debated, which I intend to consider. I have alreadie said, that we reverence our Reformers; but neither thought their Reformation at first Perfect; nor themselves Infallible. I hope some, or other will take him to Task on these Heads, and Defend the Principles of this Church, from his insolent Obloquie: I wish him a more temperat Spirit than appeareth in his Discourses; and particularly in his Ridiculeing of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the LORD'S Supper, as it is managed in the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>I Return now to the <hi>Enquirie into the New Opinions:</hi> and proceed to his Third <hi>Chapter;</hi> wherein he pretendeth enquire into several <hi>new Opinions.</hi> The first of which is, that <hi>we are against the Observing the Holy Days, of CHRISTS Nativity, Resurrection, Assention; and Commemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the Piety, Faith, and Martyrdom of the Saints that are mentioned in Scripture.</hi> We do not denie the Charge, so far as being against the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversaries observation of these Days doth reach. That this is a <hi>new Opinion</hi> we denie: though at the same time we confess the contrarie Practice is verie old: yet we maintain, that no such thing was injoyned, or practised in the Apostolick Church; which is older than the Church that he Appealeth to. He is too confident when he sayeth, <hi>it is certainly a new Doctrine;</hi> for we are certain on the other hand, that there is War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62347:107"/>
for it in the Word of GOD; as there is for no new Doctrine. He sayeth, <hi>it flieth in the Face of the whole Christian Church, Antient and Modern, Reformed, and Unreformed:</hi> and other harsh Words he is pleased to run us down with. This is Passion, not Reason. A modest Dissent from a Church or a Person, though of the greatest Veneration that is due to Men, is no <hi>flying in their Face.</hi> And if he will needs call it so, our Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie is, if they flie in the Face of the Holy Scripture, we chuse rather to Differ from them, than with them to flie in its Face: but we put no such Construction on the Opinions, or Practices of other Churches, Antient or Modern. I am not without hope that it may be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that he and his Complices, <hi>flie in the Face,</hi> both of Antiquitie, and of the Reformed Churches, by their Opinion about Holy Days; and Differ from them more than we do, which will appear when we come to State the Question: which he hath never minded, though he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth in the Debate with a great deal of warmth. This is <hi>Andalatarum more pugnare,</hi> to Fight in the dark. We are now but in the Threshold, considering the Opinion of other Churches. He will allow us none but the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and that with <hi>Calvines</hi> dislike, For <hi>Calvines</hi> dislike of the Abrogation of the Holy Days by the Magistrats of <hi>Geneva,</hi> he Citeth two Epistles of his; which he doth not distinguish by their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; so that I cannot find them: not being willing, nor at leisure, to turne over the whole Book for them. But I shall more distinctly point, him to other two of his Epistles, wherein, though he doth not fully declare for our Opinion, he doth plainly condemn that of our Prelatists. They are, <hi>ad Mons. Belgradenses, Ep. 51. p. 112. edit: Hanov.</hi> 1597. and <hi>Mansoni Poppio Ep. 278. p.</hi> 520. I say the same of our Reformers, and of the <hi>French</hi> Protestants.</p>
               <p>§ 2. I shall now address my self to fixing of the true State of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. And 1. We do not, with the Anabaptists in <hi>Germany</hi> (for some Anabaptists in this differ from them) and with the <hi>Petro Brusiani,</hi> cited by <hi>Parae in Rom. 14. Dub.</hi> 4. out of the Life of <hi>Bernhard. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 5. disowne all Holy Days. The Lords Day we owne, as of necessity to be observed, being of Divine Institution. Pardon a small Digression: I see no ground to think that <hi>Peter Bruce</hi> was of this Opinion: all that I find ascribed to him, <hi>Cent. Magd. 12. cap.</hi> 5. and that even by <hi>Petrus Cluniacensis,</hi> his Antagonist, is, <hi>Die Dominica, &amp; aliis, putabat licitum esse vesci carnibus.</hi> The <hi>Centuriators</hi> wish, <hi>Utinam vero ipsius Petri scripta extarent, ex quibus multo rectius facere judicium liceret, quam ex illis qui in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62347:107"/>
defensionem Pontificiarum abominationum conspirarunt.</hi> He was one of these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Witnesses for the Truth against Antichrist, who went under the Name of <hi>Waldenses, Albigenses, &amp;c.</hi> It is like he might disowne other Holy Days; but there is no ground to think that he disowned the Lords Day. 2. We maintain it to be unlawful, to observe the Jewish Holy Days; I should bring Arguments for this: but I think our Adversaries will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict this Assertion: the Lord having of old appointed these Days, and all the legal Rites, for Prefiguring Gospel Mysteries; and the Apostle expresly condemning this Observation: <hi>Gal. 4. 10. Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. where they are expresly called <hi>Shadows of Things to come.</hi> 3. We hold, that not only these Jewish Days are not to be observed as such, or on Jewish Principles; but the Days ought not to be set apart as Anniversary Holy Days, on account of Decency, Policy, and Order, in the Christian Church. All the Arguments will have place here that were used by the Primitive Christians against them who keep <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> on the same Day with the <hi>Jews.</hi> 4. Our Adversaries are not one among themselves about observing the Holy Days: some count them more Holy than other Days, and hold that <hi>God's extraordinary Works have sanctified some times, and advanced them, so that they ought to be, with all Men that Honour God, more Holy than other Days.</hi> So <hi>Hooker Eccles. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, lib.</hi> 5. §. 60. where he layeth a Foundation for Believing that these Days are Holy, and to be observed, antecedently to the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. Others of them, are of a contrary Opinion, <hi>Couper</hi> Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> in his Resolution of some Scruples, about the <hi>Articles of Perth,</hi> which are set down in the History of his Life, <hi>p.</hi> 8. of his Works; hath these Words: <hi>in my Mind, no King on Earth, no Church may make a Holy Day; only the Lord who made the Day, hath that Prerogative:</hi> only he sheweth that <hi>a Day may be set apart for Preaching, as the Birth Days of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are for Publick Rejoycing, &amp;c.</hi> Our Author hath not told us, which of these Opinions he owneth. 5: It is one Question, whither a Day may be set apart for Commemoration of some Mystery of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Men; and as a part of Gods Worship. And another, whither such Days may be set apart for Worshipping God, merely as a piece of good Order and Policy. The first the Papists are for: the other most of our Prelatists owne: though some of them differ little from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in this Matter. 6. The Question is not, whither a Day may be set apart occasionally for Religious Worship: that is, when any special Providence giveth occasion for Fasting and Humiliation, or for Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62347:108"/>
and Rejoycing: seing in that Case, there is a special Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Call to that Solemn Work: but, whither a Day may be set apart to be observed constantly, and as it recurreth every Year. The one maketh a Difference between that Day of the Year, and other Days; and exempteth it altogether; and constantly, from Civil Use; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth not so; the one maketh a Difference among Days; the other maketh the Difference only in the Works, or Dispensations of God, which occasioneth such Work on that Day, and not on another. All that the Church doth in the one Case, is, whereas the present Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence calleth to the Work, as it is expressed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 12. The Church only determineth the Circumstance of Time; which must be done: in the other, the Church determineth more than a necessary Circumstance, <hi>viz.</hi> That there shall be such a Solemnity: Which the Lord hath not injoyned, neither do we doubt, but that the Church may appoint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Days for Solemn Worship; to wit, while the present Providence that calleth to such Work continueth. Weekly, or Monthly Fasts may be appointed under a lasting Calamity or Threatning. 7. One Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whither any Anniversary Holy Days should be allowed, or may be appointed by Man: another, whither any are to be allowed in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Saints: for some are for <hi>the great Days;</hi> as they call them; which respect Christ, and our Redemption; such as the <hi>Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Resurrection, Ascension,</hi> and some others: who are wholly against Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Days that respect only the Saints. 8. It is a Question, whither Days may be Dedicated to Saints: as the Papists do: and another, whither the Commemoration of Saints may be made on set Days: this last our Brethren are for: though it will be hard to separate these two: of which afterward.</p>
               <p>§ 3. I shall now set down our Opinion, and wherein we differ from others. And first, we maintain, that God hath instituted the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Weekly Sabbath, as a part of that Religious Worship we owe to him. I do not expect that our Brethren will directly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly controvert this: though some of them teach Doctrine not very consistent with it: which belongeth to another Head than what we are now upon. Only I take notice, that they who are most for obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving other Holy Days, do usually shew least Zeal for the strict obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Lords Day, either in their Principle, or their Practice. 2. I assent, that the Lord hath not instituted, under the Gospel, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recurrent Holy Days, nor enjoyned the Observation of them. If
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62347:108"/>
any think otherwise, they must prove what they affirm. 3. The Church hath no Power to institute, or injoy the Observation of any recurrent, or Anniversary Holy Days, for Religious Use, without a special and present Occasion. 4. Any Days that the Church setteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part occasionally, for Religious Work, are no further Holy, than that Holy Work is the Design of their Appointment: they have no Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in themselves; nor can Men impart it to them. 5. Though we are far from severe Censuring, either Ancient or Modern Churches, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who are for some of these Holy Days; yet we cannot be of their Sentiment in this: nor look on these Days as indifferent things, as some of them do. 6. That the Reader may be undeceived about the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Reformed Churches, which our Author talketh so much of, and blameth us for differing from them: he may know, that our Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Brethren are at greater Distance from them, in this Matter, than we are: for they condemn the Saints Holy Days: so <hi>Paraeus in Rom. 14. Dub.</hi> 4. so <hi>Calvin,</hi> in both the Epistles cited, §. 1. The <hi>Helvetick Confession of Faith, cap. 24. in Cor. Confess. p. 54.

I do not pretend that they are generally, wholly on our Side, in this; for many of them look on the Observation of these Days as indifferent; in which we cannot assent to them. But I

know of none of them who imposeth them with such Rigour, and talk so highly of the necessity of observing them, being recommended by the Church; or of the Religion that is in this Observation, as the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Party in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> do. Our Brethren do also stand by themselves, in their keeping of Saints Days: and in the Number of their Holy Days; which in <hi>England</hi> is greater than the Number of these that God injoyned to the Jews; forthe Primitive Church, at some Distance from the Apostolick Times, may be they may have some Countenance there; yet these Saints Days were not then so so injoyned, and urged, as they urge and impose them, nor made such a Yoke to the People; as may be gathered from <hi>Socrates histor.

I am of Opinion, that as many other things crept in by Custom, in diverse places, so the Feast of Easter prevailed among all People, from a certain private Custom, and Observation; in so much that (as I said before) not one of the Apostles hath any where prescribed to any Man, so much as one Rule of it; it was observed, not by Canon, but of Custom;</hi> and afterward he taxeth some, <hi>who count Fornication indifferent, and contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Holy Days, as it were for Life and Death: they despise the Commands of God, and establish Canons of their own.</hi> I shall add the Opinion of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and the Protestant Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in her first State, and that out of the <hi>hist. motuum in regno Scotiae,</hi> under the borrowed Name of <hi>Iraeneus Philaleth. p. 264, 265. libro primo disciplinae, cap. 1.

We judge not others that use them without Superstitious Opinions (though we cannot well separate the Practice of them from External Superstition) and we desire the like Forbearance from others, if we cannot use them; for which I shall now give some Reasons, before I consider my Antagonists further Discourse on this Subject.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Our first Reason is, these Days were not instituted by Christ, or his Apostles, nor did they injoyn them to be instituted, nor give Power, or Allowance to the Church to do it afterward: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Warrant for them. And it cannot be rationally accounted for, that either the Church should impose, in the Matter of Religion especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or People should be obliged to submit to, what hath no sufficient Warrant. That they were not instituted by Christ nor his Apostles, is beyond doubt: our Adversaries do not pretend that they were: for there is no apparent Ground for such a Thought; and if it could be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the Case were changed: for then they were not the Days that we Debate about. That Christ and his Apostles have given no Warrant to the Church to make such an Institution, we must believe, unless our Adversaries can instruct this Warrant by plain Scripture, or sufficient Consequence from Scripture, or strong Reason, (if Reason can have place in such a Matter of Fact) if it be Answered, the Church hath Warrant from Scripture to appoint what is for <hi>Edification,</hi> and for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> and these Holy Days are such. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I Reply: it is denyed that the Church may appoint whatever is thought fit for Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Lord hath appointed sufficient Means of Grace, and of Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and the Church must not devise new Means for that End; but faithfully use the Means that he hath appointed: or if any think that the Church may appoint Means of Edification above what Christ hath appointed, both they accuse Christs Appointments for that End as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, in the Way of outward Means: And they are to shew what Warrant the Church hath for so doing. Beside, that Means of Mens devising are not like to be effectual for Edification, if Means of Gods Appointment be not so effectual, as is hinted, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 30, 31. If <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and the Prophets, Gods Means, cannot perswade one to believe; the Preaching of one risen from the Dead (a Mean that a Man contrived)
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62347:110"/>
could not do it. As for the Decency, Order, and Policy, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to warrant the Church to institute Holy Days; these are a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, or needless Decency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this last, there can be no warrant for what may effect it; if the first, the former Argument recurreth, that God, by his own Institutions, hath not sufficiently provided for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of his Church. Again, if we should grant that the Church hath Warrant to provide for all that is necessary to make the Worship of God decent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They must also shew us a Warrant to judge what is so necessary; if it be alledged, that the Holy Days are thus necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, either they must instruct this, and shew us that Scripture, or Nature hath made them necessary, and that the Ordinances of God are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, disorderly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without them; or the Church doth so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine because she will: and in that Case we require a Warrant for such Lordly Domination over the People of God. If it be further Answered, that the Church hath the same Warrant for appointing these Days, as for appointing occasional Fasts, or Thanksgivings. Reply, Not so. For the Lord himself, by his Providence, calleth to these Exercises, to be Solemnly gone about, on such Occasions: but doth not tell us whither the Fast shall be on Tuesday or Thursday, in this Week, or the next: here is a Circumstance of Time, which must be determined by Men; Nature it self maketh it necessary, supposing the Providential Call of God, to the Work on that Occasion: it is not so with the Holy Days: there is no special Providence occurrent, which calleth to these Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities at one time, more than at another. <hi>Obj.</hi> Why hath the Lord left the determining of the time of these occasional Solemnities to the Church, and not of the other also. <hi>Ans.</hi> Because the former could not be determined in Scripture, for all Times, Places, and Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without Swelling it to a Huge, and Burdensome, and less Useful Bulk; the latter could easily have been determined in the Bible; it is actually done in the Old Testament; and if the Lord had thought such a Determination needful, it had been easie to do it also in the New Testament.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Our <hi>second Argument:</hi> Either the Apostles had Warrant from God, to institute these Days, or not; if they had not, how is it imaginable that the Rulers of the Church, who came after them, had such Power granted by God: Though some Exalt Episcopal Power to a Monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Absurd Height, yet I think none of them have the Confidence to say, that the Bishops, in that do, what the Apostles, in the same
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62347:110"/>
Case, might not do. If they alledge that the Apostles had such Power; then I propose another <hi>Dilemma;</hi> either it was for Edification, that such Days should then have been appointed, as much as it was in after times, or not; if it was, the Apostles were Negligent, or Unfaithful, in not appointing them, which is Blasphemy to think, seing in all these things, they were infallibly guided by the Spirit of God: if it was not, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are obliged to shew us what was the Necessity of it afterward, which was not in the Apostles Days. I know not what can be Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this Argument, except they alledge there was not Occasion in the Apostles Days, for these Appointments; many of the great Things that are to be Commemorated on these Days, falling out afterward Reply, The greatest Things, for which these Days are kept, were then past: Christs Birth, Circumcision, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, the Effusion of the Spirit, also, the Conversion of the Apostles, <hi>Stephens</hi> Martyrdom; and yet no Anniversary Day appointed for any of these: and for the Martyrs that came after, the Apostles could easily have given a Hint that they should be so Honoured: if they had set apart a Day for Remembring the Martyrdom of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and of <hi>James,</hi> this had been Apostolick Example for after Ages; which is a good Warrant for our Practice: whence we may rationally conclude, that they had <hi>not received</hi> this Usage <hi>from the Lord,</hi> seing <hi>they did not deliver it to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> neither by Precept nor Example: if it be said that there was less need of Commemoration when these things were recent, and Religion in its Vigour. Reply, The Apostles knew they would grow old things, and that all the Means that our Lord himself thought fit for the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, would be needed. Beside, Religion was fallen into some decay, and all the Means that ever were needful, were needed before some of the Apostles went off the Stage. Again, some of the Truths that are Commemorated on these Days, were controverted, and violently opposed, both by Heathens, and Apostate Christians, even while the Apostles lived: and therefore they thought of, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted other Means for Preserving and Propagating these Truths, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver minded this.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Our <hi>third Reason</hi> is, the Apostle doth expresly condemn the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Days, under the New Testament, as besouging to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Pedagogy, and unfit for the Christian Church State, <hi>Gal. 4. 9, 10. Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. We know the Lords Day cannot there be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, because it is injoyned by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ord himself: therefore we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62347:111"/>
this Prohibition of Days that have no Warrant from the Lord, that are the Appointments of Men. Here they have several Answers at hand, 1. These Places are to be understood of the Jewish Holy Days: these were not to be observed, being now abrogated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the thing designed by them is already fulfilled: and the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, on the Matter, a denying that Christ is come. Reply, It is not to be denyed, that here are directly, and especially meant, the Jewish Holy Days: but that they are not the only Days forbidden, I prove, <hi>First,</hi> The Prohibition is general, and without Limitation: therefore no Limitation can be made by Men, but what the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self maketh in the Scripture: which we do not find, except of the Lords Day. <hi>Non distinguendum est, ubi Lex non distinguit: Secondly,</hi> Seing the Jewish Days are here forbidden, and no other put in their Room, we have Cause to think that no other are allowed, more than they are: when the Jewish Sacraments were abolished, others are substitute to them: when the Jewish Sabbath was laid aside, another was put in its Place, by Divine Authority, as may be deduced by clear Consequence from Scripture; because the Lord would not have the Gospel Church to be without Sacraments and a Sabbath. But when the Jewish Sacrifices were abolished, other Sacrifices to be offered by the Ministers of the New Testament, are not appointed in their Place, (whatever the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists say to the contrary) and when the Jewish Days were laid aside, none other were brought in their Stead: because the Lord would have no other Sacrifices, nor Holy Days under the Gospel. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if the Lord will not be served by the Observation of these Days, which once had the Stamp of his own Authority, is it like that he will be pleased with a Sort of Holy Days that he never injoyned, but are the pure De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Man? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> These Days are forbidden on general Grounds, that will reach all Days which are not appointed by the Lord; for <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. These Days are condemned <hi>as Weak and Beggerly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that is, they have no Force to Edifie, being destitute of Divine Authority, and consequently of the Divine Blessing, And <hi>Col.</hi> 2. they are Comanded, <hi>not to let Men Judge them,</hi> that is impose on them, injoyn such things to be Observed, and Censure them as guilty if they observed them not. So <hi>Hamond in loc.</hi> again, their Submitting to these things is called <hi>a voluntary Humilitie,</hi> and <hi>will Worship:</hi> and it is said of all these Observations (among which these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oly days were) that they were <hi>after the Commandments of Men, and their Doctrines,</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:62347:111"/>
and that <hi>the Observers of them did not hold the Head, CHRIST;</hi> this was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from him as the Head and Law-giver of his Church, and betaking themselves to other Law-givers. (I say not that this Phrase importeth no more than this? now all these Reasons of condemning the Observation of the Jewish Holy Days, do also reach other Holy Days that have no Divine warrant. Another <hi>Answer</hi> to our Argument is, the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the Observation of these Days as if they were still in Force by Divine Command, and were not Abrogated by the coming of Christ; but not simply as if they might not be observed for the Churches Authority injoyning them. <hi>Reply,</hi> This is to make a sense for the Text, not to find it in the Text it self: they are simply forbidden, without any such restricted sense. Again, if the LORD hath laid aside what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath once Appointed for a special use, it is strange that Men should revive that again, and bring it again into the Church for another use: especially, when the LORD himself hath Appointed other Means, and not these, for that other use: he hath laid aside the Jewish Holy days which Represented CHRIST to come: and he hath Appointed the Word and Sacraments to keep us in mind that he is come, and what he hath done for us: but our Episcopal Men are not content with that, but they will revive some of the old Jewish days, as <hi>Easter, &amp;c.</hi> to keep us in Memorie of CHRIST alreadie come. <hi>Answer Thirdly,</hi> they say we must not observe these Days as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, with a Superstitious Opinion of Worship, or as if they were in themselves Holier than other days? yet we may Observe them for keeping up Order and good Policie in the Church. <hi>Reply,</hi> The weakness of this Plea is alreadie discovered. All the Order, Decencie and Policie that the LORD requireth in his Church may be obtained without them; as the Patrons of them do, on the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, confess; when they tell us that these, and all the rest of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, are in themselves, and antecedently to the Churches imposing them, indifferent. Beside, not the Principle only, or the Opinion that Men have about these Days, is condemned in these Scriptures; but the Practice it self.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Our <hi>Fourth Reason</hi> is, the imposing of the Holy Days doth dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from that Christian Libertie that the LORD hath given to his People; which the LORD doth not allow, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. They are contrarie to this Libertie two ways. 1. It is the Libertie of Christians to be under no Yoke in matters of Religion (we refuse not civil Subjection to our Rulers in all lawful things) but that of Christ; to have him for their
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62347:112"/>
only Law-giver, <hi>James</hi> 4. 12. He hath not given Power to Men to make new Laws for his Church, but to declare his Laws; and to Execute his Censures that he hath Appointed on the Breakers of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when Christ hath given us one Holy day to be perpetually Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and no more; if Men will enjoyn moe Days, they make Laws of their own, and bring the People under their Yoke; which is not Christs. And the Places last Cited do evidently Import this: The <hi>LORD</hi> had now delivered his People from the Yoke of Ceremonies which himself had laid on them, and the false Apostles were endeavouring to wreath that Yoke still on their Necks: and it is as much Bondage, if any will wreath another Yoke upon them which is none of Christs: now that Scripture biddeth them beware of such Yokes. 2. The fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment alloweth the People of GOD six days of the Week for their lawful worldly Imployments: this Instituting of Holy days Abridgeth that Libertie, and that merely by the Authoritie of Men. It is not so when occasional Solemnities are Appointed; because the Religious, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Work (on which abstinencie from Labour doth necessarily follow) is determined by the Lord, and intimated to us by his Providence; the Church doth no more but Chuse this Day, rather than that; If it be said, that Magistrats may Restrain People from their Work for civil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; why not then for Religious Reasons. <hi>Answer,</hi> Men have not the the same Power in Religion as in Civil Things; though restraint from Work is the same in both; so is not the occasion; the one must be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the <hi>LORD;</hi> the other may by Men. Beside, that Magistrats must have some good Ground, for such Restraint; otherwise they will not be appointed of <hi>GOD,</hi> though obeyed by the People, I might here add all the Arguments that we commonly use against Humane Ceremonies in Religion; that it is an Addition to the Word or Rule that <hi>GOD</hi> hath managed the Affairs of His house by. A symbolizing with the Papists, without Necessitie. It is Superstition, being above and beyond what <hi>GOD</hi> hath Enjoyned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I shall only adde that the Scripture calleth the weekly Sabbath, <hi>the LORDS Day,</hi> as a Name of distinction from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Days: but it could be no distinguishing Name, if the Nativitie, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were all Dedicated to our <hi>LORD;</hi> for every one of these were the <hi>LORDS</hi> Day, as well as it; And therefore, when <hi>John</hi> said he <hi>was in the Spirit on the LORDS Day,</hi> we could not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was <hi>Christmass</hi> day, or <hi>Easter</hi> day; or Good <hi>Friday,</hi> or the first of <hi>January,</hi> the Circumcision Day, or some ordinary first day of the Week.</p>

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:62347:112"/>
§. 8. I come now to Examine what my Antagonist bringeth for his Holy Days, and against our Opinion. He sayeth, <hi>p. 169. they were Originally appointed to Commemorat the Mysteries of our Redemption, with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Zeal, gratitude and Solemnity.</hi> If he can shew us that Christ or his Apostles appointed them for these Ends: we shall lay our hand on our Mouth, and not mutter against them; but if they be so Appointed by Men, we ask <hi>quo warranto?</hi> CHRIST himself hath appointed Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for these Ends: particularly, the LORD'S Supper is Instituted as a Commemoration of the Mysteries of our Redemption: <hi>this do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Me:</hi> if he hath said so of any of the Controverted Holy Days we shall receive them. But I desire to know what Power the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Pastors of the Church have to Institute special Ordinances for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating the Mysteries of our Redemption. I shall further Debate this with him, by and by. Mean while I observe, that he is beyond many of his Brethren, who disown the Mysterie of these Days, and all Religious Worship, in the Observation of them, and set them no higher, than that they are for Decencie, Order, and Policie; And himself, some times when it is for his purpose, seemeth to be of the same mind, as <hi>p.</hi> 170. he frameth an Objection to himself; from the Abuse of them; which alas, is too notour, and gross, and frequent. His Answer is, <hi>so may the most Holy Exercises, and the highest Mysteries; and there is nothing so Sacred in Religion, or so universally useful in Nature, against which some such Objection may not be started.</hi> I do much wonder that a Man of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions to Learning and Reading, and who doth so superciliously despise others for defectiveness in both, should so superficially Propose, &amp; so slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Answer an Argument that hath been so much insisted on, and his Answer so fully refuted. Doth he not know, if he hath Read any thing of the Controversie about Ceremonies; that the Presbyterians never pleaded that Holy Exercises, Mysteries of Religion, or things universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly useful in Nature; yea, or what hath the Stamp of Divine Authoritie were it never so small, should be Abandoned because Abused: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse should be Reformed, and the thing retained: But this our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment speaketh only of indifferent things, which have no intrinsick Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, nor Command of GOD to injoyn them, these we say, (and have often Proved it) should be removed, when grosly, and frequently Abus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that the Holy Days are so indifferent, I think he will not deny, if he do deny it, he is obliged to prove the Necessitie of them, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Presbyterians, but also against his own Partie, who reckon
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62347:113"/>
them among the Indifferent things, the Regulating of which, is in the Courches Power.</p>
               <p>§ 9. I now Consider his Debate with the <hi>Vindicator of the Kirk,</hi> (as he calleth him) about this verie Matter; and particularly, about obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the anniverssary Feast of CHRISTS Nativity, which we call <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass.</hi> The Reader who is at pains to Compare that Book, from <hi>p.</hi> 27. with what my Antagonist here sayeth against it, will find, that the most part, and the most material Passages, and what is most Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative in that Book, to this purpose, are passed over in silence: and but a few things touched. The <hi>first</hi> thing he is pleased to Notice is, I had said, <hi>the Question is not about the Commemoration of it,</hi> (the Nativity of CHRIST) <hi>but whether this Commemoration should be by an Ordinance of GOD; or by an Appointment of Men.</hi> The occasion of this State of the Question was, he had asked; <hi>might not the Church take care that this Glorious Mystery should not be forgotten.</hi> I Answered, <hi>no doubt it might, and should:</hi> and I had mentioned the Word, and Sacraments, as GODS Appointment for this End; on which followeth the Question above set down. His Answer in this Book, to that Question is long, and made up of a great many Sentences, which I cannot well see the Connection of, nor pertinency to the present purpose (may be another may.) He first sayeth, <hi>what the Church doth in this is agreeable to the Will of GOD.</hi> If it be so, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie is at an End: and I will crave him Pardon for all I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this Subject, But it might have been expected that this Assertion, (which is the Determination of our Question; which he fairly beggeth) should have been Proved; but he thinketh not fit to attempt that. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Proof, we have it over again, in other and moe Words, (for he wisely considered, that saying it once, and so barely was not enough to perswade the Stubborn Presbyterians) <hi>And if</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>the manner of Commemoration (viz.</hi> by an Anniversarie Solemnity) <hi>be the immediate result of Ecclesiastical constitution, the Church medled wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What followeth I cannot refute, for I cannot understand it (which, may be, is my Dulness.) It is, <hi>things indifferent in their Nature do generally carry in them the Advantages, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of Necessary things.</hi> If this be true, it is Mystical: it may

As little can I understand how that can be indifferent in its own nature which hath in it (that is in its Nature) the <hi>Advantages and Encouragements of a necessarie Thing.</hi> I wish he had Instanced in some of the Things compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under his large Word <hi>generally,</hi> which have <hi>some Advantages and Encouragements</hi> in them. Many Instances may be brought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie; as, whether he walk a Mile on foot; or Ride on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, or go in Coach: whether <hi>Tuesday</hi> or <hi>Wednesday</hi> be appointed for the Weekly Sermon: whether Sermon shall begin on the LORD'S Day at Nine or Ten of the Clock; whether the Pulpit stand toward the East or West; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what <hi>Advantage or Incouragement of necessarie Things</hi> is in anie of these? If he will shew us anie <hi>Encouragement or Advantage</hi> of <hi>any necessarie Thing</hi> (and if that <hi>Encouragement or Advantage</hi> to that <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie Thing</hi> be it self Necessarie) to be in the Holy Days; we shall look on them, not as the Appointments of the Church; (for it is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that this Necessitie is Antecedent to that, and doth not flow from it) but either of Divine Institution, or of Natural Necessitie: neither of which, I suppose, he will ascribe to the Holy Days.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Another mystical Sentence followeth; <hi>GOD will have our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience approved in indifferent Things, as well as Necessarie; for Necessarie Things are approved for their intrinsick Excellencie; the other are by way of Consequence and Relation.</hi> Here also <hi>AEdipus</hi> himself might be puzled to find out the Sense. So far as I reach his Meaning, I shall Examine what is asserted I verie well understand that GOD will prove our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Himself in indifferent as well as in necessarie Things, (if there be anie thing necessarie antecedentlie to His will) but that our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Man, must be so Proved, or that our Obedience to Church-Rulers is approved of GOD, when they enjoyn indifferent Things, in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62347:114"/>
the Matters of Religion, to that I cannot assent; and if I could, I should not scruple the implicite Obedience that some require. Is it by Chance or by some inward Byasse that this Author stumbleth so often into Popish Principles? Before I assent to him in this, he must Prove that the LORD hath given the Church Power to injoyn indifferent Things which are parts of Religion, as the Holy Days are: next that we are obliged to Obey in Matters of Religion, what GOD hath left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but Men have thought fit to impose. What he Meaneth when he saith, the other (indifferent Things) <hi>are by Consequence and Relation:</hi> doth yet more puzle me. What is that Consequence, or what the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for which indifferent things are approved as Necessarie Things are for their intrinsick Excellencies: this <hi>I</hi> cannot guess at. He cannot Mean that they are approved, because they are only consequential to Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie Things: for if that Consequence be Necessarie, it maketh the Things to be Necessarie, and to cease to be indifferent: if it be not Necessarie, but the Necessarie Things may do well without them, it can no way make them more approved than if there we no such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. For their Relation to Necessaries Things, how can it make them approved? if this he Mean, and if this Principle hold, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists have a notable Foundation for the Holiness of their Relicts; and indeed, on this Principle it is Built: they are therefore Holy, because the Persons to whom they were related were so: may not relation transfuse a Holiness into his Coat, his Shoe, or what else was about him, as well as either the Birth of CHRIST transfuseth a Holiness into all the recurrent Days of all Years that Answer to that Day on which he was Born: or if he make the Relation of these Days to be to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exercises performed in them: shall everie time and everie place where there hath been Preaching, Prayer, and Celebration of the LORD'S Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be ever after that Holy and Approved of GOD: this is strange Doctrine. He goeth on: <hi>when we Commemorate the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we Worship GOD and adore His Love that sent His Son into the World: and the Church Commands that this should be performed with all possible Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie at some stated and fixed Seasons:</hi> all this is true: But how doth this Prove his Point; we question the Churches Power to appoint fixed and stated Days for this Commemorating Worship, and maintain that Christ hath appointed Ordinances of his own for this Commemoration, and he telleth us, the Church hath Commanded it also to be done: and there is an End.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:62347:114"/>
§. 11. He next bringeth somewhat like Reason: <hi>the Church may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point these Seasons (which are but Circumstances of time) as well as the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church appointed the Hours of Prayer: at which the Apostles were present,</hi> Acts 2. 15. <hi>and 3. 1. for which there was no immediate and express Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of GOD, but were kept by an Appointment and Custom of their own. Ans.</hi> 1. He doth injuriously insinuate that we require an immediate and express Institution for the Days that we will observe; where have we ever said so? let him Prove an Institution, either by express Words, or good Consequence, or Apostolick example; or by anie good <hi>Medium,</hi> and we shall acquiesce. 2. The Appointing Holy Days is more than <hi>determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Circumstance of Time.</hi> It is a sequestering of these Days perpetually from Civil, to Sacred Use; it is to give them a relative Holiness, as far as Mans power can reach; by making a Connection between them and the Solemn Exercises of Religion: it is a Dedication of such a part of our time to <hi>GOD;</hi> so as we do not Dedicate other Days of our time; and so making a difference among Days; which we think can only be done by Divine Authoritie: the Apostles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. counted it a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in some, who did no more than what our Author putteth off thus slightlie; what they did was, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. They <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished days</hi> one from another; and that with respect to Religion; which could not be without judging one of them better, and more Holy than another; and so it is Expounded by <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and <hi>Vatablus: Eslius</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, <hi>eligit unum prae alio,</hi> is this no more but determining a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance? Beside, the Lord hath not left it to us to determine Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Worship as we please, but when it is Necessarie that a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance that relateth to Worship must be determined, and it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Lord in Scripture, in that case Men may, and must Determine it; but this is not the Case in hand: there is no need that a stated Day be determined for Commemorating anie of the Mysteries of our Redemption; seing the Lord himself hath appointed his own Day for that End, and his Ordinances as the Means of that Commemoration. 3. For the Jewish Church, <hi>appointing hours of Prayer:</hi> It is to be Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that Prayer was joyned with the daily Sacrifice. And these <hi>Hours of Prayer</hi> were appointed by God, not the Church. It is true, <hi>Maimnoides</hi> giveth account of three times of Prayer that the <hi>Jewes</hi> were obliged to Observe everie day, and on their Festivities they added a Fourth: but this was in the degenerat times of their Church; as the Papists have their Canonoical hours; <hi>Maimonides</hi> indeed telleth us that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62347:115"/>
                  <hi>Esdras made Forms of Prayer, and they appointed the Number of Prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Number of the Sacrifices:</hi> but it cannot be Proved that these Constitutions were of that Antiquitie.</p>
               <p>§. 12. He further reasoneth thus, <hi>p. 171. there is something Analogical in the Christian Church to the Free-will Offerings of the Jews which are not the less Acceptable because Voluntarie: but rather the more, as long as they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Circle of these things which he hath Commanded.</hi> Ans. If we give Scope to our fancie to frame Analogies, and make these a Warrant for modes of Religious Worship, there shall be no end of devising new Ways of Worshipping God, while yet Men keep within the Compass of what is Commanded, as to the Substance of their Service. In this case the most fancieful Contriver, and Inventer of what is New, fine, and gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, shall be the best Divine: and there shall be no end of Contention: for what this Bishop thinketh a fine way, and Anological to what is Commanded, another shall think unfit: We have cause to bless the Lord that he hath given us a more sure Rule for our Direction, even the Scripture. 2. These Days Invented by Men are not Analogical to the Free-will-offerings of the Jewes: for these were Commanded in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and a Warrant given for them, and Directions given how they should be Managed. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 3. and 3. 16. and manie other places: nothing of this can be said of the Holy Days; People may Pray as oft as they will, and so may the Church meet as oft as she will for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Service, as the Jews might Offer as oft as they pleased: but the Jews were never allowed to set up stated Days, and to separate them from other Days for their Free-will-offerings: no more are Christians allowed to do so with respect to Prayers and Praises. 3. If Modes of Worship, or stated Days for them, be not less Acceptable because Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie, there could be no such thing as <hi>Will Worship;</hi> which yet the Scripture condemneth: and it were not Worshipping GOD in vain to <hi>Teach for Doctrine, the Commandments of Men (viz.</hi> about Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) which is contrary to <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th.</hi> 15. 9. I confess, Prayer and Praises are not the less accepted because Voluntarie: for these are Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Duties: but to separate Days from Common use to these Exercises, and that without special occasion, and constantly, when GOD hath appointed a recurrent Day for that end; this is not Commanded in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, nor in particular: nor hath any Analogie with the Jewish Free-will-offerings: this we Assert, not to be within the Power of the Church: if he think it is, he must Prove it. He sayeth, <hi>the Doctrine of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62347:115"/>
Presbyterians is contrary to all Christian Churches,</hi> and he telleth us of Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to this purpose by <hi>Durellus:</hi> No doubt there may be many Citiations brought of Churches differing from us: but such an universal Assertion cannot be Proved by a Thousand Instances; if we can bring one instance to the contrary: and for this we adduce the Apostolick Church: I have also §. 4. mentioned Churches, and Learned Men in them, who are as far from his Opinion, in the Matter of Holy Days, as from ours. I shall now add some more: <hi>Luther. lib. ad Nobilitatem Germanicam, Art. 5. consultum esse ut omnia Festa aboliantur, praeter diem Dominicum.</hi> And <hi>lib. de bonis operibus, Utinam</hi> (saith he) <hi>apud Christianos nullum esset Festum nisi dies Dominicus.</hi> That <hi>Calvin</hi> was really against them all, though for Peace he yielded to some few of them, I have shewed above. <hi>Bucer, in Math. 12. p.</hi> 118. hath these Words, <hi>Ferias alias, sive Dei-pari Virginis, sive Christi, sive Sanctorum Nomine commendatae sint, optarem abrogatas uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versas.</hi> And he bringeth strong Reasons for his Opinion, while he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: <hi>Primum enim constat, nullo Dei verbo invectas: ubi enim in Apostolicis Scriptis aliquid de Natali Christi, de Epiphania, &amp; similibus? facile credide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim Zelo Dei a veteribus introductas, qua Ferias Ethnicorum, seu clavum clavo pellerent, sed quis dicet hunc Zelum secundum Scripturam, qui omni adeo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, &amp; Exemplo Scripturae careat; moreque rationem humanam secuta est: Alting. in Exeges. Confess. August. Art. 15. p.</hi> 93. giveth account that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> objected to the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> that they had no Holy Days except the Lords Day. I hope here are some Christian Churches on our side: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> (beside what I have cited out of him before) hath these Words, <hi>Eth. Christian. lib. 2. cap. cap. 10. Nobis hodie eosdem dies observare nihil necesse est.</hi> And after, <hi>Itaque, neque dies illos colere, aut observare necesse est, aut operae proetium.</hi> And below, <hi>Apparet quanta superstitio postea inducta sit, &amp; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo istorum dicrum Festorum, ut omnino tolli satiùs sit. Thes. Salmur. in a Disputation</hi> on this Subject, by <hi>Capellus,</hi> commends these Churches, which in their Reformation, did quite abolish them, (it is evident then, that such Churches there were: and we are not contrary to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches) and he giveth his Reason, <hi>in religione enim, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do vel tantillum a Dei praescripto disceditur; &amp; homines aliquid sibi licere volunt, aut putant, omnia tuta timenda sunt, siquidem experientià comprobatum est, a quam exiguis, &amp; imperceptibilibus initiis, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus facius sit in Idololatriam, &amp; horrendam superstitionem in Ecclesia Pontificia progressus.</hi> And after, <hi>Ut satius esse videatur, bono aliquo utili, sed minus necessario carere, quam ex illius usu incurrere in grave grandis alicujus mali periculum.</hi> Here I confess this Author doth not expresly condemn the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62347:116"/>
Holy Days as simply unlawful, yet he is far from allowing them: <hi>Rivet</hi> on the fourth Command discourseth to the same purpose. I find also cited, <hi>Constitutiones Dordraci,</hi> 1578. Where are these Words. <hi>optandum esset libertatem sex diebus operandi a Deo concessam in Ecclesiis retineri, &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum diem Dominicum feriatum esse?</hi> What is said may sufficiently evince that Presbyterians in this, are not so Antarctick to all the World as he imagineth: though it is their Principle to take the Apostolick Church, and none other for their Guide; yet with due respect to all other sound Churches, both Ancient and Modern.</p>
               <p>§ 13. He passeth over in silence not a few of the most material Passages, and what is truly Argumentative, in the Book that he hath now under Consideration; and pitcheth on two Instances that he had given, and I had Answered, of Anniversary Holy Days instituted by the Jewish Church; whence he pleadeth that the Christian Church may do the like; the first is <hi>the Fasts mentioned, Zech.</hi> 15. The Answer to this was given, 1. <hi>God disowned these Fasts, and if it be alledged that they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, only on Account of Neglect of Seriousness in Managing them, that must be proved.</hi> His Reply is, <hi>He leaves us to Guess what Word of Scripture he buildeth this Fancy upon.</hi> I crave him Pardon for that Omission; himself supplieth it, <hi>p.</hi> 173. it is <hi>verse 5. Did ye Fast to me.</hi> He saith, <hi>that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports only that they were Careless, &amp;c. in their Publick Appearance before God;</hi> and sheweth that <hi>as much, or more hath been said of Solemnities that Christ himself appointed;</hi> all which we deny not; neither do I doubt that so much is imported, yea and mainly aimed at, in that Passage. Their Profaneness and Irreligiousness did bear more Bulk in the Prophets Eye than their Superstition. I indeed call for Proof that no more is here reproved, but their wrong Way of going about these Fasts. And I give this Reason for that Demand: though it is a Negative that is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as he stateth it. He bringeth an Argument from a Practice which God expresly disowneth. It is evident that there was Sinful Evil in this Action; he must then prove that there was also some Good in the Action; otherwise he can draw no Argument from it to prove its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableness; the Management of this Solemnity was Evil; that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove these Holy Days to have been accepted; for on that account expresly they are disowned: the Controversie is about the Authority by which they were appointed; to wit, the Churches; we say that could never make them Good: he saith it doth: here is then an Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative that he must prove: But to please him, for this once, I shall
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62347:116"/>
prove, that these Fasts are disowned on this account also: though it be not here expressed. This Action is simply condemned, <hi>viz.</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting: the Lord looketh not on it as <hi>done to Him:</hi> therefore all the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness that is in it; is to be lookt on as the Ground of this Disowning: that want of Divine Institution was one part of the Sinfulness of it, I prove, because in general (under which this Particular is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) all Religious Acts, or Solemnities which have no Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are condemned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 9. and by other Grounds that I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove laid down. If there be two or more Sorts of Immorality in one Action: no doubt both are condemned in that Action, though but one of them be expressed; as in this Instance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 31. in that Infanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, there was Idolatry, and most Unnatural Murther, and also Will-Worship, the Action is simply condemned; but only the Evil of Will-Worship is mentioned, <hi>which thing I Commanded not, neither came it into my Mind:</hi> will any say that the other Evils of that Action are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; nor the Action for them, because they are not mentioned in that Place. Wherefore, from an Action so positively condemned, he can make no Argument for its Lawfulness, (which is our Debate about the Fasts) unless he can, <hi>aliunde,</hi> prove, that this was no Fault in that Action, that it had no Divine Authority; for to suppose it, is to take for granted what is the Matter of our Debate. From all this it appeareth, that he hath no Ground to say, that <hi>if the Jews had had regard to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Institutions, their Solemn Fasts had been acceptable to God,</hi> though appointed by Humane Authority: neither is there Cause to reject this Exposition as new, seing there is such Ground for it. He next taketh notice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Answer given to his Objection, <hi>The Prophets had many things of greater Moment to reprove, and insist particularly on, that they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to comprehend such things as these under general Reproofs.</hi> Hence he infers, that these were not particularly reproved. What Advantage were it to him, if this were granted; is it not enough that they are clearly condemned in general general Terms. But this Consequence we will not yield: it only followeth, that other things of more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are, in some Places of Scripture, mentioned, when these are not. But there are particular Reproofs of these in other Places, as hath been above shewed, and will more appear anone.</p>
               <p>§ 14. I shall now adduce another Answer to his Argument; which might take off its Force, supposing that these Fasts were not condemned by the Lord, (which yet I do not grant) but approved. They were
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62347:117"/>
appointed under a present Calamity, and Providential Call from the Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> the Captivity, and Desolation of <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Temple. Here was a Call to extraordinary Fasting on that Occasion; and they only determined the Circumstance of Time, which was not determined by the Lord, nor any other Appointment was made by God, which might super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>de this recurrent Solemnity. Now that the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed these Solemnities merely for that Ocasion, appeareth from their Enquiry about the Continuance of them, now that Calamity was over. Some might plead long Custom on the one hand, others with more Reason, might plead, that the Cause being taken away, the Effect should cease; as <hi>Calvin,</hi> on the Place observeth: This cannot be said of our Holy Days, which are appointed to Perpetuity; and without any determined End; and also for the Ends these are designed for, (I mean our Holy Days) the Lord hath appointed other Ordinances, and not left it to Men to devise Ways to Commemorate these Mercies. I add yet another Answer, these Fasts were appointed in a very corrupt Time, and State of the Church, which cannot afford us a binding Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and we have no Ground to think, that in the Churches Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in <hi>Ezra's</hi> Time, these Fasts were continued: what Light we have from <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. inclineth to the contrary. I had brought two Instances of Solemn Times of Humane Institution being condemned, which he next examineth, <hi>p. 175. &amp;c. 1 Kings</hi> 12. 33. Where <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for appointing a Holy Day, that God had not instituted. His Answer to this is, that <hi>this is to Disguise Scripture History: Jeroboam is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for Idolatry, and Worshipping the Calves; but if he had appointed a Feast in Honour of the true God, and commanded the People to offer their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices at Jerusalem, he ought not to have been blamed.</hi> To this I Reply, that this is a very surprising Answer, and I know not that any beside him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, hath ever made bold with Religious Institutions at this Rate: for here is a wide Door opened for all the Devices of Men that do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly Clash with any particular Appointment of God; and that both in the Jewish and Christian Church. And if this Doctrine be received, no Ceremonies that either the Apostate Jewish Church, before Christ's Incarnation, or that the Antichristian Church in the Days of the Gospel hath introduced, can be condemned; let them appoint and do what they will, only keep from a Sinister Opinion about the Value, or Necessity of these Devices of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n: And if this Principle be good, why might not <hi>Jeroboam</hi> appoint other Places for Sacrifices beside <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:62347:117"/>
not hindring Sacrifices to be offered there too as well as appoint Feasts beside these that the Lord hath appointed, not condemning the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of these of Divine Institution. Further, <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Feast is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly condemned on this Formal Reason, that the Time was <hi>Devised</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Created) <hi>of his own Heart,</hi> he made it of nothing, there being no Ground for it by Gods Authority. Now according to this Learned Author, Men may Create as many of these Days as they will, provided they design to Worship the true God on them. <hi>It is a strange Dream</hi> (to use his own Word) to clear <hi>Jeroboam</hi> from Guilt on that Account, for which he is so expresly condemned; no doubt he Sinned highly in his Idolatry; but that he was Innocent in <hi>Devising</hi> this new Feast, is a <hi>new Opinion,</hi> beyond these which this Author is <hi>Enquiring</hi> into.</p>
               <p>§ 15. The other Scripture brought to condemn these Solemnities not instituted by God, and yet made Anniversary by Men, is, <hi>Matth. 15. 9, In vain do they Worship me, Teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</hi> We think this a plain enough Scripture to condem all Humane Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ceremonies, in general, and Anniversary Holy Days that have no Divine Warrant, as a <hi>Species</hi> comprehended under that <hi>Genus.</hi> This my Adversary seemeth to Smile at, as Ridiculous; and that from the Confidence he hath in an Exposition of this Scripture, wherein I think he is Singular; and may be more exposed than any Comment given by others: which he superciliously rejecteth: it is this, <hi>Teaching for Doctrines, in the Language of the New Testament, is affirming such a thing to be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or immediate Will of God, when it hath no other Original than Humane Institution; and nothing else but what shall bear some Analogie to that, is the Crime here reproved.</hi> It seems his Confidence was mixed with some Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of this his Comment on the Text: when he thinketh to Ward off a Blow by the uncertain Sound of, <hi>what beareth Analogie to that:</hi> what he will make to <hi>bear Analogie</hi> to calling that God's Command, which is but Mans Device, we cannot tell, unless he shall please, in his next Edition, to inform us. For his Exposition it self, it is no way to be admitted, nor can he prove, by Instances, that this is the Language of the New Testament: I am sure this Place cannot be so understood. For the things that Christ here calleth by that Name are, strict Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Washing the Hands when they came from the Mercat-Place, Religious Washing of Pots, Tables, Cups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dotations made to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> the Church Treasure, with Neglect of Relieving their Necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62347:118"/>
were the Commands, or immediate Will of God; more than our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonialists Teach their Ceremonies to be such (for both pretend a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Command for obeying the Church) I think he will never be able to prove: all that appeareth that they Taught about these Things (so far as either Scripture, or other History doth inform us) is, that these Things ought to be observed; that it is Sin, and Schism, and therefore Censurable, to neglect them; and that on account of the Churches Authority to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them.

He maketh our Argument from that Text, to run thus; <hi>God did not Command the Israelites to burn their Sons and Daughters in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom; Ergo, to appoint a Time for the Solemn and Religious Performance of that Worship, which he himself comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

falleth under the same Censure.</hi> This Way of Arguing is none of ours but his own. We thus argue, God condemneth that Worship of the Jews, as on other accounts, so on this; that <hi>he Commanded it not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came it into his Mind, Ergo,</hi> no Worship devised by Men, and not instituted by God, is allowable.

With having the Loins girt; having Shoes on the Feet, and a Staff in the Hand:</hi> and he asserts, that <hi>there is nothing in the Original Precept, that giveth the least Hint of its being Temporary, and Relative to their Itinerary State in the Wilderness: but rather, that it was of perpetual Force and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the Church changed that Ritual of Divine Institution, into another that signified more propperly Rest, as the other did their Travelling in the Wilderness.</hi> Here is plain Dealing; whereby our Author giveth us yet further to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his Principles. I shall not call this Parcel of Divinity simply <hi>New:</hi> but I am sure it is <hi>New</hi> among Protestants: nor did I ever meet with any of the Prelatick Party, who carried the Churches Power of instituting Ceremonies to this Height. For if this Reasoning have any Force, it will conclude, that the Church, may not only add to Gods Institutions; but may abolish some of them, and put others, more sit, in their Room; and if so, why should we blame the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who, though Christs Appointment was that Bread and Wine should be given to the People in the Lords Supper, yet have thought it sitter that they should only have the Bread, and the Wine should be reserved for the Priest alone; and Kings, and some others, by the Popes Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: and they give as good Reason for what they say, as he doth

               <p>§. 18. Another Instance he bringeth of CHRIST'S complying with the Jewish rites not Instituted by the LORD is, <hi>the Jews used a postcoenium, of Bread and Wine, after the Paschal Lamb: This Christ not only complyed with, but he adopted it into his own Religion, and gave it a high Signification, and made it a Faederal rite of the New Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. here is another piece of his Divinitie, which I confess is not so singular as the former; for some pretenders to be Antiquaries, and great Criticks, have in this, trode the way before him. <hi>Answer,</hi> If we should yield what they here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as to Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Jews used to eat Bread and drink Wine, after eating the Paschal Lamb; and that Christ did the like; will any rational Man say, that this is an Approving of their Adding to the Ceremonies of the Passover. For, 1. Can they prove
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62347:120"/>
that Christ did this in imitation of that Jewish Custom: or that he had any regard to it: may not we do the same Action that another doth, yet do it on other Designs than imitation of that Person? or, is it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable that our Lord would build so great a Gospel Ordinance on such a Foundation, as is the Practice of such an Apostate People as the Jews then were? sure he had a higher Design in this Heavenly Institution. Again, if there was such a Custom then in the Jewish Church; there is no ground to think that it was of any great Antiquitie; or that is was brought in while that Church continued in any measure of Puritie; but it must have had its rise in the time of that Apostace that ushered in their rejecting the Messiah, and their being utterly rejected of God, for so doing; for we read nothing of it before the Captivitie; nor after it while the <hi>Maccabees</hi> lived: Now can any Man think that Christ, who had reproved their Religious Washings, and other Ceremonies, would be so fond of these, which stood on the same bottom with them? I further Answer, that this Tradition of the <hi>Postc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nium</hi> is a groundless fancie: I find no such Custom among the Jews, of taking Bread and Wine after the Paschal Supper. <hi>Scaliger</hi> first broached this Opinion of a <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenium,</hi> or two parts, or Services in the Paschal Supper. And is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> for it, but Defended by <hi>Capell de literis Hebrae: p.</hi> 167. who out of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> giveth a long Account of all the rites used by the Jews in the Celebration of it: <hi>Lightfoot</hi> also, and <hi>Grotius,</hi> give a verie critical Accompt of their Rites out of the same <hi>Rabbi: Addison</hi> also, in his <hi>Description of the present State of the Jews in Barbarie;</hi> describeth that Feast, as Celebrated by them: but what our Author allegeth is found in none of them: but on the contrarie; I find two things that they agree in, which maketh against his <hi>Postcaenium</hi> of Bread and Wine, and Christ imitating of it: The 1. Is, the Jews used many Benedictions at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cups, and Morsels they took: so did not our Lord: he Blessed the Meat that they eat, no doubt, and we read of this Blessing Bread and Wine in the LORD'S Supper; but to say that he repeated so many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions (which were no fewer than Eight or Nine; beside several Instructions that that they read out of the Scripture, which Reading they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and other Composers of their own) and all these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions were by a set Form of Words. If my Antagonist will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us that our LORD conformed to all these Rites, he must prove it by good Arguments, and not Authoritatively impose on Peoples Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. The 2. Thing that I observe out of the Accompt that these
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62347:120"/>
Authors give of the Passover is, that they begin with a Cup, then they take the quantitie of Olive of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>bitter Herbs,</hi> and dip it in Sauce made for that Feast, then they eat what each one listeth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some other Observations, they take the quantitie of an <hi>Olive</hi> dipt as before, and after they may eat nothing that Night: here is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with Bread and Wine, for a <hi>Postcaenium.</hi> Yea, <hi>Capellus</hi> (who seemeth to be too fond of our Authors Notion, that Christ had regard to the Passover rites in Instituting His Supper) giveth yet a quite other Accompt of it than he doth: for he telleth us, that Christ took Bread and Wine in stead of that Morsel of the bigness of an <hi>Olive:</hi> whence it clearly followeth, that Christ did not appoint Bread and Wine in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Postcaenium,</hi> consisting of the same Materials: If he have no better Argument to Prove the <hi>vanity of Presbyterian Speculations</hi> (as he phraseth it) their Opinions will be able to stand against all his Assaults. I adde the Observation of <hi>Buxtorf Synagog: Judaic: cap.</hi> 13. who after a full Accompt of the Jewish Passover, and all the Rites of it, hath these Words, <hi>p. 307. ex paucis istis facile perspici potest, Judaeos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ 19. His next Work is, to Justifie his high Extoling of the Holy Days: he had said, <hi>it is certain that nothing perserveth the knowledge of the Christian Religion among the Bodie of the People more than the Festivities of the Church:</hi> and this I called <hi>raving,</hi> the Word and Sacraments being more useful for that End. To this he Answereth two things, <hi>p.</hi> 181. 182. The first is, that <hi>he did not Attribute this effect to the Festivities without the Word and Sacraments, to which they are subordinate: as being the fittest seasons for Christian Exercises.</hi> I still think this is no sober Doctrine: for there is a fitter Season for these of Christs appointment, even the Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Beside, it is evident that he Spake of his Festivities, though not in a separated Notion, yet in a distinct Notion, from the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; and I not only think that GOD'S Ordinances are more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual without, than with Mans devices, I mean the Holy days; because having no Institution, they have not the Promise of the Blessing, and are but <hi>vain Worship;</hi> but that GOD'S Ordinances used with the Holy days; if any Efficacie be to be expected from that Conjunction, have a greater Efficacie toward preserving Knowledge among the People, than the Holy days can have; therefore, there is a more Efficacious mean for that end, what ever notion he take the Holy days in. But the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62347:121"/>
may know, that this Expression was not the only ground why <hi>raving</hi> was imputed to him; but several others of that, or a higher strain; which were Examined, but he is pleased to Pass what was said against them; with this shift, he <hi>is not at leasure to follow the Vindicator every where, far less is he inclined to Examine all these Exceptions against the Author of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> I find him at leasure for as needless Work, as it were to Clear to us these, and the like Passages, <hi>do we not see all Nations agree in this, that publicke Solemnities, and annversarie Festivities, and Fasts, are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to the Beeing and Beautie of Religion,</hi> (this is a soaring flight of his fancie) <hi>they preserve and increase our Mortification. They oblige the most Stubborn and Impenitent to think of his Soul: and the visible Practices of the Church Preach Repentance more effectually, and make more lasting Impressions, than the loose and definite Homilies of self conceited Men</hi> (all the Sermons of the Presbyterians, no doubt are here meant) <hi>the Reformation of the Greek Church is hindred by neglecting of Fasting: the Holy days are the Catechisms of the People:</hi> all the Notes made on the Passages for exposing of them, he passeth over in silence; the Reason is, if ye will believe him, not that he could not Answer all; but because he was not at leasure. A second Answer he bringeth is, that <hi>the Festivities cannot be considered without the Word and Sacraments; and other Exercises of Religion,</hi> and this he taketh a great deal of Pains to illustrate; as it is usual in Disputing for one to say most when he hath least to say; and he calleth it <hi>gross ignorance</hi> to think otherwise. I need not tell him how many of his Partie make more than a Metahysical Precision, either formal, or <hi>objective,</hi> of the Holy day, from the Religious Work of it; while they Celebrate it, without going to Prayers, in idleness or that which is worse, I know this is not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Church; yet, it is evident that these Days are capable of such an abstracted Consideration; I mean, in Practice, what ever be in the speculations that Men have about them: All that he so laboriously sayeth about the Conjunction of the Holy days with Religious Exercise on them, will evanish, if we consider, that our Question is not, whether the Serious and Solemn Exercises of Religion be necessarie to these Great Uses, and Effects that he speaketh of, for that we are agreed in; that these are <hi>necessarie to the Beeing and Beautie of Religion: they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and increase our Mortification: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He should have told us, whether he understandeth this <hi>relative Holiness,</hi> or a mere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominative Holiness; that they are called Holy, but there is nothing of Holiness in them, even with respect to the Authoritie and Work that they have relation to. He doth indeed tell us; that they are called Holy days by a relative, and extrinsick Denomination, which is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical notion not easily intelligible (he Chargeth others with <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense, and gross ignorance,</hi> on less Ground,) a relative Denomination must be a Denomination built on a Relation; which supposeth a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Holiness in these Days, which yet he seemeth to disown again. If the Authoritie by which they are Instituted, and the Exercises per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in them, can communicate a relative Holiness to them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth their Holiness differ from that of the LORD'S Days? It hath no more but a relative Holiness, resulting from Divine Authoritie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning it, and the Holy Exercises that the LORD hath Commanded to be performed in it. The Difference then, must be only this, that it hath a relative Holiness of GOD'S making: these a relative Holiness of Mans making: and so Man as well as GOD, shall have a Power to Communicate a relative Holiness to Days, and consequently to Places, and other Things: and how much of the Popish Superstition, and Power of Consecration, that will bring in, I know not; neither, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, was himself aware of it.

                  <hi>Shuffling</hi> to Excuse his former <hi>Shuffling;</hi> he is entangled by Wrestling to Extricat himself. For he supposeth the whole Question, that there is a Power perpetually lodged in the Church, to appoint Holy Days; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he saith nothing to the purpose. Again, he supposeth that appointing of Holy Days, is as much in the Churches Power, as other Regulating of Publick Solemnities; whereas he should have considered, if he would have Explained, and not Confounded and Darkened the Matter, that there is a Regulating of Publick Solemnities, which lyeth in determining Circumstances, which must be determined, and yet are not determined in Scripture, such as the Time, Place, and Order of these Religious Actions, that the Lord hath appointed his Day to be spent in: there is another Regulating, which is adding to what the Lord hath appointed; more Days to his Day, new Religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to these which are of Divine Institution; or determining Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which neither are determined by God, nor need to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; such as are more Holy Days than Christ hath appointed; the Churches Power about the first sort we do not controvert: her Power about the second is the Subject of our Question: and here he either sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the Question, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church had such Power; or he saith nothing to the purpose. Yet further, when he speaketh indistinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Apostolick Power, and that of their Successors, as to this Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if he mean no more than such Regulation as is always in the Churches Power, he giveth the Successors of the Apostles the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating Power that themselves had; the Consequence of which is, that their Successors (I suppose he meaneth the Bishops) may institute new Offices, new Government, new Discipline, and all other Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Church, as the Apostles might: which is full as high as the Papists Screw up the Power of the Church, and is indeed, to make the Bishops absolute <hi>Lords over God's Inheritance.</hi> And this he confirmeth by telling us, that <hi>the Apostles made Constitutions that were laid aside by their Successors; and other Usages came in their Room,</hi> but because he saw this ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Exception he distinguisheth betwixt <hi>greater Usages, that are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unless they are equally subservient to the great Ends of Discipline, in all Ages and Countries; &amp; nisi consuetudine Ecclesiae universae sint roboratae: and lesser Usages, whose Continuance and Abrogation may depend on the Convenience of particular Churches;</hi> and he giveth an Instance in the <hi>Deaconesses,</hi> which he saith <hi>are not in the Presbyterian Meetings, nor any Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> If he would have Extricated himself from the <hi>Shuffling</hi> that was
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62347:124"/>
imputed to him, he should have given us some Rules, or Characters, by which we might discern, what Constitutions of the Apostles are to be accounted Great, and Unalterable; and what Small, and Changeable by their Successors: if Marches be not clearly Rid here, we are at a Woful Uncertainty: yea, bold Men may dare to meddle with Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy it self: and pretend that it is one of <hi>the lesser Apostolical Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> if they did at all appoint it. The Marks that he hath given us are very insufficient, their <hi>universal Subservience to the Ends of Discipline</hi> will be as much controverted, as whither they be great Constitutions or not: he saith Bishops and Holy Days are such; we deny it; and will Debate it with him; and so we are still in the Dark, what Apostolick Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions may be laid aside, or must be retained; for his <hi>consu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We neither Scruple because the Day is Anniversary; a Day for Civil Solemnity, appointed by men, may be such: nor because it is set apart for Religious Use; an Occasional Day for Solemn Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, when God by a special Providence calleth for the Work, and Man determineth the Day, is lawful, as is the perpetual recurrent Lords
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62347:125"/>
Day, appointed by God; nor thirdly, do we quarrel these Days, merely because they want a special Divine Warrant; because Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Days for Civil Use, might be appointed by Men. But the Ground of our Scruple is, the Complex Nature of these Days; that they are wholly separated from Civil Use, as the Lords Day is; that they are perpetually Discriminated from other Days in the Year; and that they are perpetually Dedicated to Religion, and all this, not by Divine, but by Humane Authority. If there be any <hi>Raving,</hi> or any thing unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible in this, I shall be content to be Instructed by him; or any who is of his Opinion. Are there not many Actions that are Good and Lawful; considered under several Circumstances; which if ye consider all their Circumstances Complexly, are Unlawful; for Instance, the Magistrat may appoint his Subjects to meet in Arms; he may also appoint that this Meeting be Yearly, Monethly, or Weekly, if need be; yea he may appoint this Meeting to be on the Lords Day, in Case of Necessity; yet he cannot lawfully appoint that they should, without Necessity, meet every Year, every Moneth, or every Week, on the Sabbath Day. He complaineth that it is called <hi>Thrasonick Triumph,</hi> when he telleth us of <hi>Danger and Impiety in separating from the Church, in these excellent Constitutions that are received from the beginning, and in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where the Name of Jesus hath been Worshiped: such Constitutions and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities have been derived from the Apostles, or Apostolick times:</hi> These are his Words; though in his Review of them here, he seemeth to Smooth them a little. He will have it only to be <hi>Thrasonick Boasting,</hi> when a Man admireth his own Wit or Performances. I love not to contend about Words; nor need I to <hi>write a Dictionary</hi> on this Occasion: nor shall I judge what Opinion he hath of himself; but I leave it to the Reader to judge, whither it may not be so Termed, when one insulteth over his Adversary, as having great and evident Advantage against him, when yet there is no Cause for so thinking; and whither he be not guilty of this Boasting, (or whatever he will call it) while he insinuateth the Universality, the Antiquity, and the Apostolick Authority of the Holy Days, and that with charging his Adversarieswith <hi>dangerous Impiety,</hi> on account of their differing from them; while all these are the things that he and I do controvert about.</p>
               <p>§ 24. He taketh it ill that it was called <hi>a loose Reasoning,</hi> when he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us that <hi>the Knowledge of Christ doth not extinguish the Light of Reason; therefore such Constitutions (as the Reason of Mankind is agreed in) have
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62347:125"/>
nothing in them contrary to the Purity of our Religion.</hi> This was called <hi>loose Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,</hi> because he taketh an Uncontested Truth for his first Proposition; and the Conclusion that we Debate about is supposed, in place of the second Proposition. His Defence is; <hi>No Society of Mankind ever thought Anniversary Holy Days unlawful; but all of them thought them proper Means to Excite Religion:</hi> he telleth us that <hi>Clamours against them</hi> (so he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our Reasons) <hi>destroy all Unity and Order, about things not only Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but Useful in their own Nature and Tendency:</hi> here is yet more <hi>loose Arguing,</hi> while he supposeth still the thing in Question. We deny their Innocency, also their usefulness; and must do so, till we see better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for what is asserted: the Apostolick Churches did not use them; whence we may with Confidence conclude, that they did not think them proper Means to <hi>Excite Devotion;</hi> yea, it is no weak Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if we infer, that they thought them unlawful; being none of these things which Christ had Commanded, nor his Apostles Taught. That <hi>they were not forbidden,</hi> is Answered above; they are forbidden in general, and that is enough. That Reasoning against Holy Days of Humane Appointment <hi>destroyeth all Unity and Order, &amp;c.</hi> looketh more like <hi>Clamour</hi> than any thing that we have said; there was Unity and Order in the Apostolick Church, without them; and so is there in the Presbyterian Societies. His Syllogism that he presenteth us with, <hi>p.</hi> 201. doth not Retrieve the Looseness of his former Reasonings: it is, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is agreeable to true Reason, is rather improved than condemned by Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but such Constitutions</hi> (he must mean the Holy Days) <hi>are agreeable to true Reason; Ergo, there is nothing in them contrary to the Purity of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> I take no notice of the Form of this Syllogism (of the Rightness of which he is confident) it may easily be reduced to Form, by a little Change of the Conclusion; here is indeed closs Reasoning; but it is not concludent Reasoning: for we deny the Minor: though he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth its Proof, both in prosecuting the first, and the second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. I am not fond of his Method of Probation; he concludeth it after the Form of a <hi>Sorites;</hi> whereas there is nothing like it in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress: but that is a small Matter: I except against his Proof in what is more material; that <hi>all Nations are agreed in this; and this is the best Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of what is agreeable to true Reason:</hi> I deny both these Propositions, 1. How will he prove that all Nations were agreed about the Necessity and Usefulness of Holy Days? Or, I distinguish this Proposition; all Nations are agreed in general, that there should be some Religious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62347:126"/>
Days: if I should put him to the Proof of this, it might puzzle him; but for our part, we think it of great Use, and necessary also, <hi>necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te praecepti;</hi> whatever may be said of the <hi>necessitas medii;</hi> we think it a Wise and Excellent Constitution of the Divine Will, that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Days, (I mean the Christian Sabbath) and Occasional Times of Solemn Worshipping God: but that all Nations are agreed about the Necessity of Holy, Religious Anniversary Days of Mans Appointing; this is yet unproved; the Jewish Holy Days, (till that Church fell into manifold Apostacy) were appointed by God; the Heathenish Religious Rites, (and their Holy Days among the rest) were appointed (as they pretended) by these whom they owned for gods; which I could prove, if it were not to digress; with that Pretension <hi>Numa,</hi> and others gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the People to submit to their Religious Rites. For his second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; it is utterly false, that the Agreement of Nations is the best Evidence of what is according to right Reason: this might hold, if Men were generally Perfect in Knowledge, and Holiness; if their Mind, Will, and Affections had no way been hurt by the Fall; but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State of Fallen, Corrupt, and Sinful Men; it is a False, Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yea Pernicious Position: if understood (as here it must be) of Matters of revealed Religion; such as instituted Worship is. His Proof of this Assertion is most absurd; which is, two Maxims of the Civil Law, wofully misunderstood; and misapplyed, <hi>viz. Quod major pars Curiae efficit, pro eo habetur, ac si omnes egerint;</hi> and, <hi>Refertur ad universos quod publice fit per majorem partem.</hi> This is to be understood, of Humane Courts in any Nation, or Society; not of the Consent of all Nations: otherwise one Nation could not make Laws for it self; but must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use the Volumns of all Nations, that they may know what Laws ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in most Nations. Again, which is yet more to our purpose, these Maxims hold in Civil, not Religious Matters: to make the Consent of Nations to be the Rule of Religion, (as this Author manifestly doth) hath so many Absurdities wrapt up in it, that it is a wonder that such a Fancy could fall into the Head of one who owneth <hi>revealed Religion;</hi> and is not far from <hi>Hobbism,</hi> or <hi>Deisin,</hi> with which he is not sparing to charge the Presbyterians, on far less Cause given. I am far from charging him with these horrid Opinions: but I advise him to beware of Zeal for Humane Holy Doly Days on such Principles as would lead Men into that Snare. If we must be determined by a Pole among Mankind (as his Assertion doth plainly import) in the Matters of our Religion;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62347:126"/>
Heathenism will clearly carry it against Christianity. Yea, Turkism will bid fair for it: and Popery will clearly Outvote Protestantism. This is a thousand times worse than what he (or his Friend) is so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with a Presbyterian Parliament for, having regard <hi>to the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People,</hi> in settling Presbyterial Government; we must now receive the Holy Days, because the Inclinations of the Apostate World, Heathens, Jews, Papists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> incline that Way. His distinguishing of such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, by <hi>considering their general, or abstracted Nature, and considering them with their Ends and Objects;</hi> will not help him; for corrupt Men will always be generally for what is worst, consider it as ye will; neither can it be said, that this Rule of Judging of Religion holdeth not in the Essentials, and great Points; but in the inferior Matters, and Rituals: for, the instituted part of Religion lieth more remote from Mans Reason, as a Contriver of it, than other things in Religion do: because these depend merely on Institution, and the Will of the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as ye can less give a Reason, why Bread and Wine should signifie the Body and Bloud of Christ, (except from the Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ 25. He taketh it very ill, and calleth it <hi>strong Natural Nonsense,</hi> that the Holy Days (and other Religious Ceremonies of Mans Devising) <hi>are called new Means of Grace, which are not to be appointed by Mens Reason; but by Gods Authority,</hi> He saith <hi>they are only appointed to increase our Devotion for the old Means of Grace; they are but Circumstances of time determinable by the Church.</hi> All that is sufficiently refuted already: but he repeateth, and forceth me to do so; <hi>First,</hi> That which is appointed <hi>to increase our Devotion</hi> toward Prayer, the Word and Sacraments, (which are the old Means of Grace) is a Mean of Grace it self; for <hi>increase of Devotion</hi> is Grace; therefore, the Means toward that End must be Means of Grace: and if these be appointed by the Lord, as the Sabbath is, for increase of our Devotion in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is one of these he calleth the <hi>old Means of Grace, viz.</hi> Means of Gods appointing; if appointed by Men; for the same end, they must be <hi>new Means of Grace</hi> appointed by Men; and superadded to these of Gods Appointment. But the Holy Days are such, <hi>ex tuo ore;</hi> being appointed to <hi>increase our Devotion,</hi> this cannot be said of mere determining a Circumstance of Worship; as appointing a Week Day Sermon. 2. That which is necessary to <hi>the Beeing and Beauty of Religion: to keep us in mind of the Mysteries of our Religion, is the Peoples Catechism, &amp;c.</hi> must be a <hi>Mean of Grace;</hi> but all this, and more, he
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62347:127"/>
hath ascribed to the Holy Days; not only to the Work to be done on them, but to it as done on such a Day; they must then be <hi>new Means of Grace,</hi> beside what God hath instituted. 3. That they are but Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Time of Worship, is above refuted; and himself refuteth it, by affirming that they are appointed for <hi>increasing our Devotion.</hi> I should allow him not only to <hi>Smile,</hi> but to burst out into Laughter, if it had been said (as he pretendeth) that Christmass was kept in Honour of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> before Christ was born; he need never want Matter of Laughter, if he be allowed thus to Devise what may make him Merry. All that was said is, that Holy Day was so kept; and thence called <hi>Yule</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Import of which is no more but this; that the same Day being kept by the Heathens on one Account, some Christians chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it into another Use, and Celebrated it as the Day of Christs Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; as I could shew they did with many other, both Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. His Criticising on the Word <hi>Yule,</hi> making it <hi>Noel,</hi> and then turning it to a <hi>nouvelle;</hi> and Expounding it, <hi>a Day of Tidings,</hi> I might rather <hi>Smile</hi> at; I think it not worthy a Laborious Examination. I need not take it very ill that he useth me with Contempt and Scorn, when he, <hi>p.</hi> 208. putteth the Excellent <hi>Buchannan</hi> among the <hi>highest Order of Devils.</hi> It was said that our Author saith as much as that the Holy Days are <hi>the Power of God to Salvation.</hi> He Answered, <hi>p.</hi> 209. he <hi>looketh on them as the Publick and Stated Seasons wherein the Power of God to Salvation is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.</hi> This is far below what he had before said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>they are necessary to the Beeing of Religion, &amp;c.</hi> and this Expression he Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am sure he doth not set us a Copy of such good Nature. We have the Mercat fallen very low; from the Holy Days being <hi>necessary to the Beauty, and Beeing of Religion:</hi> first, to this, that <hi>inward Religion may do well enough without them;</hi> next, <hi>that they are not necessary, but only very useful to the External Profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> And then, that <hi>External Religion needeth them only sometimes.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it may subsist always without them: but it will not, in that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62347:127"/>
Case, be so <hi>Orderly</hi> as were needful. Yet again, it is but for the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> of External Religion, that they are any way useful, so as the <hi>Beeing and Beauty</hi> of it may be kept where they are not observed: only these Churches are not like their Neighbours. And lastly, Religion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and External, may have both its Beeing and Beauty, in particular Persons, though they observe no Holy Days; only it is useful, that if they think fit to go to Church, and to Worship God, <hi>in Society,</hi> on these Days, that they should observe them. If he will allow us thus to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all his big Words, it will tend much to Compromise our Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He taketh it amiss, that it was said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he <hi>Damned them all to Hell who do not observe Christmass;</hi> and this he disowneth. The Ground of that Inference was (for it was not charged on him, further than that it followeth from his Principles) that he maketh the Observation of it <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the beeing of Religion.</hi> I think they who are without the <hi>Beeing of</hi> Religion, are in the Way to Hell; yea though they understand it of <hi>External Religion,</hi> which they are capable to Practise; what can we think of the State of Presbyterians, who do not, yea will not; and think they ought not observe the Holy Days, if the Observation of them be <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Beeing of Religion?</hi> It is not imaginable that a Person of such Sentiments, can have any Degree of Charity to them, with respect to their Salvation, unless he think a Man may be Saved without all <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Religion.</hi>

               <p>§. 2. Before I come to search into the Opinion of the Fathers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, about the Nature of <hi>Schism;</hi> it is needful to premise a few things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>Schism</hi> is a Breach of Unitie; and therefore, there can be no <hi>Schism</hi> where there ought to be no <hi>Unitie;</hi> yea, where there need be no <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> or where there can be no <hi>Unitie.</hi> Wherefore that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what <hi>Schism</hi> is, it is needful to Consider what <hi>Unitie</hi> should, and must be amongh Churches, and among Christians. There are several sorts of <hi>Unitie,</hi> that we cannot have with all Churches, as local Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: some that we need not have, as Identitie of Rites: some that we ought not to have with some Churches; as Communion in false Doctrine, or impure Worship. 2. The <hi>Unitie</hi> of the Church may be Considered in all the Notions in which the Church is considered; or in all the sorts of Churches: In the Catholick Church, visible, and invisible, in all the Combinations of Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Schism</hi> may be also called Positive, or negative in another Sense; the former, when a Partie in a Church, doth not joyn with the Church; yet setteth up no Church in a separated way from that Church, whereof they were Members: the later, when they set up such a distinct Societie; there may be just Causes for both: The <hi>first,</hi> When I cannot joyn with the Congregation I belong to, because of some Corruption that I must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, if I joyn; but I partake with some other more pure Societie; The <hi>second,</hi> When a Body of People cannot joyn without Sin, nor can they have the occasion of a Societie, where they might joyn; they must either live without Ordinances, or set up another Religious Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie; on this Ground <hi>Protestants</hi> did thus separate from the <hi>Popish</hi> Churches. 5. There may be a partial <hi>Separation,</hi> when one Ordinance is so corrupted, that we cannot joyn in it, and yet can joyn with the Church in all other Acts of Communion: and a total <hi>Separation,</hi> when either the Church will not suffer us to joyn with her in any part of her Service, unless we joyn in all; or she is so Corrupt that we can joyn with her in nothing that is Religous. The former by most wise and sober Men, is not reckoned such a <hi>Schism;</hi> as that any are to be blamed as <hi>Schismaticks</hi> on that account; but the Author I now Debate with, aggravateth that even to a very high degree of <hi>Schism;</hi> as also do many of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When a <hi>separation</hi> falleth out in a Church, the Guilt of it doth certainly ly on the one side or the other; and often neither side is wholly innocent; they who have cause to <hi>separate,</hi> may manage their Good cause by evil Methods, and in a way that is not wholly Commendable: now to know on which side the blame of the <hi>Schism</hi>

                  </gap>ieth, we must not always conclude that they are in the fault. 1. Who are the fewer Number; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise most Reformations of the Church were sinful: Nor, 2. Who <hi>separate</hi> from the Church Rulers, themselves being in Possession of Church Authority: for this should condemn our Reformation from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris;</hi> Nor, 3. Who <hi>separate</hi> from that Partie that hath the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of civil Authority, and hath the Law on its side; not only because it is the Gospel, not the Law of the Land, that is the Rule of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Church Practice: but also because that is variable, and by that Rule, they who were the sound Partie one year, may be <hi>Schismaticks</hi> the other; without any Change in their Principles or Practice; which is absurd. Wherefore the blame of <hi>Schism,</hi> in that case, lieth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on them who hath the wrong side of that controverted Matter about which they divide; or who, though their Opinion be better than that of the opposite Partie, yet depart from the Communion of their Brethren without sufficient Cause; every thing that we may justly blame, not being sufficient for making a Rent in the Church. Hence it plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that Mens assuming to themselves the name of the Church, is not sufficient Ground for them to Brand such as <hi>Schismaticks</hi> who depart from their Communion: Where Truth and Gospel Puritie is, there is the Church, and they who have most of these are the soundest Church.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Having laid this Foundation for Discerning what is truly <hi>Schism,</hi> and where the Blame of it lieth: I shall next enquire into the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ancient Church, about <hi>Schism:</hi> it is evident that they did Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it; and set forth its Sinfulness, and sad Consequences, with a great deal of Zeal, and that justly; for it is not only a sinful thing on the one side, or the other, but is a great Plague and Judgment from the LORD on a Church, and tendeth to the of Ruine of Good Order, of the inward and outward Practice of Religion, and of Mens Souls; and herein I shall make no Debate with my Antagonist in what he Discourseth, <hi>p.</hi> 211. 212. He is in a vast Mistake, if he reckon it among <hi>the New O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions</hi> of Presbyterians, that they think well of <hi>Schism,</hi> that is truely such;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62347:129"/>
or speak diminutively of the Evil and Hazard, and Fatal Effects of it; nay, our Principle is, that a Man should part with what is dearest to him in the World, to Redeem the Peace and Unitie of the Church; yea, that nothing can Warrant, or Excuse it, but the Necessity of shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin. It is also evident that the Ancients were very Liberal in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing on one another the odious Names of <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> as also of <hi>Heretick;</hi> and that often proceeded from a true (though mistaken) Zeal for lovely Truth, and beautiful Unity: at other times it might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from some sinful Infirmities, that they (as all Men are) were Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to. Good Men may be Zealous for their own Opinions, because they take them to be the Truths of GOD. The Fathers called several Practices <hi>Schism,</hi> and shewed a great dislike of them all. As, 1.

               <p>§. 6. There is another sort of Unity much regarded among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which though the Breach of it had as bad influence on all, or most Churches, and so on the Catholick Church: yet it properly respected Neighbour Churches; either, which were united by the Bond of one Government, a Provincial, or lesser Synod, being made up of them: or only living in the vicinitie of one another, or having frequent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Correspondence; they who were not under any uniting Bonds, but these commune to all the parts of the Catholick Church, yet had an Unity of kind Correspondence, mutual Assistance, as occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; acquainting one another with their Affairs, so far as it was of any Advantage: admitting the Members of other Churches to Communion

with them, on occasion; refusing Communion with such Members of other Churches, as were by them Excommunicated: and this Unity was then broken when these Acts of Friendship were shunned, or refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; especially when they who were cast out by one, were received to another: or when occasional Communion was either shuned by them who so joyned in another Church, or denied to such Sojourners, if they desired it: or, when one Church shewed Rage, Furie, and Bitterness against another; because of what they differed about. Instances of this are many: the Difference betwixt <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> came to that Height, that they would not Communicate together; one of them Anathematized the other: and it spread so far that the Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> and these of <hi>Africk</hi> did concern themselves in it. <hi>Eusebi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The Unity of Associated Churches who were Governed in Common, to which Government that of the several Congregations was subordinate, consisteth especially in the Agreement of the Rules in their Meetings for Managing the Publick and Common Affairs of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and each Member submitting to what was Determined by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Consent of the Plurality; whether it were Injunctions, Reproofs, or Censures. The Breach of this Unitie was when any, one, or moe, of that Ruleing Society took on them to Oppose or Contradict what was Determined as above-said: much more when they did that by themselves, which should have been done by the whole, as when <hi>Foeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissimus,</hi>

and some others of the Presbyters of <hi>Carthage,</hi> absolved some of the Lapsed, neglecting <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Bishop, or <hi>Praeses,</hi> and the Body of the Presbyters: which <hi>Cyprian</hi> did Highly, and Justly Resent. Or when they, or any of the People, refused Subjection to the just Decisions of the Church Rulers Assembled. This sort of <hi>Schism</hi> is much of the same Nature with what followeth, I insist no further on it: for it is the same Thing, as to Church Unity, whether any Minister of the Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against the Bishop; if that be the right Government of the Church; or against the Synod, Presbyterie Classical, or Congregational; if that be the way that CHRIST hath Appointed. Yea, it is the same Breach of Unity, to set up another Bishop, beside the true Bishop of the Church; or a new Synod or Presbyterie, beside these which one was before a Member of, or Subject to; yea, or to gather a Church, and to set up a Minister and Meeting in a Parish, beside what was orderly there set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. Wherfore the last sort of Unity, or <hi>Schism,</hi> is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to a particular, Congregational Church.

At <hi>Corinth</hi> there was such a <hi>Schism;</hi> they came together, and yet the Apostle saith, <hi>there were Divisions</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>among them.</hi> But <hi>Schisms</hi> in the Church, were of old, and now are, taken in a more restrained Sense for a causeless <hi>separation</hi> from the Church in the publick Exercises of Religion; either by withdrawing only, or by setting up another Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Society also. This the Fathers Expressed, sometimes by <hi>Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Bishop;</hi> or <hi>withdrawing</hi> from him; that is Denying due Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Pastor of that Church; and Obedience to him with the Presbyterie. So it is sometimes Expressed by them; but even when the Presbyterie, or Church is not named; it is so to be understood; and the Bishop is so often Named, because he was (in these times) the constant <hi>Praeses</hi> of their Meetings; and even this Praelation (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sole Jurisdiction, into which it did at last, Issue) began early to be too much taken Notice of, as I have more fully shewed else-where.</p>
               <p>§ 8. I shall first shew that <hi>Schism</hi> was often (yea ordinarilie) thus understood by the Ancients. Next, that they did not always blame this Disobedience and Separation as a Sinful <hi>Schism:</hi> but allowed it to be done in some Cases, and for some Causes. For the former, <hi>Cyprian</hi>

               <p>§ 9. I now come to consider what Apprehensions Modern Writers have had of <hi>Schism.</hi> And here were a large Field to Expatiat in; If I should Examine all or most of them, so many have written on this Subject, and so different their thoughts are of it. Wherefore I chuse one, whom, I think my Antagonist will not except against, the Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> in his <hi>Irenic. p.</hi> 109. The Sum of whose Discourse is; all are bound to joyn into some Church Societie; and being so joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, should continue in that Societie, till his Communion with them becometh Sin. Now for what maketh it Sin to continue in Church Communion, and consequentlie warranteth <hi>Separation;</hi> he supposeth, that Corruption in the Essentials of the Constitution of the Church, may warrant it; but where there are Corruptions crept into a true
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62347:133"/>
Church, yet remaining such, he saith the Question is, whither we may <hi>separate</hi> from such a Church, for purer Administrations; particularly, whither we should <hi>separate</hi> from a Church, because of Corruptions in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xercise of Discipline: he determineth it, that one may <hi>separate</hi> where there are Corruptions in Doctrine and Practice, which are avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and owning them, is required as the Terms of Communion with the Church: he alloweth in that Case, not only Noncommunion, but a total and positive <hi>Separation:</hi> but he telleth us, that where Soundness of Doctrine is retained, but some Corruptions in Practice are tollerated, but not imposed, <hi>Separation</hi> is unlawful on that Account. He saith thirdly, where Doctrine is sound, but some unlawful, or suspected Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is required to be owned, and conformed to, denying of such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie and Communion with the Church in these things is lawful, but positive <hi>Schism,</hi> or erecting <hi>Altare contra Altare</hi> is not lawful. These are Concessions of that profoundly Learned Writer. Against which I have nothing to object, but what I have elsewhere Debated with him, <hi>viz.</hi> Where some unlawful, or suspected Action is required to be done by Ministers or People, and if the Church so imposing, will not suffer them to have Communion with her in any of Gods Ordinances, unless they will conform in these, both they must do (for keeping a good Conscience) and he alloweth them a Negative, and Partial <hi>Separation:</hi> and the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them on a Positive and Total <hi>Separation:</hi> what shall they do in that Case? either they must live without Gospel Ordinances; or they must set up Meetings wherein they must have them: the former is unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; the latter, is, that Positive <hi>Separation</hi> which he condemneth. I with he, or any else, would tell us what is to be done in that Case. Let us then, improve that general, and indisputable Maxim; that we ought not to joyn with any Church, however commendable she be in many things, when our joyning doth engage us in any Action that is our Personal Sin: and that other Truth, which cannot be denyed; that when People are driven away from partaking of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the Church, unless they will do that which is sinful, or that they, after their uttermost Diligence and Sinceritie in Searching, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be sinful; they ought not wholly to live without the Word or Sacraments; and it will clearly follow, that a positive <hi>Separation,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from a true Church; and setting up a Church in a Church, is not only lawful, but is a Dutie; and the Sin of that <hi>Schism</hi> doth not ly on them who so leave the Church, or are driven from her; but on that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62347:133"/>
Church which requireth such unlawful Terms of Communion, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth them with such Rigour.</p>
               <p>§ 10. Having thus Prefaced to our Debate about <hi>Schism.</hi> I proceed to Examine what my Adversarie bringeth to prove the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> which he attempteth without making any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction among them: though he knoweth there were different Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among them, with respect to joyning in Communion with the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Church. He saith, <hi>there is not a Church on Earth, with which they can joyn in Communion, without fear of being polluted.</hi> It was Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>we can joyn with the Churches of Holland, France,</hi> (when the Protestants had their Assemblies there) <hi>and Geneva. &amp;c.</hi> It was not said by the Author whom he refuteth, <hi>that we dislike several things in these Churches;</hi> but by him: and it was Answered, <hi>we can communicate with a Church that is not so pure as we wish: what we dislike we shun the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it; but do not, for that, refuse to communicate with the Church where it is found.</hi> His Refutation of this is, <hi>at this rate it will be hard to find Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in all the Records of the Church.</hi> This is most false: for some did cast off Communion totally with the Church, and set up separate Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, when they could blame no part of Church Practice: but had Quarrels with the Persons that governed the Church. As in the Case of <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> who quarreled with <hi>Cyprians</hi> Promotion, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who made <hi>Schisms,</hi> because they could not be made Bishops. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he argueth, <hi>we cannot be said to be Members of a particular Church, or to hold Communion with it, if we do not joyn in their Worship, as it is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished among them.</hi> This is easily Answered by a plain Distinction; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we joyn in their established Worship, as to the greatest and chief Acts of it; <hi>conceditur:</hi> as to all the parts of it, even to the least, <hi>negatur.</hi> I may joyn with a Church in the Word and Sacraments; and yet if they have a Holy Day or two beside the Sabbath, may forbear, yea I may, without this, be a Member of that Church (if they will suffer me) which all the Reformed Churches do, except the Episcopal Church of <hi>England.</hi> I shewed before, that the Ancients did not place the Unity of the Church in an Uniformity in these Punctilio's, (so they who owne them, do reckon them) and the Modern Churches, mostly are of the same Sentiments, and Practice. In Confirmation of this his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he hath these Words, <hi>p. 214, 215. Since he forbears the Practice of these things he disliketh, why may he not be said to hold Communion with all visible Churches on Earth.</hi> And instanceth not only in the Churches of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:62347:134"/>
                  <hi>France;</hi> but in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. This is an Absurdity beyond what he is aware of; for some Churches we are obliged wholly to flee from; because of Fundamental Errors, Idolatry, and horrid Corruptions of all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: so we <hi>sep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the Learned <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> (as I have observed already) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of a Partial Noncommunion, where Communion is not totally cast off. What he saith, of our <hi>no more coming near a Liturgy than we would Sacrifice our Children in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom:</hi> these I say, are not the Words of Truth and Soberness; nor have they so much of Argument in them, as of unreasonable Sarcasm; and are not to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Cannot one dislike a greater and lesser Evil, unless his Aversion to both be equal?</p>
               <p>§ 11. He falleth next on the <hi>Doxologie, p.</hi> 216. and doth insinuate without any Shadow of Truth or Candor, that <hi>we turn out the Episcopal Clergy for presuming to retain it in Public<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We do not use it, but we never laid such Weight on u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it, as to forbear all Communion with a Congregation where it is used; I called it <hi>a Humane Composure.</hi> He saith, <hi>the Matter of it is Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and Unquestionable; Ergo,</hi> it is no Humane Composure; <hi>non sequitur;</hi> I said; <hi>there is no Warrant for constant Use of it.</hi> He saith, <hi>there is as good Warrant for it, as there is for Extemporary Prayer in Publick Worship.</hi> This is false; we read of no Praying by a Book, or set Form; but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Help, not that of the Book, is the Help we must look for, not only as to the Manner, but the Matter of our Prayers; <hi>what we should Pray for; Rom.</hi> 8. 26. But I insist not on this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he confesseth it to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression; and but toucheth it slightly; I judge it a very impertinent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, (but I behoved to follow as he leadeth) for I think neither Ancient nor Modern Divines will call them <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> who cordially joyn with the Church where they live in all of her Worship, except this; and it seems he hath little Ground to prove the Presbyterians <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> that he bringeth in this to help out his Proof against us. It is false also, that <hi>all the Churches abroad have Humane Ceremonies so twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with their Solemn Worship, that Presbyterians cannot joyn with them.</hi> We have often (and do when occasion serveth) very cordially, and to our Edification, joyned with them; and yet partake in none of these: nor
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62347:134"/>
is so much of these among them as he would make us believe. Another of his Arguments to prove us <hi>Schismaticks</hi> is, <hi>p. 215. If the present Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians had lived a hunder and fifty years before the Council of Nice, there was then a necessity (by their Principles) to separate from the Unity of the Church; because all the things they scruple were then practised.</hi> It was Answered, that the Hierarchy was not then in the Church; this he taketh no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, nor shall I, for we have already Debated it sufficiently. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we make the Beeing of the Hierarchy the Ground of <hi>Separation;</hi> but that Ministers, at least, must owne it, or have no Communion with their Church. But he telleth us of a great many other things that were then used, as <hi>Anniversary Days, Significant Ceremonies, the Sign of the Cross, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>beseecheth me to read some of the ancient Monuments of the Church.</hi> I thank him for his good Advice; I have followed it, in some degree (though I cannot Brag of my Reading, nor Vilifie others, as if their Reading were short of mine) before he gave it; and shall yet further, as I can; and though I find that some of these crept early into the Church; (and yet, may be, not so early as he imagineth) I do not find that the ancient Church placed her Unity in these things; and I think, by the small Reading that I have attained, I have proved the contrary, and therefore if we had then lived, we might have been counted no <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> I further Answer, the Ancients placed <hi>Schism,</hi> with respect to the Universal Church, in her Heterodoxy, not in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Rites; and therefore we maintain Unity with the Fathers, while we believe as they did; for that Unity that should be in a particular Church; we are not capable of it, but with that Church where we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, not with that which was 1600 or 1700 years ago; therefore it is improper to say we are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> because of what we would have been in that possible Case that never was.</p>
               <p>§ 12. His third Consideration to prove us <hi>Schismaticks</hi> is, that <hi>our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors condemned the same Practices as Schismatical;</hi> the Answer to this was given; <hi>this Argument was used by him before, and I Answered it before:</hi> He saith; I leave him to Guess where it was brought, and Answered: and truly I thought it was an easie Guess, being but in the end of the former page, <hi>viz.</hi> 33. If he had read heedfully what he undertaketh to refute, he could not have been at a Loss here. It was there told him, that <hi>as the former Presbyterians did not separate from the Episcopal Church, so nor did all of them of late: and they who did, were driven away by the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Party, from the way that they had engaged in; and that by forcible
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62347:135"/>
changing of the Church Government, without her Consent, or any Means used to satisfie the Consciences of them who scrupled.</hi> I add, in former times Presbytery continued, only Bishops were superinduced; therefore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters did not leave their Stations, till driven from them: but at the last Settling of Episcopacy, Presbytery was razed, (so far as Men could) and what Shew of it was left, stood on the Foot of the Bishops Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who Called and Impowered them to Act. This true Presbyterian Ministers could not submit to; it being an owning of a Power in the Church, which they are convinced is unlawful. His fourth Argument is, <hi>No Schismaticks can be named in the Records of Ecclesiastical History, to whom that Name is more agreeable, than to the Presbyterians in Scotland.</hi> In Answer to this, the <hi>Donatists</hi> were mentioned, as <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> more just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputed such, than the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians can be. And the <hi>Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> might also have been brought as another Instance; to whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, what was said agreeth more directly, <hi>viz.</hi> That they <hi>separated,</hi> because the Church admitted the Lapsed to Repentance. His Refutation of this is a long Discourse of the Original of the <hi>Donatists;</hi> in many Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that do no way concern the present Purpose: and in which are some Mistakes, as far from the Account that we have in the ancient Records, as that Lapse of Memory is, ascribing somewhat to the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> which agreeth better to the <hi>Novatians;</hi> and yet there was great Affinity between these two sorts of <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> they both had the same Rise; <hi>Donatus</hi> in <hi>Africk;</hi> and <hi>Novatus</hi> a Presbyter at <hi>Rome;</hi> (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with one of the same Name, who, upon Discontent, came from <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and joyned with him in making a <hi>Schism)</hi> both of them were, (as they thought) disobliged by the Election of a Bishop, the one, that <hi>Caeciliaenus</hi> was Elected; who (as he alledged) was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by a <hi>Traditor;</hi> yea, was a <hi>Traditor</hi> himself; that is, in time of Persecution, had given their Bibles to the Heathen to be burnt; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was made Bishop; both of them pretended a greater Zeal for the Purity of the Church, than the rest of the Pastors had; the one, that all the Churches had fallen into Apostacy, through their Communion with them who had been <hi>Traditors;</hi> the other, that they who so had fallen, or otherwise, in time of Persecution, were not to be admitted to Church Communion again, nor get Absolution; though he, nor his Followers did not deny, that they might obtain Mercy from God, upon true Repentance, (the contrary of which some impute to them) both of the Sects were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Puritans;</hi> both of them <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:62347:135"/>
from all the Churches of the World; and managed their <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with unreasonable Rigour; especially the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and among them the <hi>Circumcelliones;</hi> who were furiously enraged against all who differed from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Both of these <hi>Schisms</hi> spread far and wide. It is observed by some, that there were of both sorts, Men of strict Lives. Though some of the Ancients tell us of their <hi>Haeresies;</hi> yet others acknowledged their Agreement with others in the Faith: of the <hi>Donatists Cresconius</hi> said, they confessed the same Jesus born, dead, and risen again; they had the same Religion, and the same Sacraments, and there was no Difference about the Practice of Christianity. <hi>Augustine</hi> confesseth that their Difference was not about the Head, but about the Body, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Christ, but about his Church. <hi>Augustin. de Unitat.

                     </gap>maticks in the Primitive Church; whose Pleas when Represented with all possible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, are not so fair and plausible as these of the Presbyterians.</hi> I Answer the <hi>Donatists</hi> and <hi>Novatians</hi> were <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in the ancient Church; and their Pleas for their <hi>Separation</hi> were not so fair as these of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, which I shall shew in these Three things. 1. They had no good, nor sufficient Ground to <hi>separate;</hi> we declare that we will never <hi>separate,</hi> because the Church admitteth scandalous Sinners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Communion, as the <hi>Novations</hi> did: nor because some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and People, are not so innocent as they should be, as the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> did: we condemn their <hi>Schism</hi> as much as he doth. What the <hi>Donatists</hi> alleged was false in matter of Fact, as was made appear. <hi>First,</hi> By some Judges appointed by the Emperour, to try the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> next by a Synod held at <hi>Arles:</hi> And <hi>lastly,</hi> by the Emperour, after a full Hearing of the Matter: and if it had been true; it was no just ground of <hi>Separation;</hi> though it had been a great Grievance. The <hi>Novation</hi> Plea had no weight in it at all, because the Church was not culpable in such Admission, which they did unreasonably bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me. Can he Charge the Presbyterians with any thing that is so unreasonable. What we dislike is, an usurped Power set up in the Chuch; and humane Ceremonies
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:62347:136"/>
imposed on us; and our owning of these formally in Words, or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially in our Practice, is made a condition of our Communion with the Church. It is true, if he can Prove our Scruples to be unreasonable; and that what we dislike is Warrantable; he may blame us, for none Complyance; but what is the Question between him and us; if we Scruple without cause, the blame lieth on us: if not, the Guilt of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> lieth on them who impose such things. Wherefore the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this Point, who is culpable in the <hi>Separation</hi> that is in the Church at Present, dependeth on the Question now under Debate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Episcopacie and Ceremonies. 2. We always were willing to unite with them, if they will remove the Stumbling-blocks that lie in our ways; which themselves confess to be indifferent. I mean the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and if they will not require our owning of Episcopacie, directly nor indirectly. The <hi>Novations</hi> nor <hi>Donatists</hi> never offered such terms of Peace. It is not what they do that skareth us from them, but what they will needs force us to do. 3. We do not Exclude any of them from our Communion; as the <hi>Schismaticks</hi> of old did. Who either of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or of the People have been Excluded from the LORD'S Supper with us, on account of their Opinion in the things that are matter of our Debate. 4. We do not condemn their Church, as no Church; as the <hi>Donatists</hi> did to all beside themselves; we condemn only some things among them that are of inferior moment. 5. It is evident that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are the cause of all the <hi>Schism;</hi> and they are not of the healling temper that the Church was of, which had to do with the <hi>Donatists:</hi> that Church was willing to forbear them, even in their most unreasonable <hi>Separation;</hi> and to indulge such as were of a Religious Conversation; but differed from the Church without cause, in matters of lesser moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Episcopal Church had no Pity on such as differed in indifferent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, acknowledged to be such; but drave them away from their Communion unless they would comply in these, which they could not do without wounding their Conscience. If he can Prove that we deny Communion with the Episcopal Church, on <hi>on frivolous pretences,</hi> as he supposeth, <hi>p.</hi> 222; he gaineth what he contendeth for; but he findeth it easier to suppose this, than to Prove it. It was said by his Antagonist, that the <hi>Donatists forsook their lawful Pastors; which Presbyterians do not: the Bishops being none of our Pastors.</hi> He saith this is the very Crime of the Presbyterians, in their Erecting Altar against Altar. Answer, 1. That is not all that we plead for, as is clear from what hath been said. I
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62347:136"/>
have shewed §. 8. Cases in which, even lawful Pastors may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken; and <hi>ibid.</hi> that this may be done when they require unlawful conditions of Communion with them. But I say, 2. That the Bishops set up in <hi>Scotland</hi> were none of the lawful Pastors of the People over whom they pretended to Rule. And I am willing that Matter be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. 1. By the strength of Argument; if he can Prove the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableness of the Power that they Claim to, we must yield. 2. By the Suffrage of the ancient Church, which was positive, plain and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in this, that the People should chuse their own Bishop, and other Church-Officers; see Instances, <hi>Enquirie into the Constitution,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Primiiive Church;</hi> c. 3. p. 63. <hi>Append. ad Catalog. Test, veritat.</hi> p. 33. The ancient Church did never own a Pastoral relation, in any Man, to a People, on whom he was thrust by the Magistrat, or any Power not Properly Ecclesiastical, and without their own Consent. This is our case, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was in Peaceable Possession of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government, the Magistrat, not the Church, made a Change, and set Men over the People to be their Bishops, whose Office they could not own, and whose Persons they had no concern in: I Question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Primitive Church (I mean the first Ages) would have counted it <hi>Schism</hi> to disown such, and to cleave to their own lawful Pastors, who had been called by them, setled by Church Authority among them, and laboured among them, to their Comfort and Edification. His denying the <hi>Donatists to have taken their Name from Donatus a casis nigris,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to <hi>Petavius, rationar: tempor: lib. 6. p.</hi> 249. I know not what Vouchers he hath for him: his Assertion, <hi>p.</hi> 220. that <hi>Presbyterians have thrown Deacons out of the Church,</hi> is so false, that it is a wonder how he could have the Confidence to Affirm it: If he understand it of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deacons, he should have said so: and proved such an Officer to have been appointed by CHRIST to be in his Church.</p>
               <p>§. 14. His <hi>Fifth</hi> Reason to prove the Presbyterians <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> is from the Doctrine of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> of which he is so confident; that he maketh my asserting that a Bishop in <hi>Cyprians time was no more but a Pastor of a Flock, or a Presbyterian Moderator, not a Diocesan;</hi> to be a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that I have never read <hi>Cyprians</hi> Writings. If I had read much more than either he or I have, I should not so often, nor so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliously, vilisie others. If I have read little he will find it the easier to refute what I have Written. Another Learned Author of his Partie hath taken to task these few Lines in my <hi>Def. of Vindic.</hi> which he now
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62347:137"/>
undertaketh to refute: Which Book I have Answered (with such read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I could attain, both of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and other ancient Writers) in a Book Intituled the <hi>Cyprianick-Bishop Examined;</hi> where I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Answer all that he hath here Written, before I saw it. I am not willing to Transcribe it, being the most part of that Book. He may read it, if he thinketh fit; and if he, or any other, will refute what is there said of Episcopacie in <hi>Cyprians</hi> Age, I shall be willing to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him. His Triumphant Conclusion, <hi>p.</hi> 225. evanisheth into smoak, if what hath been said, be duly Considered. He begineth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Debate, about <hi>Preaching Moralitie;</hi> which he passeth in a Word, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooking all that had been said in Refutation of his former Book on that Head: While it was told him that not all the Clergy, but he, and such as he, was so blamed. Also, that <hi>Preaching Moralitie</hi> was never Censured, but Applauded, and lookt on as necessarie; but what we Quarelled was, that some do only <hi>Preach Moralitie,</hi> and neglect holding forth to the People the aids of the Spirit, by which they should obey the Law acceptably, and the Righteousness of CHRIST, on account of which they, and their Works that are moraly Good, should be accepted; and a great deal more to this purpose was Discoursed, to shew his Mistakes in that Matter: to all which he maketh no Return, but that his Antagonist <hi>had seen no Sermons of his in Print, nor heard him: and therefore could not tell what sort of Doctrine he preached.</hi> I think there was sufficient ground for thinking that he useth to Preach in that strain, seing he so doth Defend and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud it; but much more occasion was given for so thinking, from a large Discourse in his Book; that I was then Refuting, Vindicating their way of Preaching, in which their is nothing of that which is the Marrow of Gospel Preaching, <hi>viz.</hi> the imputed Righteousness of CHRIST, and the influence of his Spirit, by which we must do that which pleaseth GOD. His so often Rehearsing (as he hath done the Third time) an Error of the Press, which maketh a Passage that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable to be <hi>Nonsense</hi> and <hi>Blasphemie,</hi> after it had been Solemnly disowned by the Author; this, I say, sheweth the Mans temper: I am sure this silly shift will Reflect more on himself, in the Eyes of them who are not Malicious, than it will on the Person whom he would De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Government of the first Christian Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANother Debate my Antagonist Engageth in, wherein what we hold must be reckoned among <hi>the New Opinions</hi> of Presbyterians is, what way the Christian Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was at first Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; whether by Bishops, or the Pastors of the Church, acting in Parity? We cannot give a distinct and paricular Account of their way, in this Matter, because of the Silence, and Defectiveness of the History of these times; and therefore, it is a Mis-representation when he saith, that <hi>we hold that they were Presbyterians;</hi> if he understand Presbyterian Government in the the usual Sense, as made up of Kirk-Sessions, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, Synods, and General-Assemblies; we suppose they had a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in that Church; and that it was Managed by Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and directed by the Word of GOD, as they then understood it; for this we can bring no other Proof; but that they were Christians, and we owe them that Charity, having no cause to think otherwise of them: and I think this will not be Contested between him and me. All the Question that remaineth is, whether the Teachers of the Church had equal Power, and Ruled in Parity, or had Bishops set over them, who had the Power of Ruling the Church; the rest having only Power to Teach. We are for their Equality of Power; my Antagonist for Episcopal Jurisdiction to have been, even then, in the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I do agree with him that this is <hi>questio facti,</hi> and must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Testimonie; and that of Credible Witnesses, who might know the Truth of what they Assert. I have brought Credible History for what we say; all which he Rejecteth as <hi>fabulous;</hi> some of his Party (particularly <hi>Spotswood)</hi> bring Instances of Bishops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at that time, without any to Attest the Truth of what he Writeth. Which of us, then, go on the best grounds? Our Author had in the <hi>Apology</hi> (which I take to be his) pretended to Refute what I had Written on this Head; <hi>First Vindic. Question. 1. p.</hi> 4. 5. all that he saith in the <hi>Apology,</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; <hi>Deff. of Vindic. p.</hi> 36. 37. he doth in the Book now before me, endeavour to Answer part of what was said (as he had also done in the <hi>Apology)</hi> overlooking what he thought not fit to touch. I shall now Consider what he here saith; omitting nothing that is Material: He
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62347:138"/>
hath not yet cleared his Assertion that <hi>Blondel took that History of the Culdees ruling the Church, from Buchanan and his temporarie Monks, Boetius and others, or such as were little removed from his own Age.</hi> For <hi>Blondel</hi> doth not mention one Monk contemporarie with <hi>Buchanan;</hi> nor any Monk save <hi>Fordon,</hi> who was far removed from his Age; wherefore the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Word <hi>Contemporarie</hi> is not Obviated, nor Answered, by any thing said in this, or his former Book. It was Objected that <hi>his Reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writers whose Testimonies were brought, as incompetent Witnesses, was to Raze the Foundation of the History of our Nation,</hi> which he Answereth, by shewing that <hi>it is the Establishing, not Razing of History, to require Competent Witnesses for what we Believe:</hi> This is to divert into another Question; what was blamed in him was not, that Witnesses whose Testimony we receive, must be Competent; but whether these adduced by me, in the Debate, were such. I only Mark here; not Examine (being aside from our present Debate) what he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 230. that <hi>if History be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and the Moral Certainty that is conveighed by Testimony</hi> (he must mean Humane Testimony) <hi>then the Authority of Revelation falleth, and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism is Introduced; at least boundless Sceptecilm, and uncertainty.</hi> Whether this tendeth not to make Scripture, and all our Religion to Depend on the Churches Testimony, let it be Considered. If the <hi>Vindicator</hi> said, that <hi>we may believe a Matter of Fact without sufficient Evidence,</hi> let him be load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as many Epithets as he can Invent; he Pleaded that <hi>Buchanan, Boetius, Major, Fordon, Usher, the Centuriators, Baronius, Beda, and Prosper,</hi> had given Account of the Affairs of the <hi>Scots</hi> Church, and if none of these be Competent Witnesses, our Historie is lost; and cannot be made up by the <hi>Collateral Testimony of some of the Roman Historians,</hi> who spake of our Affairs <hi>obiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. Our Author is at a great deal of Pains, from <hi>p.</hi> 231. to Prove, that <hi>no History is to be Believed unless it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttested by sufficient Witnesses, who had occasion to know what they Affirm;</hi> I would gladly know who Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth him in this; he fully Proveth what was never Denyed by any Body, so far as I know; nor can it be Denyed by any Man in his Wits; I mean, without this History cannot be Believed upon the Faith of these Witnesses, which are thus incompetent; for by other Topicks a Matter of Fact, done 1000 years ago may be sufficiently Proved; as the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Heideggerus</hi> Proveth both many Antediluvian, and Postdiluvian, Passages, by Consequences drawn from Scripture, in his Excellent Book, <hi>Historia Patriarcharum;</hi> Wherefore I look on <hi>Du Lamy's</hi> Work, <hi>de Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62347:138"/>
Argumenti negantis in Quaestionibus facti,</hi> to be of good use, and that the Popish legends are by that Argument solidly refused. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess also, that there is much strength in <hi>Eusebius his neglecting of some Books as Spuroius, because not sufficiently Attested.</hi> Only I shall take Notice of a few things in his Managing of this his Discourse, though I fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Conclusion of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that History must be sufficiently Attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and then I shall State this Question about the Credebility of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, a little more clearly than he hath done. And, 1. I observe, that <hi>p.</hi> 233. he denyeth that <hi>quaestio facti can be otherwise Determined.</hi> The contrarie of which I have already shewed, <hi>viz.</hi> that it may be Determined in some cases, by Consequences drawn from uncontested Matters of Fact. Next he saith, <hi>ibid.</hi> that <hi>the Presbyterians hold the Affirmative in the present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, about our ancient Church-Government;</hi> this is Questionable, if it be not downright a Mistake: it is confessed on both hands that the <hi>Culdees</hi> taught the Church at that time; the Question is either, whether they were Bishops, or not; we hold the Negative; or if he Word it thus, whether they were any more than Presbyters, we say, no: or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were Bishops set over these Teaching <hi>Culdees,</hi> or not; we are still for the Negative; wherefore we might put him to Prove his Affirmative. I further Object, that, in the end of the same <hi>page,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth, that they against whom he Debateth do <hi>believe all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Examining the Testimonies on which their Credibilitie is founded.</hi> We do not so with any thing of Moment; far less with all things. Yea, we do not so in the Case now under Debate. Another Remark I make on what he hath, <hi>page 231. and 235. If a Matter of Fact be not Attested by any Credible Author living within 200 years of the Period in which such a Thing is said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o have happened, it is to be lookt on as a Fable:</hi> and he addeth that <hi>Du Launy supposed that Orall Tradition could not carry any Matter of Fact further;</hi> and to Ridicule any who might think otherwise, he hath devised a Ridiculous Storie of the <hi>King of China.</hi> This may suffer a little Correction; and must not be taken as a Principle, neither on his Authority, nor <hi>Du Launy's;</hi> more than a Storie of 200 years old can be. 1. It is hard to fix a Period, how far Orall Tradition can hand down a Storie to Posteritie; especially, if it be not about the <hi>Credenda</hi> of Religion: If I can believe a Storie of 200 years old, from a grave and wise Author, whose veracity I do not Question; I know not why the Addition of 50, or a 100 years more, should make it incredible, if it come from the same hand. Wherefore this is too peremptorie a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62347:139"/>
Decision: there are on the other hand, many cases in which, Oral Tradition may be very doubtful in far less time than 200 years. 2. If this Doctrine be received, what shall we think of the Histories of <hi>Eusebius, Socrates,</hi> and others, which our Author, as well as others, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often and Considently? It is true, they give us Vouchers out of ancient Writings; but many of these may be Proved to be Fabulous, by this same Argument: and this they do not always. 3. He forgetteth and contradicteth himself, in the very next <hi>page;</hi> while he sheweth, out of <hi>Sir George Mackenzie;</hi> that the <hi>Bards repeated the Scotish Genealogies at their Marriages, Births, and other Solemnities,</hi> and calleth this <hi>an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Conveyance of true, constant, and perpetual Tradition:</hi> here is but Oral Tradition; and it went beyond the Limits of 200 years; otherways, it could not be a sufficient Evidence for all the Kings that were before <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second; which is the Design for which <hi>Sir George</hi> bringeth it. 4. Good Historians, who make it their Business to Search into the Affairs of former Ages, may attain to some probable knowledge of what passed for more than 200 years, by Comparing one thing with another; which others who have not made that their Study cannot easily reach; yea, they do not always set down all the Grounds of what they Write, for that would oblige them, sometimes to write a Controversie, instead of a Historie. I say not this to Oblige any Body to take all on Trust that Historians, even of the best Note, do Write; but to shew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantableness of Determining so dogmatically about the Credibility of History; Neither do I think Defending our Opinion about the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church-Government in <hi>Scotland</hi> needeth the help of this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Before he had peremptorly Condemned the Historical Evidence that we bring; he should have Answered what <hi>Sir George Mackenzie</hi> (an Author that he seemeth to value) hath Written against the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> p. 311. that <hi>History requires, nor admits, no Mathematical, nor legal Proof. But is satisfied with Moral certainty inferred from probable Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, old Manuscripts, credible Histories, the Testimonie of forreign Authors; and probable Reasons.</hi> 2. That our <hi>Histories being already acquiesced in, and received by the Generality of Mankind, and especially by Criticks, Antiquaries, and Historians, the best Judges in such cases, need no Confirmation, nor fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof.</hi> And he sheweth, <hi>p.</hi> 6. that <hi>Livies History hath no surer Grounds than Tradition, he Writing long after the time he speaketh of.</hi> All this he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proveth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:62347:139"/>
§ 3. He doth, <hi>p.</hi> 236. unjustly suppose, that I had asserted, that <hi>the History of our Nation must perish, if there was no Presbyterian Church in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, so near the Apostolick Age.</hi> I said not so, nor had Words to that Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. What I did, and do affirm is, that <hi>if none who have written the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of this Nation, are to be believed, our History is lost;</hi> for the Collateral Proofs from the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians; that he talketh of, could give us but a very lame Account of our Affairs. He maketh, <hi>p. 237. these Recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Bards to be twisted with the Practice and Custom of the Nation; and that by a constant, and uninterrupted Practice; and that from the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies that were planted here:</hi> now let me ask him; what Authority he hath for this; is not here an Oral Tradition (for these <hi>Recitations</hi> are not extant, but are perished time out of Mind) for much more than two hundred years, and thrice as many more. Nor doth Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> give better Evidence for the Antiquity of our Kings, than we give for what we assert. He telleth us against <hi>Saint Asaph, p.</hi> 129. that <hi>the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Nation might well be preserved for six hundred years, which is far beyond our Authors Period.</hi> That I Reasoned against Christmass from the Silence of the first Ages, is no way inconsistent with what I have, on this Occasion, written; for if our Author can prove it from any other Topick, we shall not reject it. We shall tell him, whence the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had what we receive, and assert from them; when we come to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with him, the Truth of things we hold; we are now upon the general Argument, of the <hi>Credibility of a History.</hi> We are not obliged to give him Instances of other Presbyterian Churches before <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> others have done it. What he saith of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, Section 1. §. 1. I promised, above, to state this Question, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Credibility of History,</hi> more clearly than he hath done; for which there is much need; for he neither distinguisheth Matters related, nor Persons relating, nor the Weight that is to be laid on what is related in History. 1. Then Matters that are of no great Moment, whither they be true or false, we may receive with a Historical Faith, on more slender Grounds than what is of great Moment, or, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Believing which is of great Advantage, or in Convenience. Matters that we build an Article of Faith on, or that our Christian Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, yea, or that any great Worldly Interest dependeth on the Truth or Falshood of what is told us, have need to have Credentials proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to the Stress that is to be laid on them. And therefore I yield so far to this Author, that he shall not be obliged to believe what we assert
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62347:140"/>
in this Matter, unless we bring such Evidences as the Matter requireth, and is capable of. 2. The Credibility of a Historian, must bear some Proportion to the Degree of Assent, that we are to give to the thing narrated. If our Author will have us to look on any History, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and irrefragable Ground of our Belief; he must give us more than the Testimony of Men; or the best Historians who are not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely Inspired. As I have shewed Section 3. §. 31, 35. on the other hand, we talk not so high of the Historical Evidence that we bring, and therefore, a Probability of a lower Degree, than what he talketh of, may serve. 3. Tho the Credit of a Historian be not, by it self, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to perswade us of the Truth of what he saith, yet if it be supported by the Probability of the Thing, by Circumstances that favour it, or the Testimonies of others; or by any good Topick, from which the Truth, or the Probability of the Thing may be inferred, the History is not easily to be rejected. 4. The Persons who write the History are to be distinguished, some of them have given Evidence of their Ignorance, Negligence, Foolish Credulity, and Listening to Fables; others have manifested great Learning, Industry, Care to Examine what they nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; or are Attested by others to be Men of Probity, Learning, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Exactness: certainly more Weight is to be laid on the one, tho living at some Distance from the Period he writeth of, than on the other, tho nearer to it. 5. They who live at great Distance from any Period of Time, may give great Light concerning what was done in it, if they do not barely Assert what they Fancy, nor Measure the Things of that Period according to the Opinions, Customs, the Dialect of their own Time; as many of the Historians that our Author layeth much Weight on, have done; but consider Things as then they were Stated, and bring probable Grounds, either from the Histories written by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Persons in, or near that Time, or from any other <hi>Medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. I now proceed to the Vindication of our Argument from Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the first Christians in <hi>Scotland</hi> being Governed without Bishops. He mistakes when he saith, that I bring <hi>Blondel</hi> as a Historical Witness of this: I mentioned him only, as Citing these Authors which assert it. Which are, <hi>Joan. Major. de gest. Scotor. lib. 2. c. 2. Per Sacerdotes &amp; Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos, sine Episcopis, Scoti in fide sunt eruditi;</hi> and before him, <hi>Fordon Scoto-Chronicon, lib. 3. c. 8. Ante Palladii adventum, habebant Scoti fidei Doctores, &amp; Sacramentorum Ministratores, Presbyteros solummodo, vel Monachos Ritum sequentes Ecclesiae Primitivae.</hi> It is true, <hi>Blondel</hi> citeth also <hi>Boet,</hi> who was
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62347:140"/>
later than either of them: But what he citeth out of him, seemeth not to be so much to his Purpose; wherefore I wave that Testimony. Our Authors Answer to the other two Testimonies is, they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Witnesses, living at so great a Distance from the Time they speak of. To which I Reply, <hi>First,</hi> they cannot be esteemed Partial Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, being both of them Papists, and not Presbyterians: and it may be rationally thought, that if they had no sufficient Ground for what they said, they would rather have either said what made for the Way they owned, or at least suppressed what they had no good Warrant to assert, against their own Way. To this he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 245. that <hi>the Monks ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced this Fable to gratifie the Popes Design of Exempting the Religious Orders from Episcopal Jurisdiction. Reply,</hi> This doth not meet with our Case; for <hi>Major</hi> was no Monk; and so not concerned to tell a Lie to please the <hi>Pope</hi> in that Design. And for <hi>Fordon;</hi> whatever Temptation he might have, to endeavour the Lessening of the Extent of the Episcopal Power; he would not design to root out Episcopacy wholly out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (which this Testimony tendeth to, for the Period he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of) contrary to the universal Sentiments of that Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was a Member. Wherefore that Consideration doth no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogat from the Credibility of his Testimony. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have no Ground to think that these Historians spake by Guess, or that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this Story; for the contrary of it cannot be proved: and the thing it self is not impossible; yea, Sir <hi>George Mackenzy,</hi> in his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement before his Book against <hi>Saint Asaph,</hi> maketh it appear, that <hi>in our Countrey there were very Ancient Manuscripts, and that the Priests learned our ancient History from the Druids;</hi> and he maketh it clear, <hi>p. 2. &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>our Histories</hi> (of which that of <hi>Fordon</hi> and <hi>Major</hi> are a part) <hi>being received by the Generality of Mankind, especially by Criticks, Antiquaries, and Historians, ought not now to be called in Question.</hi> And I must still think, for all that he hath said in Opposition to it, that the History of our Nation falleth, if these Authors are not to be believed; seing without them, he shall never be able to make up a <hi>Scots</hi> History out of <hi>Roman</hi> Authors. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The same Author <hi>p.</hi> 5. sheweth that <hi>Men satisfie themselves in most things, with the general Belief and Tradition of a People; that Manuscripts infer no Mathematical Certainty; but the Authors of them might mistake; that the Histories of all Nations are no better founded.</hi> All which sheweth how unreasonable it is to Question the Authority of these Histories; especially when none do so, but one who is straitned
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62347:141"/>
with an Argument brought from their Testimony, against a Cause that he is fond of. It is also much to our Purpose, that the Learned <hi>Usher, de primord Eccles. Brit.</hi> 808. citeth the same Passages, with Approbation; he citeth also <hi>Balaeus de scriptor. Britan.</hi> affirming that <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent, <hi>ut Sacerdotalem Ordinem Romano Ritu institueret,</hi> which we may rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think: was to set up Bishops. Also the Learned Doctor <hi>Forbes, Iren. p.</hi> 157. citeth the same Passage of <hi>Major,</hi> and addeth of his own, <hi>adeo ut Ecclesia Scoticana plus quam 230 annos erat absque Regimine Episcopali;</hi> and <hi>Forbes</hi> was Zealous for Episcopacy.</p>
               <p>§ 5. The Testimony of these Historians is supported by other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who shew <hi>Palladius</hi> was the first Bishop that Ruled in the <hi>Scots</hi> Christian Church; and that Church had Subsisted, and had Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and others of Christs Ordinances in it, above two hundred years, before <hi>Palladius</hi> came among them. This is Attested by <hi>Baronius</hi> and his Epitomator <hi>Spondanus, ad ann.</hi> 431. and by them taken out of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,</hi> see <hi>Spondan. p.</hi> 592. this is more fully cleared, <hi>first Vind. p.</hi> 4. His Answer to this I now consider. He saith, <hi>p.</hi> 244. that <hi>the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie cometh to this, whether Prosper saith, that two hundred years before Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius was sent to the Scots, there was a Presbyterian Church in Scotland,</hi> this is a ridiculous State of the Question, and made by none but himself: we affirm that <hi>Prosper</hi> said, <hi>that Palladius was the first Bishop sent to the Scots:</hi> and we, <hi>aliunde,</hi> prove that there was a Christian Church in <hi>Scotland,</hi> two hundred years before that time. Whence the Consequence is clear, that during that Space, the <hi>Scots</hi> Christians had no Bishops. I must ly under his Charge of <hi>Supine Negligence,</hi> in not Reading the Authors I cite. I only may be bold to require him to make that appear. That he thus attempteth. <hi>Baronius</hi> saith in the same Place of <hi>Palladius, Quem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductum etiam ad Hiberniam Insulam, sed cito mortuum, Probus in rebus gestis Sancti Patricii scripsit, dictum est superius. Hibernorum quidem Conversionem Deus Sancto Patricio reservavit.</hi> I hope the Judicious Reader will neither think it a Token of <hi>Supine Negligence,</hi> nor of my not Reading the Books I cite; that I did not Transcribe this. For it was no ways to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in hand; it might as well be so Constructed, that I did not write over all that followeth in <hi>Baronius,</hi> about <hi>Saint Patricks</hi> Descent, about his Ordination, his Instruction in Divinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Weight of his Objection lyeth in this, that <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Spondanus</hi> understood <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper</hi> so, as that <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent to <hi>Ireland;</hi> and not to that part of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> that we call <hi>Scotland.</hi> Here the <hi>Enquirer</hi> giveth me Occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:62347:141"/>
the Civility of a good Advice to him; that he would consider what he Readeth, and what he Citeth out of Authors: for it is against all Sense and Reason, to make <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Spondanus,</hi> either mean this in this Passage, (or so to understand <hi>Prosper)</hi> of a Mission to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not to <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is to make a flat Contradiction between their Meaning and their Words: Whereas they say, <hi>Sanctus Prosper missum ait Palladium ordinatum Episcopum ad Scotos; quem perductum etiam ad Hiberni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp;c.</hi> The Meaning then must be to our Author, tho he was <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> and <hi>Ordinatus ad Scotos;</hi> he was not sent to the <hi>Scots,</hi> but to <hi>Ireland.</hi> Do not the Words bear it in their very Face, that he was sent to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and was their first Bishop: and after he had been there for some time, he was brought over to <hi>Ireland;</hi> it is not said <hi>Missus,</hi> nor <hi>Ordinatus;</hi> but <hi>Perductus:</hi> his Mission was to <hi>Scotland;</hi> what Casuality or Design led him to <hi>Ireland,</hi> is not told us; neither is it <hi>Prosper,</hi> but <hi>Probus</hi> that mentioneth his going to <hi>Ireland:</hi> and that he never was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I have shewed in the Place Cited.</p>
               <p>§ 6. He further endeavoureth to overturn our Argument from <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,</hi> as he is Cited by <hi>Baronius;</hi> where he attempteth two things, 1. To shew that <hi>Palladius in Prospers Sense, was not the first Bishop, that was in Scotland; but the first Bishop that was sent to them by the Pope.</hi> This he buildeth on <hi>Prospers</hi> Words, both as they are Cited by <hi>Baronius,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are in the <hi>Augustane</hi> Copy; the first are, <hi>Basso &amp; Antiocho consulibus, ad Scotos in Christum credentes, ordinatus a Caelestino Papa Palladius, primus Episcopus mittitur.</hi> And the other Copy is, <hi>Basso &amp; Antiocho consulibus, ad Scotos in Christum credentes, ordinatus a Caelestino Papa Palladius, primus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus missus est.</hi> I see not what moved him to transcribe the Words twice; unless he see a Mystery that others cannot observe, in the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is between <hi>mittitur,</hi> and <hi>missus est;</hi> but he will have <hi>mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> or <hi>missus est, primus Episcopus</hi> to signifie that he was not the first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; but the first Bishop of the <hi>Roman Mission;</hi> if he be allowed to put what Sense on Mens Words he pleaseth, it must be so: <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Spondanus</hi> did not so understand the Words; neither can any Man so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them, unless his Preconceived Opinion do Darken his Mind, that he cannot see things as they are. If <hi>Prosper</hi> had thought that there were Bishops in <hi>Scotland</hi> before, he should have spoken more plainly, and told us, that the <hi>Pope</hi> sent him to Rule over the <hi>Scots</hi> Bishops, or, that whereas <hi>Scotland</hi> was formerly Governed by their own Bishops; the <hi>Pope</hi> would have them thenceforth Governed by such as he set over
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:62347:142"/>
them. He telleth us of several Bishops sent to other Churches; not to introduce Episcopacy; but to bring them in Subjection to the <hi>Pope.</hi> This I deny not, (tho he instanceth only in <hi>Austine the Monk,</hi> who was sent to <hi>England)</hi> but this furnisheth an Argument against himself; for none of them is called <hi>primus Episcopus</hi> of such a Nation, except he who was sent to <hi>Scotland. Augustine</hi> is neither called <hi>primus Monachus,</hi> nor <hi>primus Episcopus,</hi> though, as <hi>Beda, hist. lib. 1. c.</hi> 23. hath it, he was <hi>ordinandus Episcopus, si a Gente Anglorum susciperetur.</hi> He saith <hi>it is not evident from Prospers Chronicon, whether there was any Formed, Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Church in Scotland, when Palladius was sent by Caelestine.</hi> This is wholly beside the Purpose: for <hi>Prospers</hi> Testimony is not brought for that End. Is it not enough that it is clearly proved out of Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: that the <hi>Scots</hi> were Christians <hi>anno</hi> 199, and <hi>Palladius</hi> came to them about 431. Now can he imagine, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Christians all that time, were not an Organized Church; if he think that therefore they were Unorganized, because they wanted Bishops, this is to beg the Question.</p>
               <p>§ 7. His other Answer is not a Refutation of me, but of <hi>Baronius,</hi> who took the <hi>Chronicon consulare</hi> for <hi>Prospers</hi> Work; whereas our Author saith it is none of his; and for this he produceth the Authority of <hi>Pithaeus:</hi> which is not sufficient against that of <hi>Baronius.</hi> And even <hi>Pithaeus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesseth that <hi>Chronicon per consules digestum, hactenus in omnibus Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomiani Chronici editionibus Prosperi nomine subjungitur.</hi> All the Ground he hath for denying it to be <hi>Prospers</hi> is, that the Stile differeth from what he calleth the true <hi>Chronicon,</hi> whereof a Fragment only remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. He telleth us also, that Doctor <hi>Cave</hi> saith, that the <hi>Chronicon consulare</hi> is much Interpolated: but that doth not prove the Book spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; neither doth it derogate from the Testimony we bring out of it; unless he can say that it is one of the Interpolations, may be, Foisted in by some Presbyterian; which if he say, it will make the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans older than our Author will allow. He quarrelleth, that I had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, that <hi>the Christian Faith was received in Scotland in the beginning of the second Century;</hi> and calleth it <hi>a Dream; because we have no certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of any Progress of Christianity made in the Island at that time.</hi> He should not have been so confident in this Matter, without Answering what was brought for that Assertion, or <hi>Dream,</hi> whatever he will call it. He should have disproved that <hi>Donald</hi> was our first Christian King: that he began to Reign <hi>anno</hi> 199, that <hi>Palladius</hi> came to <hi>Scotland</hi> 431,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:62347:142"/>
in all which Space the <hi>Scots</hi> lived without Bishops. If I have brought our Christianity any nearer to the beginning of the Christian AEra; I shall confess an Error in Calculation, which I deny not that I may readily fall into. What he saith of Squeezing of his Words: I cannot Answer, for he neither tells where, nor wherein; for my Book <hi>lying open to his Remarks;</hi> the Reader must judge whether it be so, or not, and what Advantage he hath got against it; the Error of my Title Page, putting <hi>of</hi> in stead of <hi>for the Clergy,</hi> is not such as he would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; if they do not owne it, he should crave Pardon for making it; if they do, I have not Miscalled it; tho I confess changing his own Word was an Oversight; but I hope it is not a Beam; but a Mote that he hath discovered, by his Critical Skill.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Ceremonies, and the rest of the Enquirers Quarrels with the Presbyterians, which have not yet been touched.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe last Effort made by this Author against the Presbyterians in his <hi>fifth Chapter,</hi> is made up of his Essay against our Opinion about <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and other Miscellany Purposes, which hardly can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to one Head: which I shall consider as his Discourse shall bring them in. Before I Examine his Dissertation, I observe two things in general concerning it. The first is, the course Treatment he giveth the Presbyterians, without Exception, as if he had them under his Feet, in this Conflict, before he enter on the Debate. He calleth our Opinion (or rather his own mistaken Apprehension of it; for it is none of ours, as will by and by appear) <hi>a silly Theorem, on which</hi> he saith, <hi>we have broken the Unity of the Church, and filled the Heads and Mouths of People with a thousand Airy and Unaccountable Fancies:</hi> he calls what we say on this Head, <hi>Raveries, and a Labyrinth of Idle Talk, Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> My other Observation is, his odd Representation of our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he maketh to be altogether <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>our own:</hi> and indeed as he representeth it, it is wholly <hi>new,</hi> and none of ours, but <hi>his own:</hi> it is, that <hi>a Significant Rite in the Worship of God, not founded upon Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, is Superstitious, Unlawful, and Abominable, and such as may Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate a Separation from any Church, where it is enjoyned to preserve Order and Uniformity.</hi> Against this I have two Objections, 1. That we did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:62347:143"/>
condemn all Significant Rites in Religion, even tho they be not founded on Divine Institution. Uncovering the Head is a Significant Rite, and we know no Divine Institution for it; and yet we use it in the Worship of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer, and several other Exercises; and will separate from no Church because of it. That a Minister Preach in a Decent Garb, and not in a Fools Coat, is a Significant Rite used in Religion, not founded on Divine Institution, yet we shall not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for enjoyning that. This loose and indistinct Way of Refuting an Adversary, cannot Instruct, nor Convince any Body. I shall not Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate his Harsh Words, by giving this Way the Epithet it deserveth. They who write on this Subject with Judgment and Understanding, use to distinguish three sorts of Modes of Mens Actions; that are found in Religion, <hi>viz. Circumstances, Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances are Modifications of Actions, as Time, Place, Person; or, a Circumstance is any thing that accompanyeth an Action which is not of its Essence, but is used with it, relateth to it, and is an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or Adjunct of it: and it may be such, either with respect to the Physical or Moral Beeing of the Action: Circumstances use to be sorted in these Memorial Verses,
<q>
                     <l>Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>And</hi> forma, figura, locus, tempus, stirps, patria, nomen.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Circumstance is a Word of larger Extent than Rite, and that than Ceremony; a Rite is the Manner of going about any Action (chiefly that which is Publick or Solemn) confirmed by Law or Custom. In a more large Sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is taken for any Action or Thing that belongeth to the Mode or Solemnity of another Action, rather than to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it: such Rites are used in Judicatures, Marriages, Burials, Inaugurations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> some of them are Civil, some Military, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and some also are Sacred; when they are appropriated to Religion. A Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is a Sacred Rite: the best Authors that I have seen, whether Heathen or Christian, Popish or Protestant, agree in this, that a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is peculiar to Religion: however the Word be sometimes, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Speech, more largely taken. This applyed to our Purpose sheweth, that our Author doth widely mistake, when he representeth us as against Significant Humane Rites in Religion: we oppose only these of them which are appropriated to Religion, and so are Religious Rites, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. He cannot but know that there are many Actions used in Religion, which are not Religious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:62347:143"/>
§ 2. The <hi>second</hi> Thing that I Observe in his Representation of the Opinion of his Adverstaries, is, that they found separation on Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies imposed to preserve Order and Unity. It is no so. Let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise what Ceremonies they will (which are not down-right Idolatry) and impose them on the most plausible pretences they can think on: yea, let them use them as much as they will; we do not think all this a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ground of Separation from a true Church whereof we are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: but if they impose on us Religious Rites, or Sacred significant Ceremonies; so as we cannot be suffered to Worship God with the Church, unless we either approve them, or use them, this we think a just Cause of Separation: seing such Complyance were our Personal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and sinful in the sight of God. And yet the Separation of them who thus scruple, is rather a passive Separation, than active: they are driven away, rather than run away. Let us now hear what he hath to say in Defence of the Ceremonies, the Question about which he hath so Stated. He <hi>will not gather together all our Raveries, but in a few Words, Vindicate the Practice of all Churches, &amp;c.</hi> Those are but Words. He had done wisely if he had excepted the Apostolick Churches. And tho I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, but that some Ceremonies did early and unobservably creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Primitive Church, and that through the Zeal of some Good Men, who saw not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mportance, nor bad Consequences of such Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it may be made appear that some of the Ceremonies that they now observe had no such early Original; and that some of these which were observed in the <hi>first</hi> Ages are laid aside by them. Of the first Sort, I instance <hi>Kneeling</hi> in the Act of receiving the LORD'S Supper, the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism, and some of the <hi>Holy Days,</hi> of which before. Of the other Sort, I instance the <hi>Trin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Immersio</hi> in Baptism, the <hi>Aagapae, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising on Whitsunday,</hi> or <hi>Dominica in albis,</hi> rather than on any other Day; the <hi>Osculum pacis,</hi> all the Steps of the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and <hi>Paenitentes,</hi> before they could be received into Communion with the Church; and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which one may find in <hi>Albaspin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Observ. Ecclesiast.</hi> which is Compendized by <hi>Keitembellius:</hi> there are also not a few modern Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who are not for the Cermonies as they are Pleaded for by Him and his Party. If what I have said be Considered, his <hi>first</hi> Argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by way of Question admitteth of an easie Answer. The Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church Worshiped GOD without Religious Ceremonies not Institut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by CHRIST; and I hope he will own these as Societies of Men, who are to be more Considered than others. A sett of Arguments he next
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:62347:144"/>
bringeth. 1. <hi>The Light of Nature teacheth us to Worship GOD, and all Men have Agreed in this, that Solemn W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rship of the DEITIE ought to be performed in Unity and Society.</hi> A. If he make the Consequence (which he hath Suppressed) to be, <hi>Ergo,</hi> we must have humane Religious significant Ceremonies; we deny this Consequence, as not having a shadow of Reason. Again, if this Argument have any weight, humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies must be necessarie: And GOD cannot be Worshiped without them: and all the Presbyterians are not only Defective in their Worship; but there is a Nullitie in it through want of such Ceremonies: which looketh more like <hi>Raverie</hi> than any thing he can Charge us with. 2. Saith he, <hi>This publick Worship should be fixed and Established by the Wisdom and Authority of Competent Judges, as to the Manner and Method. Ans.</hi> 1. Are the Manner and Method of Worship Religious significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? The Method is a Circumstance; neither Rite nor Ceremonie: for the Manner, it is either some-what that is common to Religion, and other Publick and Solemn Actions; and it consisteth in some civil Rites, therefore used in Worship because they have by Custom, Obtained in other publick Solemnities: this manner of Worship is not to be Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Wisdom and Authority of any particular Judges; but the Tacite Consent of the Nation bringeth it in by using it in all such Actions: So in the Apostles time, for a Man to <hi>Prophesie with his Head uncovered,</hi> and to <hi>wear long Hair;</hi> was a Manner of Worship not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by any Council, but brought in by civil Custom, and so made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that it was a fault to do otherways: so it were a fault among us, for a Minister to Preach in an Antick and ridiculous Garb, which Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom hath made such. Or the manner of Worship is something that is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Religious Worship; and in that case it is Religion, or Worship it self; being Designed, that by it GOD may be Honoured: tho it be a Mode of that Species of Worship: <hi>(V. Gr.</hi> the Cross is a Mode of Baptism) yet it is a piece of Worship it self; being devised for a Sacred signification, and being peculiar to Religion: this sort of <hi>Manner of Worship</hi> must be fixed and Established by the Authority of CHRIST, neither do I know any lower Authority of any Judge that is <hi>Competent</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>§ 3. His <hi>Third</hi> Argument, or Axiom, is, that <hi>we ought to express our Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ration in the publick Worship of GOD, by such significant Signs of Piety, and Devotion, as are known in that Nation where we live, to express our Reverence, and Esteem.</hi> The former Distinction will easily shew how little this will make for him. If he speak of natural or civil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ites, that is, Actions, or
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:62347:144"/>
Gestures, or Things, that Nature or civil Custom hath made so Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; we yield all that he saith, but if he mean Religious Rites, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; that is, such Things, Actions, or Gestures as have no place, nor are not lookt on as so Expressive, in any other Solemnity but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; I deny his Assertion: for what ever Custom hath crept into a Church or Nation, which is peculiar to Religion; and tho it be never so well known in the Nation that the Church hath introduced it into Worship meerly by her own Authority; So as it is neither made decent by Nature, nor by Custom, in other Solemnities or Actions; nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by Divine Authority, it ought not to be in the Church of CHRIST. Hence we can allow <hi>Sighing, lifting up the Hands,</hi> or <hi>Eyes</hi> in Worship; Nature hath made them Expressive: also <hi>a grave and decent Garb;</hi> because civil Custom hath made that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it. Also using <hi>Water in the Baptism,</hi> and <hi>Bread and Wine in the LORD'S Supper;</hi> because Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution hath made them Significant and Useful: but the <hi>Cross</hi> in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, the <hi>Surplice,</hi> &amp;c. we cannot allow, because their Signification and Use in Religon ariseth from none of these; but only from Mans will. His <hi>Fourth</hi> Assertion is, <hi>these significant Signs being indifferent in their Nature are variable according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ge or Country with whom we have to do; and may be Changed by the Authority and Wisdom of our Superiors, as o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t as there is sufficient Reason; of which they only are the Judges.</hi> Other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialists use to Plead for the Churches Ceremonie-making Power with a little more Caution and Limitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so as they are careful to Shut the Door against the Popish Ceremonies: Some because of their ineptitude, the Bulk of them, because of their Number, being a Burden: but this Author is troubled with no such Scruples, or Fetters, he setteth the Door as wide open as the <hi>Pope,</hi> or any Church-Rulers (yea, or Rulers of the State) please to have it: no other thing but their <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> can keep out a Deluge of Ceremonial Fopperies. That the Ceremonies we Contend about (I mean Religious Ceremonies) are indifferent in their own Nature, he supposeth: but this is not to Instruct, but to Hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink the Reader: for he should have Distinguished the Nature of a Significant Ceremonies: It hath a general Nature, as it is such an Action, <hi>V. Gr.</hi> the Motion of the Finger, whereby the transient Sign of the <hi>Cross</hi> is made on the Fore-head of a Child; let that pass for indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. It hath also a particular Nature, as it standeth in such Circumstances, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is Appointed to be annexed to Baptism; as it is Stated in Religion, and appointed to it: and as a Religious Signification for a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:62347:145"/>
Spiritual end is put on it, and all this, not by CHRISTS, but by Mans Authority; we deny it to be indifferent in its Nature, while it is thus Considered: as it must needs be in this Debate. But suppose we should allow an Indifferencie to be in the Ceremonies, as they are humane Actions to be used in Worship; it is said without all Warrant, that <hi>our Superiors may Determine, and take away this Indifferencie, and Change their Injunctions about these Actions when, and as often as they see Reason so to do;</hi> tho no Body else can see any such Reason. This is to make our Superiours absolute, and to give them an arbitrarie Power, in these things that we can make appear to be parts of Religion; and which himself cannot deny to have a great influence on Religion, and in which it is nearly concerned. Beside to say that Superiors may Determine every thing that is in its Nature indifferent, wherein Religion is concerned, is to open a Door to so many Impositions as might make Gospel Worship a greater Yoke than that which the Jewish Church was not able to bear; as the Apostle saith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. For Circumstances of Actions are innumberable, and few of them are Determined and Enjoyned by the LORD. We know the Church may determine the Actions in, and about Worship, which are not Determined in the Word, and yet must be Determined: but that she may Determine what ever she thinketh fit, is not to be Admitted.</p>
               <p>§ 4. He telleth us, <hi>p.</hi> 152. that <hi>it is impossible to make Objections against the decent visible Motions of the Body in publick Worship, which may not be improved against the vocal Expressions of the Tongue.</hi> If he must be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Determine what Motions of the Body are decent; this his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be not Opposed: but there are who call most of these Bodily Motions decent, even in Worship, which are Learned at the <hi>Dancing School:</hi> which yet it were hard for the Church to Enjoyn: Wherefore these Motions that were made decent in Worship by Nature, by civil Custom other grave and serious Actions, or by Divine Institution, we make no Objection against them, but blame them who neglect them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for Motions that Men will call decent, without ground from any of these, we make Objections (which yet have not been sufficiently Answered) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their being Injoyned in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>orship, which he shall never be able to Improve against all the Vocal Expressions of the Tongue. He saith <hi>we allow all these.</hi> VVhat he meaneth by so saying, I cannot Divine, we allow Vocal Expressions, and Bodily Motions too, that such of them as are fit should be used. But we do not allow that the Church, by
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:62347:145"/>
her own Authority, without such Warrant as is above-mentioned, should enjoyn her Determinations either in the one or in the other. I hope he hath no ill meaning when he saith <hi>Nature led us at first to the Worship of the DEITIE.</hi> I think Revelation had as early, and as effectual a hand in it, after the Fall. I confess Nature alone will lead Men to Worship the DEITY; but that Worship will not be such as even this Author will think sutable to Gospel Purity; but will have worse Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than those that we Contend about. He concludeth, that <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence we owe to GOD, must needs bring along with it these outward Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of respect that are made Decent by Custom and Authority, to whose Decision alone GOD left these exterior Rituals of Worship.</hi> Thus he still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth to lurk under ambiguous Expressions: we confess the Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some exterior Rituals in Worship is left to civil Custom: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Divine Authority: but that the Decision of any Rituals in Worship is left to Church Custom, where the Thing hath no Decencie but in Religion; or to Humane Authority: this is what we Question; and he should Prove. He speaketh, <hi>p.</hi> 153. of <hi>Rites in the Worship of GOD (among the Jews) that were only Significations of Reverence and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity which were still retained, as they were transmitted to them by Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Custom, and Traditions, though only founded on Humane Appointment.</hi> But he hath not thought fit to give us any one Instance of such Rites. If he mean Religious Ceremonies; that is, Actions peculiar to Worship, I think he can give no Instance of such in the Jewish Church, before its great Apostacie, except these that were Instituted by GOD, and taught in the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>

               <p>§. 5. He cometh next, <hi>p.</hi> 154. to renew the Arguments he had man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged in his <hi>Apology, p. 155. &amp;c.</hi> and were Answered, <hi>Def. of Vindic. p.</hi> 38. He telleth us of a <hi>General Medium</hi> he had used, <hi>that there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral significant Ceremonies mentioned in, and alluded to in the Scripture, which were Practised in the Worship of GOD under the Patriarchal, Jewish, and Christian AEconomie, which had no other than Humane Appointment.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> Instance he giveth is, <hi>Discalceation, Exod.</hi> 13. 5. He had in his <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> joyned with this, <hi>looking to our Feet when we go to the House of GOD; Eccies.</hi> 5. 1. But he hath now wisely left out this last: and Insisteth only on <hi>Discalccation.</hi> What was Objected here, with some freedom, that was <hi>bad Logick,</hi> he representeth as reflecting on Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth of that Observation among the Eastern-Nations. I have as high Esteem of <hi>Mr. Medes</hi> Learning as he hath; and have said nothing that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:62347:146"/>
can import the Contrarie. The Answer given to this Instance, was, <hi>this was Commanded of GOD; and so is no Argument for Observing what is brought into the Worship of GOD merely by the Authority of Man.</hi> All the Reply that he bringeth is, that <hi>this Command was no new Institution of a Ceremonie,</hi> whereas he saith, <hi>what GOD said to Moses was only an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to Observe a Custom that he knew to be used in the Eastern-Nations; so that had Moses put off his Shoes before that Advertisement, he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiss: and so this is a strong Confirmation of Ceremonies that express our Reverence though founded on Humane Appointment.</hi> Here I remark. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was a <hi>new Institution</hi> of a Ceremonie or not, is not to our Purpose: <hi>Moses</hi> had express Divine Warrant for what he did: if he can shew the like for our Ceremonies we shall Observe them. The LORD might Enjoyn what he would, either for that time, or for perpetual Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: either what was used among the Nations; or what was not so used: Let us see an Approbation of any of our Ceremonies that is Paralel to this, and we shall lay our Hand on our Mouth. 2. It is evldent that this was a Civil Custom, and made expressive of Reverence by that Civil Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom; and therefore, the LORD is not here either Instituting, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, a Religious Ceremonie, but requiring to express profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in the Ordinarie way, and that on such an Extraordinarie Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. <hi>Corn. a lapide;</hi> saith, <hi>Minus enim audacter &amp; curiose accesserat Moses.</hi> That this was a Civil Custom, and had its Signification, not from Man's Authority Appropriating it to GOD'S Worship (which is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ceremonies we Debate about) is clear from <hi>Mr, Mede,</hi> and what my Antagonist bringeth out of him. Also, the same Learned School-Man (I mean <hi>A Lapide)</hi> saith, <hi>his ritus a mancipiis descendit, qui nudis pedibus incedebant, in signum subjectionis,</hi> and therefore he Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that Text, <hi>Exod. 3. 5. ut totus in Dei jus &amp; obsequium transeas.</hi> It is Observed by <hi>Ainsworth</hi> on the same Text, that <hi>this was a Civil Sign of transferring our Right to another, Deut. 25. 9. Ruth</hi> 4. 7. It was also by Civil Custom, an Expression of Sorrow. 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 30. Isai. 20. 2, 4. Ezek</hi> 24. 17, 23. Now, if he can shew that the Ceremonies have, by Civil Custom, such aptitude to Signifie what we ought to express in the Worship of GOD, we shall not Oppose them. It is, 3. Evident from his own Words, <hi>p.</hi> 55. where to my Question, <hi>why do not they Observe it, if it be a fit Ceremonie to express our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to Religion is the same every where. If then this Action was broug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ 6. Another Instance he had brought was, <hi>Sackcloth and Ashe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> as signifying grief and sorrow in their Solemn Humiliation; To these 2 Things were Answered; The One, <hi>Why do not the Prelatists use these?</hi> This he Rejecteth, as <hi>unparalelled Nonsense;</hi> because, <hi>if they were still in use in our Countrey who would refuse them that was not resolved to be singular. A.</hi> I should be none of these singular Persons: If they had now Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancie by civil Custom: I should be willing that they should be used in Religion, when Humiliation and Sorrow were Solemnly to be exprest: but when they want that, I think our Brethren do well not to use them in Religion. Yet I must say still, that if they were Religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Old; that is peculiar to Religion; they should be still used without any Dependence on the civil Custom of our Time. I see not what <hi>Nonsense</hi> is in this. If he did not look on them as Religious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but only as used in Religion from their Signification that they had by Civil use; the <hi>Nonsense</hi> was in bringing this as an Instance of Religious Ceremonies of Humane Appointment, for they had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but from Men; therefore they never were, nor now should be, Religious Ceremonies. His next Instance is (as he saith) <hi>ad hominem. Lifting up the right hand to Heaven, in Swearing the Covenant.</hi> It was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that <hi>this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is Lawful to us, on the same Reasons that made it Lawful to them who first Practised it.</hi> In Pursuance of this his Reply, he allegeth, that <hi>we hereby Grant, that many such Usages are alluded to in Scripture, which are merely of Humane Appointment, and yet Deny their Lawfulness; which is to make all Men that Lived before us to be Sottishly Superstitious.</hi> To this Purpose he Discourseth, <hi>p.</hi> 158. 159. Let it be Considered that we do not make bare Allusion made in Scripture to any Usage, to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Proof of its Lawfulness: for some were Alluded to that were very far from being Lawful: Instances may be given of <hi>putting the Branch to the Nose, kissing the Hand, or kissing the Images</hi> that they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which (and many more) were Practised by Idolaters. Our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62347:147"/>
in this Matter is, that what Rites are mentioned in Scripture, as used in the Worship of the True GOD, by His People, and are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where Condemned, we ought to look on as Lawful, and Approved of GOD, that is, as they then were used. Now some of these Rites were of Divine Institution, as all the Jewish Ceremonies Enjoyned by <hi>Moses:</hi> these were then Lawful, but now are not so; because they are Abrogated by CHRIST; also all these Instituted by CHRIST are still Lawful. Others of them are Natural Expressions of the Acting of the Mind: such as <hi>Sighing, lifting the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>yes,</hi> &amp;c. these are always Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: others of them were Civil Customs, which by Use acquired a Significancie, and fitness to express our Affections that we should have in Religious Worship; such as <hi>Sackcloth, renting our Cloaths, Incurvation,</hi> &amp;c. these are certainly Lawful to be used in Worship, when, and where they have that Significancie, by the Force of Civil Custom; but in Times and Places where that Significancie is not, the Ground of it being ceased, I see not how they can be Esteemed Lawful, having, then, and there, no Use or Significancie in GOD'S Worship; but what they have from Man's will, which ought not to Regulate GOD'S Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Our Author Mistaketh when he saith, <hi>that we think some ceremonies Lawful which are mentioned, or alluded to in Scripture, though they had no other Original than Humane Appointment:</hi> this we Disown: for none of these <hi>Three</hi> ways by which Rites get their Significancie (which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I shall not Debate, what Men in Authority may do, toward putting a Civil Signification on Words and Actions, and making them Current in Civil Selemnities: but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

§ 7. For the Rite of <hi>Lifting up the Hand,</hi> so often mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Practised by good Men, by good Angels: yea, by God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, (speaking of Him after the Manner of Men) that it had its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from Humane Appointment, is simply denyed. We have no Footsteps of such a Law, Antecedent to the Practice of it, either in Sacred, or other Records. I may with Confidence conclude, that this Usage had its Original, if not from Nature, as Lifting up of the Eyes to Heaven, yet from an Universal Custom, and that of all, or many Nations. It is true, other Rites were also used in Swearing; but none of them so frequently mentioned as this. Wherefore it can be no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for, nor give any Countenance to, Ceremonies peculiar to the Worship of God brought into it by the Authority and Appointment of Men alone. It is hence evident, that we are not guilty of <hi>counting all them Sottishly Superstitious,</hi> who used such Rites, and that even in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho we think Humane Religious Ceremonies unlawful. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>p.</hi> 159. is pleased to make himself Merry with the Distinction I have used of Civil Rites, (which he, with little Accuracy of Speech, calleth Civil Ceremonies) and Religious Ceremonies; that the one may be used in Religion, without Divine Institution; the other not so. He calleth it <hi>a Metaphysical Distinction; and new Phylosophy; and Co-aeval with Presbytery in its last Figure.</hi> These Sarcasms are the Tokens of his Surprize, and Admiration; not of his being much Conversant with their Writings who Treat of this Subject.

                     </gap>t the Ecclesiastick Authority do it? A.</hi> He will not understand what we say: we deny that Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can introduce a Significant Ceremony into the Worship of God; tho Civil Custom may make a Rite sit to be there used. If the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat should appoint any Habite or Gesture to be used in Gods Worship, to signifie either Gods Will toward us, or our Duty to Him; which hath no such Signification, nor Use, but by the Law, or Will of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat, we should disowne such a Religious Ceremony, as much in that Case, as if it were appointed by Church Authority. But it is a quite other Case; when an Action, or Gesture, hath got a Signification by long and general Use in Mens other Actions; so as that they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made significant of what we are to express in Worship. This may be cleared by a parallel Instance: Words which have got their Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Use in other Things, may be well used in Religion: yet it
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62347:148"/>
doth not thence follow, that the Magistrate may enjoyn Words to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in our Worshipping of God, which have no Signification, but from his Will: for if this were allowed, the Magistrate might not only enjoyn Latine Service, to be used among a People that understand not that Language; but might enjoyn Words that now signifie Error, or Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: and give them an Orthodox Signification: which <hi>I</hi> hope our Brethren will not affirm. If Men may enjoyn a <hi>Surplice,</hi> because white Garments, in some Ages, and Places, were used commonly to signifie Purity or Gladness: why may he not enjoyn the Language to be used in Religion, that our Ancestors used many Hundreds of Years ago; tho it may be now neither used nor understood: it would come, in Time, to be as Significant to us, and as Religious, as now the <hi>Surplice</hi> is, where it hath been long used. He Mistaketh, or Misinterpreteth the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> when he saith, that <hi>he alloweth of Civil Ceremonies in the Worship of God;</hi> he owneth no such Ceremonies, if we speak properly: what hath its Use and Significancy from Civil Custom in other Actions is no Ceremony; it is a Civil Rite, and may well be used in Religion: he repeateth also his former Mistake: as if we thought that <hi>Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might appoint Ceremonies for Religion, but not Church Authority:</hi> our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in which, I have made plain to them who will understand what we say. I have also Answered his Question, <hi>how the Civil Rite used in Religion is Innocent, while a Religious Ceremony, appropriated to Religion, if it be of Humane Appointment</hi> (whether by the Authority of Church or State) <hi>is not so.</hi> I deny what he so confidently asserteth, <hi>p.</hi> 261. that <hi>Lifting up the Hand in Swearing, is of Humane Appointment:</hi> neither is his Proof of it sufficient, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>it hath no Divine Institution:</hi> for what is brought in, and gets its Use, and Significany, by Civil Custom; is a Middle between these. 2. I am not at Leasure to repeat my Answer, as often as he doth his Objection taken from the Equality of the Civil and Ecclesiastick Authority to institute Ceremonies; with which he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth several Pages, with a nauseous saying the same thing, in Words little different. <hi>The Immemorial Possession of any Rite in the Church</hi> (which he insinuateth as an Argument) cannot justifie it, if it be appropriated to Religion, and had no Divine Original. We are not concerned to account for <hi>Kissing the Evangel</hi> in taking an Oath; whether it came in by Civil Custom, or Ecclesiastick Authority. Let them who use it An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer such Doubts: or rather, let them shew us any Ground for it from Nature, from Civil Custom, or from Divine Institution: if it be desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

of all these, he should prove, not barely assert the Stubbornness that is in Refusing it. It is absurd to say, that <hi>the Ecclesiastical Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies having the Civil Sanction, are, under that Reduplication, to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Civil Ceremonies:</hi> for he might say the same of the Sacraments of the New Testament, when enjoyned by Law: it is not the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but Rites being used in Civil Actions, and not being peculiar to the the Worship of God; it is their having their Use and Significancy from Civil Custom, that giveth them that Denomination.</p>

                  </gap>awfulness is founded on the Significancy that it acquireth in Civil Actions.

He hath another Argument for the Lawfulness of Humane Ceremonies peculiar to Religion; which he Ushereth in with that Degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and Insolent Contempt of his Adversaries, that might Fright us into Silence, as the Lion by his Roaring Terrifieth his Prey into a Consternation; calling all our Exceptions against Significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Worship of God, <hi>little</hi> and <hi>idle frivolous Impertinencies.</hi> And no wonder he be so fond of his mighty Argument; I believe it is the Birth of his own Brain. I never met with it before: and I have seen few that are of less weight. It is that the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 6. 4. maketh a palpable Allusion to the Significant Ceremony of Immersion; when he saith we are Buried with Him by Baptism into Death, &amp;c.</hi> To strengthen this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he telleth us of <hi>Immersion being used by Jews, and by Christians;</hi> that <hi>it is founded on no Divine Institution: but on the Practice of the Jewish Church, and thence derived to Christians; and was never established by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authority, but what was purely Humane and Ecclesiastical.</hi> He telleth us <hi>this Custom was so known, that all their Learned Neighbours were acquaint with it;</hi> and for this he very wisely citeth <hi>Tacitus hist. lib.</hi> 5. speaking
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62347:149"/>
of their Circumcision, but not one Word of <hi>Immersion.</hi> He calleth for <hi>the particular Text where this Ceremony is founded on express Institution;</hi> also that we should <hi>shew where it was used in Civil Actions:</hi> That <hi>Scripture Example for it, is but the Consequence of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Immersion, in the Administration of Baptism was founded on no Divine Institution, and yet alluded to by Saint Paul, is a thing received in the current Practice of the Apostolical Church, Ergo, such a Significant Ceremony in the Worship of God, founded on no Divine Institution, is in it self lawful.</hi> I shall far more easily dispatch this Argument, than he hath framed it. If it were not to Hazard his further Despising us, as Conversant only with the <hi>School Jargon</hi> of Syllogising: I should observe that he flyeth so high, as to take little notice of Syllogistical Form, for all his pretending to it: for the Major Proposition is the very Conclusion of the Syllogism, only he hath altered the Word, putting such a Significant Ceremony, for a Significant Ceremony alluded to by the Apostle <hi>Paul:</hi> other Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities in it I pass: it is below him to mind them: <hi>Aquila non captat Muscas.</hi> For a more material Answer, I first deny the Major, as thus universally proposed: Allusion to a Ceremony is no Proof of its Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness: as I have proved §. 6. Next, I deny the Minor: I affirm that <hi>Immersion</hi> was founded on Divine Institution: which I prove, 1.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62347:149"/>
enjoyneth a Sacramental Use of Water in Baptism, for a Mystical Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing; and the Word being of so large a Signification; and Christ not having determined how much Water should be used in Baptism: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Body should be wholly Dipt, or a part of it, or Water should be Thrown, or Sprinkled on the Body; or what Quantity should be Cast on: that all these ways of Washing have Divine Warrant: and tho none of them be enjoyned exclusively of another; yet every one of them hath Christs Warrant: the Consequence of which is, that this Dipping is no Humane Ceremony, especially considering, that every one of these ways of Baptizing, hath a Mystical Signification put on it, even in the Scripture: Dipping in the Text that he citeth; and Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Rinsing in the Old Testament, see <hi>Ezek,</hi> 36. 25. And this will be yet further confirmed, if we consider, that Christ Teacheth, that however applying Water to the whole Body may be a sit, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable Ceremony to express Spiritual Washing; yet that is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but a little may be as effectual for that Mystical Use, as the whole: <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 10. What I have said precludeth the Objection, that Christ maketh the three ways of Baptizing only lawful, and alloweth the Church to determine which of them ought to be used: for the general Word implyeth a Disjunctive Command; neither is it in the Power of the Church to determine one way, exclusive of another: nor should different Practices in this Case be Censured, as receding from Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; each of these ways is a Mode of Baptizing, which is within the Compass of Christs Institution.</p>
               <p>§ 9. That this <hi>Immersion</hi> was used in the Jewish Church, (yea, it may be proved to have been used among Heathens also) is no Proof that it is not of Divine Institution, as it is used in the Christian Church; for the same may be said of Baptism, which Christ made a Sacrament. Neither doth its Mystical Signification make it to be a Humane Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; seing it hath that from Christs Institution: nor doth that make it so necessary, as to exclude all other Modes of Baptizing; seing other ways have their Mystical Significancy, as hath been shewed: yea, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Water on the Person may aptly signifie the same with Dipping, <hi>viz.</hi> being <hi>buried with Christ,</hi> a part of the Body under the Water, may signifie the being under it, as <hi>Washing the Feet</hi> signifieth Washing the whole Body, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 10.

                  </hi> Presbyterians: which he saith, <hi>p. 277. is left naked, and destitute of all such Arguments, as might excuse the Ordination of other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Churches.</hi> And he doth more than insinuate that Presbyterians have no Ordination. His Arguments (so far as I can pick them out of his Discourse) are, 1. <hi>They were under no necessity to separate from their Bishops in the Isle of Britain, A.</hi> 1. Want of Bishops might be the same Excuse for the want of Episcopal Ordination, that it was to other Protestant Churches for whom he pleadeth it: they might have had Bishops if they would, in <hi>France, Geneva, Switzerland, &amp;c.,</hi> as well as we might. 2. The Necessity lay in this, that we thought, (and still must think, till he, or some else, instruct us better) that Bishops ought not to be in the Church. 3. He speaketh of <hi>separating from our Bishops in the Isle of Britain:</hi> that plainly insinuateth, that not only the Bishops in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> are ours, but the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> also, and that we are under their Jurisdiction; as some of them have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: this, from a Minister of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is Unworthy Flattery of that Clergy that he now dependeth on for his Bread. 3. If Ministers in <hi>Scotland</hi> have no Ordination, because, in want of Bishops
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:62347:151"/>
among themselves, they went not to the <hi>English</hi> Bishops for Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why is not the same Defectiveness imputed to these in <hi>France,</hi> who might have come over to <hi>England</hi> for the same End. But the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians are the Men of his Indignation: and therefore, any Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that cometh to Hand, must be used to beat them down. Before I leave this Point, I shall make it evident that the other Reformed, who are without Bishops, can no more have a lawful Ordination than <hi>Scotland</hi> hath, 1. Because they might have had Bishops to rule them; for what could hinder them? their Magistrats did not; for they are of Opinion with themselves: except in <hi>France,</hi> where the Popish Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats did not, nor would oppose that piece of Conformity with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Yea, <hi>Thuan.</hi> blameth the Protestants for not setting up Bishops: the Primitive Church under Heathen Magistrats, had Bishops in our Authors Opinion: and we think they wanted no needful Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, even in that State. 2. It is plain that the Reformed were against Episcopacy, as no Ordinance of Christ, as I have shewed: and it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from Confession of the <hi>French</hi> Church, <hi>Art.</hi> 30. and of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, Art.</hi> 31. which being read in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> was not disliked by any of the <hi>Externi,</hi> save these from <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 11. His second Argument that the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians have no Ordination is, <hi>It is very uncertain, whether they retain such Solemn and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Words, when they impose Hands, as expresly declare, that the Priestly Power of Administrating Sacraments, and Absolving Poenitents, is then Conveyed to him that is Ordained. If there be no such Conveyance, there is no Ordination; and if the Words made use of, doth not plainly and formally signifie such a Power, then there is no such Power Conveyed. A.</hi> This Uncertainty can be no good <hi>Medium</hi> to prove his Point. For such Words may really be used, tho both he and I be uncertain, whether they were used or not. Again; how can he prove the necessity of such Words: what if Words be made use of, which do really and materially signifie the thing designed; tho they do it not formally and plainly? He is the first that I have met with, who layeth so much weight on <hi>the Form of Words.</hi> It is one of the <hi>new Opinions</hi> he hath broached, while he pretendeth to refute <hi>new Opinions.</hi> Against it I thus argue, 1. No Words are enjoyned in Scripture: which must needs have been, if the Nullity of Ordination, and consequently of the Ordinances Administred by such Ministers, had been the necessary Consequent of Words not sufficiently formal and plain. What a sad Uncertainty and Confusion should follow on this
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:62347:151"/>
Necessity of such Words? not unlike that which, in the <hi>Popish</hi> Church, followeth on the Opinion of the Necessity of the Priests Intention in his Administrations. 1. Can he tell us what Form of Words the Apostles used, when they Ordained Ministers; how plain and formal they were? if Uncertainty about that Nullify the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterian Ordination, it will by good Consequence, make void all the Ordinations of the Apostolick Church: I am sure he can give us no Account of their Words from any Authentick Records. 3. In the Administration of Baptism, no Church that I know of, useth Formal and plain Words that express either Admission into the Church, or Communication of Christian Priviledges, or Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with GOD, or our Renouncing the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am sure <hi>I Baptise thee in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. are not Formal, plain Words, to express these Things; tho I doubt not but that they Include them all: and if Baptism be valid without such a Form of Words, why not Ordination also? He says, <hi>p.</hi> 278. that <hi>there are many of their Number in the West, who think Imposition of Hands unnecessarie.</hi> I suppose he hath no Personal knowledge of this: and he should be sure of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers before he cast such a Reproach on his Brethren: for my part, I know no Minister in <hi>Scotland, West, East, South,</hi> or <hi>North,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that Opinion: tho mean while I can tell him of others who are not far from it: even the Church of <hi>France,</hi> in their Synod, at <hi>Paris 1565. C. 6. Quick. Synod. p.</hi> 62. but I far rather agree with Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> who hath Written a Treatise to prove the Necessity of it. He inferreth likewise, <hi>p.</hi> 279. from what he had Discoursed, that <hi>we have no Organical Church.</hi> We are not afraid of his Censures: we can Prove, not only that we have the Essentials of Ordination; but that, for the Manner of it, it is nearer to the Gospel Pattern than what is Practised in that Church which he owneth. I find him to be of the same Sentiments with that Bishop in <hi>England</hi> that was mentioned to him, who said of a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Minister that <hi>he was no better than a Mechanick,</hi> tho he had never been Bred to any Art but the Liberal Arts, and had Presbyterial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. It is strange that he should Insinuate, that <hi>we derive our Power from the People:</hi> he cannot but know that we Disown that Principle: but <hi>Calumniare audacter, aliquid adhaerebit:</hi> he hopeth that some will believe what ever evil he saith of us.</p>
               <p>§. 12. His next Controversie is about the <hi>Presbyterian Church Discipline:</hi> which he had most Abusivly and falsly Reproached, <hi>Apolog. p.</hi> 22, 23.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:62347:152"/>
and was Checkt for so doing by a Modest Answer, <hi>Def. Vindic. p.</hi> 17, In which that which is most Material he wholly passeth over: bringing some what like an Answer to <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> Things. It was asked, <hi>what is that Discipline of the Antient Church (which he wisheth were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored) which is not either the same with ours, or far more strict and Severe.</hi> He Answereth that <hi>he never found fault with our Discipline for its being strict; but for being factiously Pragmatical, and endlesly Inquisitive, and from its having no Tendency to Edifie the Christian-Church, or to Reclaim wicked People.</hi> What can an unbyassed Reader understand by these Words, but that the Man is angry, and hateth the Presbyterians, and their Way: and would fain cast Dirt on them, if he could find it. These indefinite and gross Accusations must either be Proved, that thus the Presbyterians do Manage the Discipline of the Church; and this must be in many Instances, and many Ministers and Elders; and all this well Attested: or the Man who thus Writeth must pass for a <hi>Slanderer,</hi> rather than a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant.</hi> Our Discipline we Manage by the Rules of the Word, and the Principles of sound Reason; we do not Indulge Sin in these of our own Way; nor medle with Things that are without our Line: nor do we enquire into Scandalous Sins till they become such, by being openly known: and if Occasion be given for Enquirie, and nothing be found, we Desist, and leave Secret Things to GOD, to whom they belong; for the Tendency of our Exercise of Discipline, we are sure it is for Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and we can make it appear that sometimes it is Blessed with Success; and if it Irritate some, or Harden others, or have no Fruit on many, we Lament it: but are not to be blamed for it; for the same Thing may be said of Preaching the Gospel, and that in a Commendable manner. I Deny not but that some are short of that Dexterity that others have; and that there is Imperfection in the best of us: and if they that blame us can say otherways of their own Church, either they are strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deluded, or the World is generally Deceived about their Way. He commenceth a new Debate, <hi>p.</hi> 283. about <hi>Non-resistance</hi> which he had raised, <hi>Apolog. p.</hi> 20. and yet waved, and of which very little was said, <hi>Def. of Vindic. p.</hi> 16. he now resumeth the Debate, and talketh more freely than before; being behind the Curtain, and not in Hazard of Censure. I was then unwilling, and am still more so, to medle in that Matter; both because it is a Controuerne that belongeth to the Politicks rather than to Divinity; and Lawyers are sittest to Mannage it. Also, because it is not now between <hi>Prelatists</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> the Generality
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:62347:152"/>
of both having of late years Agreed in what is Inconsistent with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Doctrine that was Current some years ago.</p>
               <p>§ 13. Another of our new <hi>Opinions</hi> he will have to be, <hi>p.</hi> 289. that <hi>they</hi> (the Presbyterians) <hi>abhorre and cast off all Established Forms and Rules in the Worship of GOD,</hi> &amp;c. we have under this Head a parcel of the most False and Impudent Assertions, in Matters of Fact, and the most unjust Calumnies, that ever the Press groaned under. And it is a wonder that a Person pretending to Conscience, or to Christianity, could give such Scope to his Passion, as to have no regard to Truth: and indeed here is little, or no Matter of Debate, nor place for Vindication, but by Denying what he Asserteth without any Attempt to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for what is Asserted. I Deny not but that there may be found some few among the People that own Presbytery, who through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and a mistaken Zeal, run into some of these Excesses that he Taxeth: but I know none who are Guilty of all that he Imputeth to us, <hi>sine discrimine:</hi> and I am sure the more Sober and Intelligent sort of Presbyterians, abhorreth many of these things that he Chargeth them with. He Asserteth that <hi>the Presbyterians of Scotland abhorre and cast off all Established Forms and Rules in the Worship of GOD.</hi> I Challenge him to Prove what he saith: it is a palpable Falshood. For, 1. We neither abhorre nor cast off the <hi>Form of Sound Words,</hi> I mean the Scriptures of Truth, recommended by the Apostle for us to hold, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. nor do we abhorre or reject the Form of Baptizing, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the LORD'S Supper; nor of Blessing the People at the Dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Assembly. 2. Even some Forms that we Reject, as needles, and therefore unfit to be used in this state of the Church, yet we do not abhor them; such as Forms of Prayer, we think they were both Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and necessarie, when the Church was not Provided with Qualified Ministers: yet we think they should now be laid aside, when they are not so needed: as a Man should not use Crutches when he is well Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from his Dameness. 3. To say that we abhorre and reject Rules in the Worship of GOD is beyond all bounds of Truth, and Modesty. We own, and use the Word of GOD as the Rule of Worshiping Him: neither do we abhorre or reject the Help of Humane Rules which are drawn out of that Supreme and Divine Rule: we have our <hi>Directorie,</hi> and many Good <hi>Acts of General-Assemblies,</hi> yea, <hi>of Synods,</hi> and <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> in their respective Districts. His next Assertion is shameles above measure: that <hi>since the Revolution, they Turn out the Episcopal Clergy out of their Livings, if they retain any of the Ancient forms, tho never so short, Catholick, or Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:62347:153"/>
Pray Sir, when was this done, by whom, where, or to whom? none of them were ever Turned out of their Livings on these Heads, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Church or State; and none by the Church except for Ignorance, Error in some Great Point of Faith, supine negligence, or Scandal in Things that are not Controverted among us whether they be Sins, or not. It is true, Uniformity, even in these little Things, is required of these who will Joyn with us, be Received into Ministerial Communion, and have a Share of the Government of the Church with us (and much Tenderness, and Forbearance hath been used even in these, for some time) but they who think not fit to Joyn with us, are suffered to follow their Ministerial Work in their Parishes, and Enjoy their Livings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such Uniformity with us, as he Talketh of. And if we had Requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, or Turned them out, it had been but an Imitating of the Practice of his own Party. Whom do they Suffer to Enjoy Publick Livings who do not Conform to their Way, to the Height?</p>
               <p>§ 14. He persists in his false Assertions, while he saith, <hi>the Episcopal Clergy are Enjoyned to forbear the LORD'S Prayer, Reading the Holy Scriptures in their Assemblies, the Apostolick Creed, and the Doxology.</hi> This is far from any Semblance of Truth: no such Prohibition was ever given. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth a little in Pleading for the Use of <hi>the LORD'S Prayer:</hi> but taketh no Notice of the State of the Question about it, as it hath been Proposed by his Antagonist. His Business seemeth to be, not so much to Convince, as to Accuse. It is False that <hi>we have Banished that Prayer.</hi> We duely use it as a Directory, and Pray according to it; we Teach it to our <hi>Catchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He saith, <hi>it was Enjoyned by CHRIST to his Disciples.</hi> If he mean, that the Words should be Recited, we desiderate the Proof: nor do we find that any of the Apostles, in their Publick Administrations so used it. It is true, the Presbyterians formerly used it; and if they should do so still, I should not Reclaim: but I know that his Parties making it their <hi>Shib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth,</hi> together with Conviction of the Indifferency of so using it, gave the first Occasion for disusing it. It is an unaccountable Fancy, that <hi>the Omission of these have no Tendency but to promote Atheism:</hi> this is the general <hi>

As this his Assertion is most unreasonable, and groundless in it self; there being other means far more Effectual to keep out Atheism than the Use of these Forms can be supposed to be: so Common Observation and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62347:153"/>
Experience sheweth, that the Atheism that we all should Lament, is no more visible, nor common, among that Party of Christians who do not use these Forms, than among them who are fond of them. I can draw no other Conclusion from what follows, <hi>p.</hi> 290, 291. but that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was, when he Wrote these Things, in the <hi>Paroxism</hi> that he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be in when he Wrote another Book, <hi>viz.</hi> provocked to <hi>the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Passion,</hi> to see his beloved Forms neglected. Hence he telleth us of <hi>the Madness and Dreams of idle People, and the Humour of Schism: hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Holy Scriptures to be Read in the Assemblies as heretofore.</hi> whereas it is evident (and the Reverend <hi>Mr. Boise</hi> hath made it appear, on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the like Accusation against us by the <hi>Bishop of L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Next, I Answer, that it is false and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious that he Asserteth: they are not only allowed to know the Faith that their Infants are Baptized into; but pains is taken so far as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters can, to make them understand that Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly taken Engaged to adhere to that Faith, and to breed their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the knowledge of it, and it is told them what Faith we mean, by designing it from the Scripture, the great Rule of it, and the Confession of Faith of this Church, drawn out of the Scripture.

               <p>§ 15. He saith <hi>we are so unfixed and variable, that not</hi> two <hi>in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in publick follow the same Rule,</hi> &amp;c. This is a horrid Abusing of the Reader, and can have no other Design but to make the Presbyterians odious where they are not known; for in <hi>Scotland,</hi> even among his own Party, the contrarie is well known. But all this Noise is, because we have no <hi>stinted Liturgie:</hi> without which we follow the same Rules, both Divine and Humane, as I shewed before, we all teach the same Truths; and Administer the same Ordinances; and in the same manner, except that we use not the same Words: wherein yet we do not studie a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, as he injuriously Asserteth. His Apology for the Episcopal Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> for wanting a Liturgie is odd; <hi>the Clergy Composed Prayers for themselves from which they seldom varied.</hi> It may be some of them did so, either from insufficiency or lazieness: but I am sure neither the greatest, nor the best part of them did so: but what ever be in that, both on his side, and on ours, they who did not tie themselves to the same Words, at all times, managed their Work <hi>with as much plainess, gravity, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of their Words, and left the People as little in the Dark</hi> as they did whom he so much Commendeth on these Accounts. His calling Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a set Form, <hi>Rambling,</hi> and Ascribing to it <hi>no Order, nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, but what is caused by the heat of the Animal Spirits:</hi> I neglect, as shewing a Temper of mind that is to be pitied rather than Redargued by Argument. He waveth the Debate about <hi>stinted Forms, p.</hi> 292. which any who Readeth this Discourse must understand that he intendeth not to Dispute by Scripture, or Reason, against him whom he Opposeth in this, but to Rail at him: And because I intend not to engage with him at that Weapon, I shall wave it too. Yet he bringeth <hi>Calvines</hi> Testimony for the Preference of a <hi>well Composed Liturgie;</hi> out of one of his Epistles, which he so Citeth, as no Man shall find it, unless he happen to have the same Edition of <hi>Calvines</hi> Epistles that he used; which I have not: had he named the Epistle by its Number, or the Person to whom Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed, I might have found it by some pains. I oppose <hi>Calvine</hi> to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;</hi> he said of the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> (and I suppose that will pass with my Author for a <hi>well Composed</hi> one) that <hi>it had in it some Tollerabiles ineptias.</hi> He bringeth some what that looketh like Argument, even in this Debate that he waveth. <hi>The great things of Worship is not to be left to the Wisdom and Discretion of every private Administrator.</hi> A. This is provided against
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62347:154"/>
by the Churches trying Men well before they be Intrusted: by setting the Word, and the Acts of the Church before them, as their Rule and Directorie, and by Watching over them, and Correcting them for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management. These are GOD'S ways of preventing Inconveniency; a <hi>stinted Liturgie</hi> is a way of Mans devising, without any Warrant, or Footstep of it in the Scripture. Another of his Arguments: <hi>every Priest isnot wise enough to manage an Affair of such great Importance.</hi> A. That is so true that none is wise enough for it, as the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. And if so, who is fit to Compose a <hi>Liturgie</hi> for others; which all Men must be tyed to? On this Consideration, the Church ought to chuse the fitest Men she can get; and when that is done; both the weaker, and stronger Sort should beware of leaning to their own Wit and Parts in that Great Work; and should take the Word of GOD for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectorie, and Depend on the Spirit of GOD for His assistence: and this is a better Remedy of the Evil feared than a <hi>sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ted Liturgy</hi> is; and hath more Countenance in the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. Another Argument. <hi>Though a Minister should be very Wise, yet at all times he is not in the same Temper, and it is not reasonable that the Worship of GOD should be less decent when his Intellectuals are clouded than when he is in perfect health.</hi> A. 1. If this Argument have any strength, we must have a Form of Preaching, as well as of Prayer; and always tyed to it: for a Disordered mind may make sad work there. 2. Some have been out of Temper for Reading the Service, as well as for Extemporary Prayer; when their Brain hath been clouded: and this hath as often hapened in the Reading Pue, as in the Presbyterian Pulpit. Wherefore, we must have another Remedy against it in both, than a Liturgie. 3. I confess a lesser Degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in the Worship of GOD than should be, or hath been, is never <hi>reasonable:</hi> but how can it be prevented either in Praying, Preaching, or Reading, as long as, the Temper both of Mens Bodies, and of their Minds are variable. 4. If <hi>a Mans Intellectuals</hi> be at any time so <hi>clouded,</hi> whether by a Hypochondriack Distemper, or by Drinking too liberally, or by any other Sickness; as that it is probable to make the Worship of GOD to be unduely Managed, that Man (what ever have been his Wisdom or Abilities) should not be suffered to Officiate at that time; whether with, or without the Book: I am sure there was never any Church, Ancient or Modern, which appointed a Liturgie for such Men; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 5. There is another Cause of Worship being better or worse
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62347:155"/>
Managed at diverse times, which our Author hath not thought on, nor will his Liturgie serve for a Remedie of it; that is the better or worse Frame of his Soul, with respect to Heavenly things, and the Degrees of the Presence and Aids of the Spirit of GOD: therefore, however unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable it be, yet it is manifest, that there is not the same measure of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and Spiritual Luster on the Worship of GOD at all times: nor can there be a Remedie for this, till we be better Men: nor even then, if the LORD for His own Holy ends, withdraw his presence: I know this will be slouted by some: but the Apostle himself had his unusual Inlargements, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and found it needful that the People should Pray for assistence to him, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>§. 16. He bringeth yet another Reason: <hi>the spiritual necessities of the People ought at all times to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is fair if they be always well, and sometimes, if they be tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerablly provided for. 2. This is the improperest Reason that he could have fallen upon; for it cutteth the Throat of his Cause: because the Spiritul Necessities of the People are very various: diverse People have diverse Necessities: and the same Persons Needs may be far other, or greater, at one time than at another: they know little of the Spiritual state of Souls, who know not this; now a <hi>

                     </gap>d Liturgie</hi> can never reach these, half so well as a Minister may do, who hath the Gift of Prayer; and who endeavoureth, as much as may be, to be acquainted with the Cases of the Peoples Souls. Next, he Pleadeth <hi>Uniformity</hi> for the use of a <hi>stinted Liturgie,</hi> which is a weak Argument: for Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Words (and that is all that we can have by a <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which can not be obtained without it) is not so valuable. If we all speak the same things what great Matters is it if they be exprest in diverse Words. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what Reason is there for the Necessity of <hi>Uniformity</hi> in Prayer, more than in Preaching? which yet our Brethren do not Enjoin. That the Forms he mentioneth are the <hi>Tessera's if Uniformi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y,</hi> is an absurd and groundless Assertion: there was Uniformity in the Apostolick Church, and is in our Churches, without them. If he deny this last, let him shew what Dissormity is among us, further than in Words, which he cannot shew to be among his own Partie; yea, it is evident that such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepancie is in their Worship, in one Church from another, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Charge us with the like: for the Cathedral Service, and that in Countrey Churches, are more unlike to one another, than the Latter of

This is far more readily and frequently done in Preaching than in Prayer: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will either Prove that free Preaching, without a Book, should be Restrained; or it Proveth nothing at all. And indeed the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Inconveniency in both, is not a <hi>Liturgie,</hi> but to be careful that none but well Qualified Men be in the Ministry, and Watchfully to look to the Administrations of them who are in that Office.</p>
               <p>§ 17. Our Author, <hi>p. 295. &amp; seq.</hi> Haleth in a Discourse by Head and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ars, without Occasion given, or Coherence with what he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concerning <hi>Superstition;</hi> wherein he taketh it for granted that his Way, in all the Parts and Steps of it, is right, and ours wholly wrong: and on this Begged Hypothesis, he Declaimeth against the Presbyterians as <hi>the most Superstitious,</hi> yea, <hi>the most Atheistical</hi> Men in the World. This is an easy Way of Running down any Adversary whatsoever. Whether <hi>a Groundless Scrupulosity,</hi> either in Matters of common Practice, or in Matters of Worship, be <hi>Superstition</hi> or not, I know is controverted by some: I shall not now enter into this Debate; knowing that it issueth into a mere <hi>Logomachy.</hi> Tho I think <hi>Superstition,</hi> being a sort of false Worship, or a Sin against the Worship of God, in Strickness of Speech, nothing should be called <hi>Superstition,</hi> but that whereby People intend, or pretend to Worship God. Scruples about what is not Worship may be very Sinful, because Unreasonable and Groundless, and yet not be Worship, nor <hi>Superstition.</hi> If he can prove that our Scrupling the Holy Days, Liturgy and Ceremonies, is without all Ground, and that these things are well Warranted, and Approved of God; and that there is no Sin in Using them: we shall change our Opinion, and submit to what Censure he shall put on us. But while that is not done, (as I am sure it hath not hitherto been performed) we regard little his Railing Accusations that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lleth his Pages with. Most of what he here Loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Presbyterians with, may be evidently, and with good Reason, Retorted on himself, and his Party. For Instance, he saith <hi>when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Deity, as one that is plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed with the imaginary Notions that we Groundlesly entertain of Things; this is Superstition, that Poysons the Soul and all its Faculties.</hi> Now whether Presbyterians or Prelatists be more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this, let the Reader Judge. The one think that God is pleased with nothing as Worship, but what He hath Prescribed in His Word: And that He hateth Will-Worship, and all Notions about that, which
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62347:156"/>
have no Foundation in Scripture. The other think God is pleased with a great many Things that Men have have Devised for Adorning His Worship; and for an Order and Decency that they imagine to be such; but the Lord hath never declared it to be such. Whether of the two entertain these Groundless Notions of the Deity, which are the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> that <hi>Poysoneth the Soul and all its Faculties?</hi> Another Instance: <hi>to say that such a thing is forbidden of God, only because we forbid it our selves, is to teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men: but to regulate our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in themselves indifferent, according to the Prudent Determination of our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, cannot fall under that Censure.</hi> Let us see whether we, or his own Party be thus guilty. We disowne that we say of any one thing, that it is forbidden of God, because we forbid it: if we say of any thing, that God hath forbidden it, and do not prove that it is so; we refuse not to bear the Blame of such Impiety: but it is manifest, that his Party use somethings, as if God had enjoyned them, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that it is so; but only the Church hath enjoyned them: they Command People to obey, to Use their Ceremonies, they Urge them with Rigour, they do more severely Censure the Neglect of them, than they Punish Breaking of Gods plain Commands. And yet they cannot shew, nor do they pretend to, any other Warrant for them, but the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church; which he calleth <hi>the Prudent Determination of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.</hi> It were needless, as well as endless, to take notice of all the Fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Notions that he expresseth about <hi>Superstition,</hi> and his Ungrounded Suppositions, that the Presbyterians are of these Sentiments, in which he placeth it: what is said may give a sufficient Taste of his Way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing his Adversaries: only I cannot pass, that <hi>p.</hi> 29<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is not only Conscience of Pleasing God, but Concern for that <hi>End,</hi> that maketh us so Careful, that the <hi>Means</hi> we use be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God. Or do we <hi>separate Ecclesiastical Laws, from their Relation and Subserviency to the Laws of God:</hi> we are so far from it, that we owne no Ecclesiastical Laws, which are without the Relation of Dependency

That the <hi>Negative Scrupulosity</hi> that he mentioneth from <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 21, 22, 23. is a great Evil, we doubt not: and if he will call it <hi>Superstition,</hi> we will not contend about Words (tho the Reason of that Denomination is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the <hi>Will-Worship</hi> that is mentioned, being rather to be referred to the <hi>Worshipping of Angels,</hi> spoken of <hi>v.</hi> 18. which is there, and also in Conjunction with this <hi>Will-Worship,</hi> called <hi>Humility;</hi> that is a vain Shew, of it.)

His Probative Instance of what he had said, is yet less Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable. It is, that <hi>the Covenanters, when they in their full Career a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ancient Constitutions of Church and State,</hi> (thus his Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, doth represent them to him, and his Hatred of them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him so represent them to the World) <hi>with Hands lifted up to Heaven abjured the Primitive Stations:</hi> and these <hi>Stations</hi> he highly extolleth; and thinketh the Presbyterians know not what they are, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that <hi>we are bound by the Covenant, never to be present at such Exercises of Mortifications, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Stations</hi> were their Meetings on <hi>Wednesdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> for Fasting till Nine of the Clock, and for other Spiritual Exercises.

This Supestition is what is renounced in the Covenant, and it is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Peregrinations</hi> and such other Fopperies. He calleth <hi>Superstition a Bastard Kind of Worship, p.</hi> 305. but Scrupling at Ceremonies, hath nothing in it like Worship, whether Bastard or Legitimate: how will he then Reconcile this, with Calling our Scruples <hi>Superstition?</hi> The <hi>Jewish Superstitions, the Murdering of A.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert a few Things on this his Essay, before I consider particularly the Proofs of <hi>Obscurity</hi> and <hi>Unintelligibleness</hi> of this Doctrine. 1. If I should yield all that he here proposeth to himself, he falleth short of his Design; which is to Reproach the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians: for tho they owne that <hi>Catechism,</hi> and look on it as one of the best extant, yet it is not of their Composure; it was done by the Divines Assembled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> few of whom were Presbyterians. 2. Few Men of Sense, who are Concerned about the Promoting of Religion, and the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souls, will prefer it to the Church of <hi>Englands Catechism,</hi> which beginneth, <hi>What is thy Name; Who gave thee this Name, &amp;c.</hi> but will owne that there is more sound, plain, useful Truth, and what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be known by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eople, in our, than in their <hi>Catechism.</hi> As might easily be made appear, if I might Digress to State a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison between them, from the Beginning to the End. 3. We must not imagine, that whatever is put into a <hi>Catechism,</hi> must be so plain, that the meanest Capacity, without Help, can sufficiently understand it: for there are Truths needful to be known, which the People must be helped to understand, tho at first View, they Comprehend them
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:62347:159"/>
not: yea, somethings must be taught to all the People, and are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be known by Christians, which tho they are intelligible, yet are not so easily understood, nor so fully, as some other Things, can be. If this Author will take on him, to judge of the Labour of such a Grave and Learned Assembly, as was that at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and conclude, that they Acted Foolishly, in Proposing Unintelligible Doctrines to the People, let him give also his Censure of the <hi>Apostolick Catechism;</hi> the Substance of which is set down <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. where are Matters, that as many Difficulties may be raised about, as he Starteth on this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Answer. 4. I hope he doth not Dream, that no Truths are to be Proposed to the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> but such as the meanest (yea, or the greatest Capacity) can fully Comprehend, and Solve all the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yea, or Understand all the Debates, that arise in the Heads of Learned Men about them: for then, they must be kept in Profound Ignorance of all the Mysteries of our Religion, yea, of the Greatest, most Fundamental, and most Necessary Truths that the Scripture Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us. If he were put to Frame a <hi>Catechism</hi> so Qualified, he would find it hard to get Matter for it. He should consider, that the Use of a <hi>Catechism,</hi> is not to make the People Polemick Divines at first Hand, but to Acquaint them with the Positive Doctrine of Salvation, and to Lay before them Scripture Grounds for Assenting to it. 5. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this Question and Answer, is very necessary to be known, as on other Grounds, so in Order to the Exercise of Gospel Repentance: which is hard to say any can have, who is wholly Ignorant of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> which is here, as plainly and fully Described, as hath been done by any, in so few Words. One may be Jealous, that Picking this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the <hi>Catechism,</hi> ariseth rather from Dislike of the Truths here Taught, than from the Obscurity of it. If he allow Original Sin to be Taught to the People at all, let him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry if he can Frame a plainer Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion and Answer about it. 6. It is the Care of Presbyterian Ministers, that People may understand the Grounds of our Religion, as well as may be, not only to lay down, even in the <hi>Catechism,</hi> the Scriptures where such Doctrines are Taught, that the Peoples Faith may stand on that sure Foundation, but also they Explain the <hi>Catechism,</hi> and all the Doctrines contained in it, to them, when they <hi>Catechise,</hi> and sometimes in Preaching: and do not content themselves, that the People can Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Words of the <hi>Catechism:</hi> and therefore it is no sufficient Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against the <hi>Catechism,</hi> that any Passage in it is not so Obvious to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62347:160"/>
every Capacity, as might be wisht. Notwithstanding of all that I have said, I do not yield that this, or any other Passage in the <hi>Catechism,</hi> is Unintelligible by an ordinary Capacity, where Attention, and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is used, toward Attaining of Knowledge. 7. Tho it were to be wished, that <hi>all the Lords People were Prophets,</hi> and that every one of them were able to Debate for the Truth, and to stop the Mouths of Gainsayers: yet we think it should be endeavoured, that cople gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally should know the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of these Revealed Truths, which are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to their Salvation, and to Direct them in the Way of Duty; and if some cannot Attain such a Measure of Knowledge in them as is Desireable; others who are more Docile, should not be Deprived of what Advantage they can attain.</p>
               <p>§ 20. Our Author having set down the Question and Answer, saith, <hi>there is nothing in it but is Dark, and altogether beyond the Comprehension of Illiterate People: yea, that it cannot be understood without Acquaintance with the Language of the School Men:</hi> he calleth it <hi>Clouds of Unknown Language:</hi> all this is as easily denyed as it is asserted, and with far more Reason: for we can give the Instances of many, (tho may be, they will not be willing to be Named, as he requireth) who can give a good Account, without School Terms, of the Doctrine here Comprised; who yet know no other Language, but their Mother Tongue. He telleth us that <hi>the first Difficulty is, de reatu peccati primi hominis:</hi> I confess, if he propose it thus in Latine, it will puzzle most of the Vulgar, (whom he Despiseth under the Name of <hi>Plow Men)</hi> but there are <hi>Plow Men,</hi> and others, who in their own Language, can tell you that thus it is with us, that we are guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin; and can bring Scripture Proof for what they say, out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey People can understand, that in that Passage of Scripture, it is plain, that we are guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, and that we are justified by Christs Righteousness: and so they will tell you, that Scripture holdeth forth the <hi>Imputation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of both; and they understand what is meant by that hard Word. His next Difficulty is, <hi>de privatione justitiae originalis;</hi> and he Complaineth, that <hi>the English Word doth not determine, whether it be Privation or Negation:</hi> our People can tell, (and some are Sensible of it, and Weighted with it) that they have no Righteousness of their own, nor Rectitude in their Nature, that they are neither Born with it, nor can Acquire it, but must have it from Christ, or perish without it: for the Terms he mentioneth, they do not trouble themselves about these, nor
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62347:160"/>
do we think it necessary that they should. His third Remark seemeth to make the Answer to the Question, not only Obscure, but Erroneous: for he maketh it to insinuate, that the <hi>Rectitude of Mens Souls is wholly lost, and that there are no remains of the Divine Image left on the Soul of Man.</hi> It is no wonder that he thinketh the Vulgar cannot understand this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, when so Learned a <hi>Dr.</hi> doth so foully Misapprehend it; I shall not impute this to want of Capacity, nor to the Objective Darkness of the Thing; but to his Prejudice, or want of Attention: for it is plain to any who will understand, that this is neither said nor hinted and that it is manifest that the Corruption of all the Faculties, not the total Corruption of all, or any of them, is there Expressed. Such a Blunder as this, in another, he would have Insulted over. A further Evidence of the Obscurity that he would Prove, <hi>that our sinful Estate consisteth also in all the actual Transgressions that proceed from this Original sin.</hi> He must have a very dark mind to whom this is unintelligible. But the Great Matter is, that <hi>he that Answereth must Re-collect all these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hings,</hi> (and they are but 4. in Number) <hi>before he understand this Matter.</hi> What mighty Difficulty is in that? or wherein lyeth the <hi>Necessity of Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks for understanding these Particulars,</hi> or making Re-collection of them, I cannot Comprehend: nor can I understand how <hi>Peoples being I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cumbred with the Affairs of Humane Life, putteth them out of Case for attaining the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we Debate about.</hi> What he further hath under this Head, is made up of Harsh Words and bitter Censures, not to be Answered: that <hi>the Catechism was only designed as the Badge of a Partie</hi> (as if the Prelatists met at <hi>Westminster</hi> designed a <hi>Shibboleth</hi> for the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians to be distinguished by) this is wise talk: he calleth it <hi>such Words as Monks and ill natured Zealots pitched upon: it is nothing else but to lift up a Banner for Faction, Ignorance, and Superstition. They</hi> (the People) <hi>are Taught by their Leaders to baule against the Ancient Methods of the Christian Church, and that which they set up in Oposition to it, leads them naturally to Pride, and Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm:</hi> Let any Man whose Tongue is under any Restraint from the aw of GOD, or regard to Man, tell us how this can be applied to the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism.</hi> More stuffe of this Stamp, he hath, which I am wearie to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe. He saith, <hi>this Charge may be fairly managed against the Catechism in general, as well as against this Question.</hi> And I am Confident all such Attempts may receive a full and plain Answer. He is pleased also to Reproach <hi>the Homilies of the Presbyterians</hi> (so in Contempt he calleth their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel) with <hi>the same strain;</hi> he must mean <hi>unintelligiblness:</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:62347:161"/>
from which he falleth into a new Fit of calling his Opposites by what ill Names he pleaseth. Such an Indefinite Charge as this is not to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; but by Denying it: and I am sure he can never Prove it, the Stories collected, or devised by his Friend, the Author of <hi>the Presbyterian Bloquence,</hi> are not Probative, where Sense or Reason, or Candor have place, no, not among his own Party, who know the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>§. 21. His next Charge against us is, a Repetition of what he brought, and I Answered before: that <hi>the Scripture is not Read in Publick;</hi> and this he saith, <hi>is pursuant to the Design of keeping the People in the Dark.</hi> He saith, <hi>the Canonical Scriptures, as well as the Apocryphal</hi> (a double Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in his eyes) <hi>are laid aside from publick use,</hi> which he calleth <hi>a bold stroke of Atheism, and Enthusiasm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But wise Men will think that there is far more of <hi>Atheism</hi> in such a Bold, Publick, Unlimited Assirming of what is an Evidence of having no regard to Truth. If there were any thing Argumentative (as the whole is most Abusive, and destitute of Truth) in his Harangue that he seteth off these Falsehoods with, I should be at the pains to give them a fair Answer: see what is said of this § 14. He next, <hi>p.</hi> 317. Quarrelleth with our <hi>Ruling Elders:</hi> which he Introduceth with a Falsehood that is palpably such, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>we have put away Deacons, as well as Bishops:</hi> the World knoweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: and if this Author do not know it, he is very unfit to talk of the Presbyterians, who is such a Stranger to their Way, and Constitution. We have <hi>Deacons,</hi> whose Work it is to take Care of the Poor, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Apostolick appointment. It is true, our <hi>Deacons</hi> are not allowed to Preach and Baptize, as these who in the Episcopal Church go under that Name: for we find no Warrant for giving them that Power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be immediately, and extraordinarily given them by the LORD; as it was to some (not to all) of the Primitive <hi>Deacons.</hi> It is also true, that in some places, the Office and Work of <hi>Ruling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lder,</hi> and of <hi>Deacon,</hi> is in the same Person: which hath Warrant from the Word: but that <hi>we have no Deacons,</hi> is said without any Semblance of Truth. Tho he knoweth that, that Controversie about <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> who have no Preaching Power, hath been much agitated between his Partie and us, and his Antagonist (whose Writing he never failleth to Oppose, when he thinketh he can) hath Written on that Subject; yet he is pleased here to content himself with setting his <hi>Nigrum theta</hi> on this our Oppinion, without endeavouring to Refute it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except he will call it an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62347:161"/>
that he saith, <hi>it is a Sacrilegious Usurpation on the Ecclesiastical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> He hath <hi>Two</hi> Quarrels with them: One is, that <hi>they are not set apart by Imposition of hands.</hi> I have no other Answer to this, but that some among our selves are unsatisfied with this: but they are So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and Pubickly set apart for their Work, and taken Engaged to it: and therefore, that want doth not Nullifie the Office. That such an Office should be in the Church by CHRIST'S Institution, I hold, tho I will not undertake to justifie the Practice of our own, or other Churches, in some things concerning these <hi>Elders.</hi> His other Fault that he findeth with them is, that <hi>the Preachers encroach so on them, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer them, whose sole Office is Government, to interpose in the most Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Points of Jurisdiction,</hi> viz. <hi>the Solemn and Authoritative Imposition of hands, Administration of Sacraments, and Absolution of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the Principles of this Author: do not his Party, at their own hand, give some part of Church Authority to their <hi>Deacons,</hi> as Preaching and Baptizing; and withhold from them all the rest of it: why then may not we (with much more reason) allow, that CHRIST hath given part of Church Power to these Elders, and yet not the whole of it? But I consider his Objection more particularly: the <hi>first</hi> Power (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by him) as denyed them is, <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> on the Pastors of the Church. If he can Prove that any other than Pastors have that Power, by Divine Warrant, he shall gain this Point.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:62347:162"/>
Executing of these Sentences, in the publick Congregation, is the Work of the Pastor; both because publick Administration of CHRIST'S Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are in his hand: and because these Administrations are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, or conjoyned with the Word, and publick Prayer; which are the Work of the Minister, not of the Elder.</p>
               <p>§ 22. Another <hi>New Opinion</hi> he Taxeth (but will not be at pains to Examine or Refute it) is, that <hi>we think the People have a Right to Chuse their Pastors.</hi> The <hi>Novelty</hi> of this Opinion is most absurdly Asserted: for it not only was the way of the Apostolick: but of the Primitive Churck for many Ages, as I have shewed <hi>Rational, Def. of non conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> § 6. <hi>p. 197. &amp;c.</hi> and should now further have Debated it with him, if he had insisted on it. He misrepresenteth our Opinion, while <hi>first</hi> he saith, we <hi>maintain this Right to be unalterable:</hi> whereas we think a People may lose it, as to its present Exercise, by their inhability or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, and it devolveth into the hands of the Rulers of the Church. While <hi>2dly,</hi> He insinuateth, <hi>p.</hi> 320. that <hi>this Power is allowed in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People, without due Restrictions and Limitations.</hi> We think the People in this, as in all their other Religious concernments, are under the Inspection and Government of the Presbytery, Congregational, or Classical. Instead of Arguing against this Way, he laboureth to cast Dirt on it; which easily may be wiped off. I have proved, in the Place Cited, that they who were designed for the Ministry were not only named in the Congregation for their Assent, or Objecting against them; but they were chosen <hi>a Clero et Plebe:</hi> for the 36. <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> (it is, <hi>Mihi,</hi> 37.) which he Citeth: not only we Reject it, with the rest, as not Authentick, nor Probative: but it also Censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Bishop that doth not undertake the Office, and Charge: Doth it thence follow that a Bishop may be Imposed on a People without his own Consent, as well as without theirs? that <hi>Canon</hi> seemeth to be meant of some incident Dislike, either on the part of the Pastor, or of the People, after Ordination; which should not excuse them from mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Duties: and so it is nothing to our purpose. How <hi>popular Election</hi> would hinder Uniformity, more than the Patrons Election doth; iss hard to be understood. That <hi>People will chuse such as themselves for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals and Morals,</hi> doth not always hold: People generally think that their Pastors ought to have both more Learning, and more Religion, than themselves. And if they be of such perverse Inclinations, they are to be Over-ruled by the Presbytery. What he saith of <hi>the scandalous effects
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62347:162"/>
of Popular Election</hi> (I suppose he meaneth Tumults and Divisions) were far more visible, frequent. and horrid, when Bishops were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise chosen: there was never so much Blood-shed at Election of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Minister, as hath been at Chusing of some Bishops, in the Later Primitive times, after that Office was settled in the Church. What are we concerned more than his own Party is, in the Ridiculous Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath of <hi>a Company of mean Mechanicks laying Wagers that such a one shall Preach better than another.</hi> Is any Church accountable for either the Follies, yea, or the Sinful Excesses of every one of her Members, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to Rebuke, or Censure them, according to the degree of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given; when they come to be known? I know of no such Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers laid among our People, tho may be, there is too much of being Puffed up for one, against another; as it was in a Church that I hope he will have more respect for than for he hath for the Presbyterian Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.

               <p>§. 23. His next Work is quite out of his present Road: it is not to consider any <hi>new Opinions</hi> held by the Presbyterians: but to revive a Reproach he had before cast on one P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet this Charge he only mentioneth; and therefore I shall not insist on it neither: but it seems, this was but Introductory to what he intended: which is, he will Vindicat a Notion that <hi>Grotius</hi> hath about <gap reason="foreign">

His Advice hath been followed, before it was given, in <hi>Reading Grotius on the Places he mentioneth;</hi> and yet nothing is found that maketh for his Design. He hath another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the Context (which yet is the same above-mentioned, and Answered) that <hi>the Apostle having in the preceeding,</hi> v. (he should have said in the same <hi>v.) distinguished the several Offices,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that were then most Observable in the Apostolick Church. I suppose that the helping such as were ready to fall, did most properly belong to the Spiritual Governours.</hi> This is above answered: and it is not one whit stronger by being said over again. Further, he Asserteth, but hath not shewed us, how the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text leadeth to this Interpretation: his supposing it to be most proper to the several guids to help them that fall, doth not prove his design; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he could shew that there was an Officer in the Church who had his Designation from thus <hi>helping</hi> People: and when he hath done that, he must shew that this is peculiar to the Bishop, and that no other Church Officer is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or Governing Power, but because they had the Care of the Poor, and the Dispensing of the Goods of the Church, as I shewed in the Place above Cited of this Book. Which, if it were granted, would make nothing for Episcopal Jurisdiction. We maintain that the <hi>Deacons</hi> are here meant, and if the Bishops be <hi>Deacons,</hi> let them have this Place in the List of Church Officers. For they had no Room in it before, nor on the Score of Jurisdiction over other Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. I do not derogate from <hi>Grotius his Knowledge of the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Words,</hi> nor of <hi>his Ability to have Written a Lexicon:</hi> but I do not look on him as beyond a Possibility of Mistake, even in that wherein he excelled. And indeed he speaketh very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of this Matter, as his Words Cited by my Antagonist do shew: nor doth he positively say, that the Bishops are meant by this Word. Another Proof of the Signification of the Word, is from <hi>Ps.</hi> 48. 3. where <hi>the seventy use it to signifie the Lords helping his People:</hi> what is this to the Purpose? the Question is not whether this Word have the Notion of Help; but whether it have the Notion of Government: but our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Mendeth the Matter, making up, by his Latine Translation, what is not in the Greek; for he saith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>must signifie, cum suscipiet cam, nempe Civitatem, in Tutelam:</hi> why must it signifie this: why may it not as well be turned, <hi>cum opitulabitur illi? Chrysost.</hi> hath it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ad Exaltationem.</hi> None of all these signifie any thing of Government; but of Defence or Support: so that nothing in this Word agreeth half so well to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as to the <hi>Deacons</hi> Work. I hope he will not think, that because the Lord who is in this Psalm, said to Help His People, doth also Rule them, that it hence followeth, that every <gap reason="foreign">
