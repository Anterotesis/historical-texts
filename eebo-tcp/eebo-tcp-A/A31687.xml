            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CHARACTER
OF A
Disbanded Courtier.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>Ingenium Galbae male habitat.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>HE was born with an aſpiring Mind, by much too high flown, for
his Quality and his Eſtate. His dexterity in doing ill, made
him thought capable of performing admirably well; if ever
he came to be employed and entruſted. He was preferr'd
for Ability to high degrees of Honour and Office; admitted into the
Cabinet Councils, made acquanted with all the ſecret Wheels, (and
could tell how many Coggs there was in each Wheel) upon which the
great Engine of State was turned, and kept in motion: By the favour of
his Prince, he acquired ſufficient Riches to ſupport the Splendor of a
new raiſed Family.</p>
            <p>His Glory was eminently conſpicuous, that there were but a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
below the Crown ſeem'd above him: And nothing was wanting to
render his Felicity, as laſting as Nature intended his Life; but a heart
that knew how to be grateful to a moſt <hi>Munificent Benefactor.</hi> He thought
all the Favours and Honours he enjoy'd, were leſs then the reward of
his Merit: That Thought puff'd him with Pride; ſuch a ſort of Pride, as
is commonly attended with an irrecoverable Fall, (which was his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;)
And at his Fall (like that of his Predeceſſor) might very well
have been proclaimed: <hi>Woe to you the Inhabitants of the Earth, for the
Devil is come down among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Open Revenge againſt his Soveraign, being too dangerous to attempt,
he preſently reſolves upon ſecret: He exp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſes all the Weakneſſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of the Court, (from which no Court is free) and where he can
find no real Faults, he Feigns imaginary ones; and paſſes them off for
Currant: By this new and falſe Optick, he repreſents every Mole-hill
of miſtake, in the publick Adminiſtration; for a Mountain as tall as
<hi>Teneriff,</hi> and as dangerous as the top of <hi>Aetna.</hi> Nay, he multiplies
and magnifies the very Miſcarriages, which were the effect of his own
Evil Councel. He Amuſes the freeſt Nation in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> with wild
Rumours and extravagant Apprehenſions of <hi>Slavery;</hi> under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a <hi>Prince,</hi> who in Acts of Favour, and Mercy, and Clemency,
has exceeded all His <hi>Predeceſſors.</hi> He fills the Heads of the People full
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98662:2"/>
with Whimſical Fears of Fantaſtick Devils; <hi>(Chymaera</hi>'s which only his
Malice had raiſed) on purpoſe to Frighten them out of their Loyalty
and their Wits; and prepare and ripen them for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or for <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
He makes the pretences of<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Liberty,</hi> is not a Freedom, for every man to do what he pleaſes; an exemption from juſt Laws: Theſe Laws were made for the puniſhment of Tranſgreſſors; and are the true Libery of every honeſt man. The deſtroying of which Laws, is throwing down the Fence, whereby Virtuous and good men are ſecured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected</note> 
               <hi>Liberty,</hi> the
Stirrup to get up; and<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Religion,</hi> does not conſiſt in the ſtubborn adhering to this or that Party, or in crying up one Faction as Infallible; and cenſuring all others as Damnable: But in <hi>Doing Juſtice, and Loving Mercy, and Walking Humbly with God,</hi> (ſays <hi>Micha</hi> the Prophet) <hi>And it is firſt pure and then Peaceable,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle.</note> 
               <hi>Religion</hi> the Steed
he Rides, in purſuit of his Monſtrous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns:
With theſe pretences he Cheats the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and promiſing to open their Eyes;
ſerves them as the Apoſtate Angel did our
Parents in Paradice: Only blows into them
the Magical duſt of Diſobedience; and robs
them of thoſe Jewels he pretends to beſtow,
<hi>viz. Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> which are both
ſo much talk'd of, and both ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            <p>Being a Gentleman of little or no <hi>Religion</hi> himſelf, he ſeems for all that
to eſpouſe every Diviſion and Sub-diviſion of it, every Faction and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who are bold enough to ſtand ſtiff in oppoſition againſt the well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Government. What avails it that he is in his own nature a Frugal
man? he keeps open Houſe for entertainment of all <hi>State Male-Contents;</hi>
without conſideration either of Qualities or Qualifications. And what
is he the better for being Temperate himſelf? So long as he Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and Carrowſes, and contracts Intimacy, and Amity, with the
Lewdeſt Debauchees, that he thinks will help to forward his private
Intriuges. He becomes all things to all men in the very worſt of Senſes;
perverting the deſign of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he may at leaſt delude ſome to be
as bad as himſelf.</p>
            <p>Having loſt his Honour with his Prince, and Reputation with the beſt
of men; he Cringes, and Creeps, and Sneaks, to the loweſt and Baſeſt
of the People; to procure himſelf among them an empty, vain glorious,
and undeſerved name, the <hi>Patriot</hi> of his Country.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, hoping to be made the <hi>Little Head</hi> of the <hi>Great Rabble;</hi>
he perſwades them to believe that they are all betray'd: Encourages
them to ſtrike home againſt the Enemies of King and Kingdom; (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Faithfulleſt and moſt Affectionate Servants to both) well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the <hi>Mighty Fabrick</hi> can never be ſhaken, till its Main Pillars and
and Supporters be by Cunning and Sly Stratagem, either deſtroy'd or
undermined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this may appear the weakneſs of that Modern piece of State Policy;</hi>
Oblige your Enemies, your Friends you are ſure of already: <hi>And the
tranſcendant Wiſdom of</hi> Solomons <hi>advice:</hi> Let thy own Friend and thy
Fathers Friend never be forſaken.</p>
