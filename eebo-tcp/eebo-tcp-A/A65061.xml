            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Moral or Phyſical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that yet never felt the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating,
changing, renewing, reſolving, mortifying,
ſtrengthening, or elevating works of Grace upon their
ſouls, nor were ever brought by it to a Life of Faith,
to an hatred of their moſt ſecret ſins, to a predominant
Love of God, to a ſuperlative eſteem of ſpiritual
things, and to an Heavenly converſation; and that
muſt periſh forever for want of that Grace, (yea for
their contempt and hatred of it) which they verbally
magnified in their preaching and diſputes! If any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in Divinity be practical, and to be read with holy
affection and reſolution, it is this. Remember when
thou readeſt of Grace, that the Reader is one that is
loſt and miſerable till Grace recover him, and muſt be
beholden to Grace to ſave him from everlaſting wo.
Remember that God hath therefore thus wonderfully
revealed himſelf in Love, that appearing moſt Lovely
<pb facs="tcp:53665:5"/>
to us, he may be moſt Loved by us, and all the beams of
his tranſcendent Goodneſs may terminate thus upon
our hearts, and heat them into aſcendent flames of
Love: Read till thou thus Believeſt, and thus Loveſt;
and then thou haſt read well. And I hope thou wilt find
much in theſe Sermons, which may be bellows and
fuel for this holy fire: Though they are not thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Text ſpeaks plainly and fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to the point of mans <hi>Converſion:</hi>
for <hi>coming</hi> in to Chriſt upon his Call
(which is the phraſe uſed in the Text.)
and <hi>Converſion</hi> unto God, differ not but
in ſound of words, which amount unto
one and the ſame meaning.</p>
            <p>The Philoſopher in his Dialect would call this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>
or this <hi>Coming</hi> unto Chriſt, a motion, not local,
from place to place; but tranſitive, from Term to Term:
for there are two Terms of every motion. And
the Evangeliſt, according to Scripture, expreſſes the
terms of this motion diverſly, but denoting the ſame
thing: <hi>From darkneſs to light;</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 26,
18. <hi>And from the power of Satan unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53665:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Deſign that I have in my eye is to Treat of the
point of Converſion, not pretending to accurateneſs and
curioſitie, anxiouſly inquiring after the method or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Gods working; But <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>practically</hi> to
handle this point unto you.</p>
            <p>For as thou knoweſt not what is the way of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or how the bones do grow in the womb of her that
is with Child; ſo thou knoweſt not the works of God,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 5. nor all the particulars of the methods and
wayes wherein God works in the Converſion or Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this New man.</p>
            <p>This Converſion ſometimes denotes the potent and
immediate work of God, renewing and converting; and
this is called in my Text Gods <hi>drawing</hi> of a man to
Chriſt in theſe words, <hi>Except my Father draw him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes it denotes the action of man, converting
himſelf to God, by the Faith and Repentance which he
doth receive from God; and this my Text calls mans
<hi>Coming</hi> unto Chriſt when he is called, in that phraſe, <hi>No
man can come to me except.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In time, theſe two can hardly be diſtinguiſht; but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of cauſality, they are eaſie to be diſtinguiſhed one
from another. I mean Gods work, converting or drawing
man; and mans action, converting and coming unto
Chriſt: The act of man in coming to Chriſt, thats not
firſt; but the work of God drawing in to Chriſt,
that is firſt; and the act of mans coming muſt needs
follow; as the Sun muſt of neceſſitie firſt ſhine upon the
wall, before the wall can give or reflect light or heat from
it ſelf back again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Facti ſumus opus Dei,</hi> We are firſt made the works
or workmanſhip of God; there is Gods drawing. Then
<hi>(Facimus opera Dei)</hi> we do the work of God, or walk
in the works of God which he hath ordained, <hi>that we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53665:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould walk in them,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 10. There is our coming.</p>
            <p>That you may clearly look into every corner of this
Text, you ſhall obſerve here two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the doctrine that is here taught by our Saviour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the reaſon of his teaching it at this time.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine here laid forth conſiſts in theſe three
things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the magnifying of the <hi>work of God</hi> in mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
to raiſe up your praiſes &amp; thankſgivings to God,
by whom you are, what you are: for to his Power and
Grace, our Saviour Chriſt aſſigns the only, or the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
part of it, and thats expreſt in the work of Gods
drawing a man to Chriſt: Therefore this Doctrine is
not ſpoken in a ſimple form; he doth not ſay in plain
words, My Father draws man unto me, but its ſpoken in
an <hi>exceptive</hi> or excluſive form of words excluding mans
power; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, except my Father draws, no man comes
to me: So that without the divine traction there is not
an ability or power in man to come to Jeſus Chriſt; for
he comes not by a power of his own, but my Fathers
drawing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the inſinuating of <hi>mans duty.</hi> For here
your duty is implyed in theſe words, <hi>coming unto Chriſt:</hi>
Your coming unto Chriſt is the great charge or duty
that lies upon you; the obſervation of the Law of
God, and every of his commands, that is duty: But it
is not duty of abſolute neceſſity unto ſalvation; but
coming unto Chriſt is that which is of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
you cannot otherwiſe be ſaved; becauſe this contains
the great condition of the Covenant of life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon which hinge, eternal life doth hang, and the
whole work, not only of your Converſion, but of all
the means that tend to your ſalvation do depend upon,
and are comprehended cauſally and eminently in this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53665:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your coming unto Chriſt, and therefore it is put for all
here, No man can come to me.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the depreſſion of mans pride, or derogation
of mans natural ability to faith in Chriſt, or Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is none of you but think it is an eaſie matter
to believe; that you can believe at pleaſure, its very eaſie
to believe Gods promiſes, God ſpeaking in his word.
Here now is the depreſſion of mans pride as to this
work: No man can.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, No man can come to me: Grace and
Gods power is here exalted; exalted to the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and diminution of mans own ability; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
otherwiſe be: For as the Sun when it ariſes with his
light, blots out the light of the Moon and Stars that
ſhined before; ſo when the Lord Jeſus doth appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and God puts forth his arm to draw you to
Chriſt Jeſus, this act of God doth as it were put down,
diminiſh, diſparage all the pretended ability of man, his
worthineſs, and merit. This is the Doctrine that is here
taught, or the ſum of Chriſts Doctrine in theſe words.
And then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, the reaſon of his now teaching it: (the
hearers of Chriſt they were called Jews; but indeed
were Galileans his Countrymen, that knew his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
about <hi>Capernaum,</hi> near <hi>Nazareth:</hi>) his hearers
were obſerved by him to murmure at this doctrine, as
being very offenſive to their ears and reaſon: For Chriſt
having preacht himſelf quite off thoſe expectations that
the Jews had of him, that he ſhould be a great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Prince, a King, and a great victorious Conqueror,
expectations wherewith they had been prepoſſeſt; and
preacht himſelf to be above that which they ſaw in him,
that he came down from heaven, having preacht ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that was very diſtaſteful to their carnal ears (for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53665:8"/>
doctrine is always hateful to carnal ears) they began
to vent their hidden prejudices againſt him: Say they <hi>v.</hi>
42. <hi>Is not this Jeſus the ſon of Joſeph?</hi> Do not we know
this mans Fathers and Mother? for <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where he
lived, was near to <hi>Capernaum:</hi> how doth he ſay, I came
down from Heaven? what an aſſumption is that? That
he called himſelf bread, is a Metaphorical word, and they
uſed it in their ſpeeches; this troubled them not: But
that he came from Heaven, and nothing appeared in him
to be of Heaven more then other men, this was diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to them. Now our Saviour anſwers theſe prejudices,
and tells them, that it did appear that the preventing
Grace of God had not toucht their hearts, to faſhion
and to mould them unto faith in him; and therefore I
find that your prejudices and carnal reaſons ſtick by you
ſtill, and continue your pride and obſtinacy againſt me,
unto whom indeed no man can come except my Father
draw him. Here is the File of the Connexion of the
words; by this thred the words are to be cut out,
which ſhall ſerve to raiſe a porch or gate of Entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: And therefore I ſhall raiſe thence three Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
            <p>I pray God that none of you may be offended at this
Doctrine: For as I confeſs theſe Jews pretended ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
for the offence they took at Chriſt Jeſus, his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſimplicity: for he was mean and of ſimple ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance:
So this Doctrine may be ſomewhat offenſive
to you, if you bring your own ears to hear it, if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
and preventing grace of God have not already
began to mould and faſhion your hearts to Chriſt Jeſus,
and made you reſolve to ſtick to him through thick and
thin, notwithſtanding all ſcandals and offences that may
appear to be in him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I obſerve <hi>That the Doctrine of Chriſt himſelf
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53665:9"/>
is entertained with diſtaſte and murmuring by prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and corrupt minds, v.</hi> 41, 42, 43. The Jews then
<hi>murmured</hi> at him for his doctrine, &amp;c. <hi>Murmure not
among your ſelves,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Will you take me right
in this word that I am now ſpeaking? Chriſt is the <hi>moſt
ſcandalous</hi> perſon that ever was: I mean fulleſt of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
and offences to corrupt and carnal reaſon and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
His perſon, how mighty ſcandalous! his doctrine
as well as his perſon; his birth very mean; his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
while he lived in this world; the death whereby
he died on the Croſs; the adminiſtrations of the offices
of his Kingdome, as he adminiſters is ſtill, even though
he be in heaven glorious: All of theſe are ſcandalous,
and full of offence unto corrupt reaſon.</p>
            <p>How often hath it been upbraided to Chriſtians, that
they believe in an ignominious and crucified Saviour,
that hung upon the Croſs, which the Apoſtle calls the
<hi>ſcandal of the Croſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſcandalous are the great afflictions that ſit many
times heavy and long upon the Church, as if they had
no deliverer!</p>
            <p>How ſcandalous are the diviſions of the Church, as if
they had not one Saviour and one Lord!</p>
            <p>How ſcandalous to Chriſt are the corrupt and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lives of Chriſtians that profeſs him! He that will be
a Chriſtian indeed, muſt have (as they ſay) a good ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
I mean he muſt ſwallow theſe hard morſels; and
a good digeſtion to digeſt iron, to run through all the
ſcandals that fleſhly reaſon will lay in his way concerning
all things that belong unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Its a good obſervation: A Chriſtian muſt believe in
a <hi>ſtumbling ſtone,</hi> in a <hi>rock of offence,</hi> Rom. 9. 33. <hi>Behold
I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone.</hi> If he had ſaid, I lay a ſtone
of ſafety, a rock of refuge, that had invited faith to come
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53665:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto him: But to ſay, He that will believe in Chriſt,
muſt believe in a rock of offence, in a ſtone of ſtumbling;
this ſeems rather to alienate the faith of man from
Chriſt, to eſtrange and throw faith off. Oh how hard a
thing, is faith in Chriſt! There muſt be ſuch a faith as
may overlook ſo many ſcandalous and offenſive things,
ſo oppoſite to carnal reaſon. Thats the firſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The more Evangelical the Doctrine, and
the ſweeter, the more is the offence, and the greater is
the diſlike of it, ver.</hi> 41. becauſe he ſaid, <hi>I am the bread
that came from heaven;</hi> becauſe he roſe high in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
above what they lookt for in him. And who are
theſe that took offence? Even diſciples, and they that
followed him: They ſay, this is a <hi>hard ſaying;</hi> and they
alſo murmured, nay they take the wing and fly away
and leave him, in the 61, 62, 63. <hi>verſes</hi> of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>Oh Beloved, there are many of the followers of Chriſt
that take offence at this Doctrine; and it is to us even
in our dayes, very ſcandalous to many men; and thats
the reaſon why I inſiſt ſo long upon the Connexion.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt preach himſelf the <hi>Son of God,</hi> that is God:
For I pray let me give you warning once for all, that
the word frequently uſed in the Goſpel, the Son of
God, it means no leſs then God, that Chriſt is God,
God as it were by nature: Its uſed eighty eight times,
as I think, in the New Teſtament: The Son of God is
God as well as man; and therefore the <hi>Socinian</hi> doth
but quibble (as I may ſo ſay) when he comes to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh:
Chriſt indeed is the Son of God (and ſo are we
called too:) But that phraſe doth not imply that he is
God. Yes; for they that heard the words, took it ſo,
in <hi>John</hi> 10. 33, 34, &amp;c. they took up ſtones to throw at
him for his blaſphemy; and that was, In that being
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53665:10"/>
man, thou makeſt thy ſelf God; they took it in a right
meaning.</p>
            <p>The pureſt Goſpel-doctrine is moſt harſh: Chriſts
preaching himſelf the Son of God, was very unpleaſing
to theſe carnal men: We meaſure Goſpel-doctrine by
the metwand of our wit and reaſon, and peradventure
by our learning (which may be of great reach.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are offended. Now let me ſhew you this, that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The great deſign of the Goſpel, is to advance God,
and to lay man low:</hi> And I beſeech you, carry this along
as the great Deſign of the Goſpel, to advance the power
and the grace of God, in bringing men unto ſalvation,
and to lay man, and all their parts and reaſon low: God
in the power and freedome of his grace, ſaving man, is
advanced; man in the power and merit of himſelf is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated
and made nothing: The deſign of the Goſpel,
in giving all to God, is ſeen by one Text: In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1 Chap. laſt ver. <hi>That he that glorieth, may glory in the
Lord;</hi> ſhewing that the main plot of the Goſpel, is the
advancement of Grace; the depreſſion of man, and the
derogation of mans abilities may be ſeen by what is ſaid
in <hi>Rom. 3. 17. Where is boaſting then? It is excluded</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>By what Law? Not by the Law of works, but
by the Law of Faith:</hi> And thats the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
that takes men off from their own bottoms and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
And ſo I think I have ſufficiently proved it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</p>
            <p>Of Goſpel doctrine, that that advances free Grace,
is the moſt glorious to God, the moſt full of admiration
to them that are godly, and yet the moſt obnoxious to
offence and ſcandal of man, to ordinary men of reaſon.</p>
            <p>There are in this Doctrine ſo many offenſive princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
I ſhall inſtance in eight that I know are ſcandalous
and offenſive, and ſtumbling-blocks to reaſon: And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53665:10"/>
much ado we have to leap over them, when we come to
believe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that the purpoſe of Gods Election and Chuſing
any man unto ſalvation, is not founded on the merit
(that was the old word with the Fathers &amp; Schools) we
ſay on the Conditiou of Faith and Works foreſeen; but
that God hath <hi>mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he
hardens.</hi> This is one ſcandalous point, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That before they had done either good or
evil (to ſay before they had actually done it, is a kind of
nonſenſe:) But before they had done it in foreſight or
preſcience; or before they were known or ſeen to do good
or evil: <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> equals, that tumbled both in
one belly, twins that had both one birth; for theſe to be
ſo differenced, that God ſhould ſay, I have loved the
one, and hated the other. This is another point ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and offenſive to mans reaſon, laid down in <hi>Rom.</hi>

and ſeverance of one man from another; that is, the free
grace of God abſtracted from the worthineſs or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
of man: <hi>Who made thee to differ, O man!</hi> ſayes
the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>

that follows after Righteouſneſs by the Law or Works,
did not artain it, or overtake it, as the word ſignifies;
and the Gentiles, or other men that are of no name, that
follow not after righteouſneſs by the Law or Works,
they do attain it, and overtake it by faith in Chriſt. This
is a very hard point, laid down in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 31.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, That a man is not juſtified by the works that
he doth, or his duties, or compliance with the Law; but
by the faith of Chriſt only, whom he layes hold of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offered and freely tendered in the Goſpel. This is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53665:11"/>
Goſpel-doctrine, laid down in <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, That the things of God, that is, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
things of God ſhould be hid from the wise, the prudent

heads ſo high as they do; and that to the poor and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

of the Word, and of them that are called by the
outward Ministery, but very few chosen: (Look upon,
and conſider your ſelves) this is hard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 14.
<hi>There are many called,</hi> and great offers are made in the
Goſpel, <hi>but few choſen and ſelect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, No man can believe, or come to Chriſt,
except it be by the drawing of God. Why ſure this is
a very hard point to the hearers of the Goſpel, that lay
in prejudices and obſtructions of Reaſon. You cannot
believe, except the Lord draw, and work this faith in
you, in <hi>John</hi> 6. 44, 65.</p>
            <p>There are two things that make the doctrine of the
Goſpel ſomething contemptuous tomen.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe it oppoſes mens carnal intereſts. It croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the luſts of the fleſh, and of the world; it brings men
to ſelf-denial.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe it is diſſonant to reaſon, to pride
and ſelf that is in men, and thereby they are prejudiced.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, if God meaſure out his purpoſes and proceedings
by his own ſoveraign will: So that it is not in him that
runs, nor in him that wills, as the Apoſtle hath delivered
it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. but in God that ſhews mercy: Then why
doth God finde fault, or complain of us? why doth he
finde fault with us, that we do not believe, that we ſtand
out in oppoſition? Who can help it? <hi>ver.</hi> 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53665:11"/>
hand lies it in? not ours. This is the great offence,
Who hath refiſted his will? Nay but O man, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.
<hi>Who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi> And then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
goes on to clear the doctrine of free grace, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the method whereby it can be cleared. This ſeems
to me a great ſcandal, whereat men ſtumble.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if God command and require good works
in his holy Word of us, and yet tells me that his election
of me to ſalvation doth not ſtand upon them, but that
the election whereby God hath choſen me to ſalvation,
is firm by his calling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. then if ſo be theſe
works required and commanded will not ſerve my turn,
will not confirm my Election or Juſtification, I may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, and yet not attain righteouſneſs by them, <hi>Rom.</hi>
9. 31. This is a great ſcandal and offence to mans reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if God caſt ſo many of the world off, and
chuſe ſo few of them that are called, but throws them
out as the man that was thrown from the Feaſt, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the wedding garment; This is a miſerable offence.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if God require faith of me and repentance,
call for a new heart and a new ſpirit, and ſaith, Make you
a new heart, and yet teaches me that none can come ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a divine power draw him, except it be given him,
then he requires impoſſible things. And is not this (ſay
ſome) like to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that will have the full tale of
brick, but will not find the people ſtraw.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Theſe are the offences taken by mans reaſon; theſe
raiſe up the murmurings; theſe make ſome men leave
the care of their ſalvation at ſix and ſeven; If I am ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
I ſhall be ſaved; if I am not elected, I cannot:
This makes men throw the plow into the hedge-bottom,
and let the ſhip ride before the ſea and wind.</p>
            <p>Upon all this that I have ſaid, it appears that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſt, and of the free grace of God in Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53665:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an humble heart, a captivated reaſon; or elſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of pride, and the reaſon of man, will trouble the
whole Scene.</p>
            <p>And I may give an inſtance in a point ſo reſented in the
times wherein we live, by our Maſters of Reaſon (as
ſome call themſelves) as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> of old, thoſe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Hereticks called themſelves the knowing men,
who had their oppoſition of Science falſly ſo called,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
            <p>This is it, That Chriſts blood is not a blood of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
or expiation of ſin; that there is no proper
compenſation, nor any ſatisfaction made, or needful to
Divine Juſtice for ſin: How then? God pardons us our
ſins by an abſolute goodneſs, by an abſolute free pardon,
without ſuch ſatisfaction: As a man forgives a delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
without any ſatisfaction; or as a man forgives a
debt another man owes him freely for nothing: And
this is the great Hinge on which the Socinian Doctrine
hangs, which hath leavened and paſs'd through ſo many
men in our times: But this free pardon, without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Gods juſtice, ruines and razes the foundations
of our Chriſtian Faith; as if men would not have Chriſt
to do too much for them, were angry at him for his being
their ſurety, for his paying their debt, and freeing
them from priſon and damnation; which makes me cry
out as the Apoſtle doth in 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 20. Where is the wiſe?
where is the Scribe? where is the Diſputer of this world?</hi>
(Let them take notice of it, the great learned men that
preach Heatheniſm among us) Hath not God made foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the wiſdom of this world? how? by the Doctrine
of Chriſt and free grace. And this I preach, that we
may liſten, and hold the truths that to others are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
overlooking all the ſcandals that may be found in
the perſon and doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>

NOtwithſtanding I am not unſenſible that the free
grace of God may be ſo preacht, or (if you will)
ſo apprehended by you, as it may be not only offenſive to
carnal reaſon, but juſtly offenſive to Faith and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it ſelf: And this is when the doctrine of free grace
keeps not the Channel, but runs out on this ſide or
that ſide, without or beſides its bounds; then indeed
it is juſtly offenſive and ſcandalous; and that may be
in three regards.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when it is made univerſal in extent: For the
freedom of this grace hath no affinity with the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality:
And though many do conceive that they cannot
preach it free, except they do alſo preach it univerſal,
I ſhall, after ſhew, that there is no kindred between
them.</p>
            <p>In the election of any man to ſalvation, it is free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it excludes mans worthineſs or works; and yet its
not univerſal, ſo as all are elected and choſen.</p>
            <p>One calling, I mean that calling that is according to
purpoſe, it is free, not ſtanding upon works: You are
called by Gods grace; and yet tis not univerſal, ſo as
all men are called according to Gods purpoſe. Its free
to ſuch as are called, though it be not common to all:
Was not the grace of God free to <hi>Jacob?</hi> yet not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to him and <hi>Eſau:</hi> It was free to <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet not
common to him and <hi>Judas: To you it is given to know the
myſtery of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> there is the freedom;
to others it is not given, there is a denial of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality,
<hi>Maith.</hi> 13. 11. And therefore we muſt diſtinguiſh
between the offer of free grace, and the effects of it:
grace in the offer of it may be common, and in a ſort uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
but in the effects you ſhall always obſerve grace to
be of a differencing nature; it diſcriminates and makes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53665:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
difference between one and another in ſalvation, and
therein is the glory of it; and reaſon will ſhew, that ſo
far as it differences one from another, it is not univerſal:
for that which differences, cannot be univerſal; the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hath obtained, and the reſt were hardeued, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>It is indeed offenſive when it opens, or is made
to open a window to looſeneſs of opinion, or profaneneſs of
life:</hi> That makes it rather to be called looſe grace then
free grace: for free grace truly preacht, neither takes
off the bridle of reſtraint of ſin, nor the ſpur of excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of holineſs from Gods Law; theſe two muſt ſtand
together: Sin is reſtained by the Law of God, there's
the bridle; and then its a ſpur and incentive to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<hi>Shall we ſin</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>becauſe we are not
under the Law but under Grace? God forbid.</hi> Rom. 6. 15.
Again, <hi>Shall we ſin that Grace may abound?</hi> Rom. 6. 1.
No, we may not make the doctrine of Gods free grace
a Pander, or a Porter, to let in or open us the gate more
freely to ſin againſt him: And the reaſon is excellent
good; there is no greater and ſweeter obligation obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
man to thankfulneſs and obedience, then this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of free grace: The ſenſe of this free grace (I ſay)
is the moſt obliging and indearing of the heart to God,
of any doctrine that can be preacht; ſo contrary is it
from being a looſener of thoſe bands whereby we are
tyed to God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>it is not rightly preached when it is made to deny
to man all agency in Converſion, as well as all power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is converted:</hi> For the act of faith, and repentance,
and obedience, is mans act; and therefore thoſe that
poyſon us with this doctrine, Chriſt believes for me,
and repents for me, tell us a ridiculous piece of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe:
No, it is you that muſt repent, and believe, and
act obedience: for common reaſon will ſhew you, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53665:13"/>
ſenſe, it is not the Sun that ſees; for that which ſees is
the eye; the Sun only gives light, without which the
eye cannot ſee: And ſo we muſt diſtinguiſh between the
power and the act; God draws man to Chriſt Jeſus,
the power is of him; but coming to Chriſt, or the act
of Converſion, that is mans; the power is Chriſts, the
duty is yours: And therefore, though this doctrine be
never ſo offenſive, yet it ſeems God puts his greateſt
glory in that which is moſt offenſive to mans reaſon. In
the 33. of <hi>Exod. 19. ver. I will make all my goodneſs to
paſs before thee, and I will proclame the name of the Lord.</hi>
And what is that Proclamation? that doctrine that is
conceived to be ſo ſcandalous? <hi>I will be gracious to whom
I will be gracious, and ſhew mercy to whom I will:</hi> Which
the Apoſtle inſiſts upon in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. where this point is
agitated. Thats the ſecond Obſervation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for the ſilencing of theſe murmurers at
Chriſt in the verſe before the Text, Chriſt gives the
cloſe reaſon of mans believing in him, and mans not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in him, a cloſer reaſon, then they were aware of:
The reaſon he gives is this, <hi>That thoſe that God draws to
Chriſt, they come to him,</hi> ver. 44. And <hi>every man that
hath heard and learnt of the Father, comes to me,</hi> ver. 45.
There is the teaching of God called the drawing of God,
and perſwading the mind of man; which whoever hath,
believes and comes to Chriſt Jeſus; and every man
that is not thus drawn, is left unto himſelf, is left under
his own diſability, and ſo he cannot come: For <hi>no man
can come to me except the Father draw him.</hi> Mans impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
is alledged on the one hand, and Gods drawing
is alledged on the other hand; and though there might
be great objections made againſt it, yet our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
upon this cloſe doctrine, <hi>Joh. 10. 26, 27. You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, becauſe you are not of my ſheep.</hi> Many other
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53665:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reaſons might be given, but he comes unto the bottom;
<hi>Becauſe you are not called, becauſe you are not of my ſheep
by the election of God.</hi> And ſo again in <hi>Joh. 6. 37. All
that the Father hath given to me, ſhall come to me:</hi> You
that are not of my ſheep, do not believe, therefore you
do not come: And he ſets it forth again, <hi>ver.</hi> 65. of
this Chapter, <hi>No man can come to me, except it be given him
of my Father.</hi> Theſe are ſtrange reaſons, will reaſon ſay,
and rather apt to give offence, then to take it off; rather
apt to breed murmurings, then to qualifie and allay
them. And its true, had Chriſt encouraged mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
abilities, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lattered them, he ſhould have pleaſed
the corrupt and carnal reaſon of man: for without all
queſtion, that which moſt flatters ſelf and carnal reaſon,
is moſt acceptable with you: But ſo doth not he; for
he aſſerts that God muſt draw and give faith: This
gives all to Chriſt, and aſſumes all the glory out of
your hands to God; whereby you may gather, that
thoſe that are not of the ſheep of Chriſt, are not drawn;
thoſe that are not of the ſheep of Chriſt by Gods election,
they are not drawn to Chriſt by Gods operation. This is
that which reaſon ſtumbles, and is offended at. And</p>
            <p>How ſhall this offence that reaſon may take at the
proceeding of God in this point, be cured? No way
that I know in the world but this, by laying down the
waſters and the cudgels; not diſputing with; and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at God, but humbly waiting on that hand which
of neceſſity muſt work faith in you, and convert you
to this grace: And that all unconverted perſons may do
ſo, know it for a Maxime, or a rule, for ſo I take it to
be, that God hath taken the beſt and the ſureſt way, the
moſt infallible that can be in the world, to ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
which I thus illuſtrate: Had the ſalvation of man
been left to his own power, as ſome would have it, it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53665:14"/>
had been deſperate and hopeleſs to all men, even to the
beſt man in the world: But now this powerful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
God hath reſerved it in his own power; for all
thoſe that are ſaved, are ſaved by this power, and this
grace: And now in this way of ſalvation ſome are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
ſome are in the way that God hath ſet for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man to Chriſt Jeſus; for if God had ſet forth Chriſt,
and cauſed him to be preacht to you; yea if Chriſt
ſhould have ſhed his blood to have redeemed you, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, it had been poſſible that not a man
in the world might have been ſaved without this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
drawing of God, and this hand of God, whereby
he brings ſome men unto ſalvation: And ſo now ſome
are ſaved, and ſo are obliged to greater admiration and
thankfulneſs to this God, then all the world beſides are
obliged to him, for this differencing grace whereby he
brought them unto Chriſt; otherwiſe, if he had left it
to you to believe in Chriſt Jeſus, I cannot conceive how
any one man in the world had been ſaved, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Redemption laid down, and the Atonement
made; which is a rare point, and worthy of all ſerious
diſquiſition and proof: And I would I could convince
men thereof, that if it had been as they would have it,
there would not a man on earth be ſaved. In the mean
time let this paſs for a proof; That which never was yet
in the world, may rationally be preſumed will never be:
That hitherto no man hath attained to faith, no man
hath come to Chriſt by the meer uſe of his own natural
abilities and power, without the working of this divine
grace, which all that partake of, have magnified and
bleſſed God for: We know of none, we read of none
in the Scripture, that have had this wrought in them,
but have returned the glory of it to God: But becauſe
we do not find that it ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> hath been, we may conclude
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53665:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it ſhall never be; that without this drawing of God
any man can come to believe in Chriſt Jeſus, if it were
left to their natural abilities and capacities. Be they as
they think them to be, never ſo great and valuable, all
this is but premiſſary to the Doctrines in the Text.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of theſe Doctrines of Connexion altogether
ſhall be threefold.</p>

you ſhall find that many of the hearers of this doctrine

for the Text tells you, <hi>No man can come to me

and a captivated reaſon: And therefore, though the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
received from Jeſus Chriſt be very great, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man will witneſs that Chriſt is worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to ſave the chiefeſt of ſinners; yet when they come
to look upon his perſon throughly, and conſider what
may be ſaid againſt him, as well as what is ſaid for him,
and the courſe and tenour of his doctrine, that hath it in
ſo many ſtumbling-blocks, that may give diſtate; its
great odds, that you would never have come in unto him,
were there not put forth in you a divine hand, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
to draw you.</p>
            <p>A famous inſtance we have of this in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 5.
when <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſent his diſciples to Chriſt, to know
whether he was he; not that I believe <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of it; for he was in priſon, and now ready to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
why (ſaith Chriſt) tell <hi>John</hi> what you ſee, the
ſick are healed, the lame walk, and all ſorts are cured;
very good things, ſuch as no man could be offended at:
and then he adds, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall not be offended in
me,</hi> ver. 6. as if he had ſaid, as there are many things in
me, and in my doctrine, that draw men to me, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
crowd after me, becauſe I heal, cure, and relieve
them; ſo there are others of hard digeſtion, that may
by their offenſiveneſs to mens reaſon drive them from
me.</p>
            <p>So it was in this Chapter: His diſciples that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, began to take offence, and to cry out of hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>ver.</hi> 60, 61. and then preſently go away, and walk
no more with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 66.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> Laſtly, learn from hence: <hi>A man obſtructs his faith,
when he conſiders too much the appearance of inconſiſtencies
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53665:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his reaſon and ſenſe to faith in Chriſt.</hi> As theſe <hi>Galilae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
Countrymen of Chriſts, that knew his parentage
and outward quality, fell a murmuring at his doctrine,
that he came down from Heaven; for their eyes were
all on thoſe things that they thought inconſiſtent to his
coming from Heaven; they could not ſtand with them,
and ſo obſtructed their faith: Whereupon he ſaith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
God draw men out of their inconſiſtencies, no man
can come to me: A man may follow his own reaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an abſolute unbelief, and Atheiſm; not that Scripture
or divine Reaſon is to be rejected; I do not ſpeak to that
point: But I ſpeak to that natural reaſon that is taken
up from other grounds, and not weighed in the ballance
of the Word: Faith believes God, though reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
him not; there is no reaſon that I ſhould have
my reaſon ſatisfied in the point of eternal ſalvation by
free grace, but that I ſhould have a clear word of God,
that I conceive neceſſary: That God promiſes ſo or ſo,
that I muſt needs have as the object of my faith; but
that I ſhould have my reaſon ſatisfied before I believe,
I know no reaſon of that: Take it either in the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
part of faith, or the promiſſory part: God promiſed
<hi>Abraham</hi> a ſon in the old age of him and his wife, when
he did not expect ſuch a thing; did he ſay, Shew me
how that can be now I am old? No, he did believe that
he was able to perform; he received the word which he
believed.—Theſe people reaſoned themſelves into
an abſolute unbelief; they conſidered the means of
Chriſt, what they ſaw in him; but the excellency of
Chriſt, that he came from Heaven, the Son of God, the
Saviour and Redeemer, they believed not.</p>
            <p>And therefore let me from that obſerve a notable leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
A man that will believe firmly, let him look upon
the excellency of Chriſt Jeſus, not on that which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53665:17"/>
and ſcandalous to our reaſon: It was excellent
doctrine, that he was bread from Heaven; ſomewhat
more then <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſon: Look upon the excellencies of
Chriſt Jeſus, the ſatisfaction that he hath made for you
by his blood, the acceptation of that ſatisfaction by God
the Father, and thoſe things that are excellent; and in
this doctrine of free grace look well on the Soveraignty
of God, for he hath mercy on whom he will; that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
the reaſon of man: And ſo you may believe for
the words ſake that is delivered unto you; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is commended to you by ſence and reaſon. This
that hath been delivered, is but the preamble, yet ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that it could not well be omitted.</p>

divided into three parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the aſſignment of the power by which man
comes to Chriſt, unto divine drawing. <hi>Except my Father
draw him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the inſinuation of mans duty, which is
coming unto Chriſt, which is not like the duties of the
Law, which yet we are all bound unto; for the Law is
a Law of duty: But this is a Goſpel-duty, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
the great condition of ſalvation; the great conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Covenant upon which God will ſave mankind,
is, that they believe in, and come unto Chriſt Jeſus, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in theſe words, <hi>No man can come to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; the depreſſion of mans pride, or derogation
of mans power and natural abilities in theſe words, <hi>No
man can,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the three points that may profitably be
handled out of theſe words. The laſt of theſe points
firſt comes to hand in the order of the Text, which is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53665:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label>
No man by ſelf-power, or ſelf-ability, can convert himſelf,
or come in to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That I might not go far to prove the point, therefore
I give it you in the words of the Text it ſelf:</p>
            <p>Which ſhews unto all men univerſally, that what is
of greateſt neceſſity to mans ſalvation, and tends to his
greateſt happineſs, which is to come to Chriſt, and ſo
conſequently to be ſaved; unto that, he is impotent and
without ſtrength.</p>
            <p>So that the Perſon upon whom we are to diſcourſe, is
not a man already in grace, but a man in a ſtate of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.
The Subject of our diſcourſe hath three
characters given of him together, <hi>Rom. 5. 6, 8, 10. While
we were without ſtrength, while we were yet ſinners, while
or when we were enemies:</hi> Man thus qualified, or rather
unqualified, may be, and is, a capable ſubject of divine
traction or operation. So that obſerve,</p>
            <p>No man in himſelf, while he lies in a ſtate of fin, an
impotent eſtate, without ſtrength, is a cauſe firſt moving
himſelf to his own converſion. And ſecondly, he can
be no cauſe moving God by any of his worthineſs or
works to convert him: He moves not himſelf; for he
is without ſtrength; and he moves not God; for he is a
ſinner and enemy to God; and ſo conſequently he
moves not to his own converſion &amp; ſalvation either way;
either by way of power, ſtirring up himſelf, or by way of
merit and deſert, ſtirring up God to move him.</p>
            <p>This point ſhall be opened from three particulars. The
three particulars are,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the greatneſs of the work it ſelf, to come to
Chriſt, that is, to believe in him, as you may ſee in the 35
verſe, and other verſes of this Chapter: The greatneſs
of the work manifeſts that no man can.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the impotency or diſability of man towards
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53665:18"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the oppoſition and reſiſtance that natural
man makes againſt it to the utmoſt of his power: And
ſure he that conſiders theſe three particulars, will grant
that no man can come, except it be by a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then his own, and ſo conſequently that the Doctrine
is concluded and proved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the greatneſs of the work it ſelf. Lift up your
ears, that you may lift up your thankſgivings and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
Attend to the greatneſs of the work of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and believing in Chriſt, that you may magnifie and
exalt it according to its worth: The greatneſs of the
work properly leads us to the main point, to ſhew the
imparity and impotency of man: For as the greatneſs of
the Heavens that are over our heads, doth diminiſh the
earth thats under our feet, and is the reaſon that its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>punctum,</hi> a little point; ſo you may rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the greatneſs of this work of mans converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
doth eaſily and rationally diminiſh the power and
ability of man unto it, and makes it nothing.—And
the work is great in three regards.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in reſpect of the change it ſelf that is wrought
upon every man that comes to God, which is expreſt in
Scripture by terms of the greateſt diſtance that can be,
from darkneſs to light; a great change.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in reſpect of the power required for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
it; which is the drawing of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of the concernment of it unto
mans eternal happineſs and ſalvation: For except you
be converted and thus drawn to the Lord Jeſus, there is
no hope of ſalvation for you: And therefore in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
18. laſt <hi>ver. Wherefore turn and live ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatneſs of the work of mans converſion, may
be eſtimated and proved to you,</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the names that are given unto it: It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53665:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Creation, a Reſuſcitation of the dead, a beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a new Man, or a new Creature, or Regeneration.
Now mark how great a work that muſt be: And though
I confeſs that every ſimilitude muſt not ſo be ſtretcht
and urged, as to make it run of all four (which is but a
kind of trifling preaching of Divinity) yet we may preſs
the ſcope of Scripture: Similitudes may be preacht out
of Gods Word, according to the ſcope wherein the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
holds; which hereby intimates a great work,
which no man can work upon himſelf, but is wrought by
a divine hand (<hi>non ſine novitate eſſendi</hi>) not without a
newneſs of being, as they uſe to ſpeak. Creation is ſuch
a work as brings forth a newneſs of being, whereby that
which is now made was not before.</p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary (I think) to this work of Creation,
that it ſhould preſuppoſe a total non-entity, or a not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be before it: For <hi>Eve,</hi> the firſt woman, formed
of a rib, yet may properly be ſaid to be created; yet crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may extend ſo far as to ſignifie a producing of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of nothing: For God when he made the
world, made the creatures <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of the things
<hi>Heb. 11. 3. ver.</hi> that did not appear: And when he
converts, he chuſes things that are not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 28.
that is, that were not ſuch as they are made, that have
not that exiſtence as is given to them afterwards.</p>
            <p>The Artificer and Workman requires and preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the matter that he works upon; he doth not make
the matter, and therefore is not the cauſe <hi>totius entis,</hi> as
the Schoolmen uſe to ſay, of the whole thing: But God
can, ſuch is his omnipotency, call all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
elſe, I aſſert <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> matter co-eternal with God, which
I ſhould not do. God requires not in his call that the
matter be ſitted to his hand, he creates us of nothing;
<hi>For we are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Eph.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53665:19"/>
10. And that you may ſee there is nothing in the work
of man that gives any being and riſe to Converſion and
Regeneration, you may note that it is ſo wrought in us, as
it is compared to that which was brought forth at firſt
out of nothing, in 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. Whereas in the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there was darkneſs, and then light was called out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by the word of Gods command:</hi> So ſaith the Apoſtle.
God commands light to ſhine out of darkneſs in every
one that is converted to him; he brings him into a ſtate
of light and knowledge out of juſt nothing, as the light
was at firſt commanded to ſhine out of darkneſs, having
no pre-exiſtency in the darkneſs as any ſeed of light. I
know this is <hi>quotidianum argumentum,</hi> an every days ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and therefore I will go on to the next;</p>
            <p>Which ſignifies the greatneſs of this work; a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
or Reſuſcitation on mans part, and paſſively; a
reſurrection on Gods part; and actively a raiſing of
them that are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a quickening of men together with Chriſt that were
dead before; which clearly reſembles it to a miraculous
work: For ſuch is the raiſing of the dead: Were not they
miracles whereby Chriſt raiſed the dead? And though
I confeſs the ſimilitude between natural and ſpiritual
death is not to be ſqueezed into impertinencies; yet I
ſay that thoſe that ſhall make natural man to be as it
were ſick and wounded, and only in fetters, and not
ſtark dead in ſpirituals, they wrong the grace of God,
whereby man is converted; and as the ſaying is, that
which gains in one part, loſes in another; ſo look where
man gains in this point, God loſes: They take from
God the eminency of his power, ſo much as they give
to man, and ſo enrich man by robbery of God himſelf,
and ſo make it a leſs work then indeed it is; it being a
leſs work and wonder to heal a ſick, then to raiſe a dead
man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53665:19"/>
That word Regeneration, or ſecond Birth, doth alſo
denote the gracious act of Gods great power, whereby
he brings man into a new eſtate: for generation even in
nature, if it be but of a chicken out of an egg, it is full
of admiration, and worthy to be the object of the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the learnedſt men: And therefore what ſhall we
think of Regeneration, of this ſecond Birth, as its called?
which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 3 wondred and marvelled
what it ſhould be; why ſhould not we think this to be
a great work, which is ſaid <hi>not to be of blood, nor of the
will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> 1 John
13. And our Saviour ſhews (me thinks) a natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> like it ſelf; for
the fleſh can beget nothing to the ſpirit: <hi>And that which
is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit;</hi> the ſpirit begets not to the
fleſh, nor the fleſh unto the ſpirit, but every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
unto its like, <hi>John</hi> 3. 6. And therefore if this be
ſo, Regeneration muſt be a great work. Thats my firſt
Argument, from the titles that are given unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the greatneſs of the work is manifeſted by
the greatneſs of the change wrought in them that are
converted: Lay your hearts unto the marks and note;
for every man converted is changed from contrary to
contrary, from death to life, from darkneſs to light, from
the remoteſt terms that can be, ſelf and God:</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: For man exalts ſelf, and hates and oppoſes
God. Now this man ſhall be changed from ſelf to God;
<hi>Be ye met amorphoſed,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>be ye changed in the
ſpirit of your minds,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. Now look by way of
compariſon; for we may well compare Scripture things
with Scripture: As the reſurrection of the body is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a change of that body that riſes into a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and incorruptible body: <hi>He ſhall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that it ſhall be like unto his glorious body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53665:20"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53665:20"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53665:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So the reſurrection of the ſoul is accompanied with a
mighty change of natural diſpoſition, and of thoſe habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
principles of luſt and corruption, which had firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
root, and haply by time, cuſtome, and education,
more fixt in you: Rooted they are naturally; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when you come to be changed in theſe, do not you
think as great a change follows in this reſurrection as on
the reſurrectection of the body? Nothing makes ſo
great a change as this converting grace, whereby God
draws man to Chriſt Jeſus. The moral Philoſopher
teaches vertue, &amp; excellently, to appalliate the nature of
man; for indeed he can teach no further: that is, he can
teach amendment of vice by vertue; but they know not
the meaning of thoſe Scripture-words, Creation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
Regeneration; theſe they are very great
ſtrangers unto; emendation of life is all they ſpeak of.
<hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his ſecond Apology, ſhews what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
change was wrought in them that were religious,
in them that were called: In his time the people did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, the libidinous are chaſte, the drunkards made ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the worldlings that had great eſtates, and were
tenacious, hard enough, ſell their eſtates, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to them that were converted with them; and ſo
goes on, to ſhew, as the Scripture ſpeaks, the profeſſors
of Magical Arts, and ſuch ungodly Impoſtures, ſold
and made away their books; and <hi>Paul,</hi> that had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the faith, preacht it: We preach men not only out
of ſin, but out of vertue; for Converſion is a change
extended thus far, as bringing man into grace, and unto
Chriſt: Our Saviour called the young Ruler beyond
the vertue that he profeſſed: <hi>Follow me,</hi> ſaith he. Oh
beloved, to come to Chriſt Jeſus, and to be converted
by ſpiritual grace, is beyond all the vertue that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs:
And therefore we preach men not only out of vice
but vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53665:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nothing lies nearer our ſelf-love, then our lands and
houſes, right hands, right eyes, and the like; yet Chriſt
calls men to the loſs of theſe, and he calls to no more
then grace enables eaſily to perform: The greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of ſpiritual grace in any man, is over ſelf-love and
ſelf-ſeeking; and therefore for a man to deny himſelf
in any caſe that is for the excellency of Chriſt, is the
greateſt change that can be wrought in any man: For a
man to deny himſelf upon a force, is nothing; but to do
it out of ſympathy, is much: As we find this change de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6. where you muſt allow to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſuch expreſſions: <hi>The wolf and the lamb ſhall dwell
together; the leopard and the kid; the calf and the lyon.</hi>
You muſt not think this is to be underſtood of wilde
beaſts, but of wilde men, whoſe diſpoſitions being quite
contrary, they ſhall be reconciled to agree: And the
reaſon is given, <hi>verſe 9. The earth ſhall be full of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Lord.</hi> This knowledge of Chriſt, whereby
men are turned to God, is the great thing that changes
natures, alters properties; even as that is altered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the kid and the leopard. Thats the ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the greatneſs of the power that works unto
faith in Chriſt, that magnifies the work. When Chriſt
caſt out Devils, and healed all manner of diſeaſes among
the people while he lived upon the earth, did he not put
the world into admiration and aſtoniſhment? yet this
work of Converſion, to bring ſinful ſouls to God, to
pull them out of darkneſs, and the damnable ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they lay, this Chriſt makes a greater work, in <hi>John</hi>
14. 12. where he ſaith, <hi>He that believeth in me, ſhall do
the miracles and the works that I do; and greater works
then theſe ſhall be do when I go to the Father.</hi> When I go
to ſend the Holy Ghoſt from the Father unto the world,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53665:22"/>
what greater works can there be? It cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
explained then the Ancients downard from <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen:</hi>
The converſion of the world, of the Gentil world
from Heatheniſm, and Idolatry, and Devilliſm, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to Chriſt; becauſe they work ſuch great converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to turn men from darkneſs and Idolatry, theſe are
greater works then Chriſt himſelf did, becauſe he did
not convert ſo many as they: This is the Hyperbole of
Gods power towards them that believe; this is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his mighty power: There is never a verſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
it in ſo full words as that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19. ſpeaking of
the power that he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him
from the dead, <hi>This power wrought in you when you belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
Read this verſe, and conſider it well, I think you
will never hereafter look upon it as an eaſie thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the exceeding greatneſs of power. Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
obſerve there is an aggravation; the raiſing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whereby Chriſt roſe, was a great power; he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all the ſins of mankind; the greateſt ſtone lay upon
his grave that ever man had; every man lay dead to his
his own ſins: Chriſt lay under all the ſins of mankind
in their full weight; That which went to raiſe Chriſt,
and to roll away the ſtone, was a mighty power indeed;
and the ſame is put out in you, whereby you are called
out of darkneſs into light, and from a natural ſtate to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, this is compared to ſuch works as ſeem to
us, and are to mans power impoſſible to be done: As
to the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> his changing of his skin, the leopard
putting off his ſpots; <hi>The Blackmoor cannet change his
skin, nor the leopard put off his ſpots,</hi> Jer. 13. 23. When
they can do ſo, then may you that are wicked and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to ſin, change and turn to God. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſtance in <hi>Luke 18. 25. Can a Camel go through the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53665:22"/>
eye of a needle?</hi> no more can a man that truſts in riches,
a worldly man, believe or repent; which are expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſo great a height, that we may well conclude the
greatneſs of the work.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, this is a work to which Chriſt is required,
and wherein he muſt appear both ſatisfying and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for unleſs he appear in both, there can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
wrought on any man; he muſt come by water
and by blood, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 6. The ſatisfaction of Chriſt,
thats the taking away ſin by his blood: And therefore
in <hi>John 12. 32. If I be lifted up, I will draw all men to me,</hi>
here is another drawing: There is Gods drawing by
power, and Chriſts drawing by his being lifted up, by
his meritorious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ppearing to ſatisfie juſtice. In the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the world there was no need of a ſatisfying and
ſanctifying Chriſt to appear: Its true indeed, Chriſt as
God, and the Son of God, did appear; for by him the
worlds were made, but as Mediator there was no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Chriſt: But now, if he will convert a ſinner,
and bring one of you home to God, out of darkneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
light, here muſt Chriſt as Mediator appear. Oh that
men would admire the greatneſs of this work!</p>
            <p>The Uſe of this part ſhall be twofold.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> The greatneſs of this work ſhews the reaſon of thoſe
ſayings of Divines (which were uſed by the Fathers of
the Church in former times) <hi>That the Church of God hath
ſtill her miracles, and is not deprived of that gift.</hi> Men
may ſay that miracles are put down and ceaſed; but the
Church of God hath running and abiding in it the gift
of miracles. Why ſo? Becauſe God by the Miniſtry
of the Word works after a wonderful and miraculous
manner in the hearts of men, to bring them out of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and ſelf-vanity. The raiſing of the Widows ſon
from death to life, that we read of in the Goſpel; and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53665:23"/>
the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that was four dayes dead in the
grave; theſe were great works: But if you compare the
converſion of ſinners with them, it is a greater work.
When Chriſt raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> its ſaid, <hi>that he groaned in
ſpirit;</hi> that put him to his groans: But when he came
to redeem man, that put him to his bloodſhed: And
therefore on the ſudden to change the heart of man from
hating God, as every natural man doth, to love God;
from perſecuting the truth, to die for it; from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
poſſeſt by Satan, to follow the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:
I would have men to conſider it, that they may come
with thankſgiving to the Table of the Lord. And what
faith a reverend Divine that is now with God,<note place="margin">Hilderſham.</note> 
               <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is the greateſt Miracle that ever God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ought.</hi> And it
is to be compared to the Creation of the world, ſaith
another,<note place="margin">Perkins.</note> and gives this reaſon: The Spirit of God ſeems
to make it a greater work: To the creation of the world
nothing was required but the word of God; but to the
converſion of a ſinner, the arm of the Lord; alluding to
<hi>Luke 2. the arm of the Lord;</hi> and to <hi>Iſa. 53. 1. To whom
is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> And certainly there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the moſt grace in it, and a power above any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
It is the aſſiduity and commonneſs of the work,
not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lightneſs and facility (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) that takes
off the wonder of it: The commonneſs of the Suns
light makes it not ſo much regarded, becauſe it is day;
thoſe men that have felt the power of God in their own
ſpirits, they know it is a wonder. In the Goſpel it was
a Miracle to turn water into wine; and is it nothing to
change a filthy ſwine into a ſheep, and darkneſs into
light? The creatures at firſt were made by the Word
of God; but this Converſion is cauſed by the arm of
God,<note place="margin">Origen.</note> ſaith one. It hath been Hyperbolically ſpoken of
by the Ancients that lived in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> as

he works from Heaven, exceeding thoſe on earth upon

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>4</label> THe ſecond Point is to ſhew the impotency and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity
of natural man, of his own ſtrength ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to believe or convert himſelf. It is ſaid (which I
would have obſerved) in <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>you will not

               </gap> 
               <hi>how can you believe?</hi> you will not,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53665:24"/>
you cannot. What do you gather from theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions?
You may very well collect that this cannot
is a moral impotency; and a moral impotency, as learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men do know, differs very little from an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
you cannot believe, becauſe you will not, being
diſabled by ſuch worldly and carnal luſts and prejudices,
as do foreſtall and take up your hearts, and make it juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be ſaid you cannot. The reaſon why I compare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
theſe two verſes, <hi>you will not come to me, and ye
cannot believe,</hi> is to ſhew what manner of impotency
Chriſt points us to in this matter: namely,</p>
            <p>Not a meer and ſimple impotency, that is without our
default, but a moral and culpable impotency, whereby
the heart is captivated by ſome luſt, or forelaid with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
againſt Chriſt, ſo as we cannot, becauſe we will
not come to him: And of this impotency, let me ſay
this to you at the firſt; it takes away all excuſe, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
and the more impotent, the worſe: who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
his blindneſs, that hath purpoſely put out his eyes?
yea though it be reſembled in Scripture to a ſimple im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility,
yet it is moral and culpable. <hi>Can the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
change his skin?</hi> Jer. 13. 23. then may you that
are accuſtomed to do evil, learn to do well. it is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
impotency, the fault whereof may be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, ſuch as for which you ſtand culpable before
God.</p>
            <p>This impotency of man to convert or come to Chriſt,
I ſpeak unto in this branch, and mans unwillingneſs in
the next: And ſo ye ſhall have both the cannot and the
will not.</p>
            <p>There is an impotency in man, and a diſability to come
in to Chriſt, and act to his own converſion: Theſe are
the ſame things; but in the handling of this point, I may
ſometimes name the one, and not the other, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53665:24"/>
Man in his integrity (for truly the eſtate of mans cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
integrity hath, as I conceive, a mighty influence into
all Divinity) man in that eſtate had a <hi>poſſe velle</hi> to obey
God a power to love and to keep communion with God:
An abſolute <hi>velle</hi> was not determined; but he had a
power; and therefore men that are under the fall (as all
men are) muſt needs acknowledge they have loſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
by it; we have loſt the power to will, which he
had; nay ſome ſay, that if there were a power of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Chriſt, and of converſion in lapſed man, he
ſhould ſeem to have a greater power then <hi>Adam:</hi> As
the power to riſe again from the dead, is greater then to
act life when a man is alive. I hold it to be but a trifling
objection, which is made upon deſign; and this is the
deſign upon which it is made: (for clearly to know
the reaſon of any thing, is to know the thing it ſelf) to
oblige God by vertue of his Covenant with man fallen,
to give forth univerſal grace, becauſe this faith in Chriſt,
this repentance, were not loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> who could
not loſe that which he had not; neither are we to pay
for that we took not up in him: Therefore God is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to give to man a power to believe; becauſe he hath
made a new Covenant with me, he is bound to enable
me to be reſponſible to the Covenant that he hath
made.</p>
            <p>This Objection amounts to no more but this, That
<hi>Adam</hi> could not exerciſe faith in Chriſt, nor the grace of
repentance; I grant it, there was no need of it; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
very true; for that ſuppoſes a deviation and a
fall: If man ſay, he could not look to the Serpent on the
pole: I anſwer, true, becauſe neither had the fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
ſtung, nor was the Serpent ſet upon the pole to heal
them that were ſtung, before the inſtitution of God had
taken place. <hi>Adam</hi> did not exerciſe obedience to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53665:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fifth commandement, and yet you account it one of the
moral commands; for he had no Parents and Superiors
to honour: Very true; but there was a root of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
a root of faith in God, and love of God; there was
the image of God, from whence, if occaſion had been,
grace might have budded forth: But to argue from the
not-exerciſing, to the not having of grace, is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
There was a ſeminal in <hi>Adam,</hi> of which there is
none left in man; the root of holineſs, the principles of
faith, theſe are loſt: Nor are there any ſeminals left in
man, out of which faith can be educed, as forms are edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of the fitneſs of the matter: The Scripture
ſeems to ſpeak punctually to the point, <hi>No man can
come to me,</hi> John 6. 44. The natural, or animal man, by
the light of his intellectual perception, cannot know the
things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. The wiſdom or ſenſe of
the fleſh is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can be,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. They that are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. We are not ſufficient, that is, not impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2, 3. And this is enough to prove this point of mans
impotency and diſability: Which ſhall be handled in
two members.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> No man can by his natural power convert and turn
to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>No man can come to Chriſt, or believe in him.</hi>
They are both one; but for order ſake we ſpeak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
            <p>Its true, we are commanded to turn, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.
<hi>ver. ult. Wherefore turn and live.</hi> And in another place,
<hi>Make you a new heart and a new ſpirit:</hi> Becauſe that is
our duty, and the condition of the covenant of life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us. The great condition is, <hi>Turn and live; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt Jeſus, and be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ved:</hi> This is clear, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53665:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is no queſtion againſt it: But yet we are turned
before we turn, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. Turn thou me, and I ſhall be
turned; and I will make you a new heart; and I the Lord
will circumciſe thy heart:</hi> For God makes good to his
people, not only the benefits and promiſes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
but the graces and conditions that are required;
he undertakes for grace as well as for the promiſe; which
is one of the greateſt points, and main hinge of Divinity:
The deſign and plot of God in the Goſpel, being to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
the glory of his grace (having paſt by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
that ſinned, and leaving them without excuſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
redemption) very well. Now then ſay I, there is
no point that ſerves better to that end, then the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of mans pride and power, by that impotency and
diſability that is in man to that which is ſaving: God by
this magnifies the freeneſs of his grace, that takes this
work to his own power: So that the concluſion will be,
mans fooliſhneſs doth magnifie Gods wiſdom; our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
illuſtrates his freedom, our poverty his rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
our captivity his redemption, and the enmity of man
to God, his reconciliation: So that as in travelling by
ſea or land, the more you raiſe one of the poles, the more
you depreſs the other; and the higher one riſes to your
eye, the lower the other ſinks to your Horiſon: So the
ſame degree you raiſe man in worthineſs or ability, you
lay low the grace of God, and take it down from its due
elevation: The more you illuſtrate the free grace of
God, the more you derogate from the power and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of man. And therefore you may conclude there is
no point or way ſerves more to the illuſtration of Gods
grace, then the depreſſion of the pride and power of
man.</p>
            <p>To go on, I muſt a little make a diſtinction. No man
can deny God to be the working or productive cauſe of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53665:26"/>
grace, but muſt ſome way or other exalt himſelf: But
I know very few men, nay not excepting <hi>Pelagius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that doth or hath denied God to be the working
or productive cauſe of grace in us: But they ſufficiently
depreſs the grace of God, that will allow man the ſhare
of a meritorious or procuring cauſe to obtain it, or ſome
way or other to procure it of God: For that is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the freeneſs of it, as any thing can be.</p>
            <p>If we give to man the working or producing of grace
in his own heart, that takes off from the drawing power
of God to which it is to be aſſigned; it takes from grace
the power of it: If we give to man the worthineſs, that
takes off from grace the freeneſs of it; for tis not free,
if there be a worthineſs in man: And we cannot give
grace her due, except we leave to her her power and her
freeneſs: And therefore <hi>Pelagius</hi> our Countryman, at
leaſt a <hi>Welſhman,</hi> that ſaid grace was given <hi>ſecundum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita,</hi>
according to works: And the Semi-Pelagians that
followed him, that thought he went too high, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would mend the matter with <hi>Facienti quod in ſe
eſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>God denies not grace to men that do what they can;
that to a man that doth what he can (though no ſuch
man (I think) is found in the world) that walks up to the
utmoſt of his light, to him that doth the utmoſt of his
power, God doth not deny grace in our times, when
men have learned to ſpin a finer thred; but to be as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
faſtened to the ſame doctrines as they were of old,
they do aſſign the firſt reaſon of Gods giving grace
to the honeſty and probity of man (as they call it) theſe
ſpin a finer thred one then another: But this I will ſay
of them all, That which they give to man, they take off
from God; and ſo much as they give to mans worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or power, ſo much they derogate from the power
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53665:26"/>
and freeneſs of God; and do ſo much pull down grace,
as they build man. And I think it to be a good rule,
We muſt build man upon God, and not God upon
man.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that our Saviour here in my Text properly
ſpeaks of the power of man, not the worthineſs and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which you may clear to your ſelves by the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Except my Father draw him;</hi> which ſignifies ſome
kind of power: But I have ſpoken this little of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in derogation to the worthineſs and merit of man,
that I might not trouble you with it afterwards, and that
I might ſhew you that mans merit is oppoſite to Gods
free gift and free grace, and will no more ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then mans power and Gods drawing. Thats an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Text for this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
who hath firſt given to God? and it ſhall be given to him
again reciprocally. Thus much unto the point of merit,
becauſe that I quit, and come to that which my Text
properly leads me to; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The power of man to ſelf-converſion, or faith in
Chriſt: And here there are three things that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for diſtinctneſs of method.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſubject unto whom this power is denied,
is every man in the world, as he is conſidered abſtractly
in his corrupt natural eſtate, without the traction of God:
<hi>No man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that which is denied, is power and ability
to bring himſelf to God: Not meerly will, or readineſs
of will, or forwardneſs, as if man were in fetters, or
ſick and crazy; but power he cannot; which is the moſt
offenſive denial that can be made to mans reaſon, as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to man no ſhare in his own converſion, nor to God
(as they dee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) any juſtice of commanding man to turn
and believe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:53665:27"/>
Thirdly, that unto which this power of man is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is the moſt abſolutely neceſſary thing to his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
converſion; and the moſt clearly eaſieſt thing (as
men think) which is believing in Chriſt, then which
they ſuppoſe that nothing is more facile and eaſie; you
think it to be as eaſie for a man to believe, as for a ſick
man to cry out for a Phyſician, or a hungry man to call
for meat; whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>without coming to me you
cannot live:</hi> For tis a work that requires the drawing of
God, and ſuch a work as is in no mans hand.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſubject, <hi>No man.</hi> If I open this point genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inely
according to the Text, I muſt look back, <hi>ver.</hi> 41.
where Chriſt ſilences the murmurers, and gives them a
general reaſon, that reaches all them, and all men elſe,
<hi>No man can.</hi> And then alſo it gives a comfortable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
to them that do believe, that they may know that
they are drawn of God, or elſe they ſhould even be in
the ſame condition with unbelievers: And you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, that in Scripture the univerſal miſery and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of mankind doth render the cordial and comfort
more ſweet to them that ſhall find that they have taſted
that the Lord is gracious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. Or as I may give
it by this compariſon: When <hi>Aegypt</hi> is ſtricken through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
in every houſe one dead, the deliverance of Iſrael
was the more admirable, in whoſe houſes there was not
one ſtricken, but all free: So when you ſee the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of man, and man lying under it, and to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
recovered and reduced by the power and free grace
of God to Chriſt Jeſus; how ſhould it ſerve to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the power of the free grace of God!</p>
            <p>But ſomewhat more cloſer to ſpeak to this point. If
Chriſt would have ſpoken tenderly of mans impotency
to believe, he might have given theſe murmurers ſome
other reaſon why they did not come to him; <hi>viz.</hi> their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53665:27"/>
prejudices againſt him; you know my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as you ſay, that I am of mean race and extract, and
thats the reaſon why you believe not; and ſo needed
not to have ſaid any thing of the univerſal impotency of
man: But you ſee he makes a univerſal negative, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>No man can.</hi> Therefore there is not ſuch a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
unto mans power to believe, as ſome pretend.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt would have pretended tenderneſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
credit (as our men do) that they aſſert not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in man, to emproud man; but to lay the fault at
mans door, and vindicate the juſtice and impartiality of
God, that requires all men to believe; for he boldly
and clearly lays the fault at mans door, and yet clearly
gives the reaſon of mans unbelief too: Chriſt boldly and
confidently denies to man, he cannot; <hi>No man can come
to me except the Father draw him:</hi> And more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
<hi>ver.</hi> 65. he ſaith the ſame thing; <hi>No man can come
to me, except it were given him of my Father:</hi> And he
ſaith it again, <hi>John 10. 26. You do not believe, becauſe you
are not of my ſheep.</hi> No, God hath not given you to me;
<hi>you are not of my ſheep by election, therefore you believe not:</hi>
So that Chriſt fears not any diſcredit that may redound
to God, as if God could not anſwer your pleadings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him; for God can make good his juſtice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality
againſt all mans reaſon, but to ſhew a ſecret
reaſon for the comfort of Gods elect, though others
may ſtumble.</p>
            <p>And if it ſhall be, as it is, objected that it is God that
gives the power indeed; but thats univerſal to all: The
act, the will, is put by man himſelf, who hath not power
but of God. This is the curioſity, this is the hinge of
all: God gives a power or ſufficiency to one man as well
as another; but the will, the acting of this power, is by the
will of man, and that little ſtring they have to hold by:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53665:28"/>
And truly I have this to anſwer againſt it.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour in this place gives ſuch a reaſon, as
makes a difference between man and man; ſuch a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſuch a gift of faith, ſuch an election of ſheep, as makes
a difference, and works the effect; or elſe it made no
difference between them that come, and them that come
not; therefore its ſaid, <hi>He works to will and to do:</hi> giving
ſaith to ſome, and not to others, is a differencing work;
and if it be a differencing reaſon, there can be no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality
in it; for things that make a difference, make no
univerſality: Therefore he ſaith not only, <hi>you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
except this power be given;</hi> but, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Joh. 10. 26.
<hi>ye do not believe, becauſe you are not of my ſheep:</hi> Shewing
that this is a differencing thing he ſpeaks of, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
quite the univerſality of power that men aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No man,</hi> whether he be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Carnal man,
or animal man; you ſhall find ground for ſuch a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. But what do you
mean, may ſome ſay, by carnal man? He is one that is
forelaid with groſſer luſts, that is, tranſported and
carried away with byaſſing luſts, that walks after fleſhly
intereſts, or fleſhly principles: And what is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man then? He is one that hath what this corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can give, underſtanding and wiſdom, and is embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
with the higheſt parts of that Sphere: All that can
poſſibly ſtand with corrupt nature, that cannot be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with ſuch luſts. Now of the natural man, and of
the beſt of them too, its ſaid he doth not, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>know the things of God,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
learn Chriſt; not the beſt man in the world, by an
animal or natural light, can diſcern the things of God:
And the reaſon given is, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53665:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For in that place, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the
natural and ſpiritual man are diſtinguiſhed; the ſpiritual
man goes by the guidance of Gods Spirit; the natural
man by the guidance and light of reaſon: And (as
I ſhall ſhew) no man by the meer light of natural reaſon
and natural wiſdom (I ſpeak of a moral impotency) can
believe in Chriſt, and receive him as a Saviour and a
Lord; which, if you conſider the oppoſition of the
words, you will eaſily grant.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, <hi>No man can:</hi> That is, no man
can convert or come in to Chriſt; ſuch is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
impotency of natural man: And this the Apoſtle would
convince all the world of, before he treats of the point
of juſtification by faith: His method is admirable in the
Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> till he had convinc'd <hi>Jew</hi> and
<hi>Gentil,</hi> every man in the whole world to be guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, he ſaith, <hi>Rom. 3. 9. that every mouth may be
ſtopped;</hi> and all the world be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ver. 19. obnoxious
to God;</hi> that is, liable to the judgement of God; brings
man into a loſt eſtate, and then preaches ſalvation to
him. And the reaſons of this impotency of man may
be taken, if you conſider man what he is, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
what it is, and the Goſpel-reaſons that it gives, and
what is this faith and coming unto Chriſt, that is denied
to man: For I will not give four reaſons, but four heads
of reaſons that may be given of theſe points.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider man in his natural eſtate, and look on
him two wayes, Privatively, or Poſitively: Privative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as under the privation of that rectitude which he was
created in; and ſo is called darkneſs, and not light; ſaid
to be dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, not alive; for darkneſs
and death are both privations. Oh miſerable man that
is without light and without life! Now that it may be
judged you are without and deprived of theſe, there is no
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53665:29"/>
better argument to prove it, then by that whereinto we
are redintegrate by Chriſt; this proves your lapſe, your
loſs, your ruine; for by that which is reſtored unto you,
you may know what loſs you were at before, but ſo as
(which is worthy obſervation) at the firſt the Image of
God was planted in man by creation; for God created
man after his own image: The firſt man did not work
the image of God in himſelf, but it was planted in him by
that creation by which he was made a man: So this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
comes not by any work of man; this new Image
of God is replanted by a ſecond creation: And therefore
its ſaid in <hi>Epheſ. 4. 24. The new man is created after God in
righteouſneſs and holineſs.</hi> This I ſpeak, to ſhew that this
flower needs not a watering only, but a new plantation
in our Garden; that I might bring you to pray, and give
God no reſt, till you find this work wrought in you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider man Poſitively; and in him you
ſhall find a world of luſts that byaſs him another way;
Luſts that fight againſt your converſion; luſts that fight
both againſt God and your ſouls; ſo that no man can any
more move and free himſelf from this lapſed ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is, then a bondman can free himſelf from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:
Thats a Scripture-compariſon; for there is not
one luſt you are under but you ſerve; <hi>Serving divers
luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. one haling this way, and
another pulling that way; and under the name of
this bondage doth the Scripture often ſet forth mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
and indeed obſtinate condition, being as that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in the Law, that ſaid, <hi>I like my Maſter, and will not
go out free. I will be a ſervant for ever.</hi> There are many
that ſay, I will not leave my covetouſneſs, I like my ſin;
bore my ear for perpetual ſervitude, let ſin be my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
for evermore. Thus you ſee man is not only under
privation, but under the power of poſitive luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:53665:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, From the work of Converſion it ſelf, that
gives us very good reaſon; no Philoſophy in the world
will deny this to be reaſon. Firſt, this converſion to
God is not wrought as habits that are generated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and begotten in man by acts, as a man writes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
before he learns to write; that is a moral way: But
this grace is planted in man firſt as <hi>potentia naturalis,</hi> it
produceth the acts, and muſt firſt be: The eye is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a habit: I do not by ſeeing learn to ſee,
as I do by writing learn to write; but firſt I muſt have
ſight in my eye, before I can make any act produce any
fruit: Grace is like ſight in the eye, we do not get
grace by the ſeveral acts by us performed, but firſt God
plants it in our ſouls, and then, as with the eye, we ſee:
Our Saviour Chriſt gives me the form of this reaſon;
<hi>Firſt make the tree good, and then the fruit will be good:</hi>
This muſt firſt be, a man muſt firſt be endued with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and ſaving principle; there muſt be a new man, a
new ſelf, a new creature, before there can be any new
acts. How often have I told you, that before this great
work of God that plants a principle in me, before this
be wrought, nothing at all can be expected from me!
Now Converſion is ſuch a thing as this, it makes the
tree good; and that cannot be by mans power, becauſe
Converſion makes a new ſelf in man. I ſay it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to reaſon and nature that this ſhould be; he that
cannot do a good act, can much leſs make himſelf a good
tree: Who ever heard of a thing in the world making it
ſelf? Is any thing both a creature and a Creator? I
think there is no ſuch thing in the world; for if there
were, it would be ſomething above a miracle: A dead
man raiſing himſelf; its miracle great enough if another
hand do it; I ſay tis above a miracle, and impoſſible in
reaſon: And truly if this Scripture-truth were brought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53665:30"/>
to the ponderation of reaſon, reaſon it ſelf would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragate
and oppoſe the thing. And ſecondly,</p>
            <p>Converſion is a work ſupernatural, and brings forth
ſupernatural grace, as to believe in Chriſt Jeſus the
Lord, and to love God above ſelf: For that which is
ſaid in Scripture, in the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and all thy mind, and thy neighbour
as thy ſelf:</hi> If thy neighbour be to be loved as thy ſelf,
then that which went before, is the loving God above
ſelf: And if this be true (as it is) that God is to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
above ſelf, its an impoſſibility, till there be a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
put into the mind and heart whereby to do it; for
ſelf cannot work above ſelf; nothing can act above its
ſphere of activity; my reaſon is (as the Schoolmen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve)
if a thing act and bring forth any thing without
it ſelf, there would be ſome effect without a cauſe, and
the cauſe cannot reach it; which is clearly in reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
and a contradiction: Darkneſs indeed was, and
light was called out it: God commanded light to
ſhine out of darkneſs in our new creation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. but
that darkneſs ſhould produce light, I ſay that light is
without a cauſe; for there is no cauſality in darkneſs;
and to make an effect without a cauſe, is a thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to nature and reaſon, and therefore there muſt be a
power to command it out, otherwiſe you put nature to
work above it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you conſider the Goſpel-reaſons, which
that moſt of all inſiſts on; and theſe are the ſimpleſt,
they have no Philoſophy in them: Why no man hath
power to convert himſelf, there are two reaſons the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
gives, and there are no more that I can give in this
point: I am ſure <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledges it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it layes in caution againſt boaſting, and takes
that for reaſon enough. Why not? If man were able
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53665:30"/>
to believe and convert himſelf, then there is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
laid for boaſting and pride, that man reflecting on
himſelf, might ſay, I believed; and for that reaſon the
Apoſtle doth deny in <hi>Epheſ. 2. 9. Salvation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is
by grace, not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt:</hi> not ſo,
leſt that ſhould be: Its contrary to the ſcope of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and alſo to the Goſpel-deſign, that is to unhinge
the power of man, and to draw all the water to Gods
own mill, the free grace of God. And oh that we were
in love with this free grace of God! that whereby
when we were involved in ſin, we were brought out.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon the Goſpel gives, and it needs
no more, is, it gives all the honour to Gods grace
throughout, aſſigning all the difference of one man from
another, to that fountain: If a man converts himſelf,
then he differences himſelf from another man; but the
Scripture aſſigns all the difference to grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.
<hi>Who made thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou
that thou haſt not received?</hi> Well then it cannot be, and
muſt not be ſaid, that man hath power of himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
or to determine of himſelf to convert and turn
to God.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>

impoſſibility of mans making himſelf to differ from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>

HAving thus far in general ſpoken of mans impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to his own converſion: And that being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
general, I now come to ſpeak of that particular in
the Text, which our Saviour names, and that is the Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namy
or inability of man to come unto Chriſt: <hi>No man
can come to me:</hi> that is, no man can believe in me, or no
man can give himſelf up to me; for ſo it is explained in
<hi>ver.</hi> 35. foregoing, where coming to Chriſt, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Chriſt, are equivalent and of one ſenſe. The
Propoſition I ſhall ſpeak to, is; No man of himſelf can
come unto, or believe in Chriſt, without a divine power
enabling and perſwading him thereunto: <hi>No man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
thats a Scripture-expreſſion, in <hi>Epheſ. 2. 8. Not of
our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No man of himſelf, or by his own power, can come unto
Chriſt.</hi> In this verſe it is ſaid, <hi>No man can:</hi> In the next
verſe its ſaid, <hi>Every man that hath heard and learnt of the
Father, comes to me;</hi> which two places, if compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
ſhew, that no man of himſelf can, but every
man that is enabled by the power of a divine traction,
and the inward teaching of God, who ſo teacheth the
heart of man, as thereby to draw and perſwade it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and believe in Chriſt, doth indeed believe in him
unto ſalvation: For the teaching and drawing of God
are made both one; and every one that is ſo taught, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that is thus drawn, doth believe; and no man
without it doth believe in Chriſt unto ſalvation: For
the faith here meant is ſaving faith, and ſo expounded,
<hi>ver. 47. He that believeth on me, hath eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The impotency and diſability which our Saviour ſpeaks
of in the Text, ſo far as I underſtand, is a moral impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and this lies much of it in the will of man: An
indiſpoſition to, and diſlike of Chriſt, to the acceptance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53665:31"/>
of whom, and againſt the acceptance of him, the heart of
man is poſſeſt with prejudice, and foreſtalled by luſts,
forbidden and hindred by ſelf-righteouſneſs of his own;
which he maintains all he can. If the handling of this
point may lead you further into your own hearts; to ſee
the guile that lies in them, and the ſinful impotency that
is in you, it will be pains well ſpent.</p>
            <p>For the handling whereof, this inability of man to
receive Chriſt unto ſalvation, may be diſtinguiſht into
theſe two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a judicial diſability of ſome men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a natural diſability of all men.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is, when in the juſt judgement of
God a man is inſenſibly (I mean to his own ſenſe) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
and ſpiritually ſmitten with unbelief, with a mind
that is alienated from Chriſt, as <hi>Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h</hi> was inſenſibly
ſmitten with hardneſs of heart: And of theſe its ſpoken
in <hi>John 12. 39, 40. Therefore they could not believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heares,
leaſt they ſhould ſee, and underſtand, and be converted, that
I ſhould heal them.</hi> This is a dreadful condition of men
that are judicially hardened in their unbelief, under impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
and diſability with which they are ſmitten.</p>
            <p>And who are they, aud what is their ſin? may ſome
ſay.</p>
            <p>The people ſmitten with this, are thoſe that have had
the light of the Goſpel ſhining among them, and have
been allured by the offers of grace and Chriſt, to turn
unto, and come to him; but they have neglected and
deſpiſed the offers that have been made, and preferred
the purſuit of their own luſts and intereſts, before the
entertainment of Chriſt Jeſus; theſe are the people.
The character is the character of us; it was then of the
<hi>Jewes</hi> (for they are properly meant in this Text) whom
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53665:32"/>
God followed by his Word and the Miniſtry thereof
from time to time; but they preferred their luſts before
the teachings of God: <hi>They believed not, becauſe they
could not,</hi> Joh. 12. 37. and they could not, becauſe God
had ſmitten them; and he ſmote them, becauſe they did
not like to retain the knowledge of God in their minds,
as it is ſaid of the Heathen in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. And ſo when the
offers of Chriſt are unpleaſing, and you prefer to keep
acquaintance with your luſts, then to receive him and
the knowledge of God, then he ſmites you, that when
you would, you ſhall not believe; as theſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> that
had ſeen ſo many Miracles, yet could not believe.</p>
            <p>And let it ſit ſadly upon your hearts, that you that
have received the light of the Goſpel with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
that have had ſo many offers of grace, and ſuch
long ſpace of time of hearing and receiving the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt, that you be not ſealed up under a poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
unbelief, even then when you think your ſelves to
be believers; that whereas it may be ſaid of you in the
dayes of your proſperity, as it is in <hi>John 5. 40. You
will not come to me that you may have life,</hi> it ſo fall not
out one day with you, when you cry to believe, that you
ſhall not be able: <hi>For many ſhall ſeek to enter</hi> (ſaith our
Saviour) <hi>and ſhall not be able.</hi> This point is hard of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
to you; but take heed you be not found in the
number of them: But this not the unbelief in the Text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a diſability of all: For <hi>no man can
come to me,</hi> &amp;c. And this the reaſon of man ſtumbles at
almoſt above any point, that God, in making a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with man of life and ſalvation, ſhould lay the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant upon an impoſſibility, which is
mans coming to Chriſt: For the condition of ſalvation
being laid upon mans coming to Chriſt, and man being
impotent unto it, it both defeats the benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53665:32"/>
and puts into the mouth of man an excuſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may excuſe himſelf for his not believing, as not
being able to perform impoſſible things, nor indeed
bound unto them, as the Rule ſaith, <hi>Nemo tenetur ad
impoſsibilia.</hi> Therefore this lets man looſe unto an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
that our Saviour ſhould deliver theſe words, <hi>No
man can;</hi> and ſeems to lay the blame upon God, that
layes the conditiou of the covenant of life, upon that
which cannot be by man performed: But truly</p>
            <p>Mans reaſon errs in the objection that it makes, as
well as in the apprehenſion that it hath of ſpiritual and
divine things; for a thing may be <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
impoſſible, that is not ſimply ſo: Its not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
impoſſible to riſe from the dead, for then it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be; but its impoſſible for a dead man to raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
So to believe in Chriſt, its not impoſſible through
grace &amp; the divine traction; but to a man as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and in ſin, it is impoſſible: Faith in Chriſt is not an
impoſſible act; but it is not poſſible by mans own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and therefore if Reaſon quarrel at God for laying
the conditions of the Covenant of life upon impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for not laying the condition of the Covenant in
mans own power, yet that Reaſon is without reaſon in
it; for the condition was once in mans power; and the
forfeiture of the Covenant, the event may teach us to
bleſs God that it is ſo no more, that the condition of the
Covenant lies no more in the power of man to forfeit
it, or in man only to accompliſh it: God hath given (I
do believe) and doth give ſo much power unto man, as
may juſtifie his commanding man, and condemning, in
caſe they do not obſerve his commands; there is ſo
much power given as may juſtifie God in both; and ſo
much knowledge as God doth give to any man in the
world, ſo much knowledge as any man hath, or might
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53665:33"/>
have, ſo much he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without excuſe: I
think thats a Principle and Maxime that will go far in
all Divinity: So much power as you have, ſo much
your excuſe is taken from you; ſo much you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and therefore are left inexcuſable; even thoſe
that have knowledge of God but by the light of Nature,
ſo much as they did know him, are without excuſe. But
certainly (as its ſaid) the purpoſe of Gods election ſtands
not by our works, but <hi>ex vocante,</hi> of him that calleth, <hi>Rom.</hi>
9. 11. ſo is his Covenant made good, not by mans put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the condition, but Gods giving of it; elſe the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that he hath made with us, ſhould be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works or merits, and not of grace, if it did not
ſtand upon Gods performance as it doth: And therefore
its not laid upon an an impoſſible condition, but a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
performed and made good by God himſelf: <hi>I will
put my law into their hearts, and I will write it in their minds,
and they ſhall all know me:</hi> that is, ſhall believe in, and
love me, and accept me for their God, as the tenour of
the covenant runs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. And the very reaſon
why this covenant of life ſhould not be defeated, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
and made void; therefore its not committed to
your power, but reſerved to the hands of the grace of
God to make it good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. Therefore it is of faith,
that it might be of grace, to the end that the Covenant
might be ſure to all the ſeed; otherwiſe it had been as
unſure as the Covenant that he made with <hi>Adam,</hi> or as
that which he made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God ſaid was broken,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. For in every Covenant, that with <hi>Adam,</hi> the
promiſe was ſure enough to the condition; life was ſure
enough to the condition, Do this; if that condition had
been performed, it had been a ſure covenant, none ſurer.
What failed then? the condition failed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe it
leaned on man; and for that reaſon only it failed; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53665:33"/>
therefore the covenant was not ſure; and this I have
ſpoken all along to anſwer that objection, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
might be ſure, the condition doth not reſt barely
on the power of man: But God performs the condition
of the covenant that he makes with his people; and (I
think) he that gives the object of faith, gives alſo the
act of faith: He that gave the ſerpent on the pole, gives
alſo the eye to look upon it, that ſo Chriſt the object of
your faith, and faith that you might believe in him, might
be the gift of God: For what avails Chriſt ſet forth to
a people, and no faith to lay hold on him? Of what
avail is the ſetting forth of an object, where there is no
eye to ſee it? Grace, I believe, ſaving grace (though I
confeſs it is not ſo reſented by many learned men) comes
from the purchaſe and merit of Chriſt, as well as bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of pardon: The conditions and graces of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
come from the merit of Chriſt alſo, without which
there is no pardon; ſince Chriſt is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12.
the ſurety of a better Covenant, an undertaker of the
beſt Covenant. Now all the queſtion of the Text will
be whoſe ſurety is Chriſt: Is he Gods ſurety that makes
it, or mans ſurety with whom it is made? Gods ſurety
(ſaith a learned man of latter times) God and mans (ſure)
I think;<note place="margin">Hammond.</note> mans ſurety he is by giving ſatisfaction to the
juſtice of God for the ſins of man; Gods ſurety he is
by ſending forth his Spirit to certifie and ſeal us: Or
thus, he is ſurety for God, that he will pardon us; and
ſponſor or undertaker for us, that we ſhall know God,
and believe in Chriſt, and receive him for a Saviour;
therefore alſo called a Mediator of the ſame Covenant:
Now a Mediator is is not of one, but of two parts; in
<hi>Zach. 13. 9. I will ſay You are my people; they ſhall ſay The
Lord is my God.</hi> If Chriſt then be the ſurety of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
Gods ſurety and ours, for God and for us, it will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53665:34"/>
follow that Chriſt undertakes for us, and that we have
grace, our believing, our faith, from his merit and his
purchaſe. Well then</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay, all men are naturally unable to believe in
Chriſt, or to come unto him; for though he be a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
opened, that was once a fountain ſealed compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
<hi>Zach. 13. 1. In that day a fountain ſhall be opened
for ſin and for uncleanneſs:</hi> (ſpeaking in the dialect of
the <hi>Jewes</hi>) that is, as in the Law there were ſins and
uncleanneſs; ſin to be purged by blood, and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to be purified by water; and there were expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſin, and purgations of uncleanneſs repreſented in
ſeveral Types: So the Prophet ſhews that Chriſt ſhall
anſwer them all; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt all theſe Types; yet though
he be a fountain opened, as the impotent man ſaid, <hi>I
have none to put me in,</hi> Ioh. 5. 7. I lie lame and decrepid
at the pool-ſide, and when the water is moved, have
none to put me in: So it may be ſaid in this point, there
is a fountain opened in Chriſt Jeſus for ſin and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but none is able to come to it without a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
help, and a divine hand go along with him.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel-preaching opens this fountain to you;
and this grace <hi>Pelagius</hi> reſted upon, and held that the
grace of God was the preaching of the Word, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fountain to men: For <hi>Orthodoxis verbis non ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinuit.</hi>
He (as other Erroniſts that live in our times) did
not abſtain from Orthodox words: But what ſaid <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
to them? <hi>Nolumus iſtam gratiam,</hi> we reſt not upon
that grace meerly of having the Goſpel preached, and
the Fountain declared to be opened unto us; but there
muſt be a divine hand to enable the will of man to come
to this pool when it is moved. Of any Text in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
this is moſt clear to prove the miſerable impotency
of ſinful man to this point of ſalvation; he cannot
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53665:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
comply with this of himſelf. <hi>No man can,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And if this do not ſuffice, we will argue the point a
little further, <hi>Iſa. 53. 1. Who hath believed our report?
and to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed?</hi> Here is
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophets report; but there is an arm
muſt be revealed, both which muſt go together; the
report revealed by the Miniſtry, and the arm of the Lord
revealed, muſt go together; for elſe, though they ſaw
ſo many miracles (the means of believing) yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not, ſaith our Saviour, quoting this Text, <hi>John</hi>
12. 39. And whereas every one taught and drawn of
God doth come, and no man can come except ſo drawn,
it manifeſtly proves, that as the coming is mans act, and
the free act of man (for I think man is never more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
then when he is convinc'd indeed, and enabled to
come to Chriſt) yet the drawing is Gods power; that
muſt firſt be; and the drawing of God, that is firſt in
time; for man doth not come that he may be drawn; but
becauſe he is drawn, therefore he comes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this drawing of man to faith in Chriſt, ſounds like a
work of Almighty power, or a work of omnipotence,
<hi>Epheſ. 1. 19. The exceeding greatneſs of his power towards
us that believe, according to the working of his mighty
power whereby he raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and lifted
him to glory. The exceeding greatneſs of his power:</hi> The
Hyperbole of it (here is a thruſting and crowding of
words together) a power that is compared to the raiſing
of Chriſt; Chriſt (I ſay) who bore our ſins in his body
on the tree, though he lay, under our ſins (for the death
of Chriſt muſt be conſidered a little further) no ſuch
load could depreſs him; the Lord would have the ſtone
rolled from his grave for him to riſe again: This was a
work of mighty power, and yet according to this, God
puts forth his hand in drawing of man to Chriſt; ſo that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53665:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as I conceive) it cannot but argue that the free grace
of God giving, and the great power of God drawing,
makes faith to be above man, and takes it from mans
merit, and mans power: And truly it could not elſe
be rightly ſaid in <hi>Epheſ. 2. 8. Through faith, not of your
ſelves,</hi> if this faith were of our ſelves.</p>
            <p>The Root of this impotency ſhall be ſhewn you in
five particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there are ſome footſteps of the Law of God
remaining, that were written in the heart of man: In
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. they ſhew the work of the Law written in
their hearts; that as by the rubbiſh that you ſee, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
what building there was before, and by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
lines you may gueſs at the picture; ſo you may by
the common Notions left in mens minds, judge of right
and wrong, and the differences between juſtice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
without which no ſociety could be of any men in
the world, but would be herds of wilde beaſts rather
then men; but of Chriſt there appears nothing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
naturally in the heart of man; nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Saviour and a Mediatour, but an utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſilence of Chriſt, and conſequently of Faith in
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly therefore, man, when his conſcience is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
(having ſomething of the Law in it) and accuſes as
it doth, for ſins againſt Nature, common Law, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Light; and when it accuſes and troubles him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether ignorant of the righteouſneſs of God by
faith in Chriſt, and how he ſhould be ſaved and juſtifie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
knows not till it be revealed by the Goſpel; for
<hi>therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed,</hi> Rom. 1. 7. For
who can ſo much as gueſs by the pregnancy of natural
light, that God in his Covenant of Salvation, ſhould
pitch on; ſuch a way as Chriſt, a Sponſor or Surety, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53665:35"/>
Mediator between God and man? that he ſhould make
expiation for ſin? truly no more then <hi>Moſes,</hi> or an <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>
could have ſo much as found out the way of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the biting of the fiery Serpents by a figure ſet upon
a pole to be looked unto; no man could imagine, no
mans reaſon could have found it out, had they wandred
in the wilderneſs never ſo many years; and yet this was
Gods way, and a Type of Chriſt; ſignifying what man
could never have found out to conceive of compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for ſin by a Mediator, which was a thing impoſſible,
and had not been known; therefore man being ignorant
of this, muſt of neceſſity fly to his own plaiſters and fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves;
for if by nature he may be convinc'd of ſin, yet by
the dictates of natural conſcience, he can never find out
any righteouſneſs and ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice; then
it muſt follow that he muſt fly to making a medicine of
his own righteouſneſs, which is of works; for that only
comes by man to be found out, as being next to hand
in this caſe; that I ſay, or nothing, as being his only hope;
and this bulruſh the drowning man takes hold of, and
holds it faſt as for life, and ſo comes of neceſſity to ſettle
on his own righteouſneſs, being ignorant of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of God, which is by faith in Chriſt: And this the
Apoſtle tells you, <hi>Rom. 10. 3. For they being ignorant of
the righteouſneſs of God, went about to eſtabliſh their own
righteouſneſs, and ſo ſubmitted not to the righteouſneſs of
God.</hi> where you ſee the righteouſneſs that is our own,
maintains our pride (in that word <hi>ſubmitted not</hi>) and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from ignorance of that of Gods righteouſneſs (to
which we muſt ſubmit by way of humiliation) which is a
cauſe that men believe not. And then</p>
            <p>Thirdly (and pray mark) there is a double Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt; the one is a revealing of him by Goſpel-doctrine,
the other is a revealing of him by ſpiritual light:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53665:36"/>
The revealing of Chriſt by Goſpel-doctrine to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
knowledge of mans corrupt underſtanding, cannot
procure or produce any other then literal knowledge of
Chriſt: The Scripture calls it knowledge in the letter,
as to know the Goſpel as a Hiſtory may be known to be
true, whereof a man hath a dogmatical knowledge;
you have many believers, and theſe by knowing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
by a natural light, are differenced from Heathens:
But this doth not, nor never will produce a ſaving faith;
moſt men have a literal knowledge; we ſee in ordinary
experience, all men have ſome knowledge, and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
a great deal; yet being ſeen by natural light, though
revealed in the Goſpel, will not reach ſo far as to beget
faith, ſaving faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But the other revealing of Chriſt by the light of the
Spirit of God, conveying the knowledge of him into
the mind and heart of man: This is that which is <hi>lumen
fidel,</hi> and ſhews him as he is, ſo as to draw unto him, and
is called the teaching of God, <hi>whereby every man that
hath it doth believe and receive Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 6. 47. Who
is ſeen in his own light, as the Sun in its own; for by
torch-light or candles we cannot ſee the Sun; ſo the
natural man cannot know him, becauſe he is ſpiritually
diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. And ſo its ſaid, <hi>Fleſh and blood
hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father,</hi> Mat. 16. 17.
The truth of the Hiſtory of the Goſpel that you read,
may be revealed to fleſh and blood; but the revelation
of which faith is begotten, is from my Father: And in
1 <hi>John 5. 20. He hath given to us an underſtanding, that
we may know him, and we are in him.</hi> Such a knowledge,
to know him by faith, is a knowledge of union, and
brings us to him: Therefore this light of the ſweetneſs,
excellency, comfortableneſs, and neceſſity of Chriſt
Jeſus appearing to your minds and hearts by Gods tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53665:36"/>
is that which throws down your reaſonings, pulls
down your ſtrong holds, and brings every thought in
you into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
5. And doubtleſs that is the light which is neceſſary to
the production of true faith in Chriſt, which yet few
have: Therefore let not men wonder that have a great
deal of natural knowledge, that yet they have not a
proportionable light that is commenſurable to ſpiritual
things, no more then the Moon-light is to judge of
colours; you have not the light that produces faith, and
becauſe you have it not in a natural eſtate, therefore the
natural man is not able to believe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the act of mans coming is an effect of Gods
drawing; for man doth not come that he may be
drawn, but becauſe he is drawn firſt. Faith is an act of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
principle; faith is not the act of a dead man; there muſt
be life before there be ſight: we do not firſt ſee, and
then live; no, but all ſeeing in nature is an act of life,
and from life it muſt come: A dead man ſeeth not, and
therefore it is no more eaſie for a man to believe in
Chriſt, then to make himſelf to live; for your reaſon
will teach you there muſt be <hi>potentia</hi> before there be
<hi>actus;</hi> he that will believe in Chriſt, if he will not have
an act without power, muſt firſt make himſelf alive, raiſe
himſelf from being dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, that he
may put forth lively acts from a vital principle; therefore
I conclude from that demonſtration, that no man is able
of himſelf to believe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, no man can believe aright that undervalues
God or Chriſt to his own luſts, or any of them: If any
man undervalues God or Chriſt to any worldly earthly
intereſt (true, in judgement you may not, but in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
you do) and every natural man hath ſome luſt that
he values, ſomewhat of the fleſh, or the world, that is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53665:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
predominant and prevalent in him, which he values even
above God, that man ſets up himſelf before God in his
choiſe or election, and ſo cannot believe in Chriſt.
Chriſt ſaid in <hi>John 5. 40. How can ye believe, that receive
honour one of another?</hi> that have a humour of doing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and receiving honour from men, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
your ſelves with the honour that comes from God
only? As the leaſt chap in the joynt between the graft
and the ſtock will hinder coalition; ſo that man that
hath either one luſt or other (for the ſame reaſon holds
of all) if he be ambitious of honour, that he prefers and
holds faſt, rather then leave, and come to Chriſt. From
all that hath been ſaid, the hardneſs and difficulty of
faith muſt be conſidered what it is, and then reaſon will
convince you, that no man can come to, or believe in
Chriſt, except the Father draw him.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of this point is five-fold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to humble the pride of man, that is ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale
as to contribute one act of ſaving faith to his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
able to do little in a thing on which depends his
eternal happineſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> believing in Chriſt: A dead hand,
or a full hand, neither of them can receive or hold faſt
any thing: Now every man in the world hath a dead
hand or a full; dead without life, or full of himſelf; his
own righteouſneſs and obedience; and therefore it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the pride of man, that ſo confidently can believe and
receive Chriſt, they can do nothing if they cannot do
that: Truly you can do nothing indeed; there muſt be
a moulding, a drawing, a teaching of God, whereby
there muſt be a new life put into you, and your hand
muſt be emptyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſhews the folly of thoſe that undertake
to believe and repent at their own pleaſure, and their
own time: That are like <hi>Iſrael, All that the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53665:37"/>
us we will do:</hi> or as a Mariner that is to go to ſea,
truants his time away, as if he had the wind in a bag, or
in his fiſt: Sin is a deceitful thing, and men are harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through the deceitfulneſs of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. Take
heed, you that are ſo great undertakers, I will aſſure
you, you ſhall be little or ſmall performers of this point:
For</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is not an eaſie thing to believe, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
as I have ſhewn: They ſeem to me to have but
little faith, or little proof of it that ſay ſo, or have not
found it a hard thing to believe. In time of peace, when
nothing troubles the conſcience, no temptation, no ſin,
no diſcouragement, its eaſie to pretend believing: But
is it eaſie when temptation comes? when a man ſees the
vaſt compaſs of his ſins, and ſees the frowning face of
God; no ability nor power to help himſelf, is it eaſie
then? I believe you will find it a hard thing, and our
Saviours words will be found true, <hi>No man can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourth Uſe of this Point: Be not deluded with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of a common intereſt in Chriſt, or hope thereof,
becauſe of his general ſalvation, becauſe he hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
you, and common and general men are deluded
by it: I will tell you, I have known many that have
made this to be their comfort; this may be an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to men to believe, but can be no comfort to
men until they do believe: This is an encouragement
inviting men to believe; but thats not ſure or ſtrong
conſolation: You muſt indeed come to him; but the
power whereby you come, will be found not to be at
your command: But God vouchſafes it unto thoſe he
will draw, and thoſe only.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, learn hence that God hath laid the condition
of ſalvation upon that which he himſelf works: God
hath laid it upon our coming to Chriſt, which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53665:38"/>
the very grace of God to perform, our coming to
Gods drawing; that ſo in every mans ſalvation the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and freedome of the grace of God may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
And ſo much for this Point, <hi>That it is not in
the natural power of man to believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>6</label> IF you pleaſe to keep in mind the order and method of
handling this Point, <hi>No man can come to me:</hi> you may
remember I propounded to handle theſe two things;
the impotency of natural and corrupt man; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
and oppoſition of him.</p>
            <p>The impotency or diſability of man, was firſt in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to his own converſion, in particular to his coming
in to Chriſt, which is the particular in the Text: And
having done with the Impotency or Adunamy of man,
which is a privative thing:</p>
            <p>I now come to that which is poſitive, and hath more
of ths will in it, though (as I ſhewed) it was a moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency:
The oppoſition to this work, which will ſhew
you that corrupt man is by his own will oppoſitely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
towards God: And this point, as the former, ſpeaks
generally to the oppoſition that there is in man to God,
or to the holineſs of God, in two things. Firſt, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety:
Secondly, his enmity to the holineſs of God
or his Law: And it ſpeaks particularly to the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that corrupt man doth make to Chriſt, or the grace
of Chriſt that is offered in the Goſpel: And that alſo
in two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, his averſeneſs to come, and</p>
            <p>Secondly, his reſiſtance of grace when its offered to him!</p>
            <p>In which four ſteps this oppoſition may be handled
and manifeſtly ſeen, ſhewing you thereby what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing a natural man is, being in <hi>ſtatu belli,</hi> in a ſtate of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53665:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
war and hoſtility againſt the great God, his Law, his
Grace, and conſequently an enemy and oppoſite to his
own happineſs: And this point ſhall be opened to you
to this end, to vilifie and depreſs the pretended pride
or worthineſs of man, and to exalt the freeneſs and
power of Gods grace in the ſalvation of man. For
there are two eminent things in that Doctrine that you
call the free grace of God: Freeneſs and power.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the contrariety of man in the ſtate of corruption
unto the nature of God, is palpable, and may be felt;
and ſo indeed had need to be, rather then only taught:
And it is this Contrariety to God, that renders the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
condition of man moſt deplorable, and is a very
good argument, as there is any, to prove that <hi>David</hi> in
that confeſſion of his in the 51 <hi>Pſal.</hi> did intend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his own ſin, and not the ſin of his Mother, <hi>I
was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother warm me.</hi>
For he went backward from his own traſient and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſins, to the original and root of his malady, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
his ſin by this contrariety to God; which
ſaith no more then that expreſſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>Sin
that dwells in me:</hi> or haply that in <hi>Iſa. 48. 8. Thou waſt
called a tranſgreſſor from the womb:</hi> And concerning this
contrariety of man to God ſo deplored, I ſhew you theſe
three things in general.</p>
            <p>Firſt, this Contrariety to God is not acquired or got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by iteration of acts and actual ſins; but is innate
and bred in nature: As the ſtrings of an inſtrument are
out of tune before you play upon them, and they ſound
harſhly to you; ſo is the heart of man; the faculties
there are vitiated, but not quite blotted out; but all the
ſtrings are out of tune before they come to be actuated:
For they have a good ſaying in the Schools, and tis true:
Firſt, the perſon, <hi>viz. Adam,</hi> infected mans nature; but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53665:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now the nature infects the perſon; ſo that there is this
contrariety of man to God by nature: For</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Image of God in man was before this
contrariety in corrupted nature; but this contrariety to
God is now, before the Image of God reſtored to man;
therefore its ſaid, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 8. Ye were ſometimes darkneſs,
but now are light:</hi> And, <hi>Ye were dead in ſins, but
now are quickened,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1. <hi>Ye were the ſervants of
ſin, but now ye are made free from ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. that
look as life and death, ſervitude and freedom, light and
darkneſs, are contraries one to another: So are expreſt
the ſtate of Nature and the ſtate of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there are in ſin (ſay the Schools) two parts;
the firſt, mans averſion, or turning from God; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
mans converſion or turning to himſelf or the
creature: The one of theſe hath more of ſenſuality
and ſelf; the other bewrays more Contrariety to
God.</p>
            <p>But to come more particularly to the point: This
contrariety ſhews it ſelf in this, that an unregenerate
man cannot by any principle that is in nature, love God
above all things or above himſelf; which thing, if well
minded, may let you in to ſee ſpiritual wickedneſs, and
not only carnal and ſenſual; ſelf may love God as a
benefactor, or as a ſervant to his own ends, whom he
may make uſe of to gain by, and live upon. Call this
love of God if you will; but ſuch a man doth <hi>uti Deo
ut fruatur mund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> uſes God, that he may enjoy the
world: A Merchant may traffique and commerce with
an enemy whom he hates; ſo you may converſe with
God, whom you hate in your hearts, meerly to get by
him, and for matter of advantage: This love of God is
not <hi>amor amicitiae,</hi> a love of friendſhip, but <hi>concupiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
a love of luſt, to gain by God; a love of paraſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53665:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and flattery, and ſelf-love of God.</p>
            <p>Concerning which ſelf-love, I ſay particularly thus
much.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that every man by nature is brim-ful of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
ſelf-love; I call it inordinate ſelf-love; for there
is a ſubordinate ſelf-love, which neither can nor ought
to be put off, God having linked together his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and mans happineſs in himſelf: For the chief end of
man, is to pleaſe God and enjoy him; <hi>Moſes,</hi> in denying
of himſelf to pleaſe God, had an eye to the recompence
of reward; But thats inordinate ſelf love, when a man
ſeeks God in order to his own ends, and neglecting his
holineſs, which it is impoſſible a corrupt man ſhould
love; only ſerves himſelf upon God, and makes uſe of
him in prayer or otherwiſe for his private intereſt, either
<hi>ut proſit,</hi> or <hi>ne noceat,</hi> that God may profit him, and keep
him in health or wealth, or that God may not hurt him,
and lay judgements, torments, and plagues upon him,
as the love of a whore is for hire: This is that inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſelf-love that a man hath to himſelf, becauſe he ſets
himſelf above God, as making himſelf the end, and God
the means to attain that end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Self-love, with the branches of it
(which are very many) ſelf-ſeeking, ſelf-pleaſing, ſelf-ayming,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the root and mother of all ſin: And
therefore when the Apoſtle makes you a catalogue of ſin,
he ſets this in the front, in 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 3. Men ſhall be lovers of
their own ſelves:</hi> And then they ſhall be filled with all
politick ſins, and all ſins of private intereſts; and above all
this, and more then theſe, <hi>they ſhall have a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
and deny the power of it:</hi> That whereas its ſaid of
ſome of the Elements, they move to the Center, and
not from it; ſo I may ſay in this caſe, a corrupt man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53665:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
moves towards this Center, and moves not from
it: This ſelf-love begets not a love, but a contempt of
God (as <hi>Aquinas</hi>) and takes the wall of him in every
thing; for it makes him a ſervant only to work my own
intereſt, and to enjoy my ſelf, which is the great Idol of
man, to which every man naturally burns incenſe, and
offers ſacrifice, and is no more able, whatſoever he may
pretend, to exalt and ſet up God any further then may
ſtand with ſelf, then a current of running water that
comes from a Spring, is able to run above the height of
the Head or Fountain; for then it would follow that a
heavy body ſhould run above it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the true love of God above ſelf, or all
other things, cannot poſſibly flow from any other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
but that which is above nature, <hi>viz.</hi> regenerating
grace: And I take it to be one of the moſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
arguments, and the firſt product of ſaving grace, to
love God for his holineſs; and ability to delight in him for
himſelf, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Delight in the Lord, and he
ſhall give thee thy hearts deſire.</hi> This ſhews that there is
planted in the ſoul a ſimilitude and likeneſs unto God,
which likeneſs is alwayes the cauſe of love; and where
this likeneſs is not, it is impoſſible that the corrupt heart
of man ſhould put forth any act of love to God himſelf:
And therefore its a very hard thing to perſwade a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man that he loves not God, until he find that grace
in himſelf that ſhews him plainly that he did not love
him before; and the reaſon is, becauſe every man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
meaſures his love of God by a falſe meaſure:
For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, either he meaſures the love of God to him by
a common goodneſs of God; which as it may ſtand
with Gods hate of him, ſo it may ſtand with his hate of
God; and ſo all that love of God is but a love unto
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53665:40"/>
himſelf, becauſe its ſounded meerly in nothing elſe but
common goodneſs, that God vouchſafes to you perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
in this above other men: For, as it is ſaid of
<hi>Abraham, He gave all that he had unto</hi> Iſaac; <hi>but unto the
ſons of his Concubines he gave gifts and ſent them away,</hi>
Gen. 25. 6. ſo thoſe that are indeed the beloved of
God, to them he gives the inheritance of divine grace;
but as for others, he gives them gifts, but ſends them
away from all comfortable preſence and enjoyment of
communion with him: And therefore thats a falſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to meaſure the love of God to you by. Or</p>
            <p>Secondly, he thinks (and will not be beaten off it)
he loves God, becauſe he can ſay, and that truly, that
God is amiable, and to be beloved above all; and that
the chiefeſt good and happineſs of man is to be found in
God, and in the enjoyment of him. Theſe are fair words.
But the Schoolmen have a true ſaying, Mans corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is more corrupt <hi>quantum ad appetitum boni,</hi> then
<hi>quantum ad cognitionem boni;</hi> moe out of the way in
choiſe of good, then in knowledge of truth: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as it is the beſt way to know whether you love God
or no, by bringing things to particulars, unto choiſe and
unto vote, to <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> to particulars that ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with God, then tis plain with you, and alas,
plain with us all in our natural condition, that ſenſitive
intereſt and ſenſual profit is choſen and embraced before
God, as infinite experience ſheweth that the pooreſt and
meaneſt luſt, or the enjoyment of any creature in the
world, when it comes to choiſe, ſhall carry it quite away
from God; which is a demonſtration that this love of
God is not in ſome, and doth not preponderate.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew you, Firſt, that an unregenerate man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
love God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, why he cannot love God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53665:41"/>
Firſt, <hi>He cannot.</hi> No man, until God renew his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in him, can love God; for there goes renewing
grace to this work, to love God above ſelf; its a rare
thing, very ſeldom do you find out this corruption. Ah,
I pity you! you know not the half of that contrariety
that is in every one of you to God: In <hi>Deut. 30. 6. The
Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, to love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart:</hi> For there is a foreskin upon the
heart of man that muſt be taken away, and that is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
hardneſs and indiſpoſition, and this ſticks upon the
very elect of God themſelves, until they are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods purpoſe; for they are born uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
and have not this love of God in them, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
and enmity to God: Indeed its true, they have
a love of God towards them, while they are in a ſtate of
alienation from him, and that is called <hi>Amor</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but
not yet <hi>Amor</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: the love of his good pleaſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, but not a love of complacency and well-pleaſedneſs
in them: For ſo the Scripture calls him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that ſerves Chriſt <hi>in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy
in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14. 18. Theſe are under the
well-pleaſedneſs of God only; and therefore, though
the love of his purpoſe may be toward them, yet this of
complacency is not in them until they be converted, <hi>I
the Lord will circumciſe thy heart to love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the effects of alienation from God may be
found in every natural man: For ſo in <hi>Col. 1. 21. You
were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your minds by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
works.</hi> And again, in <hi>Epheſ. 4. 18. Being alienated
from the life of God.</hi> You will ſay this ſpeaks to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils,</hi>
what they were before they came to Chriſt: I
grant it; but were the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that were Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as you may ſeem to be, any better? Of them,
Chriſt ſaith in <hi>John 5. 42. I know you, that you have not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53665:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the love of God in you.</hi> You may very well think that
they would have ſpit in the face of any that ſhould have
ſaid they had not the love of God in them, as you may
hold any man in defiance that ſhall ſay it of you: But
you know not the enmity and contrariety that is in your
hearts to God: He proves it by this argument; he that
hath not true faith in Chriſt, hath not a ſincere love of
God; As men put fallacies to themſelves in point of
believing, ſo in point of loving: And I remember <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi>
goes about to prove that all unbelief ariſes from
the hatred of God; when a man traces his unbelief in
Chriſt to the laſt reſult of it, he ſhall find it to be the
hate of God: I would not ſtrain things higher then they
are, but ſo far forth as they may give a good demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
By which argument it appears that there is not
much love of God in the world, or indeed in the Church:
And this contrariety to God may appear,</p>
            <p>Firſt, in that a natural man hath not (and cannot have
any) delight in communion with God; and I think he
can have no delight in God, in Heaven, or Earth: In
Earth he cannot; tis an irk ſome thing! They ſay, <hi>When
will the new Moon be gone, and the Sabbath be over, that
we may ſet forth wheat, and keep our markets!</hi> Amos 8. 5.
weary of communion with God.</p>
            <p>Nay, and ſome ſay that it is demonſtrable, that if by
ſuppoſition an unregerate man were let into Heaven, he
would not take content there, could not poſſibly have
any delight in it; proving by this ſuppoſition, that if
one were in heaven that had not this divine grace, this
likeneſs with God, there would be no delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
there with him to abide; for both the happineſs of
the place is unproportionable to his ſenſuality, and the
holineſs of Gods preſence &amp; communion with him are as
unſuitable to him, as the glorious light of the Sun unto
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53665:42"/>
the eye of an owl, which he cannot bear, and is no more
deſirable then pearls that are caſt before a ſwine: For
things are to be meaſured not by the excellency of the
place it ſelf, but by the proportionableneſs of nature to
them: And therefore, as you deſire to find happineſs
and delight in heaven it ſelf when you die, ſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
you to get your corrupt natures changed and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
without which I do verily believe heaven it ſelf
would not be heaven unto you. Oh what a miſerable
caſe doth a corrupt and natural man live in, that would
not go to torment and perdition, and cannot go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and ſalvation, becauſe of the contrariety of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!</p>
            <p>Secondly, it appears, in that a carnal man delights to
do that which God hates, and prefers it, and is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
doth not tremble at his offence of God; <hi>They rejoyce
to do evil,</hi> Pro. 2. 14. And if any of you ſometimes find
them to be troubled for ſin, and to be in anguiſh, as it is
ordinary, it is but out of ſelf-love, being affrighted at
the puniſhment and torment, being willing to be rid of
them; for ſo the Devil is, <hi>Art thou come to torment us
before our time?</hi> but not at the offence of God, except
as of a Judge which hath the Law ready in his mouth,
not of God as a Father, which ſhews their fear to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
and ſervile fear hath torment in it, which love caſts
out, and not filial and ſon like, which love cauſes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it appears in the hatred they expreſs to the
Image of God, in whomſoever they ſee it: For as he
(and tis ſo all the world over, from the beginning to the
end) that was born after the fleſh (it is not a falling out
between man and man for a time) but he that was born
after the fleſh, perſecuted, or deſpiſed, or mocked him
that was born after the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. as then, ſo now,
that as they ſay, the Leopard or Tygre will expreſs their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53665:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hatred to man even in his picture, where they find it
they will tear it, in hatred unto man; you ſhall find it
ſo in the wicked carnal men of the world, whereever
they ſee the Image of God ſhine forth, they will be ſure
to tear and perſecute it; and therefore from that it may
be certainly concluded that they love not God: And
this is the contrariety that I charge upon corrupt nature
unto God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, why a natural man loves not God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, this rule may be the reaſon of it; he loves not
God at all that loves any thing more then God: I think
we ſhall ſet our ſelves into a very great ſtrait anon; an
underlove is accounted none at all; a woman would not
much account of the loue of a husband, if he loved one
woman in the world more then her ſelf; love will not
bear one more; <hi>He ſhall leave father and mother</hi> (ſaith the
Scripture) <hi>and cleave to his wife.</hi> How do you think
God will eſteem and account that love to him, if ſo be
your ſelves, or any creature in the world be loved above
him, or better then him? And therefore the love of God
then begins to be accounted lovely, and reckoned for
love, when it exceeds all other love: Its accounted by
the ſurpluſſage of it, that it hath above life and liberty,
above the world, and all the dear and near things of the
world; if you account it otherwiſe, you ſhall be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
As you account a thing to be weight, if it draw
the ſcale; for that that makes one ſcale weigh down the
other, that makes the weight; ſo though thou loveſt,
God in many reſpects, yet until it come to ſurpluſſage
and preponderation, God accounts not of it; for the
greater weight carries down the ſcale from him; for
while the ſcales ſtand even, it is not accounted weight:
And therefore every natural man that committeth forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation
with the creature, and is married to ſome one or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53665:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other luſt, hath no love to God, becauſe God is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed
by it: And this Doctrine our Saviour taught
in <hi>Matth. 10. 37. He that loveth, Father, Mother, ſon,
or daughter more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi> And the
reaſon is, while God and the creature are in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
while God ſtands not againſt us in any luſt of ours,
we know not whether we love God or our ſelves beſt;
but when they come into election, then its ſeen: As
while the ſcales ſtand upon the Counter, there is no ſight
which end is the weightier; but when you take the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
in hand, then you find which preponderates: So
when you come to particulars, either loſe this profit,
or Gods favour; while theſe ſtand in competition, there
is no knowledge, no ſight; but when you come to try,
your hearts and conſciences will quickly tell you; the
ballance doth not tell you which end the gold lies in,
and which the braſs, but where the moſt weight lies:
Every man tells himſelf that God is beſt to be loved,
and that end hath the gold in it; yet the choice of the
creature above God, ſhews that there lies moſt weight;
and thats pure intereſt and luſt that takes place with you.
Thus it is when God is weighed againſt luſt in a natural
mans beam; and therefore whatever you ſay in that
point, look to the election and choiſe of the heart, that
chuſes the creature before God, and ſhews that God is
leſs eſteemed then luſt, or a natural mans intereſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an unregenerate man cannot love God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he can have no aſſurance that God loves him firſt;
for that is a rule, 1 <hi>John 4. 19. We love him, becauſe he
loved us firſt:</hi> that is, to ordain and faſhion us unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life; the ſenſe and appearance whereof is hidden to
a natural man; and there muſt not only be a firſt love,
but alſo the ſenſe and knowledge of it, before it beget
a reciprocal and anſwerable love to God: And therefore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53665:43"/>
the love of God to his elect in their ſtate of nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
produce any love in them to God: why? becauſe
it muſt be a thing known; there muſt be day-break or
Sun-riſing, a work of effectual vocation and calling,
by which light you may ſee it; you can no more love
God, till not only you have his divine grace, but alſo
know it, then the pavement can be hot, or reflect heat
to make you hot, till the Sun hath ſhined upon it; no
more is it in your hearts to love God above ſelf, until the
love of God hath ſhined into your hearts, to make them
in love with him. And this is the ſecond thing, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of corrupt nature to God.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>7</label> THirdly, the contrariety of corrupt nature unto grace
is manifeſted in their mutual fight one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
(Remember that I go about to prove that there is
ſuch oppoſition of a natural man to God, as that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
convert himſelf, and come in to Chriſt to believe)
for neither will ſin give grace entrance &amp; admiſſion, nor
will allow it quiet poſſeſſion or dominion; but they are
always in unreconciliable war, while there are remains of
either: For as it was ſaid of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they
ſtrangely ſtrugled and wreſtled in their Mothers womb,
and ſhe went to the Oracle, and asked, <hi>Why is it thus with
me?</hi> it was anſwered in <hi>Gen. 25. 23. There are two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and two manner of people in thy womb.</hi> This ſets
forth to us grace and nature, fleſh and ſpirit, which in
the ſame womb of mans heart do fight and ſtruggle; and
if you will have the very words, it is in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5: 17. <hi>Theſe
are ſet one againſt another, the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit,
and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh:</hi> And theſe are of contrary
perſwaſions, principles, byaſſes, and affections; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is oppoſite to this grace, by reaſon that his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53665:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath firſt poſſeſſion, and having ſo, fights againſt
that grace that comes to take him captive to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;
and there can be no more compliance in a natural
man to comply with the grace of God, then between
fire and water: why? becauſe there is a contrariety;
every thing that is, be it of never ſo vile and baſe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
would be what it is, and hath no principle to aſpire
to a higher being: A ſpider cannot aſpire to a being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
her; a toad or ſerpent cannot wiſh (as I may ſay)
to be any thing then what they are; only man indeed
may aſpire to be worſe, and more contrary to God, but
never better; and therefore I ſee no reaſon that can be
given, why corruption ſhould deſire to change its eſtate
into the ſtate of grace: Corruption ſupplanted grace at
firſt, and is always prone to ſupplant grace again: Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
ſupplanted Gods Image at firſt, and is ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to do ſo again, but that through Chriſt grace
comes in, and ſupplants ſin in part, fighting down the
dominion of it, though not the exiſtence and being of
it: <hi>Sin dwells in me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; that look as
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> when he came to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> deſtroyed
all the Canaanitiſh Kings, but not all the Canaanites
and petty people; for they were left for good uſes, to
teach them humility, and to do Gods work upon them;
ſo if ever regenerating grace come into the heart of man,
it will certainly kill and ſubdue all kingſhip and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſin: <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, becauſe
you are not under the Law but grace:</hi> But yet all ſin is not
extinguiſhed; the Canaanites yet live: Sin dwels in the
people of God, but it dwels in them for good ends; for
if it had not been for good ends left, be confident it
ſhould not have been. There are two Uſes of it; for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
and for Conſolation: For though it be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
to every Chriſtian to draw the clog: <hi>Oh
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53665:44"/>
wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of death!</hi> Rom. 7. 14. yet it is a comfort when a
man finds this contrariety in him; he hath cauſe to
bleſs God that he is not all of a piece, that he is not all
fleſh, that there is <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in him: For it is not
the conqueſt that ſhews grace, but the fight or contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of grace unto corruption. And were it not that
grace had a ſtronger Second, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt and the
Spirit, as its delivered 1 <hi>John 4. 4. Greater is he that is
in you, then he that is in the world,</hi> it would be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and beaten out of the field every day; for tis as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put out as the light of the Sun would be put out by
any interpoſition, and would no longer live then a ſpark
of fire in the Ocean; but only God doth as well keep
it in, as bring it in at firſt by his mighty arm; for as to
heat the water you know there is need of fire, but not
to cool it; the nature of the water will out the heat:
And though the Sun gives light, yet there needs no
cauſe of darkneſs; for if the Sun ceaſe to ſhine, darkneſs
it ſelf returns, and comes into the Air, where it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
So the very ceſſation of the influences of the ſpirit,
if they ſhould but ceaſe, though there were no contrary
cauſes (as there are from the fleſh &amp; the world that infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
corruption) yet theſe corruptions would return, as the
firſt inhabitants in man, to which he is firſt principled;
ſo that it is the wonderful power of God that keeps
grace alive. Thats the third particular to prove this
Contrariety, that maintains the fight, and keeps out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
grace until the heart be made willing to receive it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Contrariety of corrupt nature unto
God, is manifeſted by this, that the holy Law of God
(which the Apoſtle calls holy, juſt, and good) makes ſin
more ſinful, and exaſperates it into a greater height;
and therefore thoſe men that live where the Law of God
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53665:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
comes cloſeſt to them in reproof and correction, are the
wickedſt men alive; that as you ſee by making of a
Dam the ſtream is raiſed, and the water fumes and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
beats againſt it; ſo when a reſtraint is put upon
the nature of man by the very Law of God, nature it
ſelf (I mean corrupt) becomes furious: And this point
is taught almoſt in a whole Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. whereof
excellent uſe may be made for a man to ſee his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Pauls</hi> glaſs, <hi>ver. 13. Was that which is good made
death to me? God forbid; but ſin, that it might appear ſin,
wrought death in me by that which is good, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
became exceeding ſinful.</hi> What a miſerable
creature is natural man! if God give him a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he is the worſe for it; there is a renitency, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
in the heart of man to the Law of God; that
moſt appears, in that we the leſs do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
becauſe he commands it; and we the rather do
that which God forbids, becauſe he forbids it. A horſe,
or ſtomackful colt, put the bridle on him, and he is mad;
let him run in the field, and he is quiet: Let the Sun
ſhine on a ſtinking dunghill, and it ſtinks the worſe, not
becauſe the Sun gives pollution by its heat, but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
makes the ſtink break forth ſo much the more.
Alas, when the Lord comes to put the bridle of reſtraint
on man, he is filld with more ſtomack and rage; and
when the ſweet Sun ſhines on him to invite him to God,
he is ſtill the worſe, and the rather evil; ſo little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
is there of mans heart with God: And as we
may truly ſay that Antipathies and Sympathies do ſhew
us very far into nature where they are found, as the
Schools do well obſerve; for a lamb to hate and fly
from, not this and that wolf, but every one, though it
never ſaw it before, which ſhews a general antipathy to
all wolves: So it is in this caſe; if there were a Law
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53665:45"/>
of God made known to any natural man, ſuch a Law
as he never ſaw nor heard of before, he would hate it,
and never comply with it; which ſhews the ſtone that
is in his heart, and manifeſts a rebellion in it againſt God:
As on the contrary, a Sympathy, an agreement: A ſoul
that loves and delights in the Law of God, though moſt
croſs to private intereſts, is a very excellent proof of
grace, that hath reconciled the enmity of the heart to
God, <hi>Rom. 7. 22. I delight in the Law of God concerning
the inner man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, the pleaſingneſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of the
heart with any luſt to which its taken by peculiar agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of nature, which is <hi>peccatum in deliciis,</hi> doth ſhew
this contrariety unto God; ſo long as this ſin of delight
continues his maſter-ſin, he will walk contrary to God,
ſay what you will. I confeſs every man cannot practice
every groſs ſin, as to be a drunkard, a whore-monger,
covetous, no more then one man at one time can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be ſick of all diſeaſes; but that ſin which takes him
up by natural propenſion, inclination, or cuſtome, or
whatever it be, that either takes acquaintance with, or
poſſeſſion of him, no ſuch man can come to Chriſt: He
himſelf tells them, <hi>How can ye believe, that are taken up
with worldly credit and ambition?</hi> John 5. 4. Let it be
any ſin, Covetouſneſs, Drunkenneſs, or Luſt, which he
feeds by other ſins, and ſerves as a maſter, to which he
is tyed as faſt as by a Cable, which he cannot break un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
divine grace appear to him, and cannot get off by any
power of his own, but Gods; no afflictions; though they
bray him as a fool in a morter, pound him to pieces, yet
his folly ſhall not depart from him; no vowes; though
he ſeem to bind himſelf never ſo firmly, nothing while
the luſt remains, will alter or change him; nay, ſet the
judgement of God and death eternal before his eyes, ye
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53665:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do nothing; the pleaſure of his ſin remains, <hi>Rom. 1. ult.
Who knowing the judgement of God, that they that commit
ſuch things are worthy of death, yet not only do the ſame, but
have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> Nay, would you think
that any mans ſin ſhould be ſo faſt rivetted in him, as that
it ſhould cauſe him to love death? He doth ſo <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tativè,</hi>
by Gods conſtruction and interpretation. <hi>Prov.</hi>
8. <hi>ult. He that ſinneth againſt me, hurteth his ſoul; and they
that hate me, love death.</hi> Now how filthy and abominable
is man (ſaith God) that drinks in iniquity like water!
comparing a natural man to a fiſh in the water, in its own
Element, from which you know he cannot be willingly
pulled to the dry bank; and therefore I conclude that
man is not willingly of himſelf brought into that eſtate,
though it be far better, yea a thouſand times better then
his own, until his nature be changed, and then he is
brought. And ſo much for the firſt branch, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of corrupt nature to God, to his Law, and to
his Grace.</p>
            <p>But whereas an Objection might be made, that man
is not ſo contrary to grace, becauſe that ſhews him life:
Certainly there is a greater oppoſition in the heart of
man to the grace of the Goſpel, then to the Law of
Duty, to humble man, and ſhew him that the work of
Converſion is from contrary to contrary: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let me make uſe of that which ſome ſay, that God
in creating the world drew the creatures out of nothing;
but in this new Creation, Converſion, he finds oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and contrariety in the ſubject that he works upon,
that bids him battel, and ſets him at defiance: The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
converts by new objects, and God by new natures,
until which, there is little done.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Branch of this oppoſition of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to God, we call enmity unto, or hatred of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53665:46"/>
ſelf; which I inſtance in, to ſhew that poiſon &amp; venom that
is in man, in every one of your beſt hearts in your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
condition unto the Lord God; you will not be known
of it in your ſelves: Hate God, may ſome ſay! there is
not one of us that take our ſelves to be haters of God,
but ſeem to defie all that hate God: But the Scripture
ſpeaks much of it; <hi>Them that hate me,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Exo.</hi>
20. 5. And he calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom. 1. 30. Haters of
God.</hi> And in handling of this point, I ſhall enter upon
that ſin which is diabolical. Firſt, Hatred is a part of
that diabolical malignity, which makes man like the
Devil; for when he overthrew man at the firſt, he
ſpawned into man a certain diabolical ſeed; not ſins of
ſenſuality and the fleſh, but malignity, and oppoſition,
and ſpight againſt God; this man is of a ſerpentine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
One man may be angry with another man; but a
Serpent hates the very nature of man: Anger is in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
hate in generals, ſay the Schools; ſo that this
ariſes higher then the other doth, into a hatred of God
himſelf. And then</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hatred differs from Contrariety in this: It
riſes from the conſideration of ſuch effects of juſtice
which are threatned or executed upon man againſt his
will, puniſhing him for ſin, and ſo cauſes hatred; but
Contrariety is to the holineſs of God and his Law, and
ſo is an oppoſite to Gods juſtice, and the effects of it;
for corruption is ſo deſperately carried againſt God, that
like the Devil, it hates God puniſhing and inflicting;
not peradventure as God is a benefactor and ſuſtainer of
nature, but he will not abide Gods vengeance on him:
Inſomuch that a man in his private retired thoughts hath
ſecret wiſhings in himſelf ſometimes that God were not,
looking upon the effects of the Juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>And this I will ſhew you in three Particulars: And
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53665:47"/>
oh that this might rifle your hearts, to go away from this
ſelf-love of yours, whereby the great God is ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed!</p>
            <p>Firſt, all the hate that is in man aganſt the Law, the
Holineſs, the Image of God, riſes originally from the
hate of God himſelf, there is the core of this diſeaſe;
you think if you hate man for the Image of God that is
in him, that you hate but man; but the root of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
lies in the hatred of God: Therefore Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
it, <hi>John 15. 17. If the world hate you, ye know it hated
me before it hated you.</hi> Men are aſhamed to ſee this
Fountain; but the malice of the Devil ſhews whence
this hatred doth ariſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, every corrupt man, more or leſs, holds the
truth of God in unrighteouſneſs, and doth as it were
keep it under a buſhel, <hi>Rom. 1. 18. The wrath of God is
revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſs
of men, that hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> That
is, that whereas there is a ſhining light that ſhines in man,
he hath common notions of right and wrong; this he
knows, but he will not let it breath out in practice, but
lets his affections and luſts impriſon and dam it up; he
will not let this light reſtrain his luſts: There is no man
living that lives up to his own light; he knows more
then he will practice and put forth to the glory of God,
in his place and family; and therefore there is wrath to
him. There is no man in this place, let him be never
ſo vile, but hath ſome beams of light, <hi>Amat lucentem,
edit arguentem;</hi> he loves the ſhining light, but hates the
reproving and convincing light. This alſo is the ſin of
the Devil.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this hatred appears in this; man is angry that
he may not ſin <hi>impune,</hi> and do what he will without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll;
and if he cannot, then he faſtens his hatred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53665:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God: God hath given him grace, but he would fain
enjoy and ſerve luſts and pleaſures freely, and would
have impunity not to be puniſhed; he would ſin and
eſcape, ſin and be ſaved, ſin and be happy; this is his
temper: And if the wrath of God be revealed, that he
cannot do ſo, then he is carried out to an utter hatred of
God himſelf; for if he could, he would continue and
go on in the height of his iniquity, and would not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
but could wiſh that God were out of his way:
If he could diſarm his juſtice, he would; and therefore
he can be content that God give life and being, and fuel
to maintain his luſts; but if he ſee that God come out
to puniſh, then he wiſhes with all his heart rather that
God were not, that there were no ſuch inflictor of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
upon man: Theſe are the ſecret thoughts, the
eruptions and belchings, ſecret breakings up of hatred
that are in the hearts of men to God: And if you ask for
an inſtance of it out of man, I can give none but the
Devil, that in all theſe three ſteps wiſhes that God were
not. And this I have briefly ſaid to ſhew the enmity of
man to God, that beſides ſenſual luſts, there ſhould be
ſuch a poiſon in his ſpirit againſt the holy God, which
we hear of often in the Scripture; the wiſdom of the fleſh
or appetite (call it what you will) in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
unto God; <hi>for it is not ſubject to the law of God</hi> (let
him be never ſo wiſe) <hi>nor indeed can be.</hi> And in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.
21. <hi>And you that were ſometimes alienated and enemies
in your minds by wicked works.</hi> And let no man marvel
at it; the reaſon is this, the love of God will not ſtand
with any thing that is better loved: If any thing be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
loved then God is, then it turns to hatred: <hi>Ye adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
and adultereſſes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtl, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4. mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worldly men, <hi>know you not that the friendſhip of the
world is enmity with God?</hi> Now if you recollect theſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53665:48"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:53665:49"/>
two Arguments, the Corruption and Contrariety that
is in natural man to God, and the Enmity that is in him,
I think you will ſay the firſt part is proved, <hi>That no man
can come to Chriſt,</hi> by reaſon uot only of the impotency,
but the oppoſition that is in him. This in general to
the Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>8</label> NOw I am to go on particulary to handle this Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
Firſt, mans unwillingneſs to believe and
come in to grace offered. Secondly, his reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
converting grace that offers it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt then I will ſhew you the unwillingneſs of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
natural man to accept of grace offered: And this is
a point wherein the demerit of man, and the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice of God thereupon doth appear without all
excuſe of mans ſelf, without all exception againſt the
Grace of God; for what exception can man make
againſt his condemnation that is willing to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
what excuſe can he make for his unbelief that is
unwilling to believe? that whereas all creatures in the
world do affect that moſt wherein their happineſs doth
lie, and are infinitely carryed towards it, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
whereof no creature can be indifferent: yet corrupt
ſinful man doth not only oppoſe the commands of God,
break his bonds aſunder and caſt his cords away, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
2. 2. but is alſo unwilling unto ſalvation, to which
he is invited by ſo many ſolicitations, to which he is
drawn by ſo many powerful arguments and perſwaſions
of the Word of God under the Goſpel as are afforded
him. And this is the point I handle;</p>
            <p>That man naturally is unwilling to be converted, to turn to
Chriſt, that he may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>I think you will hardly believe this point: But it may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53665:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
juſtly be ſaid he cannot come, becauſe he will not; for
in <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. this point is clearly proved; <hi>You will not
come to me that ye may have life.</hi> And it is the complaint
that our Saviour makes over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Mat. 13. 37. <hi>How
often would I have gathered thee, and ye would not!</hi> And in
<hi>Prov. 1. 24. I have called, and ye have refuſed; I have
ſtretched out my hands, and none regarded; you have ſet at
naught my counſel, and would have none of my reproof, but
have caſt my words behind your backs.</hi> Nay, <hi>you would have
none of me,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Pſal. 81. 11. Iſrael would none of
me.</hi> They that have not heard of ſalvation offered, do
not ſeek it; they to whom it hath been offered, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
it; and they to whom it is commended by all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
they have deſpiſed it.</p>
            <p>Converſion is as little beholding to the will of man as
to any thing; that whereas friends would have their
friends, and one relation would have another, when they
know Chriſt, they would have them know Chriſt alſo:
The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> called the whole Town out to
Chriſt: Converſion is leaſt beholding to the Queen of
Faculties, as they call the Will of man, which is rather
the ſlave of all the reſt, the Captain of rebellion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
man is unwilling to his own converſion and faith in
Chriſt Jeſus: And therefore it is ſaid in 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 13. We
are born of God, regenerate, not of blood, nor of the will of
the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but God.</hi> Thoſe that do
receive Chriſt, are born again: But this regeneration is
denied, Firſt, to a natural inſtinct, <hi>not of blood.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to a carnal principle, <hi>not of the will of the fleſh.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to any moral rational principle, <hi>not of the will of man.</hi>
But it is affirmed to be an influence of God, as its ſaid,
<hi>but of God.</hi> There can be no juſt reaſon given that man
ſhould be unwilling to come to Chriſt, or to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for no man can give any reaſon againſt the chief
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53665:50"/>
good, or the only means that may ſerve to that end:
Mans happineſs lies in the enjoying of God; and the
means tending thereunto, is coming to, and cloſing with
Chriſt Jeſus: But there may be reaſon from the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and miſchievous corruption of man, that doth, and
will, and can do nothing elſe but walk contrary to his
own happineſs; the Bow is made to hit the mark, but
yet ſometimes (as we ſay) it muſt needs miſs; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
muſt be taken from the crookedneſs and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Bow: So it is with man, he is made to be
happy in the enjoyment of God by this one means of
coming to Chriſt; yet he muſt needs ſometime miſs;
the reaſon muſt be taken from the deceitfulneſs of the
heart of man, that is poſſeſt with vanity, folly, pride, and
luſt. This is the point then, the unwillingneſs of man
to his own Converſion.</p>
            <p>And firſt in General I ſhall lay down this Reaſon for
it, that is the ſumm of all reaſons;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That every man by nature is forelaid with ſome impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and obſtructions that prohibit his cloſure with Chriſt,
and that Goſpel-way of ſalvation by the faith of Chriſt.</hi> He
fights againſt it, he oppoſes it, he is unwilling unto it:
Corrupt man fights againſt theſe two things, the holy
Law of God, and the Goſpel: He fights againſt the law
of God, in maintenance of ſin, luſt, and corruption;
he fights againſt Chriſt and Goſpel-grace as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Law: And this he doth in maintenance of
that we call <hi>ſelf;</hi> and of the two this is the ſharper op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
For the firſt deſire of mans heart is to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and to ſeek himſelf, and to maintain himſelf from
all manner of captivity; and therefore the Apoſtle tells
us, <hi>That there is might in this arm of God to bring every
thought in us into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt:</hi> To
whom he would not come, if he could preſerve that ſelf
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53665:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is in him; in the maintenance whereof he is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to accept of the grace of the Goſpel when its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>And this point ſhall be thus handled. Firſt, what I
mean by the Goſpel-way of Salvation; theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the one and only way of the ſalvation of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
is that which is brought to light by the doctrine of
the Goſpel: Moral doctrine teaches reformation of life
according to principles of vertue; but this which is called
the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. is
that only which is the Jubilee-Trumpet, proclaming the
acceptable year of the Lord, the day of ſalvation: In al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
to which its ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 89. 15. Bleſſed are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that hear the joyful ſound; for thereby is brought life
and immortality to light,</hi> viz. <hi>through the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Tim.
1. 10. ſhewing that life and immortality are hid, and in
the dark to all the world, until they be brought to light
by Goſpel-doctrine: <hi>For therein is the righteouſneſs of
God revealed,</hi> Rom. 1. 17. The way of Gods making
righteous, or juſtification of man, is revealed and made
known to man by the doctrine of the Goſpel: For as
the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> (may be) might know
that there was a promiſe of deliverance; but whether
they ſhould deliver themſelves, or that <hi>Moſes,</hi> an exile
and caſt-out, was the man to deliver them, that they
knew not: So that Chriſt is that <hi>Moſes</hi> which was to
be manifeſted to Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to bring loft man out of
damnation, from Egyptian ſlavery under which he was,
its only brought to light by the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by this doctrine Chriſt is ſet forth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of a ſinner, and the root of ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, acknowledging Chriſt to be the tree of life,
into which all that are ſaved muſt be tranſplanted from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53665:51"/>
off the tree of corruption whereon they naturally grow:
For Chriſt and a Believer make but one body; Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
they have none at all but what they have
through him; ſpiritual and eternal life they have none
but what they have from him, as is ſhewn in <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 24. by a compariſon given of the branches of the
tree: <hi>Thou wert cut off from the Olive-tree wild by nature,
and wert grafted contrary to nature in the good Olive-tree:</hi>
Where you ſee that converſion of a man to Chriſt and
Goſpel-grace is compared to an ingrafting contrary unto
nature; for the graft grows not naturally, but contrary to
nature; ſo that there muſt be a tranſplantation, a cutting
off man from the Crab-tree of natural corruption, that
he may, contrary to nature, be planted into Chriſt Jeſus,
unto which work, that man is unwilling, may appear by
theſe two expreſſions, <hi>Thou wert cut off,</hi> and <hi>To be graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
contrary to nature:</hi> For to be cut off by ſharpneſs from
a condition to which a man is naturalized, though it be
worſe, and to be ingrafted contrary to nature, though
into a better, man cannot be willing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is not willing to this way of ſalvation
by tranſplantation into Chriſt, upon theſe grounds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe this way of ſalvation is out of his ſight;
for nature and the wiſdom of it doth not teach it him;
though there be the greateſt ſagacity and quickneſs of
ſcent in natural wiſdom that you can imagine; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reveal Gods giving Jeſus Chriſt the Lord to man;
there can be no willingneſs to receive that which is not
known; the greateſt wiſdom accounts it fooliſhneſs:
Thoſe two words are taken for one and the ſame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of God,
neither can know them.</hi> Receiving is an act of faith and
believing, and goes not before knowing; for being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of Gods righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. thats the way
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53665:51"/>
of Gods making man righteous; <hi>ignoti nulla cupido:</hi>
And therefore as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs did not know
that the Serpent on the pole ſhould heal the mortal ſting
and biting of the fiery Serpent, till it was ſet up; ſo
Chriſt did as much lie out of the way of manifeſtation
for mans wiſdom to find out; neither could it be known
to a natural man, before it had been revealed to him by
the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon ariſes thus: As in nature they
ſay there is no vacuity, but every place in the whole
world is full of ſomewhat, until there come ſome other
matter to expel it; now ſo is it with the heart of man;
its taken np with corruption, and poſſeſt, till the grace
of God come and drive that out, and extirpate that
which is in poſſeſſion already: For the heart is not as a
thing wherein there is nothing of God, or ſin; but every
man living, his heart is blotted with corruption, before
it be written upon with the Law: <hi>I will write my Law in
yonr hearts,</hi> ſaith God when he regenerates any man; for
the heart of no man is <hi>raſa tabula,</hi> a white paper, that is
neither good or bad; but is like a pair of ſcales not
empty, it inclines one way or other: Now ſuppoſing a
natural man blotted with corruption, and ſin is firſt in
poſſeſſion; then there is this rule, that as the inclination
of every thing is, ſo is the appetite of it; for the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
follows not the goodneſs of the object, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the creature as that that doth deſire it; as
the ſtomack vitiated, deſires not the moſt wholſom food,
but longs, and hath an appetite after coals and aſhes, and
that becauſe it is full of humours: Its not the goodneſs
of the thing, but the inclination draws out deſire; ſo
the will of man being ſowred with corrupt ferment, wills
not, deſires not grace, but follows the Byas or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of that humour that hath corrupted it: And
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53665:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this the Scripture ſpeaking of every man by nature cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
principled, ſaith, he cannot act contrary to that
principle which inclines him to ſin; he cannot will that
which is againſt that inclination that doth poſſeſs him,
and diſiinclines him to do good, <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. 8. So then they
that are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God: He ſaith, they
cannot; the principle that inclines them to act is fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and therefore the appetite cannot be ſpiritual: A
will on the contrary to that which is good, is made the
property, and follows upon regenerating grace, <hi>Pſalm</hi>
110. 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi>
Meaning in that day that the Lord ſhall ſhew his power
upon the will, to draw it, and ingraft another principle
on the heart; then a man ſhall come, and not till then:
<hi>And then to will is preſent with me,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. when there is this principle laid; every appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
follows the inclination; as the inclination moves, ſo
the appetite doth; and becauſe this is corrupt in natural
man, therefore it cannot will good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a man is naturally enamoured with a pleaſing
apprehenſion of ſome righteouſneſs of his own; not
only ſome, but every man naturally is of this opinion,
and therefore is not willing to come to Chriſt; and
while he is filld with this opinion, and pleaſed with this
apprehenſion that he hath ſomewhat of his own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he ſhall be righteous with God, ſo long he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to take in this righteouſneſs of Chriſt: no more then
a Merchant is to caſt his loading into the Sea, until he ſee
the neceſſity of life require it; ſo will not the natural
man, until he ſee a neceſſity of this righteouſneſs unto
eternal life; and therefore ſo long as he can patch up
any ſhelter to himſelf out of the fragments of his own
hopes, he doth not ſubmit himſelf to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 10. 3. They went
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53665:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and ſubmitted not
unto the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> As a Manſlayer under the
Law would not fly from his own houſe unto the City
of refuge, until the avenger of blood threatned him; ſo
no man until he hear the voice of Gods wrath, and the
malediction of the Law, will take his heels to fly from
his own righteouſneſs, but will lie quiet there: This
ſelf-ſomethingneſs is predominant in every man that
lives, until Chriſt be found; and in it, man places his
gains as the Scripture calls it, <hi>viz.</hi> the arguments of his
confidence, as S<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul</hi> in his natural eſtate did: <hi>Thoſe
things th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t were gain to me, I accounted loſs for Chriſt,</hi>
Phil. 3. 7. Thoſe things that were gain to me in my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
eſtate; which ſtopt and hindred <hi>Paul,</hi> made him ſo
oppoſite when they ſtood in his way, and appeared gain
to him; theſe he accounted loſs upon the diſcovery of
Chriſt: And ſo you finde in the Goſpel, men naturally
ſet upon doing, and to have ſomewhat of themſelves.
<hi>Maſter, what ſhall we do, that we may work the works of
God?</hi> And, <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do, that I may inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
eternal life?</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 6. 28. Mark 10. 17.</note> As if they made no other queſtion but
the way of ſalvation lay in doing: <hi>This is the work of
God</hi> (ſaid our Saviour) <hi>that you believe in him whom
he hath ſent,</hi> John 6. 29. anſwering them in their own
words to their own queſtion. And the Nation of the
<hi>Jewes</hi> do make us an example of the invalidity of our
own works: <hi>They which followed after the Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
have not attained,</hi> Rom. 9. 31. And the <hi>Gentils</hi>
make an example of the ſufficiency and neceſſity of faith
in Chriſt: <hi>They believed when Chriſt was preached unto
them, and attained righteouſneſs, becauſe they did not ſeek it
by the works of the law, but by faith,</hi> ver. 31.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why every man naturally and willingly
doth build himſelf upon this falſe bottom, which makes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53665:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him unwilling to come to this Goſpel-way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that God hath revealed by Chriſt, is;</p>
            <p>Firſt, every man will have ſome ſhelter for himſelf;
when a man ſees his own nakedneſs, fear and ſhame will
drive him to ſeek a cover, though they be but fig-leaves,
as <hi>Adam</hi> did when he felt himſelf naked: The cobweb
ſerves the ſpider, and the ſhell the ſnail; every man
hath ſomewhat to cover his nakedneſs, that he thinks
may ſhelter him. And then</p>
            <p>Secondly, this is the uſual ſhelter. Firſt, becauſe it
is your own: <hi>They went about to eſtabliſh their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
Rom. 10. 3. <hi>their own:</hi> For we all love our own
things, even becauſe they are our own; there is in every
natural man ſomthing that he cals his own: This he puts
in the place of Chriſt, until he be throughly &amp; ſoundly
convincd to receive him: And therefore it is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of a man that hath truly found Chriſt, when he
is come ſo far as to quit his own for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God which is by faith, when he is able to look
on that as dung and droſs, and to loſe it all for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
this is that which is his ſtrong hold, becauſe it
ſeems the moſt natural and rational way to a natural
man: Ask a man how he ſhall be ſaved; he can inſtance
in nothing but the way of his own works; for this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the condition of the firſt Covenant made with man,
<hi>Do this and live,</hi> it ſticks ſtill in his teeth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſtill gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pes after this old door, ſtill harping on
this <hi>Doing and live:</hi> Its natural to him. And then</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it makes you, and the beſt of you unwilling,
becauſe there is in this way a maintenance of pride and
boaſting: The Peacock may here ſpread his tail; in this
way I can maintain ſelf: And therefore its ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.
17. that glorying is not excluded by the Law of works,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53665:53"/>
not ſo; it maintains ſome ſtring uncut that upholds a man
on his own bottom. This for theſe reaſons being mans
darling, is the cauſe that he is unwilling and averſe to
take the Goſpel-way, which ſets up another righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that pulls down this; and that makes him cry up
his own <hi>Diana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, when Chriſt is holden forth to a natural
man that oppoſeth himſelf, you muſt know that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
is made to a man in his ſtrong holds: Every natural
man is fortified beforehand againſt the knowledge of
Chriſt Jeſus; and you know, if men come to a ſtrong
hold, and offer fair conditions while it is tenable, and
they within be able to hold it, they are unwilling to
yield; man is unwilling, being fortified, to take in the
Conquerour: Now every natural man is fortified, and
till he be brought to exigents, or diſmantled, he will
ſtand it out; for he is not willing to admit the contrary
party; every man by nature is ſelf-content, and ſelf-ſufficient:
no ſo poor creature, that is without his den
or hold; now before that the thoughts be every of them
brought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt, as
Converſion is called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. he will never come
in, until the Lord Jeſus by the Word of the Goſpel,
and the power of the Spirit, hath pulld down and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled
theſe ſtrong holds, reaſoning high things: For
always when you are converted, and Chriſt enters into
the ſoul, he enters like a Conquerour at a breach in the
wall; until this breach be made, he that conquers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter, neither ſhall he prevail; until then, men will
not admit him. There is a refuge of lyes that men make
to themſelves, an they hide themſelves under falſhood,
<hi>Iſa. 28. 15. Therefore</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will lay a Cornor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
a ſure foundation,</hi> ver. 16. But this is not accepted
by them that have other holds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53665:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fifthly, man is unwilling to come to Chriſt, becauſe
the receiving of his righteouſneſs and of his yoke, layes
low both pride and ſelf, and abaſeth theſe which are the
two chief corruptions in the heart of man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proud man moſt of all oppoſes and hates Goſpel-Religion,
which of all Religions that ever were, hath
this glory, That it moſt tramples upon proud ſelf, and
calls for poverty of ſpirit, ſelf-denial, and forſaking all
deareſt things: And for this reaſon men a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſo unwilling
to accept of this way of ſalvation, and had rather ſuffer,
and bleed, and lay out themſelves, wherein they may be
ſomebody, then only take ſuch a profeſſion upon them
which makes them no body, and leaves them neither me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
nor glory: How far will merit, credit, and glory, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the heart of man in any doing or ſuffering? But the
propoſal of this free grace of God, which draws all the
water to another mill, and muſt let Chriſt be my Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note>
my Righteouſneſs, my Sanctification and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
that is hard to digeſt, becauſe that cruſhes the
head of our pride, and of being ſomething in our own
eyes. What poor draughts of men did Chriſt make by
his preaching, until he was lift up, and by his Spirit drew
men by conviction? For firſt his uſual doctrine of ſelf-denial,
of forſaking all for Chriſt, hath no ſhew to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
eye.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the very way of Goſpel-ſalvation is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that it proclames the man that is ſaved, a beggar,
a meer nothing; for the richer he is, the more he owes
to the free grace of God; and the more he receives, the
more he is in debt; and the more duties he doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
the leſs the merit, becauſe he hath received it from
God; and Faith, which is his chief grace, is a beggarly
grace; for the nature of it lies in meer receiving, and
taking; <hi>to as many as received him, John</hi> 1. 12. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53665:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon another for every drop of ſap and life; and
hath it not from its own root, but from another, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 18. <hi>Thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, this Goſpel-way of Salvation leaves no
power of your own to make any difference between your
ſelves and them that periſh: <hi>Who made thee to differ from
another? and what haſt thou that thou diddeſt not receive?</hi>
1 Cor. 4. 7.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, you are bound to acknowledge the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and receiving of all unto another hand; not your
working, but Chriſts giving hand: And the reaſon is,
<hi>That he that glories, may glory in the Lord;</hi> leaving by this
acknowledgement no manner of glorying to himſelf,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. And then</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that you may ſee the Lord will cruſh all pride,
he is obliged by his receits from Chriſt, to live to Chriſt,
and not to live unto himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. He died for all,
that they that live, ſhould not henceforth live unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but to him that died for them.</hi> Enlarge theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
upon your own thoughts; God hath cruſht pride
and ſelf in this Goſpel-way of Salvation, and therefore
it is ſo unacceptable to man, until he be made willing to it
by Grace: And all this gives the firſt and general Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of mans unwillingneſs to come in to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>9</label>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> SEcondly, the heart is not willing to come unto, and
give it ſelf up to Chriſt, until the mind be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by ſuch a conviction as brings every thought into
captivity to the obedience of Chriſt, as the phraſe is,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. which until it be done, the man remains in
his oppoſition and unwillingneſs: And this I conceive
to be the meaning of that in <hi>Job, Job</hi> 21. 14. where
having deſcribed a man at eaſe, and peace, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53665:55"/>
in himſelf (that is not ſick of ſelf) therefore they ſay
unto God, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge
of thy wayes: What is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve
him, and what profit is it that we pray to him?</hi> Doth any
man ſay unto God, Depart? The Scripture brings in
oftentimes what the heart ſaith within it ſelf; not that
any man is ſo impudent and brazen-fac'd, as to ſay to
God, Depart; but this the proudeſt heart of all doth
do: And this Conviction is twofold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, this Conviction is of our loſt, hopeleſs and
helpleſs condition in our ſelves: But let me tell you, we
are not preſently, fully and duly convinced, when we ſee
and own our ſins; the reaſon is, becauſe the ſight of ſin
drives a man unto his ſhifts, drives him to his harbour,
to his refuge of lyes, his own works, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and helps; it doth but drive him from ſin unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing that holds him as faſt. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaw his
ſickneſs, and <hi>Judah</hi> ſaw his wound, then went <hi>Ephraim</hi>
to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and ſent to King <hi>Jar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b;</hi> yet could he
not heal you, nor cure your wound, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5. 13. Let
that be an inſtance in the caſe: When <hi>Ephraim</hi> and the
ten T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibes ſaw that they were ſmitten, and in miſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
and like to be led into captivity, the ſight of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
drove them to ſhelter and refuge, as the hunted beaſt
flies to his den and covert where he hides himſelf; for
he is not alwayes caught when hunted: So the heart of
man, when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Law goes out againſt him, and thunders
the wrath of God in his face, and he is convinc'd of this,
and ſees it, is driven to its refuge: But this is requiſite
to full conviction, that a man be (as they ſay) digg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
out of his borough, unkenneld, and all his refuges diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led
and pulld down about his ears, humbled out of
his refuges as well as out of the guilt of ſin: And this is
taught you in the parable of the loſt Son, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 12, 13.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53665:55"/>
When all was ſpent, and the famine came, he began to be
in want; yet he went and joyned himſelf to a Citizen
of that far Country, to relieve himſelf by feeding ſwine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The meaning is, when a man begins to be pincht
with the ſenſe of his loſt condition, and is in want of a
ſhelter, he doth make ſhifts, he flies to ſome refuges of
his own to ſupport his conſcience, and relieve his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:
And mark it, he takes hold of a Citizen, that
keeps him in a far Country, if he would maintain him,
he would live there ſtill: If by your refuges you can
gain to relieve your ſelves, you will keep off from God
ſtill: But when he was beaten from his refuges, as well
as whipt by famine, then (ſaith the Text) he came to
himſelf, and began to think of plenty in his Fathers
houſe; ſhewing, that until poor ſinners be not only
humbled under the ſmart of ſin, but driven from all
ſhelters and refuges, he will not think of the riches of
that God and Father whom he hath offended, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
uſe all means to ſtay in that far Country; but
when he is beaten from all, then he is reſolved for God.
You have the like ſaying to this in <hi>Hoſ: 2. 6. Therefore I
will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that ſhe
ſhall not find her paths:</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>And ſhe ſhall follow her
Lovers, but ſhall not overtake them; ſhall ſeek them; but
ſhall not find them: Then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and return
to my firſt husband; for then it was better with me then now.</hi>
A true Embleme of a man caſt out of all content and
poſſible relief; he finds no contentment in ſin, but a
pricking and ſharpneſs: He ſhall follow his Lovers; but
the plaiſter will not be wide enough for the wound, he
ſhall not finde them, ſhall not overtake contentment;
he ſeeks his Lovers, but is not relieved by them: Then
the Conviction becomes full, and he reſolves to take
up with God as beſt. And then</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:53665:56"/>
Secondly, this Conviction is of the fulneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
the ſufficiency and fitneſs of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>That
he is able to ſave to the-utmoſt all that come to God by him,</hi>
Heb. 7. 25. And upon theſe two hinges hangs this full
and thorough Conviction. Of which, I have to ſay
four things, that I may not leave that Argument, till I
have brought it to a Concluſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that this Conviction muſt go before the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and acceptance of the will, becauſe it leads unto
this willingneſs and reſolution, as its ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 6. 40.
<hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that whoſoever ſees the
Son, and believes on him, ſhould have eternal life.</hi> The firſt
thing is ſeeing of Chriſt, that is, convictively; and this
believing follows after, and is ſomewhat more then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
They that oppoſe themſelves, muſt be inſtructed,
that by repentance given they may recover themſelves
out of the ſnare of the Devil, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 25, 26. That
they may recover and awaken themſelves ont of their ſleep:</hi>
Till they have this inſtruction they are captives, and
oppoſe themſelves. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his time, ſpeaks of
ſome Erroniſts (that did in his time as now in ours) <hi>ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo
docere,</hi> teach by perſwaſions, and wooing their
credulous Proſelytes; whereas they ſhould <hi>docendo ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi>
firſt teach by Conviction, and then perſwade men;
not childiſhly, to perſwade before you have convinc'd;
for when you have convinc'd, the perſwaſion is half made:
Thats the method of dealing with men as men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the will of man naturally follows the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the underſtanding, and of the mind: The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
is like the ſeeing man that rides upon the
ſhoulders of the blind but going man; the will moves,
but it ſees not; the underſtanding doth not move the
man fully and wholly, but ſees the way; for the will of
man is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a rational appetite led by reaſon: The
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53665:56"/>
ancient Divines and Philoſophers had a ſaying, <hi>Every
evil man errs</hi> (And by that ſaying they prove that the
conviction of the underſtanding muſt lead the will:)
or, as <hi>Solomons</hi> phraſe is, <hi>is a fool:</hi> For if he did not err
in judgement, if he had ſo much light to guide him and
lead him, he could not be wicked in his choiſe, or miſelect:
But there is an errour in all ſin, an errour in the mind,
whereby not being fully convinc'd of truth, it leaves the
will to miſchuſe, under the ſpecious choiſe of good, to
chuſe that which is evil. I know in theſe latter dayes
ſome of the Schools have chopt the underſtanding and
the will, not into divers acts upon ſeveral reſpective ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
Truth and Goodneſs; but into divers faculties,
that I believe they will never be able to prove, and
for my part I will not diſpute; only this I tell you,
whenever God commands light to ſhine out of darkneſs,
and ſhines into your hearts the knowledge of himſelf by
the faith of Chriſt Jeſus, this is by conviction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
6. <hi>as in the Creation a light begotten ſhined out of darkneſs.</hi>
And by this light he cures the darkneſs of the mind,
and the enmity of the will; by which means, when a man
is fully and duly convinc'd, he comes and receives Chriſt
Jeſus the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, till the light of Conviction do premonſtrate
Chriſt in his glorious beauty, goodneſs, truth, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
to the ſoul, or in all thoſe glories that render him
eligible, whereby he may draw your hearts unto him,
there is no willingneſs in mans heart to accept or receive
him: For (the reaſon is) by the natural light of mans
own reaſon and underſtanding, though there be never
ſo much ſagacity in them, Chriſt and the things of God
have no more ſhew to the eye of man, then the moſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
colours have by moon or torch-light, which lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
prejudices, and vility, and miſapprehenſions; and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53665:57"/>
ſo much as they loſe of their beauty, ſo much they come
ſhort of their convictiveneſs; becauſe, as the <hi>medium</hi> is
the cauſe why a ſtrait ſtaff in the water appears to my
eye crooked, and otherwiſe then it is, it is not crooked;
but becauſe I look through that <hi>medium,</hi> the ſtaff ſeems
to be ſo, and is ſo to me: Juſt ſo to the eye of a natural
man, looking not through the <hi>medium</hi> of this light of
divine grace, and the conviction of the Spirit, but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the natural reaſon and underſtanding of man, the
excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> calls it,
looks poor to a natural man;<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8. 1. Cor. 3. 19.</note> wiſdom to him is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs;
and that mean ſhew of Chriſt through a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<hi>medium,</hi> is the reaſon why we deſpiſe and contemn
him: And therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. ſpeaking of Chriſt,
and how he ſhould come into the world, <hi>He hath no form
and comelineſs:</hi> And when we ſhall ſee him, looking
on Chriſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> did who were not convinc'd, <hi>there
is no comelineſs in him, that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> But was
it ſo with all? thoſe that were enlightned, convinc'd by
this light commanded to ſhine out of darkneſs? No,
<hi>We ſaw his glory,</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 1. 24. though vailed under
fleſh, <hi>as the glory of the only begotten Son of God:</hi> ſaw his
glory under all diſadvantages and vails; but the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſaw no comelineſs in him to deſire him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 23. Chriſt crucified is to the Jews a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
block;</hi> they took offence at him: <hi>and to the Greeks
fooliſhneſs;</hi> they ſaw nothing in him. But how is he to
us that are called both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Greeks?</hi> Chriſt, the
wiſdom of God, and the power of God; ſuch difference
is made by the <hi>medium,</hi> or by the eye that ſees Chriſt in
his own light; there is to us an excellent beauty in him.
For</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the light by which God ſhines into the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53665:57"/>
heart, doth make every man that hath it, willing to come
to Chriſt; and every man left to the eye and natural
light of the own reaſon and underſtanding, is left unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to come to him: Every man that is thus drawn doth
come, and none elſe; and ſo every man that is a natural
man, and hath no other light then that, is unwilling;
and every man that hath this divine light ſhining in him
(for it is not acquired) convincing him, is the thereby made
willing to come to Chriſt: <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the
living God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 16. 16, 17. <hi>Beſſed art thou
Simon, this ſaving knowledge is not revealed by fleſh and
blood,</hi> the light of natural underſtanding, or of reaſon,
<hi>but my Father:</hi> And the verſes following my Text, ſay,
<hi>That every man that hath heard or learned of the Father,
or hath learned me of the Father, comes to me,</hi> and therefore
is made willing to come. Oh that I could affect you with
this difference between light and light, this light of
divine teaching, and that you have by the teaching of
books and miniſtery alone; for (this is the great reaſon
of all) Chriſt being given to mankind, without being
found out by mans wit and reaſon, hath a ſpirit of his
own that leads him into mans mind by a peculiar light:
in which light of his own, thoſe that do not ſee him,
ſhall never be willing to come to him: that is, to give
themſelves up to him; for he can never be known by
a natural light ſavingly: Let Schollars and Learned
men ſay what they will, this is no frantick reaſon.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, Naturally man is unwilling to come to Chriſt;
becauſe the conditions required of him that comes to
him are hard and to nature intolerable: It is the terms
that make him unacceptable: for you know this in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
it is the terms that make the bargain unpleaſing;
for if there be a commodity to be had, yet it makes a
man unwilling to buy if the price be too high. It is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53665:58"/>
very hard to bring the heart of man to the terms of the
Goſpel; that's the ſum of what I would ſay on this
reaſon: which though (for you may miſtake) it require
nothing by way of merit or price; for the grace is free; yet
by way of fitneſs which is called worthineſs or ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſpirit to a Chriſtian condition, the terms are
hard to a natural man, and therefore its ſaid in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 3.
<hi>They that were bidden would not come:</hi> and <hi>ver. 5. they
made light of it:</hi> here you ſee there is an averſneſs in the
will of man; and yet notwithſtanding this text doth not
expreſs hard conditions; they were only open and other
of theſe outward things that diverted and turned them
aſide: Chriſt in his preaching propounded himſelf on
hard conditions; and that's the reaſon, that unto natural
men that were averſe to it, it was ſo diſreliſht; I need
not ſtand to ſhew what conditions he offered himſelf
upon. <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf
and take up his Croſs daily,</hi> Mark 8. 34. <hi>Whoſoever he be
that forſaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Diſciple,</hi>
Luke 14. 33. And <hi>one thing thou lackeſt; Go ſell al
that thou haſt, and give to the poor, and come and follow me,</hi>
Luke 18. 22. This was a condition hard as he himſelf
confeſſes; and ſuch as is not alwayes in ſpecie required
of you. It was impoſſible to that man under that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpirit: you ſee by this taſt, that Chriſt put men to it
by propounding hard conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Indeed in thoſe times and the ſucceeding, when
the Croſs fell ſo heavy upon Chriſtians, it was ſo: firſt,
from the Jew, and ſecondly, from the Empire: but is it
ſo now?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that in all times that are or ever
ſhall be, I am perſwaded the terms and conditions of
Chriſtianity in truth profeſt, will be very hard to fleſh
and blood to the worlds end: (<hi>I would not flatter you with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53665:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fleſhly eaſe</hi>) for there is more ſelf-denyal required to this
profeſſion then to any (and leſs ſhewn) and of all things
that is moſt neceſſary to the plantation of faith in
Chriſt; and then there is a divorce of the affections,
the looſening of them from pleaſant ſins and luſts: if he
will be a Chriſtian, there is required a cloſe ſubjection
to holineſs, and a reſolution to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollow the commands:
and a poſſibility of ſuffering the loſs of deareſt things,
yea even of life it ſelf; ſo that the conditions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
are hard and as impoſſible for the heart, not
drawn, to cloſe with, as for Iron to move upward thats
not toucht with the loadſtone, or a tree to pull it ſelf up
by the roots from the ſoil to which it is naturalized:
therefore our Saviour ſpeaking of the conditions he had
propounded, ſaith, <hi>with man indeed it is not poſſible,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 26.</note> 
               <hi>but
with God all things are poſſible;</hi> and the reaſon of all is
this: Chriſt commands thoſe things from his people
that nature is moſt enamoured of; ſuch as life, ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
pleaſant luſts, deareſt enjoyments: and why
theſe? I will ſhew you reaſon for it; firſt, that ſo he
may try our faith and love to be towards him above all:
which he cannot try with the loſs of petty things: And
ſecondly, that he may hold us firm to himſelf, by cutting
off every ſtring; for if any of thoſe ſtrings which
he will have cut, ſhould hold us to the world and
to our ſelves, when the competition comes between
them and Chriſt, they will hold you where you are and
make you loſe Chriſt Jeſus; and ſo it is in mercy to
us, that we are ſtript of all other things which might
have diverted us from Chriſt:<note place="margin">Exod. 10. 26.</note> 
               <hi>that not a hoof is left in</hi>
Egypt <hi>to put us in mind of returning: nor any bunch on the
Camels back that may hinder his going through a ſtrait,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 24.</note> as
our Saviour hints the compariſon: And theſe hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
are reaſonably required of us, becauſe he hath
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53665:59"/>
for us overgone and overdone all the world; nay if
there were a thouſand worlds, he hath overdone them
all: and therefore if he requires conditions that are hard
to fleſh and blood, they are but reaſonably required: and
the Apoſtle inſiſts upon this reaſon in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
one would dye for a good man; that is, a
Benefactor, one that is good to him; ſome ſuch may
be found: but for a righteous man one will ſcarcely
dye that hath not been to him a Benefactor: But the
Lord Chriſt hath overdone all; in that when we were
ſinners and enemies (and no man will dye for an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my)
he dyed for us, and thereby hath obliged us to
take ſuch conditions from him as he will propound; the
Lord ſettle it in all our hearts.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, Men are unwilling to come to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
becauſe of thoſe prejudices that are found againſt
him; for as I ſaid before (I think you will bate me that
expreſſion) the Lord Jeſus was the moſt ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that ever lived on earth; that is, he afforded more
ſcandals and offences unto the reaſon of man, then ever
man did: not juſtly, but by the miſtake and miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of mans reaſon: how often doth he ſay? Bleſſed
are they that are not prejudiced at me;<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 6. Marke 6. 3. Luke 7. 23. &amp;c.</note> his perſon, his
parentage, his mean life, his death on the Croſs between
two thieves; and therefore the Apoſtle calls it the
ſcandal of the Croſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 11. His appearance, life,
death, and doctrine, all to carnal reaſon ſo unlikely and
unſuitable to ſuch a perſon and officer as indeed he was:
nay the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes it general to all that believe
not in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8. He is a pretious ſtone to them
that believe; and a ſtone of ſtumbling and rock of
offence to them that ſtumble at the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereat
men daſh, firſt their reaſon, and then themſelves to
pieces. According as the light is wherein men ſee him,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53665:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo he is either a pretious ſtone or a rock of offence: and
let me ſay it again, the ſweeteſt promiſes in Chriſt Jeſus
have no more ſhew to a natural light, then a Pearl or
Diamond have to a ſwine, or as a delicate colour ſeen by
the light of a ruſh candle: and on the contrary, the
hardeſt conditions ſeen by the light of faith the attractive
light whereby God irradiates the mind, in order to
Chriſt, theſe are deſireable and have an admirable luſtre
in them above all the beauties in the world; as an
Egyptian (for I would reaſon this point out of Scripture)
thought the glory of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court admirable (as may
be you might do) but as for <hi>Moſes</hi> that lookt upon it
with another eye, he eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt
greater riches, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. ſhewing that as the eye is
that looks on theſe things, ſo is the will captivated:
And this weight of glory (as it is called) that is in Chriſt
Jeſus,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> is made more weighty; for that is but a Scripture
alluſion; Glory is weighty in the Scripture: the weight
of Glory that is in Chriſt, may be made greater to our
eye two wayes; either by conviction of Chriſt his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
ſeeing ſeeing more of him; or by humiliation of man
under his miſery; by laying lower the price of this
dung and droſs, undervaluing the luſts of this world;
as the light is by which he ſees ſin or Chriſt, ſo the
weight in the ſcales appears more; either if we add to
the one end, or take out that which is in the other end
of the ſcale; for ſo much is this more weight, as that is
leſs that is put againſt it: Oh that we had hearts to
make abatements of the weights of this world and the
things of this life, that ſo the glory of Chriſt may be
more weighty in our eyes: and this is done by convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
I ſay the will is regulated by knowledge: men
will not chuſe Chriſt becauſe they know not his worth:
you would not (ſayes Chriſt to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Mat. 23. 37.)
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53665:60"/>
               <hi>And thou kneweſt not the time of thy viſitation,</hi> Luke
19. 44. where there is no knowledge or not ſuch a
knowledge as is convincing, there thou wouldſt not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> True may ſome ſay, the prejudices that men had
againſt Chriſt in thoſe dayes of his appearance to the
world were many: And if we had lived in thoſe times
and been left to our ſelves, we had had as many as they;
but now they are ceaſt: And therefore of all other this
is no reaſon, why men ſhould yet alwayes be unwilling
to receive Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, there are perpetual prejudices agaiſt
Chriſtianity, through the miſtakes and miſapprehenſions
of men, why they will not come to him or have him:
I cannot name them; they are as the Devil or their own
fancy do ſuggeſt to them; for every one makes Chriſt
a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to them that
are thereunto appointed, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks,
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p>When a man being enlightned, and a little convinc'd,
begins to be diſquieted and finds trouble brought upon
him: by this there is wrought in this mans breaſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
againſt converting Grace, that it takes away his
ſleep and appetite, ſhakes him, troubles him, diſquiets
him, that he cannot enjoy himſelf and the things of this
world: this is a prejudice and a miſtake: the truth is,
you muſt look for diſquietneſs and broken bones when
this is made known unto you. But yet take it for granted,
you are now entring into a comfortable eſtate: <hi>I will
make the valley of</hi> Achor <hi>a door of hope, the skirts of the
land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 15. I will make that to be a door
of hope: what is that? that a man or this people when
I bring them to tribulations and diſquiet them, it ſhall
be the beginning and commencement of hope, comfort
and delight, wherein I will viſit them in mercy: Again,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:53665:60"/>
When a man comes to be a profeſſor of Chriſt and
Religion, he hath more enemies, more temptations;
Satan moleſteth him more, he is more troubled then ever
he was before; and he takes prejudice at this, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that as <hi>Pharoah</hi> will make out with his Chariots and
horſe-men when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a going: ſo will Satan purſue
thoſe who are going out of his power. There is alſo
this prejudice againſt the wayes of God; the wayes of
God are holy. I am unſuitable, unholy; he that hath
gone ſo long looſe as I have done, ſhall never bear ſuch
ſtrictneſs as is required: this is a miſtake, he meaſures
himſelf by what he was or is: But God that commands
the walking, will put on the Byas whereby thou ſhalt
move right: It is as one ſhould ſay, A hog or ſwine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how a ſheep feeds cleanly on the graſs, ſhould
never feed as a ſheep, and live as he doth. Its true
whiles he remains a ſwine: But if the nature of a ſheep
be put into him, if he be ſo principled and altered, its
impoſſible he ſhould live otherwiſe; if you meaſure the
walking in Gods wayes by the luſts in you, you are never
able to endure, to affect, to love them. But the change
of the principle makes the thing to nature changed.
There is alſo a prejudice, that a man ſhall ſee no good
dayes: loſe all content and joy, live a melancholike or
recluſe life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is a miſtake; he ſhall not loſe but
change his joy; the countenance of God doth not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the heart, <hi>but puts in more delight then Corn, and
Wine, and Oyl increaſing,</hi> Pſal. 4. 7.</p>
            <p>More of theſe prejudices might be named, but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in ſome, that you might find your own in you,
that render you unwilling to believe; for they are but
miſapprehenſions of Chriſt and the work of his Grace,
by which the will is hindred as the ſpecies or appearance
of good doth moſt frequently invite it. If I would ſtrain
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53665:61"/>
hard, there might be other reaſons given for the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
of man to accept of Grace offered him, but theſe
ſhall ſerve for this tract.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>10</label> THe fourth point ſerving to open the Adunamy or
diſability of man in reſpect of coming unto him,
which our Saviour holds forth in theſe words, <hi>no man
can come to me,</hi> is mans reſiſtance of Grace, or the means
thereof that are offered towards converſion; and this
reſiſtance is the higheſt ſtep; for it is not ſo high to be
unwilling to receive grace when it is offered, as it is to
reſiſt grace, whereby, we might believe and be converted:
And the Point that ſhall be the foot of my diſcourſe, ſhall
be laid down in theſe words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the natural corruption of man prompts him to a
rebellion againſt, and the reſiſtance of grace offered him
for converſion, or bringing him in to faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
Every one of us do ſtand in defiance, all the dayes of
our natural condition, unto the very grace of God that is
offered us for converſion. I ſay all our dayes, untill the
time comes whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>that every
thought in us be brought into captivity to the obedience of
Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. till then, we ſtand it out in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
ſo that it may very juſtly be ſaid by Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi>
8. <hi>ult.</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon of God and Chriſt, <hi>All they
that hate me, love death.</hi> A ſtrange ſervitude of a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſin, that for the ſake thereof, that which is the
great terrour of the whole world, death, death eternal,
ſhould <hi>interpretativè</hi> though not <hi>formaliter</hi> be loved.
Being to ſpeak of this point of Reſiſtance offered unto
the grace of God, we muſt note, that Reſiſtance is
either between equal or unequal powers.</p>
            <p>The Reſiſtance that is between equal powers brings
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53665:61"/>
forth the indifferency of an equal Scale, where neither
end is victorious.</p>
            <p>The Reſiſtance between unequal powers, is, either
when a leſſer power reſiſts the greater, and then it
retards the action, but makes no conqueſt: or when a
greater power reſiſts the leſſer, and that conquers the
Reſiſtance and ſwallows up the oppoſition. So that
upon this point of the Reſiſtance of man, becauſe it is
of no proportion to Gods omnipotency, therefore if
God ſhould act <hi>ad extremum virium,</hi> to the extremity or
height of his own power, there could be no oppoſition
made unto Divine grace: But becauſe God is a free
agent, tempering his working by his will, which gives
the gage unto his power, putting forth ſo much as he
will and no more, therefore is his grace whereby he calls
man, often fruſtrated and defeated of his work. I will
make no quarrel about theſe words which one calls pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
words, which learned men have made occaſion
of quarrel in the Church; the reſiſtibility and unreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of converting grace; but ſo go on to handle this
point, as to divide an even thred, that God may have
and reap all the glory of this work of Converſion unto
his free grace: and ſinful man nothing but thankfulneſs
and ſelf-confuſion; thankfulneſs if he be drawn, or
however ſelf-confuſion, and abaſement to himſelf: as
contributing nothing unto, but a great deal of oppoſition
and reſiſtance againſt the work: Let me fall upon a
diſtinction that will clear your underſtandings in this
intricate and difficult point.</p>
            <p>We will diſtinguiſh, firſt, between the act of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or the grace that is exerciſed in the act: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</p>
            <p>The means and way of God which in the nature of it
tends towards Converſion, as preceding and preparing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53665:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the heart thereunto: for its very well ſaid by a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man: God doth not bring any man, ordinarily, into a
ſtate of Juſtification <hi>per ſubitum Enthuſiaſmum,</hi> by ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and upſtart Enthuſiaſmes, by an unexpected work
of illumination, but by previous means and methods and
workings. Now upon this diſtinction I ſay: Firſt,</p>
            <p>That the Grace of God exerted and exerciſed in and
to the act of Converſion, ſo as it may be ſaid, now the
man is Converted and born of God, I ſay that Grace
in that act being carryed on by the revealed arm of God,
is ſo potent and omnipotent, as that indeed it is inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and cannot be reſiſted by any victorious reſiſtance;
it conquers all the reſiſtance of man that might be
thought to fruſtrate and defeat it: for when God hath
a meaning and intention to overcome the heart of man;
effectually to draw him, he puts forth a victorious power,
inſuperable to any reſiſtance that you can make, to make
void the work: But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Grace which God offers and gives
to ſinful man, which in the nature of it tends to the
bringing of man to repentance, and to faith in Chriſt
Jeſus, leading thereunto, as the Miniſtry of the Word,
and the excitations, and internal motions of the Spirit of
God being diſpenſt by a more common hand: this
Grace of God, this Initial Grace, this previous Grace
tending to move, excite, and quicken man up; theſe
are defeated, reſiſted, and fruſtrated by mans reſiſtance;
and indeed no man ſhall be able to lay his impotency
and unbelief at the door of God: But be made to take it
upon himſelf, upon the reſiſtance that he makes againſt
the hand of God ſtretched out to him, he being a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying
ſoul; and this is that I ſay which may be reſiſted,
and is; Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and
forbearance, and long ſuffering, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53665:62"/>
goodneſs of God, leading to repentance? theſe may be and
are deſpiſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. So then,</p>
            <p>This diſtinction being laid, we ſhall now enquire
whether the heart of man do make actual and victorious
reſiſtance of Gods Grace put forth in the act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion:
And for our clearer proceeding therein you
muſt remember,</p>
            <p>That Converſion doth either denote the work of God
Converting man, and this is Gods drawing; or,</p>
            <p>It denotes the action of man thereupon turning and
coming in to Chriſt being thus moved: and this is called
mans coming in the text, both of them make up com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Converſion; the one whereby God turns man,
and by the other man being wrought upon turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to Chriſt: Theſe two are inſeparable in time, but
in order of cauſality Gods work is firſt; the traction of
God is before the coming of man; the coming in of the
light into a room, we uſe to ſay expels darkneſs, and
plants in light, though it be but one motion and one act;
ſo there muſt be the work of God enlightning the mind,
ſoftning the heart, drawing the will, before there be a
coming of man to God: the act of drawing is Gods,
the act of Converſion or turning is mans: God in his
act of putting in and drawing forth faith, doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but rather is the cauſe that the heart of man performs
his own act: and therefore the act of believing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it be given by God, yet being exerciſed and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by us, is our act: <hi>for with the heart man believes,</hi>
Rom. 10. 10. as we uſe to ſay, he that throws the bowl
doth nor rowl or turn, but the bowl by motion from the
hand: So when God puts forth this act to convert man,
the act is mans; the act of Faith, and Repentance, and
Converſion; but the power and hand whereby the heart
is turned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that only is the act of God: Well then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53665:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt, If we conſider converſion as Gods drawing
work converting the heart, we may ſafely ſay The heart
in that act doth not make actual reſiſtance; much leſs
overcome and defeat the power of Grace, which is put
forth in believers with exceeding greatneſs of power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the working of his mighty power which he
wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead:
there you ſee the work deſcribed in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20.
Its true, there may at that time and doth lurk a bitter
root of proneneſs in the corrupt heart (mark, here is the
knot and great point) to reſiſt the motions of the Spirit,
for the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit; and this root of
habitual perverſeneſs is not wholly and preſently eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and rooted out by Converting Grace: But this we
ſay, that Grace doth ſo powerfully work in the work or
act of Converſion: it ſo ſweetly plyes the affections,
the underſtanding, and the will with ſuch drawings, and
carries the work on with that actual ſtrength, that the
actual reſiſtance of the heart is tyed up, bridled, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
for that time, that it doth not overcome the
Grace of God; but the Grace of God overcomes the
heart by a victorious delight to yeild up it ſelf to God;
though there be corruption in it, it is ſo ſuſpended as it
doth not act: I will give it you by this compariſon; The
tyde doth not take from the river an aptneſs to run
downwards to the Sea; but ſo powerfully when it comes
in, bears the ſtream back, that it cannot take his natural
courſe. I need not make application. And this may teach
all Converts with what meaſure of admiration and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to come to God, for overcoming, bridling, and
ſuſpending theſe reſiſtances of your froward hearts; for
having lived twenty or thirty years in reſiſtance of Grace,
and keeping it at the ſtaves end; and after Converſion
reſiſting Grace and quenching the Spirit ſo often as you
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53665:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do; if God had left you in that act to theſe reſiſtances,
you had been loſt and undone; and therefore that God at
ſuch a time ſhould forbid, ſtill, and quiet theſe rebellions
and reſiſtencies of your heart, till he had turned the
ſtream, and taken away the ſtone, this is an admirable
demonſtration of the mercy, love, and power of his grace
to you. Of all things wherein God is to be praiſed, this
is one, that a rebellious man that had ſo often before time
and ſince reſiſted grace, that at that time when God
Converted him, he did not leave him to the reſiſtencies
of his heart: And how would that child had he wit,
thank his Father for tying him hand and foot that he
ſhould not ſtruggle (and otherwiſe he could not do)
while he was cutting for the ſtone; for the ſtrugling might
have prevented the cure. When God comes to work
upon the heart, and man cannot but ſtrive, and reſiſt,
and rebell againſt grace, that God ſhould take away at
that time this reſiſtance, and bind a man hand and foot,
and ſo to overcome him with grace that he cannot reſiſt
it: Oh the admirable wonderful mercy, whereby the
Lord makes a difference between his elect and others,
whom he leaves with the bridle on their necks to run
away whether they will; for it muſt be put among Gods
promiſes and mercies, when though with ſome ſharpneſs
he hinders us of the uſe of our liberty, in hindring us
from finding contentment in our walking, contrary to
our departure from him, as you obſerve <hi>Hoſ. 2. 6. I will
hedge up thy way with thorns that thou ſhalt not find or enjoy
thy paths:</hi> this hedge of thorns is an admirable mercy, for
which the people of God have cauſe to bleſs God all their
dayes, that keeps them from finding that content in the
way of their ſins which otherwiſe they would have
done: this Converting grace doth ſo put forth it ſelf in
the act of Converſion of every ſinner (I know not your
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53665:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
experiences of it) that it ſubdues the actual reſiſtance of
mans heart at that time, as the effect of it cannot be
fruſtrated or defeated, which teaches us with importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Prayer to beg this grace which comes with ſo
much ſtrength, as that it bears down the wickedneſs of
our hearts, and irreſiſtibly works a ſaving work. <hi>Turn
thou me and I ſhall be turned,</hi> Jer. 31. 18. <hi>and draw me and
we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 3. And that you that
have received ſuch grace, may magnifie the goodneſs and
power of God towards you in that diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons why Converting Grace doth take away
and overcome the reſiſtance of mans heart at the act of
Converſion, which with great content and profit to the
Reader may be given of the point, are four.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Firſt, The Grace of Converſion doth not only move
the heart to believe, but it makes it to believe; I ſpeak
of the act of Converſion; it doth not only <hi>ſuadere,</hi> but
<hi>perſuadere:</hi> I cannot diſtinguiſh theſe words in Engliſh;
or this, it doth not only ſtand at the door and knock, and
call, as you would do to awaken them that are aſleep
within, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. as exciting grace doth (which is
indeed a great favour) which is reſiſted by man; for to
this Grace that knocks and is only pulſant, calling and
awakening the heart of man, we may <hi>Ponere obicem,</hi> put
a bar, bar the door the faſter as againſt a thief and invader
that would come in by force: but the Grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
opens the door; and if there be no body within
but thoſe that bar the door, it comes with ſuch power as
opens the door, the heart, and comes in and takes
poſſeſſion: for of the two, though corruption be ſtrong,
yet grace, eſpecially when it comes in ſtrength, is the
ſtronger: Our Saviour in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 21. tells us, <hi>while the
ſtrong man poſſeſſes his goods, all is well: but when a ſtronger
then he</hi> (and that is the divine hand of God) <hi>comes to take
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53665:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
poſſesſion he binds the ſtrong man;</hi> what that? binds up
the reſiſtance of the heart; that when God comes to cut
him of this ſtone, and he would ſtruggle, and could not
do otherwiſe, Grace overcomes: it finds a man in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
and doth not only command him to believe, but
gives faith; therefore faith is not only the command,
but the gift of God: it finds a man unwilling, but it
makes him willing: it not only ſtirs up by way of exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the will and the deed; but it works to will and to
do, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. how long may one cry
and call aloud at a dead mans grave, <hi>Ariſe come forth!</hi> but
if with the call there go forth a power, as there did when
Chriſt called <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave, then he riſes and
ſtarts up; This Converting grace is called by Divines
<hi>Creatrix gratia,</hi> a creating grace, we are his workmanſhip
created in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. This raiſes the dead,
this gives <hi>Spirituale eſſe,</hi> a ſpiritual being unto the ſoul:
it puts in a formal principle of eliciting holy acts; this
puts in new ſtrength, and heals the vicious inclinations;
this grace doth not only call, and ſay, Obey my voyce,
but it puts in the very grace of obedience: <hi>I will put my
law unto the heart, and write it in the mind that they ſhall all
know me,</hi> Heb. 10. 16. this drawing is the teaching of
God, and Gods teaching is alway followed or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
with ſucceſs, with the work it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> mans
coming; for every man that hath heard and learned thus,
comes to me; every man, <hi>John.</hi> 6. 45. and in a word,
ſuch is the power of this Converting grace, that ſaith the
Apoſtle, <hi>it is mighty to caſt down ſtrong holds, reaſonings,
to bring down every high thing that exalts it ſelf, and to
lead every thought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi>
2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. and whats that, but it takes away the
actual reſiſtance of the heart at that preſent time?</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> Secondly, If this Converting grace ſhould not carry
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53665:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on the work with ſo efficacious and moſt ſweet a hand,
as to overcome all our oppoſition, one of theſe two
things would follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That our Converſion ſhould be defeated, and
Gods intention towards his Elect ſhould be fruſtrated:
for this grace of Converſion comes from the purpoſe of
God which is infallible: <hi>It is a calling according to his
purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8. 29. what purpoſe? why the purpoſe
of his Election which muſt ſtand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of God muſt ſtand, that is, not defeated, fruſtrated,
and finally oppoſed, for then it ſtands not: And how
doth it ſtand? not of works and the compliance of the
will of man, but of Gods call: now ſhall that grace that
comes from a meaning and purpoſe of God, be defeated
by mans oppoſition and reſiſtance? no, for then that
could not be true, that he hath mercy on whom he will,
and whom he will he hardens: God would have mercy
on ſuch a man; but by his oppoſition made againſt that
work he is defeated; which would be a ſad aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Or elſe this muſt follow, that the will of
man caſts the ſcales of his Converſion, and ſo the chief
part belongs to man, which is to decide the determine
the work; for grace doth not then determine the will to
a choice; but the will determines grace to an effect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
event, whereby man may ſtand out and ſay, I made
my ſelf to differ from another; for another man had as
much grace as I, but he repulſed and oppoſed it; he ſhut
the door againſt it, but I let it in: and therefore the act
of difference between my ſelf and other men, is my own
act, the act of my own will: but this I ſhould by no
means admit of; for to me it ſeems incredible, that God
that made my will, and gave it that liberty that it hath,
ſhould not, if he will, ſo work on it or in it, as he will, to
his own glory, without any detriment to the nature or
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53665:65"/>
liberty of it, having a moſt omnipotent power to incline
the heart of man like a river of water whether he will:
<hi>De ipſis hominum volunt atibus facit quod vult:</hi> God doth
with the very will of man, what he will; as if he that
makes a lock and knows all the ſprings of it, ſhould
not be able to make a key to it without breaking it all
to pieces: and it is alſo a thing incredible to me, that
God that hath determined of ſome perſons to grace and
glory (let me ſuppoſe that, for I think it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
ſhould leave it to the will of man, (that knows not
the purpoſe of God to him) either to determine himſelf
to grace, or to defeat it at his pleaſure: this makes very
ill muſick in an humble and rational ear: that God, that
determines a man to ſalvation, ſhould leave it to the
pleaſure of blind will to defeat the purpoſe of his grace;
for if he ſhould ſtumble (as I may ſay) on the reſiſtance
of it, he himſelf is gone for ever; which leaves not
unto God ſo much above the Publican or they that are
paſt over, as the Phariſee his God I thank thee.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, There is a good rule to be obſerved, laid
down by our Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> To put difference between
ſome principal acts of grace, without which the ſalvation
of Gods Elect conſiſts not; and thoſe ſubſequent and
following acts of grace, or the motions thereof in the
regenerate, which though they were very good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acts, yet a believer may be ſaved without them. And
upon the firſt ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe in Chriſt, to Convert
to God, to be made new creatures, to perſevere unto the
end, for the performance of theſe, God in his time gives
to his people ſuch a grace as ſhall not be fruſtrate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
they ſhall be performed in thee: But for other
acts that God calls for of thee, as to omit ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in, or to
do ſuch and ſuch a duty; which being conſidered ſingle
and particular, thou mayſt be ſaved without: in theſe he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53665:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gives thee his Spirit whoſe conduct is to be followed:
but as experience ſhews, the Elect and regenerate may
<hi>deeſſegratiae</hi> may be wanting to this grace, and repulſe
the motions, and as its ſaid, <hi>grieve the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ.
4. 30. if in one ſort of acts he ſhould reſiſt, he is loſt:
and therefore God puts in a mighty hand and an abſolute
will: <hi>I will put my Law,</hi> &amp;c. in the other he guides by
his Spirit; and a grace is given not ſo infallibly to bring
the effect, which is good, not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
becauſe if you ſin by not doing your duty, yet your
eſtate is not in danger: and here let me ſuggeſt a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or two to ſuch as are fit to make uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let the regenerate conſider, that whereas they
have reſiſted grace and the motions of it a thouſand
tmes, and ſince their Converſion have grieved the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
by indulgence of their luſts againſt the motions of the
Spirit and the dictates of their own conſciences; if God
had permitted them unto themſelves, and let them have
done ſo in the act of Converſion, they had for ever
periſht; and their reſiſtance at other times ſhews they
might or would have done ſo then, if God that may let
his child ſlip and take a knock, did not yet keep a hand
upon them that they fall not into the fire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let them learn to underſtand God a right,
and to take comfort, that though in other acts he pleaſe
to ſuffer them often and very grievouſly to fall, ſhewing
thereby the perverſeneſs of their ſpirits yet remaining,
ſo as that they may fear they may loſe all and fall ſo as
never to ariſe more: yet be comforted that in ſuch things
as ſalvation lyes in, he will be ſure and an infallible God
to his Elect; to ſupport and raiſe them up again: and let
them alſo remember, that God ſo makes good the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his Covenant in things eſſential unto ſalvation
to work them infallibly: <hi>I will put my fear into their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53665:66"/>
hearts that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32. 40. or as
it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 37. 23, 24. The Lord or dereth a good mans
ſteps, and he delighteth in his way:</hi> though he fall he ſhall
not be utterly caſt down, for the Lord upholdeth him
with his hand; though he fall in the Covenant, he ſhall
not fall from it.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> Fourthly and laſtly, Converting grace in the act of it
cannot be reſiſted and defeated; becauſe it is given to
that end to ſubdue and overcome the reſiſtance of fleſh
and blood: now that which is given to take away re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
no reſiſtance can ſtand againſt it; therefore in
the work of Converſion it will leave in the heart no
actual rebellion that ſhall perk up to defeat the work:
<hi>A nullo duro corde r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſpuitur;</hi> it is not reſiſted by the heart
thats hard, becauſe it takes away the hardneſs and gives
a heart of fleſh, <hi>Ezek. 36. 27. I will take away the heart of
ſtone and give a heart of fleſh;</hi> take away the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable,
and give a heart thats tractable; I will take
away the heart thats hard as ſtone to reſiſt, and give them
a tender heart to feel their own miſery. I may give it by
this compariſon: In a room if the windows be not ſhut,
the darkneſs cannot reſiſt the light, becauſe its given to
that purpoſe to expell the darkneſs: And when God
gives any thing to take away an oppoſition, that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
cannot ſtand in its place; ſo this Divine grace is
refuſed by no hard heart of man, when it comes with the
meaning and purpoſe of God to carry it on, becauſe then
it comes with commiſſion and authority to remove ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
and pull away bars that it may overcome: And this
much be ſpoken of Converſion as it denotes the act of
God drawing or Converting, and the deportment of
mans heart under it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond conſideration is as Converſion denotes
the action of man; Converting to God upon and by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53665:67"/>
vertue of this drawing of God: And what is the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the heart when it is toucht by this loadſtone and
drawn by this grace? freedome ſay I, and willingneſs;
there follows thereupon, a coming, nay a running after
God, in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. For the power of God and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of man do conſiſt together, <hi>thy people ſhall be willing
in the day of thy power,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3. Now therefore I will
ſay, that man cannot be ſuppoſed in this act of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
as it is his, to reſiſt or be unwilling, becauſe he is
made willing, and the reſiſtance for this act is overcome
and ſubdued. And therefore it is ſaid, as God draws, ſo
man comes, and his coming is an act not of force but of
freedom, being both powerfully and ſweetly drawn by
the cords of man, by the bonds of love, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 3. And
therefore as mans reſiſtance of Gods work, and his free
coming in to God cannot ſtand together in the ſame act,
there is reaſon in nature for that: a man may as well
move Eaſt and Weſt at the ſame time, as reſiſt and be
willing to come all at one time; for there is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the terms to ſay, though a man doth believe, yet
he will not believe; for man will not reſiſt being made
willing to comply with God; and this is the miracle of
Gods power and grace in mans Converſion; that the
heart ſo prone and apt to run into ſin ſo headlong and
uncontrouled, ſhould upon the touch of this loadſtone of
grace be made ſo free and delightful to come to God,
and by this marriage conſent to joyn hands with God;
loathing in compariſon of God the thoughts of thoſe
luſts and pleaſures which he ſo doated on in the dayes of
his captivity to ſin; and ſaying as they ſaid to their
Idols,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 22.</note> Fie upon you, get you hence; and therefore there
can be no reſiſtance remaining in this coming; ſo that
its clear, that neither in the act of Gods drawing or in
mans act of turning will there be found a victorious reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53665:67"/>
(an habitual corruption there will remain) but that
it is bridled at any time, <hi>let it magnifie for ever Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

               <hi>we can do nothing againſt the truth but for

               </gap> Converting grace flowing from the purpoſe of
God, is in the act of Converſion victorious over the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the corrupt heart, and though it do not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extirpate all the degrees of habitual perverſeneſs and
rebellion, yet it binds up the actual reſiſtance at that
time, as that it is imprevalent to divert the work of ſo
powerful grace: I come to the point wherein the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
offered to the grace of God doth lie; and that is,
the grace that is promiſcuouſly offered unto man in the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel or other external means, though
it be carried o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by great enlightnings, moral ſuaſions,
ſweet invitations, loud pulſations, or knockings at the
door of ſecurity: and though by theſe means there be
wrought ſome common graces that are common in elect
and reprobate, like the joy in the ſtony ground: I ſay
though theſe be, yet both theſe offers of grace, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
received would make a man happy, are reſiſted and
oppoſed: and theſe ſhallow graces are but like ſome
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53665:68"/>
winter fruit, that never ripen, and come to maturity, as
the blade in the thorny and ſtony ground never came to
ear well and ſo to harveſt: ſo theſe graces may be finally
choaked, and from them a man may finally fall away:
this is the point of reſiſtance of this grace offered; which
before I give the reaſons of, I ſhall premiſe three things
to be handled:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Concerning theſe offers of grace, I ſhall ſay
three things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Shew the entertainment of theſe offers is
with oppoſition and recuſancy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The dangerous caſe that man falls into by
this refuſal;</p>
            <p>As concerning the offers of grace that God makes you
in the Goſpel, know three things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Goſpel tenour or terms may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to every creature; thats the phraſe of Chriſt,
<hi>Mark 16. 15. Go preach the Goſpel to every creature;</hi> that
is, in the dialect of Chriſt which was the received form of
ſpeech uſed at that time by the Jewiſh Rabbies, every man,
every humane creature; for it belongs not to the Angels
that ſinned, though they be ſinful creatures; theſe Goſpel
propoſals do not belong to them, but every humane
creature, which is expounded by <hi>Matthew, Go and Baptize,</hi>
that is, Diſciple all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and whats the
meaning properly of all Nations and every creature?
this, that whereas the Jewiſh Pale was but of one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they were the Church of God impaled, and there
was a wall of partition between them and all the world
beſide, and he dealt not ſo with every Nation as he did
with them: It ſeems now the Pale is broken down, the
wall of partition, and the ſeveral is made common; now
go preach to every creature: that is, the Jews only are
not the ſubjects of Goſpel promiſes, but all and every
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53665:68"/>
man, to them it may be propoſed: and what are thoſe
Goſpel terms? <hi>he that believes and is baptized, ſhall be
ſaved; he that believes not, ſhall be damned:</hi> but is this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?
<hi>he that believes not, ſhall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, you muſt conſider the meaning of
it: under the Law there was a curſe went out againſt
every man for every ſin: there could not be an idle
word or thought but the curſe of the Law went out
againſt: In <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Curſed is every one,</hi> &amp;c. Now mark,
though this curſe may go forth againſt every ſin by the
ſentence of the Law; yet it is diſſolved and taken off
from believers, and abides only becauſe of unbelief,
<hi>Joh. 3. ult.</hi> Believing takes off every ſcore; and that only.</p>
            <p>About theſe offers of the Goſpel conſider two things,
they are made with Invitation and with Encouragement.</p>
            <p>Firſt with Invitation of ſuch as could not expect to
be at the marriage feaſt of a Kings Son: <hi>Go out ſaith the
King, to the high-wayes and hedges, and invite the meaneſt
and moſt remote creatures,</hi> Mat. 22. 4. and they called in
both good and bad, and furniſhed the feaſt with gueſts:
all ſorts may have theſe Goſpel propoſals made to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Its made with Encouragement, and that
to the moſt crimſon and ſcarlet ſinners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18,
<hi>Waſh you, make you clean,</hi> &amp;c. None that came to Chriſt
for cure were diſmiſt without healing, though they were
Samaritans and not Iſraelites: therefore no man can
ſay, that God by the tenour of the Goſpel hath exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, or ſhut the door againſt him; for in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 5, 6.
the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives in words of Encouragement;
<hi>Let not the ſon of the ſtranger ſay I am caſt out; nor the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,
I am a dry tree</hi> (for both the ſon of the ſtranger,

priviledges of children and favourites;</hi> his meaning is,
there is no man ſo alien, ſo remote from God and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that hath all the marks of diſparagement upon him;
but if he will come in and believe, the invitation is made
to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I confeſs we read in the Scripture, that the
Spirit of God forbade the lantern-bearers of the Goſpel
to go into ſome Countries, and the providence of God
at all times and at this time ſo regulates the ſun of the
Goſpel, as that ſome people are as in night: but this I
ſay, that no man is excluded by the Goſpel tenour from
the offer of grace that is propounded in the Goſpel, by
any national bar as in former time: And then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the Goſpel offer, and the propoſals
thereof may be made to every man without any other
conſideration then that he is a ſinner. Art thou a ſinner?
for thee Chriſt is a Saviour: that as the brazen Serpent
was ſet upon the pole for the wounded and bitten with
fiery Serpents: So is grace offered in the Goſpel, to them
that are finners without any other conſideration for the
offer of it: underſtand me right: but for the promiſe of
the Goſpel. thats made to every one that comes to Chriſt
for the grace promiſed; and here is no condition of
worthineſs, but of fitneſs and meetneſs, whereby a man
may be in a nearer capacity, but hath no more merit or
worth, as I ſhall here ſhew you: The Goſpel makes the
Proclamation of pardon to all men that are in actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:
that as a Prince by his pardon charms the ſword
out of the hands of a Rebel: ſo if your iron hearts were
ſoftned to underſtand the grace of God, upon his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
you might have the ſword of rebellion charmed
out of your hands, and be brought into ſubmiſſion unto
Chriſt: but the Goſpel makes the promiſe of pardon
and grace to a believer in Chriſt, and to every believer
without any reſpect to what he hath been in times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſt,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53665:69"/>
whether he be Barbarian or Scythian, bond or free; for
the righteouſneſs of God is upon all and unto all that
believe; for there is no difference, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. Mark
and be invited I beſeech you that have ſo long ſtood it
out and reſiſted the grace of God: Oh! be you invited
to come in; the promiſe is to every one that thirſteth,
<hi>Iſa. 55. 1. All that are weary and heavy-laden with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of their ſins and miſeries,</hi> Mat. 11. 28. <hi>And whoſoever
will (viz.</hi> is willing) <hi>let him come and take of the water of
life freely,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Every one that believeth in Chriſt,
ſhall not periſh, but have eternal life,</hi> John 3. 15, 16. So
that you ſee the Proclamation is general, the invitation of
the thirſty to water, wine &amp; milk, of the loaden and weary
unto reſt, of the willing unto the water of life; and the
Promiſe is general to all and every believer, and that of
eternal life; and therefore you may conclude, there is an
offer of grace made to ſinful and wicked men by the
Goſpel; <hi>for thou</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt of Chriſt) <hi>haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
gifts for men; yea for the rebellious alſo that God may
dwell amongſt them,</hi> Pſal. 69. 18. And then,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Which binds all the reſt, whomſoever God
doth call to faith and Converſion by the invitations of
his Word, and by the pulſations or knockings of his
Spirit, he calls and invites them ſeriouſly and in good
earneſt: what think you? when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>how often
would I have gathered you!</hi> and when God ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
14. 13. <hi>I purged thee and thou waſt not purged:</hi> are theſe
things ſpoken in jeſt? we muſt not judge that grace is
not offered in good earneſt by the event that it hath in
us; for it may be fruſtrate and without ſucceſs; but judge
by the nature of the benefit offered, by the excitements
afforded, and the aids and motions ſupplyed, and by the
tendency of them what they mean, and in their nature
drive at; even at the bringing of you to Chriſt Jeſus:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53665:70"/>
let no man think with himſelf that God Tantalizeth man
with the offers of his grace, and that he is not really
minded that they ſhould be received; but let this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
be ſetled and throughly fixt in your hearts, that
God is in good earneſt and means ſeriouſly, when he
woes and invites you to repentance; for this principle is
of great uſe; for that induces the acceptance, the reality
of the offerer: no man will look on a bargain that is
offered him in jeſt: look after a gift though never ſo
rich that is holden forth in a pretence and ſimulation;
this will not induce a man to look after grace, if he hath
this perſwaſion that God Tantalizeth him with it: what
man living under the Goſpel can ſtand out and ſay?
Lord, I would, but thou wouldeſt not; I put forth my
hand and thou dreweſt back thine; let no man think this
to excuſe himſelf upon God; this was intended by a
Parable, <hi>Luke 19. 20. of him that had a talent given him
who laid it up and did not uſe it,</hi> thinking to excuſe himſelf
on the temper, the auſterity of the Maſter, ſo to put off
all blame from himſelf, whereby our Saviour ſignifies
that men would put the fault upon God; ſaith he, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
I knew thou wert a hard man, that reapeſt where
thou didſt not ſow; therefore I laid up the talent that
thou mighteſt have thy own; the Maſter ſpeaks to him,
calling him evil ſervant, and retorts the objection
upon himſelf, if I were a hard man, thou oughteſt to have
put forth thy talent rather: he is deceived that thinks to
clear his neglect by faſtening a reaſon for it upon God:
for there are four things in the Scripture that ſeem to me
to prove theſe offers of grace in the Goſpel to be ſerious:
I know not how others may interpret them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The pathetical form that is uſed of inviting
ſinners, ſo low ſometimes that God doth beſeech us to
be reconciled; <hi>God and Chriſt doth beſeech you by us that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53665:70"/>
are his Miniſters and Embaſſadors,</hi> 2 Corinthians 5. 20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the frequent exhortations: and amongſt
the reſt (for I ſhould ſpeak the whole Bible in a manner
to name all) that 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 1. we beſeech you that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not the grace of God in vain</hi> (for its not offered to
you in vain) for he ſaith there is a day of Salvation and
that is now: And then,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the expoſtulations with careleſs and
negligent men for not coming in, neglecting or abuſing
theſe offers; <hi>I wonder that you are ſo ſoon perverted and
carryed away to another Goſpel,</hi> in Gal. 6. 1. And then,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By the promiſes made and holden forth,
<hi>Rev. 3. 20. I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man will
open to me, I will come and ſup with him:</hi> and do not all
theſe forms of dealing with man prove ſufficiently the
reality of the offers of grace to a ſinner? yea verily,
and that he doth not dally with men: For elſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, God ſhould ſeem hereby to deceive men, to
offer them a purchaſe and a prize, and call and invite
them in the Name of his Son Chriſt, and never mean
or intend that this grace ſhould be by them received.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The meſſengers whom God ſends forth
to be woers of chaſt virgins unto Chriſt, and to beſpeak
the eſpouſals as the Word is, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 1, 2. they ſhould
be found falſe witneſſes;</hi> for what would you take him
to be that ſhould ſpeak to a man to beſpeak a virgin for
him, whom he never intends or means to have, if ſhe
would have him? And then,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The neglect of this grace might more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſably
be made a great deal, and would have a greater
colour of excuſe; for they would ſay, there was indeed
grace holden forth to them in mockery, without any
reality that they ſhould receive it; but now God finds

               </gap> with men and blames them for not acknowledging

or not conſidering that his goodneſs ſhould lead them to
repentance, and therefore do deſpiſe it as the phraſe is,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. And therefore it muſt be a plain caſe, that the
drift and ſcope of that goodneſs is to lead men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and ſo the whole army of providenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the offers made in the Word, the excitements of
the Spirit of God, as well as other goodneſs, do all ſpeak
and tend to the clearing of God of ſimulation or meer
pretence: I would it were believed, that though you
were never ſo remote and far from this grace, and ſeem
to deſpair that you cannot have it, and think that. God
doth but dally when he makes the offer to you, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
your apprehenſions be, ſettle it in your hearts, the
offer is real, and God is ſerious and in good earneſt whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
he offers Chriſt and grace in the Goſpel. One great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
there is in this point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How can theſe offers of grace be ſerious or in
earneſt, when ſo many thouſands called by the Word are
not abſolutely converted? how doth God deal in good
earneſt in the offer of grace, when he doth not abſolutely
give it and work this Converſion? if God had a ſerious
will, it would be abſolute by power to work that he calls
men unto; if God were in good earneſt that I ſhould be
converted and believe in Chriſt, then God by his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and peremptory will would give me this grace and
work it in me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But we anſwer that the will of God may be
ſerious, though it be not abſolute and peremptory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God
may by his ſerious will will that you repent, and yet by
his abſolute will work it not: The great iuſtance in this
point is: God had a ſerious will that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſtand,
for God was not in jeſt in that buſineſs; but God had not
an abſolute will that he ſhould ſtand, ſo as to work and
confirm him in that eſtate; ſo as to cauſe. <hi>Adam</hi> to ſtand
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53665:71"/>
in his integrity; ſo the will of God may be ſerious in
commanding of a man to repent, and yet not abſolute
and peremptory to work it in that man if he refuſe to
obey the command; when God commands a man to
make him a new heart, to circumciſe his heart, or to obey
his holy Laws, in all theſe, God is ſerious and in good
earneſt, notwithſtanding he doth not abſolutely work
theſe in all: In the Elect of God whom he hath choſen
he doth indeed not only command, but works it: In all
he doth not: And the reaſon is, becauſe God is ſerious in
his conditional promiſes or Covenant, when he ſpeaks to
man to believe, and thereupon promiſes pardon, he is in
good earneſt; for he would have men to believe, and it
is their ſin not to do it; and then if they do, the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between faith and pardon is ſure: a man earneſtly
perſwades his ſervant or friend to be cut of the ſtone; they
will not; the man takes his child and binds him, cuts and
cures him; he goes further with his child then he did
with his friend or ſervant; yet he did ſeriouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them, though he did not go ſo far with them,
nor had he reaſon, but leaves them to themſelves; not
that a ſimilitude ſhould run on four feet, but take it in
the general meaning; God doth perſwade with men to
break the ſtone, and to plough up the fallow ground of
their hearts: but he takes them that belong to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his grace, and whereas they refuſe this grace as
well as others, he takes away the heart of ſtone from
them; <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone and give a heart of
fleſh,</hi> and therefore when the Lord ſaith thus in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
18. 31, 32. <hi>Caſt away your tranſgresſions, make you a new
heart and a new ſpirit: for why will ye dye O houſe of</hi> Iſrael!

is the acceptable and perfect will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.
<hi>there is an acceptable will and an effective will of God:</hi> the
acceptable will of God is ſeen in this call and offer of
grace: the effective will of God is that of his purpoſe
which is effective of the work, works the work upon you:
now God is ſerious when he ſpeaks according to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
will, though he doth not effect it abſolutely and
peremptorily.</p>

               </gap>
ſhews it ſelf in the word, the other in the work. This
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53665:72"/>
acceptable will of God manifeſted in Evangelical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and promiſes, whereby he commands faith and
repentance, and promiſes pardon of ſin and life, is that
which we muſt look unto and prove, as the Apoſtle ſaith,

the will of Gods purpoſe, his effective will is ſecret, and
ſo cannot be the guide of our addreſſes to God, nor the
rule of our believing (for Gods acceptable will is the
rule of our faith) And this will of Gods purpoſe though
it be abſolutely performed in and unto all that are under
that purpoſe; yet there is an outward calling of many
that are not choſen, and there are offers of grace to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
unto whom it is not powerfully given; for it is
ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 11.</note> 
               <hi>to you it is given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom,
but to others it is not given;</hi> and yet to thoſe to whom it
is not abſolutely given, it is ſeriouſly offered; according
to the effective will is the one, and according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
will is the other: and here comes in a queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the reaſon that God effectually works
that grace in one, which he doth but offer to another?
that God works by his abſolute will the grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and Faith in ſome, which he offers and requires
according to his acceptable will of others; and why
doth he ſo pathetically work with counſells and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
that which he might command? if God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
light to ſhine out of darkneſs, and do not create
that light, the light doth not ſhine: one word, <hi>fiat lux,</hi>
would effect the work which he commands to be
wrought in us, and by us is reſiſted; this is the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>To this I ſay three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, That God might have converted his
Elect as he made this world, that is, immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tools or inſtruments: God in the Converſion of man,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53665:73"/>
will deal with man as man; he will uſe a miniſtry, a means,
by exhortation, by conviction, by counſel and by moral
perſwaſions; that as its ſaid, <hi>Hoſ. 11. 3. he will draw
with the cords of man,</hi> ſo he will deal with man as man, by
reaſonable counſels and perſwaſions leading him, not as
a ſtock by a Cable rope of meer force, but ſo as that he
may by excitation quicken the affections, by enlightning
convince the underſtanding, by awakening carry the will;
this muſt be that the affections may be allured and
drawn up to the conſideration of ſpiritual things; ſo
that this being the way of God, of neceſſity it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that there be uſed means, motions, counſels, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,
and the like. I have to ſay further on this head
theſe four things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, God by theſe offers and tenders of grace pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in the Word and left to the management of man,
convictively ſhews what even his Elect are; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his powerful hand to ſtrike the ſtroke the work will
not be done; for the Elect of God as well as others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only morally moved and perſwaded to Converſion,
do uſe the ſame ſhifts, and Tergiverſations, make as much
reſiſtance and ſhew the ſame unwillingneſs as other men
do; and therefore take this for a rule and find it in your
ſelves, that God commonly convinces a man before he
converts; convinces man of his own impotency and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
before he put forth his own arm; and therefore
leaves him to his own recuſancy and reſiſtance to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry his
own ſtrength, and a long time lets him alone to his own
purpoſes, which will ſavour of pride enough untill God
ſhew him the difference between the report of the word
and the arm of the Lord revealed: for although the
word of God, the Goſpel that we preach unto you, is
the fitteſt means in the world of an external inſtrument
to convert the heart of man, and is furniſht with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53665:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to work on the heart; yet its but like a key very
ſuitable to the ſprings of a lock, and put into it, that will
not ſhut the bolt and open the door without a hand to
turn the key as well as put it in: ſo if the Word preacht
be never ſo fit to meet with the ſprings in mans heart,
yet if there be not a ſtrong hand to turn the key, the heart
will not be opened: ſo that when God convinces by the
offer of grace, and leaves you to your own acceptance,
little good will be done without the putting forth of his
own arm to the work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, With theſe offers made in the Word, God
in Converſion goes out with his arm, and ſo Converſion
is wrought (in thoſe he purpoſes to call) by the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
morally by perſwaſion, by Gods hand ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally;
ſo with the word that faith <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth,
there goes a work of power to effect it; this power goes
forth with the Word, as the hand with the ax, with the
inſtrument, with the key for the honour of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
And therefore its told you while <hi>Peter</hi> ſpoke,
<hi>Acts 10. 44. the Holy Ghoſt fell upon the hearers;</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there went out with the Word the power of the
Holy Ghoſt to convert them that God calls according
to his purpoſe; he takes hold of their hearts with his
powerful arm and brings them in, yet not without means,
as if they were converted by Enthuſiaſms, but in an
ordinary way, as I may clear it by a compariſon: fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
&amp; rubbings uſed ſometimes to a people in a ſwound
are very profitable to recall life where there was life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but if uſed to a dead carkaſs out of which life is
gone, doth nothing to beget or recall life: ſo are the
tenders of grace, offered with exhortations and counſels,
motions and knockings; if there be life of grace in the
heart, they are profitable to revive, to call in, to refreſh
grace: but if uſed to a natural man, to a man dead in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53665:74"/>
ſins, of themſelves they work nothing, they leave him as
dead as they found him, untill there be a new life of
grace put into him; which is the work that I contend
for to be of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By theſe offers of grace and exhortations,
God takes from man all excuſe; all the light that God
gives to man doth tend to render man unexcuſable,
though it be but natural light, for ſo far as it directs,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. that they might be without excuſe; for what?
for not believing in Chriſt? no, that light went not ſo
far; no light leaves a man without excuſe farther then it
goes; Goſpel-light goes farther then natural light, and
convinces in a farther degree and proportion, as the light
is greater; and as far as it convinces, ſo far it will leave
without excuſe; and therefore there is no man that hath
Chriſt offered, that is enlightned, convinc't, hath ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
made unto him, but is left without excuſe; and
though men in wantonneſs of diſputes may weave a web
of excuſes, and muſter them up againſt God: yet no man
in agony of conſcience upon his death-bed or at Gods
Tribunal, ſhall-be able to make any excuſe for the
neglect and reſiſtance of the grace of God, but ſhall be
like him in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. ſpeechleſs: he might have ſaid
ſomewhat for himſelf, as to them that called him to the
feaſt, but there was no excuſe to be made to the King.
There are two caſes wherein all excuſes are taken from
man. Firſt, In caſe of voluntary impotency by a mans
own default, as if he imbezel the ſtock committed to his
hand, and would make an excuſe for non-payment of a
debt, though he may ſay he have it not, that ſerves not
his turn; for you had it and the ſtock by you is imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelled:
Or ſecondly, if he be oppoſite and reſiſt, as if a
man that will not or cannot ſee becauſe he ſhuts the
window and will not let the light in, its no excuſe for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53665:74"/>
him to ſay I do not ſee, becauſe its a voluntary act of his
own to ſhut out the light: in both caſes he is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.
But eſpecially I lay weight on the latter, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of man and his oppoſition; for there is no man
living that reſts in a ſimple impotency, but reſiſts and
ſhuts his eyes, and makes oppoſition to the grace of God

               <hi>light is come into the world, and men love
darkneſs rather then light,</hi> this is the condemnation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God in the Goſpel ſeldom or never offers
grace to a man, but he affords and furniſhes him with
ſome degree of light and power to do more then he doth,
to go farther then he doth; for in <hi>Rom. 1. 17. the wrath of
God is revealed from heaven againſt thoſe that hold the truth
of God in unrighteouſneſs:</hi> that is, for not living up to their
light, nor doing ſo much as they may or can: no man in
the world untill God work upon his heart ſavingly, live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
up to his own rule, neither doth <hi>facere quod in ſe eſt,</hi> do
ſo much as he might and hath power to do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God is no way bound to give converting grace; if
a man will not imploy one talent ſo far as he may go with
one, what reaſon hath God to give that man five or ten
talents? None at all when the power and grace of God
given is reſiſted and oppoſed, and neglected; What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is there that men ſhould cavil againſt the Lord; and
ſay, I had not ſo many talents, whereas he did not uſe the
one he had! no man is without a talent, every man hath
ſomewhat whereby he may trade for God, and becauſe
he doth not do it, certainly the Lord is free and clear, if
he do not give him more, if he do not give him converting
grace: God will I ſay be clear when he is quarrelled at
by man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly, Converting grace is Gods own,
not diſpenſed to any in a way of Juſtice, but as a gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of

               </gap>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:53665:75"/>
to account for the gifts he gives? if it were in juſtice,
there a man might demand account; in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15.
<hi>is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> grace
is Gods own, and therefore is not tyed to accounts; ſo
its argued <hi>Job 33. 15. why doſt thou ſtrive againſt the Lord?
he giveth no account of any of his matters:</hi> and in reſpect
of this ſoveraignty of God, he hath no other rule to guide
his gift of grace but his own will; <hi>for he hath mercy on
whom he will: for who hath enjoyned him his way, or who
can ſay thou haſt wrought iniquity?</hi> Job 26. 23. therefore
let thoſe that from Converting grace do but ſeek an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of excuſing themſelves and diſputing with God,
in ſilence firſt ask themſelves that queſtion in <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 35. <hi>who hath given to him firſt? and it ſhall be given
or rendred to him again;</hi> firſt let him ſtand out and ſay,
this I have done for God, and have given to him, and
therefore let him be juſt to render to me again, or ceaſe to
quarrel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Thirdly, God doth not give Converting
grace to all that have the offer, to the end that he may
make his grace the more glorious and admirable, and his
Elect the more thankful and obliged; who when they
ſee what the Lord hath done, what ſcandal as it were he
hath run himſelf into in the eyes of the world, to greaten
his mercy in their eyes, how this is denyed to many bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then themſelves, may ſtand admiring at that whereof
no reaſon out of God and the cabinet of his will can be
given. If this grace which God hath given and will give
to his Elect, had been univerſal, I do think I may very
well ſay it muſt needs have fallen in price, becauſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
teaches us that full markets make cheap commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities:
<hi>and therefore the wrath of God on veſſels of wrath,
doth ſerve to ſhew forth his mercy on veſſels of mercy,</hi> Rom.
9. 22. to whom it appears to be riches of glory, even by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53665:75"/>
the conſideration of Gods wrath upon others; let Gods
people look themſelves in this glaſs, and let them know
that grace hath more glory by the property of diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
then it could have by univerſality; for if dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
were as common as Flints and Pebles, I think
people would not ſo much wear them on their fingers:
and ſo much of the firſt Premiſe.</p>
            <p>I come to the ſecond, which is, what entertainment
the offers of grace do find with a natural man, and that
is oppoſition and reſiſtance, that look as the hard wall
reverberates and beats back the ball thats thrown againſt
it, and the harder you throw it, the farther it recoils upon
you; ſo the hard heart of man by its renitency reacts
and repulſes the tenders of grace; and becauſe this is a
point that no man will eaſily believe that he is a reſiſter
of grace, therefore I mean to handle it only by opening
ſome plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of Scripture, wherein you ſhall ſee that God
charges this on you, and then I ſhall ſum them up into a
total.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there are two denominations of men that are
ſaid to hate the light and to hate Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20.
<hi>every one that doth evil hates the light:</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 15. 18.
<hi>the world hates me:</hi> the higheſt degree of malignity is
expreſt by hate; the two higheſt and moſt pretious
things, Chriſt and light are hated, by men that love their
luſt; by the world, that is in the dialect of Chriſt, the
not called, the unregenerate, which ſhews us the general
ſtate of men that are not brought into Chriſt, they hate
the light and they hate Chriſt; but yet men will not own
it, they think not ſo; ſo <hi>Hazael</hi> when he was accuſed by
the Prophet, that he ſhould rip up women with child,
and other villanies when he came to be King; What ſaith
he, am I a dog to do ſuch great wickedneſs? no more do
men think this of themſelves that they hate Chriſt or
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53665:76"/>
the light: Its true, the general and toothleſs light, the
ſhining and gliſtering light of ſpeculation is pleaſant;
thats not the light which is hated; but as the light that
comes on ſore eyes and cauſes them to ſmart is tedious;
ſo that light that diſcovers and convinces of ſin and
miſery by reaſon thereof, and threatens vengance from
God for it, that you cannot abide; for mark the Word,
<hi>they hate the light leſt their deeds ſhould be reproved;</hi> the
reproving light is taken very ill, they cannot bear that.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe that are in impenitency drunk and
aſleep in the devils ſnare, do oppoſe themſelves, or as the
Word ſignifies, are contrarily diſpoſed and affected,
2 <hi>Tim. 2. 25. Let the Miniſter inſtruct in meekneſs them
that oppoſe themſelves:</hi> And who are theſe? the ſecure
wretched man, who being drunk is fallen aſleep in the
ſnare of the devil; for it is that he may awaken out of
drunken ſleep unto a ſober mind thoſe that lie croſs in
the way, if God peradventure will give them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the acknowledgement of the truth which they
diſown and diſavow; and this is their reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Goſpel invitations are ſlighted by men
of worldly ſpirits and employments, whoſe very callings
do call them from the Goſpel feaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 1. For till a
man be brought to God, his imployment, his lawful
calling in the world makes him to ſlight the grace of
God; they were called to the Supper; and the farm,
the oxen, the merchandiſe, and the marryed wife, hinders
their coming; this and that, other vanity are preferred;
for though heaven be never ſo great a thing (as indeed it
is) yet to a man that hath a cloſer, though a petty thing,
in his heart, that hinders his choiſe of heaven: as though
the firmament be a great thing, yet let a man put a ſix
pence or three pence on his eye and it hinders his ſight of
heaven, becauſe a cloſer thing lies on his eye: ſo when
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53665:76"/>
this world and the things thereof lie cloſe to the heart,
though petty and mean, they bring a contempt and
ſlighting of this converting grace offered in the Word
of the Goſpel; and therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 5. they made light of
it, and <hi>ver.</hi> 3. they would not come, and this is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The patient expectation and loving call of
God is gain ſaid, even by <hi>Iſrael</hi> that had the Ordinances
of God; what good did they? they were reſiſted; how
is that proved? in <hi>Rom. 9. ult. all the day long</hi> (the day
of that Nation, while it was a Nation, till it grew night
with them) <hi>have I ſtretched out my hands to a gainſaying
and contradicting people that believe not: all day long,</hi>
there is patience; <hi>have I ſtretched out my hands,</hi> a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
taken from a Mother calling her child: there is a
ſhew of calling with affection; and yet the proud and
ſelf-righteous people were gainſaying and contradicting;
thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was their reſiſtance as long as Gods patience: and
do not you find this in your own hearts? how often have
you gainſaid and contradicted the God of heaven?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The counſels, invitations and reproofs of
Wiſdom (<hi>i.e.</hi>) of Chriſt, are not regarded; in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24.
a terrible place, <hi>I have called and ye refuſed, ſtretched out
my hands, and no man regarded; ye have deſpiſed all my
counſel, and ſet at nought all my reproof, or hated my reproof;</hi>
and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he proceeds to tell them how bitterly he will
go out againſt them: here is calling, ſtretching out of
hands, counſel, reproof, and they all refuſed, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
deſpiſed, hated; I think this amounts to the
point of reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Holy Ghoſt is reſiſted in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51.
<hi>ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed, ye do alwayes reſiſt the Holy
Ghoſt:</hi> but how doth this ſtand with the former point,
that the Spirit of God in the point of Converſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53665:77"/>
be reſiſted? I anſwer: The clear meaning of this
phraſe, is, the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in the Prophets:
<hi>you have reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking and teſtifying to you
in the Prophets,</hi> as if he had ſaid, the Holy Ghoſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the miniſtry and calling by the Word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
thats it you have reſiſted; for its not meant of the
renewing Spirit in the heart, but of the Spirit teſtifying
in the Prophets, <hi>ye uncircumciſed and ſtiff-necked;</hi> like a
Bullock of a hard neck that will take no yoke: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed,
that is, hard and obſtinate againſt God; you
do alway reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt: this was their reſiſtance,
from whence you learn that there is a natural hardneſs
of heart, an obſtinate neck that is the cauſe of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the Holy Ghoſt, both ſpeaking in the Word,
and knocking at the door, and exciting with motions
the heart to believe; all is in vain; for it is but as knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a dead mans door, or at a guilty perſons door, that
will put more bars when one knocks: ſo when God
knocks and layes ſiege to mans heart, there is made
the greater oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Men that refuſe to ſubmit to the way of
Salvation by God appointed, are ſaid to reject the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of God againſt themſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 7. 30. ſpeaking of
ſome that came not in to the Baptiſm of <hi>John;</hi> ſome
read it Towards themſelves, the counſel of God towards
them for their good, or the counſel of God againſt
themſelves, that is, to their own hurt and prejudice, in
that they would not be baptized by <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry to
the profeſſion of the Lord Jeſus: people that will not
come in to the Ordinances of God, they reject the
counſel of God againſt themſelves, to their own hurt; this
is through reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Take a full meaſure of the height or this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
there can be no higher expreſſions then thoſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53665:77"/>
in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. to tread under foot the Son of God, to
account the blood of the Covenant an unholy or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing, and do deſpight to the Spirit of grace: but
who doth this? are there ſuch monſters in the world,
ſuch miſcreants as do this; yes ſaith he, that there is; and
who are they? ſuch as have been ſanctified; that is, called
into Chriſtianity, thats the plain meaning, and the
word in the text reaches no farther: <hi>ſeparate from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh
Idolatry and pollution, to come to and profeſs the name
of Chriſt, and ſo have been ſanctified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and I take thoſe in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. 5. to be the ſame men with theſe; there its ſaid
<hi>they were enlightned and taſted, they were made partakers of
the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and yet they fell; here you find men ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
to tread under foot the Son of God; there is a
double apoſtacy; a ſimple apoſtacy, called a ſtealing
or a ſhrinking away from the profeſſion of Religion;
And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or a venome apoſtacy, falling away with
deſpight againſt Religion or Chriſt: that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
ſpeaks of the former; this in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. of the latter: and
what doth God conſtrue their action to be? a treading of
the Son of God under foot, and offering deſpight to the
Spirit.</p>
            <p>In all theſe particulars I have held my ſelf to the New
Teſtament and the words of Chriſt in it: and now as I
ſaid, that we have particularly pondred the words of
Scripture in this point, let us ſum them up together;
here is hating, oppoſing ones ſelf, ſlighting, refuſing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
the holy Spirit, rejecting the counſel of God, and
treding under foot the Son of God, which fully amount
to a reſiſtance of the offers of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>13</label> I Know it is a hard thing to convince any man of this;
therefore I have uſed Scripture words, Gods lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53665:78"/>
that we may not flatter our ſelves, and that men
may ſee there is more poyſon in their hearts then they are
aware of, or will own; I know what it is that uſually
blinds men, that they will not own theſe expreſſions of
Scripture to belong to them: for who will call himſelf
an oppoſer of grace offered, a reſiſter of the Holy Ghoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that is becauſe you confeſs your ſelves to be glad of
the tydings of the Goſpel, of remiſſion of ſin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from hell; and you delight to hear of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as it is generally conceived to be a ſtate of happineſs,
not as it is a ſtate of holineſs and communion with God;
and in any extremity, agony, and death into which you
fall, you pretend to have ſome deſires of grace as a
bridge unto Salvation, or at leaſt ſeem to magnifie it
much in words; theſe things ſeem to be an argument to
you that you are not reſiſters and neglecters of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace: but you may well remember that the fooliſh
Virgins knocked at the door and cryed Lord Lord open
unto us, and the ſtony ground heard and believed the
Word of the Goſpel with a kind of joy: And there is
not the veryeſt coward in the world, but will take hold
of a ſwords point to ſave his life, and to pluck him out of
the water: the Goſpel as it is interpreted and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the eye of ſelf-love, ſeems very attractive of the
deſire of man towards it, ſo long as he may ſerve himſelf
and his own advantage upon it; namely to live in ſin
and to his ſin, and yet be ſaved at laſt when he can ſin no
more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo long there is no carnal heart will reſiſt and make
oppoſition: but all this may ſtand with hate of Chriſt
and Grace; for till a mans heart be thus moulded and
tempered by God, as to affect Grace for reconciliation,
and for converſion, that ſo you may be Gods as well as
have him yours; ſo as to live to him as well as have
Chriſt dye for you, till then there is little but fallacy
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53665:78"/>
and falſhood in you: the man that thruſt in at the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
feaſt, who came to fill his belly with good chear, not
for the honour of the bridegroom, was caſt out ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
ſignifying that a man that doth not come to Chriſt
for the love and ſervice of Chriſt, but to reap thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
that ſelf-love ſpies out in Goſpel offers, that
man may be a reſiſter and oppoſer of Grace.</p>
            <p>The third Premiſe is to ſhew the deplorable condition
into which the reſiſters of offered grace do plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
though the time of this life be ſweetned with the
affluence of all earthly commodities and contentments;
all reſiſtance of Grace is dangerous; but that which is
final and out ſtands the patience of God, of that I may
ſay, there remains no ſacrifice for that ſin, but a fearful
expectation of judgement, which I need no further to
prove unto you, then to call in two or three witneſſes to
depoſe unto it: and the firſt of them ſpeaks in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3.
<hi>for if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every
tranſgreſſion,</hi> &amp;c. what then? <hi>how ſhall we eſcape if we
neglect ſo great Salvation:</hi> neglect is a word ſomewhat
lower then this that we call reſiſtance; and yet how ſhall
we eſcape? ſinners againſt the Law of God, though there
be a puniſhment allotted them, yet they may eſcape: but
for the neglect of Salvation, great, ſo great Salvation,
there is no eſcape, there is a peremptory condemnation
belongs to ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> Ezek. 24. 13. <hi>is the ſecond witneſs;</hi> Becauſe I have
purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged
from thy filthineſs any more untill I have cauſed my fury to
reſt upon thee: becauſe I purged thee by my Ordinances, the
application and uſe of them, and thou waſt not purged; <hi>&amp;c.
God will not alwayes waſh a blackmore; his offended pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
turns to fury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third witneſs is <hi>Prov. 1. 24, 26. Becauſe I have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53665:79"/>
called and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hands and no
man regarded, I alſo will laugh at your calamity, and mock
when your fear cometh:</hi> there is no comfort for ſuch men
that refuſe Gods call, ſtand out againſt grace offered:
for when they call and cry, God will laugh at their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
Oh the miſery of men living under the Goſpel,
that ſtand it out againſt the offers of Grace therein
made, which are ſerious and in good earneſt!</p>
            <p>I will handle this point diſtinctly proceeding in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That unto Countries, Cities, Towns, Families,
Single perſons, upon whom the Sun of Righteouſneſs
(that is the Goſpel) doth ariſe with healing in his wings,
God doth afford a day of Grace (which he doth to you
that now live) in which day he proclaimes peace to ſuch
rebels as caſt down their arms, and come in and accept
the pardon and Grace offered upon theſe terms; and this
is their day of viſitation, or as it is called <hi>their day;</hi> let
every one conſider it and lay it ſadly to heart; In <hi>Luke</hi>
19. 42 44. <hi>Oh</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>now that the things pertaining
to thy peace are offered thee: this is thy day, the time of thy
viſitation: our Saviour that wept at the death of</hi> Lazarus,
<hi>did weep now at the blindneſs of this people that did not ſee
and own their day, wherein their Saviour appeared to offer
them grace and ſo great a mercy:</hi> Oh that you would ſay
within your ſelves every one of you: What? have I a
day wherein there is ſaving Grace offered to me, as the
terms of my eternal peace! have I a time of viſitation
afforded by the Lord Jeſus! Oh that I might work out
my ſalvation while it is called to day, before the night
comes upon me (for there is no day but hath a night)
wherein no man can work! Be tenderly affected to your
own ſouls; for this I tell you, and ſhall clear it by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
there is not one of you that ſtand here this day,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53665:79"/>
but have a day afforded, a time of viſitation, wherein the
things pertaining to your eternal peace are held forth to
you: with what earneſtneſs doth the Holy Ghoſt ſpeak
in <hi>Heb. 3. 7. To day if ye will hear his voyce,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>while
it is called to day,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>while it is ſaid to day!</hi> three
times in one Chapter: and oh that you would conſider
it while it is day, while its ſaid <hi>to day,</hi> and while its called
<hi>today:</hi> And the Apoſtle exhorts with all diligence not
to take the grace of God in vain, not to fruſtrate, to
neglect or reſiſt it, by this argument, Now is the accepted
time, Now is the day of ſalvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2. tis a
comfortable and yet a ſad point; comfortable that there
is a day; ſad if you outſtand it, and it be taken from you.
I blame not in any man the deſire of a long day of grace
for <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> for thy ſelf, provided that the
hope of a long day make not the morning a truant: and
though I blame not the deſire, yet I blame their choice
that chooſe the eleventh hour of the day to come into the
vineyard, the laſt hour of their lives, of their day of grace,
before they come into this vineyard to work out their
ſalvation. Oh that you would awake from your deadly
ſleep betimes in the morning of your youth; for by this
means the day of grace will be long, and your day in
grace will be long too; ſuch will the benefit be that you
ſhall reap by it; and let it ſharply enter into your ſpirits
that God hath ſet a time to Towns, to Countries, and
ſingle perſons, to you and me, when we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and brought into the ſtate of ſalvation or never:
a point clear according to the Scripture, however ſome
men diſpute it, and the day of grace is not alwayes ſo
long as the time of life: before thou dye, the Word of
God, the means, may be a dead letter to thee; no man
knows the length of this day of grace, how long the door
will ſtand open to him; but this is certain, the more of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53665:80"/>
the glaſs is run out, the ſhorter is behind; the longer day
of grace <hi>England</hi> hath ſeen and paſt, the ſhorter the day
that is to come: And therefore let theſe monitors
ſtrike and prevail with you: The one is <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 25.
where our Saviour, as elſewhere, inculcates this point:
When once the maſter of the houſe hath ſhut the door,
then if you knock, he ſhall ſay I know you not: from
which place it is plain that there is a time when the door
is ſhut, and will ſtand open no longer: And then you
may Cry to God for mercy and Salvation: But you ſee
the anſwer that will be made, Depart, be gon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I will not
own you nor know you, becauſe when the door of grace
ſtood open, you came not in: The other is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 15. 17.
I take clear places becauſe its ſomewhat a quarrelled
point: Beware, look diligently, marke you, leſt any
fail of the grace of God: for you know that when
he (<hi>Eſau</hi>) would have inherited the Bleſſing, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and found no place for repentance, though he
ſought it carefully with tears. A Place worthy out
ſad and ſerious meditation: he found no place for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
I confeſs learned men with whom ſometime I
have gone in the expoſition of this place, ſay he found
no place for the repentance of his Father: he could
not find means to make his Father repent for beſtowing
his bleſſing on his younger ſon; yet truly it may well and
conveniently be expounded, He found no place for his
own repentance, though he ſought it very carefully: the
Gift is gone from thee, thou haſt loſt thy time;
And though thou Blubbereſt and Cryeſt to me, with
doleful tears, I cannot help thee: And therefore the
Beſt counſel I can give any man in this point, is this:
Work out your Salvation while God works, make hay
while Sun ſhines, Somewhat like to that, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12.
<hi>Work out your Salvation with fear and trembling; for it is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53665:80"/>
God that workes in you both to will and to do:</hi> Giving the
Reaſon from Gods working, that we ſhould work: leſt
God that offers his Grace, and ſtretches out his hand
ſhould pull it in again, after his long ſuffering and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and offer no more: And learn to know <hi>your day</hi>
before it be lapſed: for the lapſe of this day is Fatal:
I, may ſome ſay, thats worth the knowing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But how ſhall I do that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> Firſt do ye find a <hi>prizing</hi> of and an Appetite
to the ſincere milk of the word, that you may grow
thereby? thats a ſign that you are new-born babes; the
Child that cryes to ſuck, is not dead: look for this
thirſting appetite.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the ſpirit of God <hi>ſtrive</hi> with you ſtill,
Convincing and reproving: are your hearts often Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
of ſecret ſins? if unfaithful in your calling, you
find no quiet, its a ſign God hath not done with you:
for while the ſpirit ſtrives its a day of Grace: <hi>My ſpirit
ſhall not alway ſtrive with man,</hi> Gen. 6. 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do you find God making a thorny hedge
about you ways? and doth it ſtand, and is not pulled
up? is there a reſtraint that a man cannot run out but his
Conſcience pricks him? And when ever he ſins in
commiſſions, or omiſſions, the thorny hedge is ſtill gore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and pricking him. Hoſea 2. 6. <hi>I will make a thorny
hedge, that thou ſhalt not find thy path,</hi> not find Content
in ſin: an Evident ſign the door of grace is yet open.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Do you find pulſations, beatings, knockings?
doth any body rap at the door ſtill, as they have done?
<hi>behold,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I ſtand at the door and knock,</hi> Rev.
3. 20. <hi>if any man will open, I will come in and ſup:</hi> this
is an admirable ſign: the invitation of God holds out
ſtill, motion upon motion, beſeeching upon beſeeching:
the knocker at the door is ſeldome quiet: by theſe you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53665:81"/>
may know your <hi>day</hi> of Grace; and therefore I ſay, Call
for the bellows while there is fire; Blow the ſparks
which lie in the Embers, and not all dead, blow them
up; For if the ſparks die, if God call in his ſpirit from
ſtriving with you, you ſhall blow among the dead
aſhes in vain. Oh the miſerie of man that doth not
know his time! eſpecially the time of his viſitation as
Jeruſalem! For whereas <hi>the ſwallow and the ſtork do know
their time,</hi> yet in the 9. or 12. ver. <hi>man knoweth not his
time:</hi> and therefore they are ſnared in an evil time: and
Chap. 8. 6. <hi>becauſe to every purpoſe there is time and
judgement,</hi> if man hit the time, well and Good: but
mark ſaith he, <hi>becauſe man doth not know his time,</hi> take
the nick, <hi>therefore the miſery of man is great upon
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Second propoſition, which is a doleful one: that <hi>In
this day of grace when a man may take Heaven and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Fore-lock, as we uſe to ſay, many times the things
belonging to his eternal peace are hidden from his eyes:</hi>
which is by the Apoſtle made the marke of a loſt man.
In 2 Cor. 4. 3. <hi>if our Goſpel be hid</hi> (that a man ſees
no beauty in it, finds no power) <hi>its hid to them that are
loſt; in whom the god of this world hath blinded their
minds, that the light ſhould not ſhine into them.</hi> And it was
the obſervation of Chriſt that in Jeruſalems day <hi>the
things of her peace were now hid from her eyes,</hi> Luk.
19. 42. never could blindneſs have fallen upon her or
any man elſe in a worſe time: in the day of his viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when the things of his peace are offered to him!
Now is the <hi>day</hi> in which as God opens the door wideſt,
ſo now the devil is moſt converſant about the eye, <hi>leaſt,</hi>
faith the Apoſtle, <hi>the light of the glorious Goſpel ſhould
ſhine into them:</hi> the devils aim is to pick out the eyes of
men: this he moſt frequently aims in this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:53665:81"/>
Thirdly, Thoſe that either refuſe the grace that is
offered to them, or fall quite off from thoſe initials and
beginnings thereof which they had Received (as I
ſhewed when I handled the point of Apoſtacy, they
might do:) they bring themſelves by both into a worſe
condition then ſuch as remain in their natural eſtate,
blind and without all light; then ſuch, as never had ſuch
offers made unto them. And without all queſtion, you
who either ſtand out againſt thoſe offers to refuſe them,
or deſert &amp; relinquiſh thoſe beginnings of grace that you
have received, no heathen man in the world is in a worſe
condition then you; for this Chriſt alſo taught, Matth.
10. 14, 15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive you nor hear your
words, it ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorah,
<hi>in the day of judgement then for them.</hi> Matth. 11. 21.
<hi>we to thee</hi> Chorazin <hi>and</hi> Bethsaida, Cities of <hi>Galilee</hi>
where Chriſt walked; <hi>It ſhall be eaſier for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon.
Heathen Cities ſhall eſcape eaſier then ſuch where
the mighty works of Chriſt have been ſhewed forth:
Oh that men can hear theſe things with dull and drowſie
ears! doth nothing of this ſit upon you? It is a ſign
that your eyes are <hi>hidden</hi> in this your day: if the mighty
works had been ſhewn in them, which have been ſhewn
in you, they would have repented. And they have been
ſhewn in you, and you repent not: And as this is ſaid
of the recuſancy of Grace, the greateſt and moſt vulgar
crime among us: ſo it may be ſaid of thoſe under
the Apoſtacie of it, in 2 Pet. 2. 21. <hi>It had been better
they had never known the way of righteouſneſs, then having
known it, to turn away from the holy Commandment given
unto them.</hi> Let this bound your wandring fancies, and
afright you from your Apoſtacy from God; For as the
Iron of the Stethee is the harder for the often knocking
upon it: ſo the heart of man thats naturally hard, by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53665:82"/>
the often knocking and preſſing the word of God upon
it, is made the harder: And if the ſalt that ſeaſons other
things, be in it ſelf infatuate, its good for nothing; what
ſhall ſeaſon ſalt? they that are in this caſe, heavier
judgement waits on them, and greater guilt is upon
them.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>14</label> LET all neglecters, deſpiſers, and reſiſters of the
Grace of God, learn from henceforth to know, in
what reſpects their condition is worſe then even thoſe
Infidels and heathens that unto this day do ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the ſhadow of death: their condition is worſe
in five regards. Now I come to touch your pulſe; to
ſhew you your condition, if you be not converted and
come in to Chriſt Jeſus, if there be not a work of ſaving
converſion upon your ſouls,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>They are many times Judicially hardened in their
reſiſtance;</hi> every mans heart is <hi>naturally</hi> hard: but every
man is not <hi>Judicially</hi> hardned: as every man muſt dye;
but every man is not ſentenced to dye by the Judge: ſo
there is a <hi>natural</hi> hardneſs and a <hi>ſentential</hi> or a <hi>judicial</hi>
hardneſs, whereby God himſelf hardens the heart of man;
every man is not hardened as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was: ſuch mens
hardneſs is their ſin and judgement to, both in one:
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 14. there is the ſentence which is repeated
three or four times in the New Teſtament, <hi>hearing you
ſhall hear and not underſtand: ſeeing you ſhall ſee and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:</hi>
and this is the puniſhment of obduration, and of
mans own ſhutting of his eyes: and then God ſeals up
his eyes; <hi>leaſt they ſhould be converted,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and I
ſhould heal them.</hi> And it is repeated again in <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 40:
a dreadful judgement that goes out againſt lazy, ſleepy,
neglectful hearers of the Goſpel; <hi>therefore they could
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53665:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not believe, becauſe God hath blinded them,</hi> paenally, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially:
thou ſeteſt a lock on the door againſt his grace,
and he ſets another lock on the door againſt thee. In
reſpect of their hardneſs of heart, Its ſaid <hi>they would not;</hi>
but in reſpect of Gods hardening, Its ſaid <hi>they could not:</hi>
which I perſwade my ſelf is a judgement largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in our Church, thought men will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't
of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Therefore, <hi>the condition of theſe perſons is
very hopeleſs, difficult, yea and deſperate:</hi> there is no
hope that the Bellows will do any good where the fire is
<hi>gene out,</hi> when there remains no ſpark alive in the heart
of man, there is a high word given of them in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4.
who were as greatly indowed as moſt of us, <hi>It is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to renew them again by repentance;</hi> And ſuch is he
that hath extinguiſhed his taſte: And the Apoſtle uſeth
a ſimilitude taken from the earth, that the <hi>rain comes oft
upon,</hi> as ſermons upon you: and the fruit it yields, is
<hi>nothing but briars and thonrs:</hi> ſtill they go on in ſin, the
marks of a Curſed ſoile; <hi>they are nigh to curſing, whoſe

<hi>purged</hi> (by means uſed) and yet <hi>were not purged;</hi> and
therefore <hi>ſhall not be purged any more,</hi> Ezek. 24. 13. take
therefore the grace of God by the forelock; for as they
ſay of <hi>time,</hi> it may prove bald behind: and there may be
no lock to take hold of; the twig of a tree thats once
dead, never revives again: there may grow others on the
ſame root, but a blaſted bud never revives more; <hi>when
the maſter hath ſhut the door, you may knock in vain;</hi> And
ſuch as theſe that have refuſed the call of God, <hi>they
ſhall</hi> in their day (ſaith God) <hi>call on me, but I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
they ſhall ſeek me early, and not find me, becauſe</hi>

Thirdly, <hi>The neglected talent is taken from them.</hi>
Matth. 13. 12. <hi>Whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken
away</hi> that which he ſeems to have, nay that <hi>which he hath.</hi>
God ſtrips thoſe profeſſors of their <hi>parts,</hi> that will not
admit the <hi>power</hi> of his grace into their ſouls: there ſhall
be taken from them that which they ſeem to have: the
<hi>improvement</hi> of Grace, and the keeping it alive, is the
way to encreaſe it, and continue it; But otherwiſe <hi>the
kingdom ſhall be taken from you,</hi> the Goſpel ſhall be taken
away, and all the parts and endowments that you have
got together, you ſhall be ſtript ſtark-naked of them
all: In <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 25, 26. the example of this may be
ſeen in the Jewiſh nation, and other countreys, towns,
and people that have been ſtript of the word and Goſpel
by their undervaluing refuſal of the Grace offered unto
them in <hi>tbeir day,</hi> and the judgement is like the ſin: For
Chriſt curſeth the Barren Figtree with barrenneſs, <hi>Never
fruit grow more on thee:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 21. 19.</note> Oh Let not this curſe come on
you: conſider the dreadful Judgement, the curſe it is
called, of the Figtree; No prevention of this, but by
making uſe of your <hi>accepted time, your day of Salvation,</hi>
without which <hi>your houſe will be left unto you deſolate;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 13. 2 Cor. 6. 2. Mat. 23. 38.</note> this
is the judgement that flies over nations, and countreys,
and particular perſons, (I have obſerved) men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
forward hearers of the word of God, men of good
Elevated affections, ſeeming to be zealous and diligent
in duties, yet afterwards when the world hath grown
upon them, as it is apt to grow upon you all, then God
for the neglect of their talent hath come to diſtrain;
and what hath he left behind? truly a kind of <hi>Bankrupt</hi>
profeſſion of Religion, mouldring away and ſinking to
nothing; a company of ſick profeſſors whoſe parts are
ſpent, and many times they grow ſottiſh and ſtupid;
their <hi>parts,</hi> that which they had, is taken from them;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53665:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>having forgotten</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that they were purged
from their old ſins,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>they are let alone to fill up the meaſure of their
ſins;</hi> In this God deals with you as a phyſitian that
leaves a deſperate patient to his own appetite; Give him
what he will have, you ſay, for the phyſitian hath left
him. God comes at you no more to humble you, to
give you a feeling, a heavenly <hi>thirſt</hi> or appetite; It is a
ſore judgement as any is, yet men do not feel it, when
God pulls the bridle off a mans head, and lets him run;
<hi>he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill;</hi> when God doth not
compaſs him about with <hi>a hedge of thorns,</hi> but <hi>lets him
alone,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 6. Oh miſerable man! In Pſal. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>But my people would not hearken to my word, and Iſrael
would none of me:</hi> here is their ſin: <hi>So I gave them up
to their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 17.

Grace.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The grieving of the waiting patience of God,</hi>
ſtretching out his hand all the day long, and waiting on
you, beſeeching you to come to Chriſt, to receive the
Lord Jeſus: and the anſwering and embittering it with
provocations, <hi>brings forth at laſt that fearful and irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
oath of God,</hi> at which me thinks any man that hath life

it: ſo this Oath is made a Barr againſt the Salvation of

ſignifie the immutability of his wrath, that its like the law
of the <hi>Medes and Perſians that alters not:</hi> and therefore
fear to outſtand <hi>the day of grace;</hi> For be you aſſured
that as <hi>ſun-ſet</hi> to one, may be and is <hi>ſun-riſe</hi> to another:
ſo the <hi>day of grace</hi> may ariſe to another, and yet ſet to
thee: Oh that you would know and tremble at it:
fearing leſt you ſhould be at or paſt the <hi>ſun-ſet</hi> of this
day of grace: and ſo I have finiſht the three premiſes,
Firſt, <hi>That God offers Goſpel Grace to men ſeriouſly and in
good earneſt.</hi> Secondly, <hi>It is natural to corrupt man to
entertain this Grace offered with neglect and reſiſtance.</hi>
Thirdly, That therefore <hi>he is plunged into a ſad and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond of which, that <hi>its natural to man to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this grace offered with reſiſtance,</hi> is that which I am
to ſhew the reaſon of.</p>
            <p>The Firſt and the Third, <hi>that God offers that Grace, which
being reſiſted, plunges men into worſe condition then ever, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords

            </p>
            <p>But for the reaſons of this <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> though all reaſon
is for mans acceptance thereof, yet ſuch is the frame of
the heart that it oppoſeth it ſelf againſt it, and therefore
cannot come to Jeſus Chriſt; the Reaſons though they

For though there be a holineſs before the End, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

moulds &amp; prepares the heart by the miniſtry of the word

enquire what they ſhould do to be ſaved.</hi> For as it is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Generation, there are many previous diſpoſitions
that go before the induction of the forme, which gives
it the ſpecifical Being; ſo are men brought to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

God doth work by theſe previous workings, and in the

            <p>Object. 2. If this be that the men in whom theſe are
wrought, may deſert, extinguiſh, and fall off; why
then will ſome ſay, <hi>is this ſo culpable a thing to quench
theſe, that have no regenerating life in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are they againſt which the Scripture
pours out ſo much wrath, and declares ſo great danger
in this caſe to ſuch as ſhall deſert, forſake, or extinguiſh
theſe workings of initial beginnings, as in that phraſe
Heb. 10. ult. <hi>my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in them that
withdraw to perdition;</hi> not becauſe theſe have any root
at the preſent, for ſo our Saviour deſcribes them in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53665:90"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 21. but becauſe the things in themſelves
have a tendency to further ripening and perfection; as
the egg to the Chicken, the Bud to the fruit, and the
embryo to the Child, not yet actually perfect, Gal 4. 19.
<hi>I travel in pain till Chriſt be formed in you:</hi> In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
they are ſaid to know the way of Righteouſneſs,
2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 20, 21. And for this reaſon it is ſo culpable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they do deſtroy the fruit in the bud. But then
may ſome ſay;</p>
            <p>Object. 3. This renewing and converting grace comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from God, and doth not require any previous or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous
workings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The compariſon of natural generation will give
ſome light, what to ſay of this: for ſuppoſe the rational
ſoul be infuſed, not meerly traduced, poured in from
heaven by the hand of God: yet notwithſtanding there
is uſe of marriage, and many preparatory diſpoſitions are
required, tending to the generation of a man: ſo that
you may rightly conceive here if grace be (which yet
I diſpute not) the begetting of a man to God, there may
notwithſtanding be required many previous diſpoſitions
tending thereunto: which that it is ſo, may be evident
to you by the means and inſtruments that God uſes in
Converſion: the inſtruments are men, the means are
the miniſtry of the word; <hi>I have begotten you by the Goſpel,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. And if God was
pleaſed immediately (which I know not that any of
you Expect, and ſhould be ſorry you ſhould be deluded
ſo) I ſay immediately to convert, and ſuddenly to ſnatch
a man out of his unregeneracy, without conviction
foregoing, without knowledge and ſorrow for ſin, deſire
of pardon and deliverance, then neither would there be
need of the miniſtry of men, nor word preached: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
need the Miniſter <hi>rightly divide the word,</hi> as the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53665:91"/>
Apoſtles phraſe is: that is, plowing down the ridges of
the law, or laying up the furrows by the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
this grace therefore is that which may be deſerted,
and theſe offers of grace are many a time reſiſted, and
are by many finally reſiſted to the great danger of their
ſouls, and the loſs of them. And therefore it is
juſt with God to deſert theſe, and to withdraw the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
as indeed he doth, ſo as now after all they reject
and hate the truth, and are given up, and let alone to go
on in their luſts: as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſrael would have
none of me: therefore I gave them up,</hi> &amp;c. Whence men
become hardened in their ſecurity, to rot and be ſtupifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their ſins, and at laſt come to that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
calls the <hi>worm that never dies,</hi> in the world to come,
which above all other things as I conceive, grows
and breeds out of the neglect of grace offered: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
and recuſancy of the Lords ſtretched-out hand:
this this ſharpens the teeth of that worm that will bite
them the ſoreſt, and ſting them the worſt, and upbraid
them with this above all: the neglect, the refuſal of grace
given or offered.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Prop. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe whom God hath affected with ſome begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of grace, he doth not uſually deſert nor deſiſt to promote
them in the way towards Converſion, until either by their
voluntary neglect, or by the repulſe of that Initial Grace of
God, he be by them firſt forſaken and caſt of:</hi> and this is the
mirror of the kindneſs and mercy of God to poor men,
that when he hath begun to woo, he follows them
with kindneſs, and calls not in his Jewels or rings, until
he be by the party woed, denyed, and repulſed: <hi>take
the talent from him,</hi> ſaith our Saviour: but it is not ſaid
till the man had hidden it in the ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 28.
and this ſeems to be given as the reaſon, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24.
often quoted; <hi>I have called, and ye refuſed, I alſo will
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53665:91"/>
laugh at your deſtruction, and mock when your fear cometh.</hi>
And this is alſo the reaſon of Gods forſaking, 2 Chron.
24. 20. <hi>Becauſe ye have forſaken the Lord, he hath alſo
forſaken you.</hi> And Pſalm 81. 11. <hi>My people would not
hearken to my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me: ſo I
gave them up &amp;c.</hi> God may ſet up a candle or Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t pleaſure: It is a
work of grace, not of juſtice nor of injuſtice to deny it:
but having afforded theſe means and Ordinances for
Converſion, it is not ordinary: and there is no Scripture
teaches that he takes away the aids or ſubſidiaries of
exciting grace, or the help given untill he hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
and there be a voluntary caſting of him off <hi>untill</hi>
as the text ſaith, <hi>there be no remedy, 2 Chron.</hi> 36. 16. Oh
that the length of the patience and goodneſs of God
might awaken your hearts, to take Grace by the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
when it is coming towards you: becauſe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and ſeaſon going from you may be bald.</p>

for their neglect and undervaluing the motions and excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Grace, may be juſtly left and deſerted, though God
doth not deal with them</hi> ſtricto Jure, <hi>nor finally leave the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of them.</hi> I ſpeak not of the grace of God in the act of
Converſion, that is victorious over the heart of man, as
hath been largely handled before: but thoſe overtures,
thoſe precedaneous workings I now ſpeak of. If you
conſider the Elect of God in the ſtate of grace, that is
the called, even they are often wanting to the grace that
is offered: there is a great deal of neglect, undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and contempt that abounds in them. And ſo for
a time in ſome particulars they are left: <hi>For a ſmall
moment have I forſaken thee: I have hid my face from
them, Iſaiah</hi> 54. 7, 8. So it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chron.
32. 31. <hi>God left him to try him, that he might know all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53665:92"/>
that was in his heart.</hi> And <hi>My beloved,</hi> ſaith ſhe,
Cant. 5. 6. <hi>was withdrawn, I ſought him but could not find
him.</hi> But this is done in a way of diſcipline: for if the
Lord ſhould deal in ſtrict Juſtice with his elect, even
for the neglect and reſiſtance of grace after converſion,
how ſhould they be able to ſtand before him? But
much more is this true of them in their natural ſtate:
they are as oppoſite as others, and therefore they may
alſo be left: and ſo they are, but not finally, but for
Conviction: And the Lord, I am confident, convinces
moſt men before he converts them: by giving them
ſuch offers as being left to their own management
would come to nothing; they would ſee that they have
no more power of themſelves then others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as an Angler pulls back his bait many times, to
quicken the appetite of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

afterwards repented and went:</hi> if we ſhould be taken

therefore it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord of the Vineyard ſent ſervants,
and he ſent other ſervants: and he ſent yet again, ver.</hi> 37.
which ſhews that God doth not uſe to take his people
at advantage, but ſends ſervants after ſervants, and
the Son after that: and yet moſt juſtly may leave us at

and when they are wounded, run to the herd, as
a wounded Deer to ſhift off the Arrow: yet finally
God will not leave them:<note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 37.</note> 
               <hi>I will cauſe you,</hi> ſaith God
(ſpeaking to a people rebellious enough) <hi>to paſs under

A Metaphor taken from a man telling his ſheep
out of the Fold with a rod in the morning as they go
out. <hi>And I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant:</hi>
For the Elect of God are as a child; if his arm be broken
or out of joint, he would not have it toucht, but let alone
ſo it might have eaſe. Is it not ſo with us? would not
we be at eaſe and quiet? Do not we cry and labour
that our ſores may not be toucht? but are better
pleaſed to be left in our ſecurity, and natural condition:
yet God will follow us with conviction after convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
breaks our peace, that it ſhall not cement or be
ſoadered: <hi>Make a thorny hedge about us that we ſhall not find
our path:</hi> Untill being convict, we come to that, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to God, or my firſt husband; for then it was better with
me then now.</hi> The Lord hews them and moulds their
hearts, till of unwilling he makes them willing: and have
brought them as thoſe that are in a Caſtle, whoſe ſtrong
hold is beaten down, they are forced to ſurrender to meer
mercy, upon the Victors own terms. So the Lord will
force his elect. <hi>All that the Father hath given to me, ſhall
come to me,</hi> John 6. 37. <hi>And do it for thy Name ſake,
for our backſlidings are many,</hi> Jer. 14. 7. This is the word,
and may be ſpoken even by the elect of God. And if
this were not, that God ſhould not take the work into
his hand, he might ſtretch out his hand all the day long
and find little but gainſayings and contradictions: no
effectual calling could be: there would be no ſuch thing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53665:93"/>

fruſtrate. This was the remnant or end that I had to

in deſpight of your own ſtubberneſs: And ſo much

both the Preacher of this point, and the Hearer of it

and the power or cauſality of man himſelf b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed:
For ſo the Text, <hi>No man can come, except my

that tryes other mettals, who ſhall try it? how ſhall
it be made appear, that this Doctrine is indeed the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53665:93"/>
true teſt? For that I will give you three Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe this Doctrine is conſonant to the ſcope of
Go <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> ſpel doctrine:</hi> which as it ſuggeſts matter of glorying
to the ſinner in himſelf confounded with ſhame and loſt,
and never leaves him till it hath brought him to a ſtate
of glorying from his nothingneſs: ſo it places this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in God only, not ſelf: as the compating two
places of Scripture doth witneſs: the one is 1 Cor.
1. ult. <hi>That he that gloryeth may glory in the Lord:</hi> and
Epheſ. 2. 9. <hi>Not of works;</hi> for this Reaſon, <hi>leaſt any man
ſhould boaſt.</hi> Which two places do ſhew the ſcope of
Goſpel Doctrine: And there cannot be a better
teſt of Doctrine, then the conſonancy of it with the
main ſcope of the Goſpel: that is, with the Analogy
of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. For if in expounding a particular
Scripture, a man ſeem to cut out one part of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unproportionable to the body, he ſeems to have
miſt his meaſure, and as it were to make a monſtrous
garment: For the ſcope of the Scripture is the meaſure
and teſt whereby any particular is to be meaſured:
therefore this muſt needs be a good teſt.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> Secondly, <hi>Becauſe all the gracious works of God from

in the Kingdom of heaven; I ſay every one of theſe
works upon, and in, his Elect to bring them to ſalvation, do
all conſpire and tend unanimouſly to this great end, the
praiſe of his free and powerful grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 6. <hi>He hath
Predeſtinated and Adopted us that we might be to the praiſe

Varniſh, no colour of it ſelf, but ſerves to ſet off all
other colours. Wiſdom, Power, Mercy and Love are
included or ſet out by Grace: And therefore the praiſe
of grace is the praiſe of all: for God doth not work
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53665:94"/>
for the exaltation of mans power or pride, but to the
praiſe of his own grace.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, This is a true teſt, <hi>Becauſe we find the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
experience of Gods people avouching and atteſting this:</hi>
the experience of <hi>Paul</hi> that great trumpet of grace,
1 Cor. 9. 16. <hi>I have nothing to glory of;</hi> and in 1 Cor.
12. 11. <hi>I am nothing;</hi> For Gods ſecond Church is built
as Gods ſecond Temple (the ſecond Church, give me
leave ſo to ſay, I mean the Goſpel Church) <hi>not by
might, nor by power, but by my ſpirit.</hi> And they cry
<hi>grace grace</hi> unto it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 6, 7. as that which was
called the ſecond Temple was meaner built to outward
ſhew, then <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; and was built not by
might, nor by power, but with much weakneſs of the
people returned from Captivity, and oppoſed of all
hands. So is the Goſpel ſtate of the Church built
of a people returned from the captivity of Hell and
death; not by the might and power of man, but by
the Spirit of God; And therefore he that made the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
Anſwer to that Queſtion the Apoſtle propounds,
<hi>Who made thee to differ from another,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Ego me ipſum
diſcerno,</hi> I diſcriminate my ſelf, ſeems to be miſtaken
in his own Experience, (as Chriſtians often are) or not
to own the confeſſed experience of Gods Converts, as
<hi>Paul</hi> and others that have been humbled out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to acknowledge the free grace of God. For I
think we ſhall rarely find a man on his death-bed to be
a Papiſt that is enlightened; becauſe then he finds he
flies out of himſelf to Gods alone mercy; Nor ſeldom
find a man in point of converſion to be a Pelagian: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he acknowledges it to be the Free grace of
God that brings him both down and up: Down, to
bring down his pride, to throw down his ſtrong holds;
And Up again, by raiſing him from a ſtate of nothing.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53665:94"/>
And therefore as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his time, when
there were many deceivers gone forth into the world,
as there are in the dayes wherein we live, did give Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
a teſt, or mark by which they might prove the
ſpurious, or the true: whether they brought ſealed
meaſure with their Doctrine, yea or no. And that teſt
was the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh: (for that was
then commonly denyed by the ſpawn of Gnoſticks)
ſaying, <hi>If any come to you, and bring not this Doctrine,
receive him not, 2 John ver.</hi> 10. And ſo moſt commonly
all along in the Scripture, where any dangerous error is
confuted, you ſhall find in that confutation a teſt given,
a touchſtone whereby that Doctrine that is Erroneous
may be tryed: So in this point of Converſion of man,
and diſcriminating grace, if any man blow the Bladder
as well as the Trumpet to make him ſwell, and ſill him
full of Pride and Self; building God upon man, and
not man upon God; Let this that I have ſaid be the
teſt at which you examine that Doctrine. For as the
letting fall of the ſtring of a Vial or Lute too low, or
the ſtraining it too high, ſpoils the harmony: And as the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom</hi> 12. 6. the proportion is changed by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a Unite unto, or by ſubſtracting it from any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
ſo in this point of converting grace, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
of mans power be drawn to deny mans duty: or
the Calling for Duty in Scripture, be drawn ſo high as
to exalt mans power, the proportion and Harmony is
ſpoiled in both. After this animadverſion, and after
ſuch a teſt of Doctrine, here found out and commended
to you, let me give you warning how to apply this
ſealed mete-wand to the Doctrine that you hear: And
I would that there were not ſo many inſtances as might
be given, that the Iniquity or Neceſſity of theſe times
does require to be ſpoken unto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:53665:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt, That Doctrine by this teſt ſounds not clear,
but ſeems to have a crack in it, <hi>That under pretence of duty
doth conclude and advance mans power:</hi> and the reaſon is
plauſible with thoſe men that have learning enough, that
whereas it is ſaid, in Ezek. 18. 30. 31. <hi>Repent and
make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit, and caſt away your
tranſgreſsions; for why will you die?</hi> and from Jer. 4. 4.
<hi>Circumciſe your ſelves to the Lord, and be not ſtiff-necked;
take away the foreskin of your hearts:</hi> from theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
doth conclude that man hath power to do it; or
elſe ſaith carnal Reaſon, why is he commanded? they
that do make this concluſion, let them be examined by
this Eſtabliſht teſt of Doctrine; and having hung the
ſcales, let us now weigh the point: this is true, What
God in his law requires, that the law ſuppoſes a power to
be or to have been, becauſe the law of God doth not
command things abſolutely impoſſible, to which there
never was power given; and therefore mans diſability
to perform any command ariſes accidentally when he
hath diſabled himſelf: And this is called by the Apoſtle;
and the cauſe of it ſhewn, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 8. the Impoſſibility
of the law, and that is through ſin and corruption that
hath Invaded man, and diſabled him unto obedience;
But now in caſe of this diſability, the law that requires
the duty, doth not argue a power in you, but it doth
drive diſabled man to the remedie, and that is the free
grace of God, and; therefore he that calls on thee for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
doth himſelf give it: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. he that
bids, Make you a new heart, doth promiſe it, I will give
them a new heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. He that ſaith Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
your ſelves, ſaith alſo I will circumciſe your hearts,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. The command ſhews what man owes to
God, and what muſt be in him if he will not dye: and
this drives him to the remedy, the free and gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53665:95"/>
of God, to work this in him: the meaſure of his
duty is not the meaſure of his power: as a man mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
not his worth by what he ows; no man will be ſo
abſurd; and yet men will meaſure their power to repent,
to turn to God, to believe in Chriſt by what indeed is their
duty to do, which is (to ſay no more) a falſe meaſure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Nor are they to be heard that from qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of fitneſs do argue and conclude for qualifications
of worthineſs or merit:</hi> obſerve, for you will not
underſtand the anſwer to theſe, except you underſtand
where the Errour lies: the law uſes this word (worthy)
for a dueneſs of the reward of debt; that that hath ſome
proportion to the reward, when the reward is of debt, as
the Apoſtle deſcribes it: but the Goſpel dictionary uſeth
the word (worthineſs) for the fitneſs of a man to receive
the reward of grace and promiſe; and therefore in the
Goſpel they are uſually pronounced worthy, that are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and made meet for to receive Chriſt or the promiſe:
as the worthy receiver at the Lords table, is not he that
is meritoriouſly worthy, but he that is meet, that is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
anſwerably to the Sacrament, that hath in him ſuch
qualifications as are anſwerable to the body and blood of
the Lord there exhibited: and ſo you may read works

digeſt theſe words <hi>qualifications towards Converſion,</hi> &amp;c.
(a point that in the proceſs of this diſcourſe I ſhall touch

no quarrel upon the word at all: for we mean not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
qualifications, not any thing meritoriouſly

of the ſubject recipient, not merit of the thing to be

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That doctrine, by this teſt, will be found leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that makes the ruinous condition of man leſs then it is:</hi>
for then conſequently it will follow that the power of
God in his reſtauration is leſs alſo: as for inſtance, if
<hi>Lazarus</hi> be but ſick, his recovery is leſs then a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
If you make mans caſe better, ſo as ſickneſs is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
death, ſo far as mans power is made greater in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſo far is the power of God made leſs then it is: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
on both hands are to be avoided, in leſſening the
freeneſs or the power of man, or in the greatning of it;
I will not ſo decry the will of man in his converſion,
that I will deny it to be freer in that act, then it is in any
action of this life, then it is to eat and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53665:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whence comes that freedom? who hath unſhackled, nay
who hath revived this will? that is God; <hi>The will of

               <note place="margin">Luther.</note> 
               <hi>nor

They who make man who is <hi>dead in ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 5.</note> to be like the
man in the parable half-dead, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 30. (which to
anſwer that place by the way, was enough to ſhew who
was his neighbour; It was enough for the ſcope of our
Saviours Parable, to ſuppoſe the man left half-dead:)
do unawares wrong the quickening vertue of Chriſt:
<hi>You hath he quickened who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1.</note>
he that makes a man leſs then dead, makes the quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power that converts him, leſs then a reſurrection: he
that makes the captivity and bondage of a man leſs, doth
thereby make his freedom leſs too; becauſe theſe do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
one upon another; bondage and freedom, captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and liberty: as thoſe Papiſts that free the virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> from all ſin, do alſo remove Chriſt from being
her Saviour; his name ſhall be called Jeſus, becauſe he
ſaves his people from their ſins; if there be no ſin, from
whence is the ſalvation? if there be no ſalvation, from
whence is he called a Saviour? as therefore I would
not ſet works in the place of Juſtification, which is
Chriſts place; ſo neither will I remove them from a
neceſſary place in ſanctification and ſalvation, for they
have a neceſſary place: but not a place to work it; for
we muſt be Gods workmanſhip before we can do Gods
work; the Apoſtle makes that plain, when he gives
that as a reaſon;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 10.</note> nor in the place of Juſtification; for that
as I ſaid, is Chriſts place; nor as a motive to move God
to juſtifie a ſinner; for that is free grace; nor as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and inſtrument: for that is the place of faith; yet
they have a place in ſanctification afterwards, as the
fruit of the tree, though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not as the root; for a cypher
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53665:97"/>
that in the firſt place of a figure is nothing, may in the
ſecond place add a value: ſo that which in point of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and cauſality, is nothing, yet if there be firſt grace,
a work of regeneration, and ſanctification wrought in
the heart, then I ſay there is ſomething to be ſaid of
this obedience: and as I will not give to man the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the will and the deed, ſo neither will I deny the
working out of Salvation to be mans act; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe that ſay, Chriſt repents for me, and Chriſt
believes for me, as if ſo be it were not man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
and the ſinner that repents, they ſpeak a kind of
non-ſence; the text I am upon, teaches the contrary,
where he tells them the drawing is Gods; the coming
is mans act and duty, and therefore its not to be ſaid
Chriſt believes and repents for me; for I muſt repent
and believe, or I am loſt, and lie in my loſt eſtate. The
duty and act of faith and repentance are yours; But
the grace and power whereby theſe are wrought in you,
are God's, and therefore the rule here is that the power
and Grace of God be not degraded by the extenuation
of mans natural ſin and corruption, but that rather the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>much more,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17. be
given to the abundance of Grace; for if you conſider
and compare together mans duty, and Gods power,
mans act, and the power of God that works the will and
the deed, rather give the more to God then ſin: if ſin
be abounding, I would rather ſay Grace over-abounds;
becauſe that is the favourable ſide, and gives unto the
grace of God more then peradventure ſome think to be
due to him, <hi>that where as abounding may be ſaid of ſin, let
ſuper abounding be ſaid of Grace,</hi> Rom. 5. 20.</p>

FOurthly, <hi>Nor will that doctrine abide the due or true
teſt, that under the pretence of this ſole power of God
exerted in mans Converſion, doth clamorouſly cry down all
inſtruments and means, Goſpel and Goſpel Miniſtry, under
this pretence that the ſole power of mans new creation and
converſion is of God; and therefore hold that as God made
this world without tools and inſtruments, ſo God ſhall and
will convert men by his converting grace without means,
inſtruments, miniſtry, and the like;</hi> And what danger is
it to ſnatch up a piece of a ſentence? for they
have heard this doctrine from the orthodox, that man
cannot, he is diſabled to believe in Chriſt, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is of God, and have run away with it, and thence
have hatcht this fancie, that therefore we need not look
after theſe means: ſhewing to us that preach, that we
had need to uſe due Correctives in our preaching; for
good medicines without apt Correctives ſometimes breed
wind or diſeaſe, rather then cure it; ſo this orthodox
doctrine not rightly Corrected, breeds this fancy, that
there is no need of inſtruments to work that whereof
God hath the ſole power; Theſe men (I can ſay no
leſs of them) will teach God to convert man; Let
them teach themſelves to ſtand in the way and rode of
Chriſt, where he walks and doth miracles; Let them
ſtand in the way of his ordinances. For though I
confeſs, God can convert without ordinances and
means, yet to ſay that he doth ſo, is as if becauſe he
did ſometime make a man at full ſtature (as <hi>Adam</hi>)
therefore he doth ſo always; And ſo aboliſh mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
which he hath inſtituted for the propagation of
mankind; and ſo becauſe God can convert man, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53665:98"/>
bring him to a full autumne and ſtate of grace at
firſt, that therefore God muſt aboliſh his own ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
inſtituted for bringing his people to him; Is it
not enough that God hath tyed us to the uſe of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
where Salvation is to be had, but we muſt tie
God according to our fancie, either to or from the
uſe of Ordinances? what if God did extraordinarily
without the plough maintain <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs
by Manna, bread from heaven; is therefore God tyed
to do the ſame by ſuch extraordinary means, when they
come to their ſetled Land, where they mow, and ſowe,
and reap Corn for themſelves? this doth not follow;
Where there are no ordinances to be had, there God may
work extraordinarily: But God is not therefore bound
to do it, neither can we conclude he will do it; let <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi>
the Syrian be an extraordinary example of a man
healed by miracle, and thoſe that Chriſt converted and
healed: what is this to our purpoſe? God by his
meer free will hath choſen this way of Goſpel-miniſtry,
and ordained it to be the <hi>Power of God to Salvation,</hi> Rom.
1, 16. God puts forth a power when he converts a ſoul:
and he puts forth this power in this way, the Goſpel; Its
confeſt that the veſſel or pipes by which this excellency
of power is conveyed, are earthen and contemptible:
But that is <hi>de induſtria,</hi> on purpoſe, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. we have
this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the
power may be of God, and not of us:</hi> the weakneſs of
the veſſel doth derogate from the power of the veſſel:
It was his goodneſs, and not unto your loſs, to teach
you by men: for if God had taught you by Angels
that are by nature unſociable with men, it had not been
ſo well; now God hath appointed to bring you to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the miniſtry of men like your ſelves; And in
a way ſurable to man, that is, by word and doctrine,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53665:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by counſel, inſtruction, reaſon, God will ſo convince and
convert you, not by inſinuating a ſudden power into the
heart of man: from whence Miniſters are called <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
together with God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 1. and he alſo is ſaid
to <hi>work together with them,</hi> Mark. 16. 20. If God
and man work together, what ſhall we think of them
that divide this partnerſhip, this conjunction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Oh but you Preach the law! It is the Goſpel
that Converts!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You are deceived; we preach Chriſt when we
preach the law, as is plain when <hi>Paul</hi> was required by
<hi>Felix</hi> to preach to him the faith of Chriſt, ſaith the text,
he preacht <hi>of righteouſneſs, temperance, and judgement
to come, whereat</hi> Felix <hi>trembled:</hi> was this preaching
the Faith of Chriſt? yea, or elſe <hi>Paul</hi> was deceived; the
Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
Rom. 10 4. and becauſe by the law, men are
concluded under ſin, <hi>that the promiſe,</hi> that is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<hi>might be given to them that believe,</hi> Gal. 3. 22.
and if ſo, what diſſonancy will you make between
preaching of the means and the end? we are not ſo mad
as to preach Salvation by the law: and when we
preach the Law to you, to wound, it is in order to the
promiſe, and Chriſt Jeſus: It is not the plungers that
trouble the water, that catch the Fiſh: we know it is
the Net, but the plungers drive the Fiſh into the net,
that they may be caught: we ſay the work of Salvation
is not by the Law, its the net of the Goſpel whereby
men are caught to Everlaſting Salvation: But its the
terrour of the Law, and the curſe under which they
are driven into this net: tis the avenger of blood that
purſues with the drawn ſword, that makes you fly to
the City of refuge, and therefore there is more of
Chriſt preacht in a Sermon that you call Legal many
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53665:99"/>
times then in the vociferations &amp; clamors that ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
uſe of Chriſt, Chriſt, as they cryed <hi>Baal, Baal,</hi> though
you pronounce nothing but Chriſt, a hundred times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
and therefore let me charge you (for that I
may have leave to do to thoſe that are under my charge)
and exhort all others, that ſince faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſince you are born again of the uncorruptible ſeed
of the word: ſince his Miniſters are in pain, while they
go traveling in their ſouls till Chriſt be formed in you:
ſince the Lord many times in his word honours the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
in the work of Converſion, with the honour
of doing that which he doth by them (S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I
am your father) as <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword was honoured with
the work that <hi>David</hi> did by it: upon all theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
be not you ſtricken with this madneſs, as either
to think that the excellency of power of Converſion is in
the box that carries this treaſure, or to divide the treaſure
from the veſſel that you have in it; for then you loſe it:
But where then will you have it? But to conſider in your
ſerious thoughts, what thoſe gifts were which Chriſt gave
to his Church on his triumphal day; a phraſe of ſpeech
alluding to the Roman triumph; when a Conquer or came
home and had a triumph allowed him by the Senate, he
ſpred his prizes that he brought home, and gave mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
gifts; ſo the Apoſtle obſerves that when
Chriſt aſcended and rode in the triumphal Chariot to
heaven, <hi>he carried ſpoils with him, and gave gifts to men;</hi>
and what were thoſe gifts? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7. he gave Apoſtles,
Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
and perfecting of the Saints: or thus (if you
will) he gave the Holy Ghoſt, which doth not only
work itſelf, but makes overſeers, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and
then works by them, as the inſtrument is firſt made,
and then wrought with: ſo the Holy Ghoſt makes
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53665:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you overſeers, and then works in and by them that are
Miniſters made by the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
not means and inſtruments: enough is ſaid of that
point to wiſe men.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Nor will that doctrine abide this teſt, that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that man is the giver, and God the receiver:</hi> for the
truth is, God is the firſt giver in all kinds: make him
but firſt in the work of Calling, Election, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you cannot be unſound or erroneous in
any of theſe doctrines: but that doctrine which makes
man the giver, and God the receiver, cannot be true; the
reaſon is, <hi>he loved us firſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19.
<hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you,</hi> Joh. 15. 16.
and therefore it is ſaid, Rom. 11. 35. <hi>who hath firſt given
to God? and it ſhall be recompenced to him again;</hi> that is, that
hath firſt done or performed any work, that obliges God
to recompence it; thoſe therefore that make man the
firſt lover, the firſt chuſer, the firſt giver, they make
man the creditor, and God the debtor: and how unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
is it with any modeſty and ingenuity to ſpeak
ſo? which of neceſſity muſt be, if you make man
firſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly; <hi>Nor doth it follow by this teſt</hi> (which is
ſomewhat a difficult point) <hi>that becauſe there is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made with man, upon conditions of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
therefore theſe conditions muſt be performed by one
of the confederates, that is, by mans own power:</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this, its ſaid, there was ſo much required of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and he had power, and God expected the performance of
the condition made with him; And you know many times
it is thus with men; they expect a mutual performance
of Covenants one with another; and they do-in-many
caſes think that man hath power to perform the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to which he obliges himſelf: and yet ſometimes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53665:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tis otherwiſe; there cannot a general rule be made of this;
a creditor requires the payment of the ſumm; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the debtor pays it of mony gotten by his own hand,
or borrow it, or it be given him by ſome benefactor, is
not material; only this is material, that the condition be
performed, and the money paid: ſo we may ſay in this
point; this is certain, that the condition required of man,
is mans duty, is mans act; and the benefit of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is for him that performs faith and repentance:
but God requires not the performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by mans own power: for therefore the Covenant is
altered from <hi>Do this and live,</hi> unto <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus
and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> they are both expreſt Rom. 10. 5, 9.
becauſe man, fallen man, could not abide ſuch a condition
of life as muſt reſt upon his own power to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
which was before poſſible to him while he ſtood
in integrity, but now is impoſſible to him in ſin: this
objection may be further purſued, and then I confeſs
you make a hard knot of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Still it ſeems the condition continues impoſsible; for
man by a natural power cannot perform perſonal and perfect
obedience, neither can he believe, neither keep the law, nor
obey the Goſpel, neither perform the condition of works,
nor yet of Faith; and what are we then the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt diſtinguiſh between a natural
power, and a power reſtored by grace; as to the natural
power, there is no more in man to believe in Chriſt, then
to perform the law: to a natural power both theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are impoſſible, (let me not offend you in words) for
to <hi>Do this and live,</hi> you do not pretend to, but to Believe
and come to Chriſt, that you ſay you can. But the text
ſaith, <hi>no man can come to me;</hi> Oh that you could but
feel this impotency in your ſelves; but then the power
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53665:100"/>
reſtored is a power to believe in Chriſt, which is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to keep the law of works, but unfeignedly to
believe in and love Chriſt: and this power is given by
the drawing of God, to all that do indeed come to
Chriſt: <hi>thoſe that are not drawn, do not come; all that
come are drawn, and impowred to believe:</hi> Gods drawing,
and mans coming are, both of one latitude, one meaſure,
one extent; <hi>as many as the Lord works upon and draws, they
do come,</hi> ver. 45. <hi>And thoſe that are not drawn, do not come,</hi>
ver. 44. and this I call the reſtored power, not reſtored
to man to keep the Law, but to believe in, and receive
Chriſt Jeſus. And ſo the power to perform the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant, is a reſtored power: but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the condition of the Covenant of works, there is
no power reſtored: therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>God will not
that it ſhould pertain but only to his Grace, that man ſhould
come to him, that being come he ſhould not recede from him.</hi>
And that God would not have the condition of this
Covenant to be built on mans power of performance,
I prove by three Reaſons.</p>

11. ult. and that <hi>rectum eſt index ſui &amp; obliqui,</hi> the right
line is index of it ſelf, and the oblique or Crooked:
Let whatſoever doctrine that makes not all to be of
him, through him, and unto him, be hence confuted,
by this excellent teſt; as</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That which makes man a beginner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and God a helper of thoſe beginnings: that affirms
aſſiſting, but not preventing Grace; that which makes grace
the nurſe, not the mother that brings forth; a crutch for the
lame, but not life to quicken the dead; that which makes
God the finiſher, but not the author of Faith, <hi>this is
not Scripture doctrine; this makes not all to be of
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That which affirms that though there be no
merit in Juſtification, yet there is a power in man for
Sanctification, becauſe it deals unequally with a long arm,
and a ſhort one; allows no merit, and yet aſſumes a power:</hi>
that ſounds not well neither: yet this is a thought that
is in many a mans heart, Oh that God would pardon me,
and for walking with God, let me alone: Oh that God
would forgive me my ſins, and Ile cleanſe my ſelf,
Ile live to God: you will not aſſume the merit of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
but you may not ſet your power in the place
of the ſpirit of God in point of ſanctification, no more
then merit in place of the Lord Jeſus for Juſtification;
for in Pſal. 103. <hi>he forgives all thy ſin, and heals all
thy diſeaſe,</hi> ver. 3. where in one verſe you may ſee both:
I Confeſs, Juſtification is like quitting of a Priſoner at
the Goal delivery; the ſentence quits him in an inſtant,
<pb facs="tcp:53665:102"/>
and frees him. But ſanctification is like the healing
of a wound by a Surgeon, which is a progreſſive work, a
work of time: the power of man is nothing in the one
as well as the other; <hi>without me you can do nothing;</hi> both
are <hi>from Chriſt that comes by water and blood,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 6.
for the remiſſion of ſin, and alſo for cleanſing, purging,
and purifying of the heart; <hi>who is made both righteouſneſs
and ſanctification to us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. for elſe a man may be
reformed by vertue, not ſanctified, which is by grace or
faith.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That which though it denyes not grace to be of
God</hi> (no Pelagian would ever do that) <hi>yet affirms
the uſe of grace to be of man;</hi> it is in man to receive it,
or not receive it; to believe by it, or no; that is, that
God may give the power, but not the act: God gives
the power whereby I may believe in Chriſt if I will:
But he gives not the act of believing; And this is the
great queſtion which methinks is thus determined in the
Scripture; <hi>God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>works both to will and to
do;</hi> and <hi>every man that hath learned of the Father comes
to me,</hi> Joh. 6. 45. for though your reaſon tells you,
that in many caſes a man hath power to do that he doth
not, as to ſee when he ſhuts his eyes, you muſt make
a difference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when God works faith, he frames the
heart to uſe his grace and to believe, as when the hand
doth turn the wheel, the wheel always tnrns; for if it
did not turn, it takes away the ſubject of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
when there is a power put forth from God to
work upon my heart, to lead me to Chriſt, he doth
not therein only give a power that I ſhall uſe it as I liſt;
thats clean contrary: for if he turn me, I am turned;
and if I am not turned, he doth not turn me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:53665:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fourthly, that which teaches <hi>That Good works ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, may be performed without a new nature:</hi>
(and by this point) I thruſt every man to ſeek a new
nature, and a new being: and not only to do good
works; for that contradicts the point of our Saviour,
<hi>Make the tree good and his fruit good:</hi> There muſt firſt
be Regeneration, Renovation in the ſpirit of man,
whereby he muſt be implanted into Chriſt Jeſus, or
there will never grow good fruit thereon.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that it is true, <hi>God ſends Chriſt,</hi> (as the text
ſaith.) But there are ſo many attractives in him to draw
a ſinner, that there needs no drawing of God: there
needs no drawing of a loſt man to a Saviour, no more
then a poor man is drawn to a loaf of bread: But ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
loſt and undone, ſtand in need of drawing: And
therefore I ſhall ſhew, that as God gives Chriſt, ſo he
muſt give faith in Chriſt, or I cannot be ſaved: As
God gives Chriſt, and ſends him to me, ſo he muſt draw
me, and bring me to Chriſt, or elſe no ſaving effect will
follow. And that ſhall be the ſecond <hi>Uſe</hi> or <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>18</label>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label>
               <hi>THat as God ſends Chriſt to us, ſo he muſt draw us alſo to
him, or elſe there can be no ſalvation:</hi> and this may
be thus proved. Thoſe that come not to Chriſt, cannot
be ſaved by him; thoſe of the world that are not drawn
by this drawing of the Father, do not come to Chriſt:
therefore they are not ſaved: The ſervice that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
doth, is, this will beat down the thoughts of
many thouſands that reſt in this empty plea: God hath
<pb facs="tcp:53665:103"/>
ſent Chriſt to die, and to redeem mankind; it is well,
and the plea is good for encouragement to believe; but
if this be all the conſolation, if this be all you reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Gods acts in ſending Chriſt, you are much miſtaken;
for the great queſtion is, Hath God drawn thee to
Chriſt? Thou pleadeſt Chriſts miſſion: but Canſt thou
make Gods traction of thee to appear? This is the
great point that this doctrine preaches: as if Chriſt
ſhould ſay, It is true, My Father hath ſent me, and I
am come to you by his appointment, to ſhed my blood
for you; but you muſt come to me if you will have life;
and come to me you cannot, except you be drawn by
the power of him that ſent me; for no man can come
to me except the Father draw him.</p>
            <p>Whether of the two be moſt neceſſary to ſalvation;
Gods miſſion of Chriſt, or Gods traction of man to
Chriſt, is as I conceive, a trivial queſtion, hardly coming
into the Schools, which will tye a knot in any ruſh;
for they are both equally neceſſary: as the Serpent on
the pole in view to be lookt upon, and the eye to ſee it,
were both neceſſary for the recovery of them that were
bitten by fiery Serpents: except God ſend Chriſt, there
is no object of Faith: except God draw you to Chriſt,
there is no act of Faith: And the neceſſity of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and of the act, cannot without fondneſs be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
together; for both, are in their kind neceſſary in
the higheſt degree: the mercy and the grace of God
are eminent in both: the Father his ſending Chriſt, and
the Fathers drawing of ſinners unto Chriſt, they are
both neceſſary. But yet this ſending, and this drawing,
are of diſtinct conſideration in divers reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods ſending Chriſt, ſets up to ſinful man the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his faith.</hi> For though all the Scripture be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53665:103"/>
of that they call the Catholick faith; yet peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Chriſt in the Scripture is the kernel and marrow of
all the types in the Old Teſtament: Chriſt is the object
of Faith, whereby it juſtifies: For though the eye that
lookt to the brazen Serpent, could ſee many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides;
yet they could have no cure by the ſight of any
thing but that; this ſets up to man the object of his
Faith; Gods drawing, works in man the act of Faith:
If Chriſt had not been ſent, there had been no object
to be believed on: If God ſhould not draw ſinners to
him, there would be no faith to believe by: So that it
would be as with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if there were either no Serpent
on the pole to be lookt unto, or no eye to look up to it,
the recovery of thoſe bitten with the fiery Serpents
would fail.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods ſending of Chriſt was in purſuance of
his Covenant made with our Mediaeter: Gods drawing unto
Chriſt, is in purſuance of his Covenant made with ſinners in
the Mediator.</hi> That there is a Covenant of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Chriſt Jeſus, ſeems very probable: becauſe
there was a Covenant made with the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo with the ſecond: And this is intimated by
Chriſt himſelf, in theſe words, <hi>John 17. 4. I have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the work that thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> And in thoſe,
<hi>Heb. 10. 9. Lo I come to do thy will O God.</hi> For there is
that we call the Law, impoſed upon our Mediator, that
is the Covenant made with Chriſt. And <hi>Arminius</hi> in
his Orations <hi>De Sacerdotio Chriſti,</hi> confeſſes this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made with Chriſt, is very well expreſt in theſe
words, <hi>Iſa. 53. 10. When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for ſin;</hi> therefore his ſoul was to be an offering:
And the promiſe of the Covenant with Chriſt, that he
ſhould ſee his ſeed: this Covenant of God with the
<pb facs="tcp:53665:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mediator, what he ſhould perform as Mediator, is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
and brought to effect by God his ſending of his
Son: But the Covenant made with ſinners in a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
it is this, If you believe in, and come to this Lord
Jeſus whom he hath ſent, you ſhall be ſaved: And this
part of the Covenant is brought to effect and purſued;
by Gods drawing us to come to Chriſt: The want of
making diſtinction between the Covenant with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
what he ſhall do, <hi>he ſhall make his ſoul an offering
for ſin:</hi> And what he ſhall have, <hi>he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he
ſhall divide the ſpoil, take the captive out of the hands of the
Devil:</hi> and between the Covenant with the ſinner;
where there are the ſame two reſpects; what he ſhall
do, <hi>he ſhall come unto and believe in the Lord Jeſus;</hi> and
what he ſhall have, <hi>he ſhall be juſtified, ſaved, and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cut of the hands of hell and damnation:</hi> How ſhall man
be able to do this? ſaith God, I will draw him, for elſe
he cannot come; for, <hi>No man can come to me except my
Father draw him.</hi> I ſay, the not diſtinguiſhing of theſe
two, breeds great confuſion in the apprehenſions of men
about the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods ſending Chriſt, puts a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
mankind and the Angels that ſinned: But Gods
drawing of man unto Chriſt, puts a difference between the
elect and others.</hi> The ſpeculation of which point, is of
delightful and pleaſant conſideration. By ſending Chriſt,
he puts a difference between mankind, faln and lapſed,
and the Angels that fell; there was no cord let down
from heaven to them, to draw them out of the pit into
which they were faln. By drawing unto Chriſt, he puts
a difference between thoſe that God will ſave, and thoſe
that he will not ſave; <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal
life, believed, Acts</hi> 13. 48. To the Angels that ſinned,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53665:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt is not ſent; there you ſee the love of God to
mankind: And they that are not <hi>ordained to eternal
life,</hi> are not drawn; that makes a diſtinction of
men.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>God in ſending Chriſt doth not look at mans
faith as antecedent, or required of man before God ſends
him: But Gods drawing man to Chriſt, works that faith
whereby man is ſaved.</hi> Gods ſending Chriſt, doth not
look to faith at all, becauſe Chriſt is ſent to man yet
reſting in his unbelief; but that faith that is required to
ſalvation, is wrought by Gods drawing, whereby he
moulds the heart of man to Chriſt; as by a familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
may be inſtanced: The eye looking up, was not
required to the ſetting up of the Serpent upon the pole:
by Gods command it was ſet up, whether any man was
ſtung or no; but looking up was required to the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the perſon ſtung.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>If God ſhould have ſent Chriſt, and required it
of mans power, or left it to mans power, to come in and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, there would not have been a man, as I conceive,
ſaved.</hi> And his ſending, which is Gods act, would have
faln ſhort of its effect, without Gods drawing; becauſe
there would not have been faith found to have received
and believed in him; for <hi>No man can,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo Chriſts
Kingdom had not been ſet up and built; there had no
members been planted into this head. But the gift of
Chriſt to and for men, being ſeconded by a power of
bringing men in to Chriſt, gives effect and ſucceſs; and
therefore you ſhall find in the Goſpel alwayes, Gods
giving of Chriſt to man, is ſeconded by the giving of
the Spirit; that as we are <hi>redeemed, reconciled, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Chriſts merit and blood;</hi> ſo we muſt alſo be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,
regenerate and ſanctified by Gods Spirit;</hi> the one
<pb facs="tcp:53665:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of theſe accompanies the other: And this power of the
Spirit doth ſo certainly go along with Chriſts merit, as
to the ſalvation of any man, that it is ſaid, Have one,
have both. <hi>For he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none
of his, Rom.</hi> 8. 9. Becauſe though Chriſt be ſent by
the miſſion of God, yet without this Spirit there is no
drawing, no traction of man to be partaker of Chriſt,
as we have ſome adumbration or ſhadow. In <hi>Iſrael</hi> they
are delivered from the deſtroying Angel by blood
ſprinkled on the door poſts:<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 23.</note> And from the Egyptian
ſlavery by a mighty hand; ſhewing theſe two works in
the delivery of man out of the ſlavery under which he
lay: there is the work of Redemption, by the blood of
Chriſt ſprinkled upon him: and he muſt march out, be
drawn out of ſin by an out-ſtretched arm and mighty
hand: theſe two muſt go together.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>There is a general encouragement: you may call
it Comfort, that ariſes to us from Gods ſending of Chriſt.</hi>
For where there is no hope, there is no motion; where
there is no encouragement to believe, there a man hath
little heart: From Gods ſending Chriſt to ſave you,
there is encouragement; but the preſent Comfort, the
ſpecial Conſolation of a mans ſalvation, ariſes from the
ſecond particular of the two, that God hath drawn
man to Chriſt Jeſus; there is, I ſay, an encouragement
that God hath ſent Chriſt; that is, there is a ſalvability;
men are made ſaveable from the curſe and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law, under which they are involved: But
the ſpecial comfort that they have to themſelves in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
muſt ariſe from this, that God hath drawn, and
by converting grace, made them to believe in Chriſt:
For this faith, this drawing of man to Chriſt, is both a
pledge of ſalvation for the future, and a token of his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53665:105"/>
election before-hand. And that which as it were doth
couple both the poles together, the election of God, and
the ſalvation of man; the one as a pledge becauſe future;
the other as a mark, or ſign, becauſe paſt; this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
point indeed. But certainly the point of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt to make atonement for all, or of univerſal
Redemption, (let it be ſuppoſed) doth neither ſpeak
ſalvation nor election to any one in particular more then
another; and therefore ſuch ſilly ſouls, whether they
be drawn by others, or through their own ignorance of
the point, are miſtaken and deceived, that do build the
comfort of their ſalvation upon that, that God hath ſent
Chriſt for an encouragement to believe, &amp; therefore they
ſhall be ſaved; they do but build Caſtles in the air, that
is, without ground; for the Scripture tells you, that you
muſt <hi>be in the faith,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt muſt be in you, except you
be reprobates, 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 5. It is this drawing you to
come to Chriſt that ſtrikes the ſtroak; this teaching of
God which teaches you to believe, that gives you the
particular aſſurance of ſalvation. And therefore though
God have ſent Chriſt, yet there are thouſands of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and rejected perſons in the world. It is Chriſt in
you, and you in him by Faith, that ſtrikes the
ſtroak.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>The point of Gods ſending Chriſt affords
ſweet meditation; but the ſenſe of Gods drawing thy ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, affords ſweet conſolation.</hi> In the one thou mayſt
ſee the love of God to the world; for <hi>God ſo loved the
world, John</hi> 3. 16. By the other thou mayſt ſee his ſpecial
love to thee; concerning which you find it written by
the Apoſtle, Gal. 2. 20. <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf
for me:</hi> No man can ſay this word <hi>me,</hi> until he be drawn
unto Chriſt: And when is that? may ſome ſay; that
<pb facs="tcp:53665:106"/>
is not my point now to handle, yet in brief I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>When thou art come, then thou haſt been drawn:</hi>
If thou canſt embrace and receive Chriſt as a Saviour
and a Lord, then thou haſt been drawn, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. And
therefore as I may ſay of the ſhadow on the Dyal that is
gone to another line, though you cannot ſee the motion,
yet you may conclude it is moved, becauſe it is gone to
another line: So you may certainly conclude, that you
are gone from the ſtate of nature to the ſtate of grace,
when there is a reception and embracing of Chriſt
Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>When thy enmity and oppoſition is removed,
and thoſe things that obſtructed thy faith are taken away:</hi>
(Gods drawing doth that) If there be an inclination
to Chriſt as the chief Good, come in place of the
averſation that was there before; if there be a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
come in ſtead of the hardneſs and antipathy that
was there before: It is made one of the firſt ſigns of
grace, <hi>I will pour out upon them the Spirit of grace and
ſupplication, and they ſhall look on him whom they have
pierced, and mourn and be in bitterneſs, Zach.</hi> 12. 10.
(ſpoken of the Jews) This is a ſign that there is a great
change: as when light comes into a chamber, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the ſhutts of the window are removed; ſo
when you find a new light, a new diſpoſition of the
heart to God, you may conclude the obſtructions are
removed, and the enmity is taken away. So much
for the ſecond Corollary drawn from this point.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> Thirdly, <hi>If no man can come to Chriſt except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draw him;</hi> Hence we may learn, how much faith and
coming to Chriſt, being both one, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. are miſtaken
in the world: the great hinge on which the ſalvation
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53665:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of man turns: It is undertaken and entertained as men
think, with great eaſineſs, and at pleaſure performed,
without any ſenſe or ſenſible need of Gods drawing,
without which Chriſt teaches us that no man can come
to him. I ſhall make it appear that this coming to
Chriſt is, I will not ſay hard and difficult, for that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
ſome poſſibility of mans performance: but that
it is altogether unperformable without the aſſiſtance of
divine power. That ſaying, A man may believe in
Chriſt if he will (to take in that by the way) is true
and good, if it be taken in a right ſenſe: for ſo the
Scripture, <hi>Rev. 22. 17. Whoſoever will, let him take the
water of life freely.</hi> But then I muſt ſay, and I think
Reaſon will go with me, that every wiſh is not a will,
and every velleity (as they call it) is not a will ſet on
edge, an earneſt thirſty will after Chriſt Jeſus: He
that hath a will wrought by God (and the truth is, we
differ from other men only in this:) all confeſs him
to be free in believing: But man is not made by himſelf
free: but the grace of God frees the will of man: <hi>for if
the Son make you free, then are you free indeed:</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 8. 36.</note> And no
man doth any thing in the world with greater freedom
then a willingneſs to believe: when of nilling, he is
made by God, willing, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, ſuch a ſoul being
freed from its ſervitude, to thirſt after the righteouſneſs
of God, is pronounced bleſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6. We may
ſafely ſay, he hath the ſeed of faith that hath this will in
him: But every <hi>Balaams</hi> wiſh, to <hi>die the death of the
righteous:</hi> and every one that ſaith, <hi>I will,</hi> but doth not,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 30. this is not reckoned in Scripture to be a
will; therefore men are as much miſtaken in their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as in their believing. The Reaſons of the opinion
of this eaſineſs of believing are three.</p>
            <p>

Firſt, <hi>The miſtaking of</hi> Leah <hi>for</hi> Rachel. My meaning
is, the taking of a Dogmatical for a ſaving Faith: which
is the common miſtake of the world that live under the
Goſpel: For this is but light oar that lies near day, as
the Mettaliſts ſay; though it looks like gold, it is not
gold: It looks like the Faith that ſaves, but it is not it:
<hi>For this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Fet. 3. 5.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, <hi>they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
know not:</hi> This is not the Faith that is hard and
difficult: You muſt not look to be ſaved by a Chriſt
without you, but by a Chriſt within you: For to be in
the Faith, and to have Chriſt in you, is all one. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 5. As there are that may be called Diſciples out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. and there are others
that Chriſt calls <hi>Diſciples indeed,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, really, <hi>John</hi>
8. 31. So there is a Faith that brings forth a profeſſion
of Chriſt, as the blade in the ſtony ground. And there
is a Faith that brings a man into poſſeſſion of Chriſt;
and that is the Faith. Now it is a fatal miſtake of many
men, to reckon themſelves in Chriſt and a ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
by a Faith that makes them only Diſciples out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.
For even the greateſt part of the called are not
choſen: That Faith muſt needs be unſaving, that is
conſiſtent with predominant luſts, that encounters not
raigning ſins: For all reſiſtance of ſin, in a Scripture-phraſe,
is called <hi>conqueſt:</hi> For in the reſiſtance of it,
there is as much love ſeen to God, as in the <hi>conqueſt</hi> of it;
though there be not ſo much power ſeen. That which
is the beſt kind of Faith, and ſaving, is that which is
moſt hard, difficult, and impoſſible to man: The very
Faith of Miracles, that you read of ſometimes in the
Scripture, is not ſo hard as ſaving Faith, to come unto
and believe in Chriſt: Certainly this is to be known;
thoſe that came ſhort of ſaving Faith, have yet attained
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53665:107"/>
to the Faith of Miracles, as <hi>Judas</hi> and others: And
therefore let us ſet theſe two, the Faith which ſaves, and
that which ſaves not, in front one againſt the other:
and ſee what the Scripture ſaith of both: And you ſhall
find the drawing power of God affixt to the ſaving
faith, but not to the other: In <hi>John 2. 23. many believed</hi>
on Chriſt, <hi>when they ſaw the miracles that he did:</hi> But
they were falſe-hearted men, that would not hold out if
they came to wetting, And ſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 21. and
<hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. they that received the word, and with joy
too, they are ſuch as believe but for a while: but having
no root, they go away: As the houſe built on the ſand,
may ſtand till the wind blows: And in <hi>John 12. 42. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
believed on him,</hi> but yet <hi>they loved the praiſe of men
more then the praiſe of God:</hi> worldly things are preferred
before ſpiritual: And in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 13, 24. compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
<hi>Simon alſo believed,</hi> but that did not pluck him
out of the gall of bittterneſs, nor unfetter him from the
bond of iniquity: That faith that lets a man lie in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
eſtate, that is the faith of <hi>Simon Magus:</hi>
It is called Believing, and you may ſo call your ſelves
Believers, and yet be without ſaving Faith. For every
place in which it is named, ſets a blemiſh upon it: Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſuch a believing is joyned with predominant
luſt: But now the Faith that ſaves, that is other wayes
in Scripture deſcribed, and ſet forth with other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.
It is called a believing to the ſaving of the
ſoul; and ſo oppoſite to that which withdraws, that
is Faith for a time: Mark the diſtinction and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
of the words in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: <hi>ult.</hi> It is a receiving of
Chriſt Jeſus as Saviour and Lord, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
accompanied with true regeneration. In <hi>John</hi> 1.
12, 13. <hi>Whoſoever believes in Chriſt to the ſaving of his
<pb facs="tcp:53665:108"/>
ſoul, is born of God.</hi> 1 John 5. 1. <hi>Whoever believeth that
Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God.</hi> Whoever believeth that
he is ſo, and ſo takes him. And is called in Scripture by
theſe properties and epithites, a <hi>heart-purifying faith,</hi>
Acts 15. 9. <hi>a faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 5. <hi>the Faith of
Gods elect,</hi> 1 Tit. 1. <hi>a precious faith,</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 1. an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
or operative faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all this ſhews that though
the Scripture call this and that both by the ſame name,
Believing, yet they differ as much as ſaving and not
ſaving Faith. This is the firſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> concerning that
opinion of the eaſineſs of believing. They that will be

<hi>he hath ſet to his ſeal that God is true, (i. e.</hi>) he that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth:</hi>

Word of God; but now the common Faith of moſt
that live in the Church, in the ayre of the Goſpel,
if it be followed to the laſt reſolve or reſort of it,
is not into conviction by the word or ſpirit, but the
cuſtom and example <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

this kind of believing with our milk, which makes
it eaſie to us, as the Fathers authority to the Child
in minority is the greateſt in the world; But to think
that without a better Reaſon of our Faith, we can be

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> The third reaſon of the eaſineſs of this kind of unſaying
Faith; is, <hi>freedom from temptations:</hi> For many men
are carryed on the wings of this Faith all their lives
long, freed from temptations, doubts, fears, diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
have no thoughts perplex them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end of their lives: for they are temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
within that are the cauſe of the difficulty of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
when the wind lay, <hi>Peter</hi> doubted not: the Lord
called, and <hi>Peter</hi> went to him upon the water: But when
the wind roſe and was boiſterous, then ſaith the text, he
was <hi>afraid</hi> and <hi>doubted,</hi> Math. 14. 29. then, <hi>Lord ſave

wherefore doſt thou doubt?</hi> when the wind was ſtrong,
<pb facs="tcp:53665:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faith became weak: when a man rides on in ſecurity
and peace, no guilt within, no fears, doubts, or ſoul-troubles
encountering him, its an eaſie thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
But when tribulation ſeizes upon the ſpirit, and

the heart, Lord, that I had but one drop of Faith, that
I were but able to come and be fixed upon the center
of believing: this is the common and greateſt Reaſon
of eaſie believing: the empty traveller ſings before the

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Satan rather keeps the peace of ſuch a ſoul then

whiles Iſrael followed a quiet drudgery: and
therefore the devil rather rocks the cradle, then he will
diſquiet his ſleeping Child. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>While a man is not ſenſible what it is to

Phil.</hi> 3. 7. and if you ſhould preſently die, you have
ſomething to truſt unto: and while theſe remain with
you, it is not a hard thing for you to believe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man truſts to his fleſhly confidence, till he come
to know Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; But when the ſoul is
unhorſt of her falſe confidence, and true faith hath
diſmantled all mans ſtrong holds,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> that there is nothing
to relieve it, but faith in Chriſt: when a man is left
naked as <hi>Adam</hi> was of himſelf and his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and a man hath nothing to truſt unto but the
word of God whom he hath offended, and yet now he
muſt truſt to it, and venture his ſoul upon it; when
troubles and fearful queſtions do ariſe, then you will
find no ſea, no <hi>Euripus</hi> is more unconſtant then the heart
of man, nothing more hard to fix; this will make him
cry out with <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> Oh that I had but one dram
of Faith! O that my Faith were fixt, and my heart by
Faith: theſe are the Reaſons of that opinion, <hi>the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of believing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I muſt ſhew the contrary to this opinion, about
the <hi>eaſineſs of Faith,</hi> and to that end I ſhall ſay thus
much, that it is not properly ſaid to be hard for a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man to come to Chriſt, for that may denote a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
but that man cannot come without Gods drawing,
which I ſhall endeavour to prove.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the Scripture makes it the work of God,
and the gift of God:</hi> the work of God, for he draws:
the gift of God, for it is given to believe: And in ſome
places gives that as the reaſon why men cannot believe
<pb facs="tcp:53665:110"/>
of themſelves, as in the text, <hi>No man can except God draw:</hi>
which is given as the reaſon of the unbelief of theſe
murmurers againſt Chriſts doctrine; and <hi>ver.</hi> 64. 65. its
ſaid <hi>Chriſt knew from the beginning who ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
For no man can come to me except it were given
him of my Father:</hi> And our Saviour as appears by this,
thought it a good proof that they that were not drawn
by Gods work, nor had faith given them of his Father,
could not believe in him, or come to him. That faith is
the gift of God, it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>Phil. 1. 29. to you
it is given to believe ſincerely:</hi> And Matth. 13. 11. <hi>to
you it is given to know the myſteries.</hi> And Epheſ.
2. 8. <hi>you are ſaved by grace, through Faith, and
this not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi>
And</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That you may ſee that aſsigning of our
Faith to Gods work, and Gods gift, doth deny man to be
the ſocial, as well as ſole cauſe of his faith, and that
God only teaches the heart to believe:</hi> you may obſerve
that it is ſpoken <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by way of oppoſition unto,
and not of Compoſition or Concurrence of man with
God, in way of Co-ordination: where the Scripture
ſpeaks of God, it ſpeaks of God as the ſole cauſe;
Mark the antithetical places, where it is not only ſaid
that God works it, but God works it, and not man;
<hi>Fleſh and blood hath not revealed this to thee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt
to <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 16. 17. <hi>but my Father; our ſufficiency
is not of our ſelves to the leaſt thought, but of God,</hi>
2 Cor. 3. 5. there is an antitheſis excluding our ſelves;
<hi>Not of our ſelves, but it is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8.
As therefore they ſay in Philoſophy, God is <hi>Cauſa to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
entis,</hi> which doth deny all concauſality; <hi>he made
us, not we our ſelves,</hi> in the hundred Pſalm; ſo it may
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53665:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ſaid that we are his creatures in grace as well
as in nature. We make not a haire of our ſelves,
no not the colour, and ſhall we not lay it to heart?
In nature did I make my ſelf? why ſhall not I give
as much to God in regeneration as generation,
ſeeing God is ſeen in the one as well as in the
other?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith in Chriſt is a diſtinguiſhing grace,
a work that differences thoſe that are ſheep, from them
that are not; thoſe that are given, from them that
are not given to Chriſt:</hi> this is proved, Matth.
13. 11. <hi>to you it is given, to them it is not given;
to the babes it is revealed, but hidden from the wiſe,</hi>
Matth. 11. 25. This coming unto Chriſt, to ſpeak
plainly, is a fruit and effect of election: all that
are choſen to Eternal Life, ſhall come in unto and
believe in Chriſt, <hi>they ſhall all know me,</hi> Heb. 8. 11.
both the leaſt and the greateſt, every man that is
<hi>taught of God</hi> doth believe, Joh. 6. 45. If any man
living can know himſelf to be Elected of God,
how muſt he know it? we muſt know our election
(if at all) <hi>aſcendendo,</hi> not <hi>deſcendendo,</hi> not prying
into the abyſſe, but beginning at the loweſt round
of the ladder, my regeneration and Faith in Chriſt:
and from thence, aſcend: As many as were ordained
to eternal life, believed, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. (a place as it
pinches hard, ſo men have ſet their wits on the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to make ſomething of it, or rather nothing)
not as were qualified and diſpoſed, as ſay ſome: but
appointed or ordained: Its vain to waſh away the
ſence of the word: We know it is called The faith of
Gods elect, and that it is ſaid, <hi>the election hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi>
Rom. 11. 4. our Saviour ſaith, John. 10. 26.
<pb facs="tcp:53665:111"/>
               <hi>you ſee the works that I do; miracles that one would think
might work faith:</hi> but there is a ſecret reaſon why
you believe not, <hi>Becauſe you are not of my ſheep,</hi> for
all they, do believe in me: and this is my conſtant
doctrine, for this I have ſaid unto you: It is ſaid of
the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> by him that wrote the hiſtory
of that Councel, that when thoſe that were for the
will and power of man, diſputed with the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by reaſon, they ſeemed to carry all before them, to
get the victory; but when the other party that was for
the Grace of God againſt the will of man, came to
back their arguments by Scripture, not by reaſon, then
they went as far backward as forward. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
that it is not likely that all that in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
were ordained to life eternal did believe
at that time: It is but a quibble, which we can
ſpeak no further unto, then the text doth: It is
enough that the reaſon of believing is drawn from
their ordination to life, as <hi>John 6. 37. all that the
Father giveth me, ſhall come to me:</hi> and if all that
God giveth to Chriſt, ſhall come to Chriſt, we
conclude that it is proper to thoſe that are the elect of
God: to thoſe God gives it, in thoſe God works
it.</p>

in the holy Scripture: famouſly in Iſa. 53. 11. <hi>by his

by the Faith of him; and whence this light of faith
doth come, you may very well perceive by that, <hi>Fleſh
and blood hath not revealed it:</hi> It is not a light of
natural reaſon or acquiſition, but is a light created by
God, and conveyed by the ſpirit of God only,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 17. For that which is called a ſpiritual
diſcerning, and that muſt either be Faith, or the light
wherein faith is planted, that is affirmed, <hi>not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the power of a natural man,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. where he
gives the reaſon why a natural man doth not perceive
the things of God, <hi>becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
and therefore I conclude that a natural man hath not
<pb facs="tcp:53665:112"/>
the ſpiritual diſcerning of heavenly things: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not this ſpiritual diſcerning, it remains that it

of Reaſon, learning and pregnancy of wit in man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
is but darkneſs to this ſpiritual light, which is
given to babes and fools, as the moon light is but night
and darkneſs unto that light which makes day: and if
this be that light whereby Chriſt is only ſavingly
known in the excellency of his knowledge,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> it muſt
needs follow, that faith being ſeated in it, muſt be a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>4</label> Fourthly, <hi>There appears by comparing things together,
that there is ſome admirable ſecret in this work of believing
in and coming to Chriſt;</hi> for if you obſerve, there is all
the reaſon in the world, why a man ſhould believe, there
being all arguments and motives of faith in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
there are all manner of invitements and provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the word of God: and there being ſome that do
believe by ſuch a faith, as is under the rate of ſaving faith,
what may be the reaſon that our Saviour yet ſaith, <hi>No
man can come to me without a divine traction;</hi> if I ſhould
handle theſe largely, perhaps I ſhould not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
but I will be brief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:53665:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt, there is all reaſon that man ſhould come in to
Chriſt Jeſus; for unleſs he do ſo, and that ſincerely,
the wrath of God abides on him: It comes upon us
for any ſin, but abides upon us for unbelief; not that
unbelief is the only ſin that damns, as ſome do teach
in theſe days. If a man be indicted of Felony and
found guilty, he is condemned for that; but the reaſon
why he is ſent to execution is, becauſe that having the
Book he cannot read; ſo is unbelief the great Reaſon
that all other ſins are bound upon your backs; none of
them are pardoned: Even as a woman in debt aſſoon
as ſhe takes a husband is no longer to be accounted in
debt, becauſe all her debts involve him to whom ſhe
hath given her ſelf; So that very hour, aſſoon as ever
you believe, you have your ſins pardoned; as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi>
ſtung with a fiery Serpent, aſſoon as ever he
lookt up to the Serpent on the pole, he recovered, or as
the Text ſaith, <hi>he lived;</hi> ſo he that believes, is healed of
all diſeaſes, reſtored into a ſtate of favour, made a Son
and Heir of God for preſent title, and all his mortal
ſins become venial, yea not pardonable but pardoned:
Therefore there is all reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there are all Motives and Arguments for
faith in Chriſt himſelf: There is many a man would be
glad of the benefits of Chriſt that doth not receive
Union with Chriſt himſelf; but marriage you know is
not between a man and the dowry, but between perſon
and perſon: Men obſtruct their own Faith by looking
to take riſe for it in themſelves, but there is all in
Chriſt, he is the ſinners Saviour, not ſinful Angels,
but ſinful mans; therefore no argument lies in ſin to
diſcourage thee, becauſe thy ſin makes thee a due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as the biting of the fiery Serpent made a fit Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the Serpent on the Pole; and as he is the ſinners
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53665:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Saviour, ſo he is the ſent and ſealed of God, commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
and authorized by him unto this ſaving work: ſo
that God cannot retract his act, the promiſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to any that believes in him; as he is the ſent of God
we need not doubt him whoſe anger it was that terrified
us, ſo he is freely offered and given to the ſinner as a
plaiſter wide enough for every ſore; being able to ſave
to the uttermoſt, all that come to God by him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Motives are in him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God invites us by all manner of invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and provocations to receive Chriſt: And I have
ſhewed and proved to you, that he doth call you ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and not tantalize us with the promiſe of faith;
for then he could not ſay, <hi>How often would I, but you
would not?</hi> The Call whereby God invites men to faith
and repentance is ſerious.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there are many that do believe, and that
with joy, by a faith that is under the rate of ſaving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is by a faith of Conviction, not of Acceptance:
As a woman that can ſay nothing againſt a man, yet
gives not conſent of marriage; ſo they are convinc'd of
the excellency and neceſſity of Chriſt, and yet do not
receive and accept him for good and all, with ſelf-out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſelf-renouncing: And all this being ſo as it is,
well might <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay of this grace, which <hi>Pelagius</hi> was
content withal, that is, the doctrine, exhortation, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
by way of object propounded and counſel mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
<hi>Nolumus istam gratiam,</hi> we are not content to
reſt in that grace, but will have ſuch as takes away the
ſtony and gives a heart of fleſh; as it was with <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
he did not riſe out of the Grave, becauſe he was bid to
riſe, but with the word there went a powerful work,
and ſo he came forth. Notwithſtanding all this that
I have ſaid as touching the object of faith propoſed, the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53665:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
motives and means of Faith uſed, which I confeſs are
enough to lay the blame of non-believing at mans door,
yet this admirable ſecret of not believing upon all this,
ariſes from a higher reaſon or ſecret of God, as appears
by our Saviours Doctrine: And the Reaſons are two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Though all theſe be uſed as they are, for the
preparing, and inclining, and exciting man to believe,
That God may deal with man as a rational creature by
moral means; for God doth not draw man as a beam of
timber or a ſtone is drawn by force, but in a way of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
Reaſon, and Argument; yet that high
deſign of God in giving men to Chriſt, or not giving
them to him, is aſſigned by our Saviour as a Reaſon of
mens coming, or not coming to him, <hi>Joh. 6 44, 65. No
man can come to me except it were given him of my Father;</hi>
and <hi>verſ. 37. All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to
me.</hi> The giving of Faith to man, and of man to
Chriſt, are both Gods work: And in <hi>John 10. 26. But
ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my Sheep;</hi> that is, <hi>not
given to me by the Father.</hi> And ſurely 'tis for this ſecret
reaſon that many in the world, and in our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that have all the formerly named Means and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to Faith, do yet ſtand it out obſtinately; and thoſe
that have appeared the moſt unlikely of all others to be
believers in Chriſt, have, after their long withſtanding,
come in at length.</p>
            <p>Seconldy, The reaſon why all theſe do not work
Faith, is becauſe they work but morally and objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and do not (haply) ingenerate life, by which they
may be prevalent. We do not wonder why a Trumpet
doth not waken, and why Muſick doth not delight a dead
man, becauſe neither the one nor the other doth beget
life, but ſuppoſes life to be. Faith, if it be lively and
ſaving, comes from a root of Life, from the Spirit of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53665:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Regeneration and renewing Grace; and therefore where
ſuch Grace is not by the Spirit implanted in the heart,
all Means and Motives of Faith are but like the frictions
and rubbings of a dead man, which are profitable to
awaken the ſpirits if there be life, but not to recall or
produce it; and this is that which Chriſt ſpeaks in the
Text, <hi>No man can come to me,</hi> becauſe he is of himſelf
dead, and void of power by Nature, until God put a
Spirit of life into him; and when he is alive, theſe
Mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Motives may be profitable; or as is uſually
ſaid by S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſpeaking of the Doctrine of <hi>Pelagius;
Hold a green branch or bunch of graſs before a Sheep, and;
if he be alive, he may follow your hand; but it gives not
life to him, if dead.</hi> All that can be ſaid is, That there
muſt be firſt a Plantation of a vital Principle, a ſeed of
ſpiritual life, before there can be any Faith put forth to
theſe Promiſes and Motives of Faith; and therefore
this beſpeaks you all to uſe the means for life; for God
by theſe means works it: But yet the means are left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute,
unleſs joyntly with the Word of Faith there go
the Work of Faith, as with, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> there
went a Power to raiſe him from the dead; and then man
believes. And this is the fourth Conſectary from this
point.</p>

a point ſerving to pull down man, that we may not
make man the worker, the doer, the mover of his own
ſalvation; that we may build mans will upon God, and
not go about to build Gods Will upon man, as if God
did wait to ſee how man would diſpoſe of himſelf. I

            <p>And the Reaſon is clear that no man in the world can,
becauſe there would be no active Converſion, were

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53665:119"/>
firſt a paſſive Converſion whereby God turns man to
God; no Converſion could be the act of man, if not
firſt Converſion be the act of God: To ſpeak plainly,
there can be no coming to Chriſt except there be firſt a
drawing of God: <hi>For no man can come to me except my
Father draw him.</hi> They are both of them delivered in
<hi>Jer. 31. 18. 19. Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I was turned I repented;</hi> there is the act of <hi>Ephraim;</hi>
after I had received the paſſive Converſion, that God
had drawn and turned me: There is no reſurrection

the Sun ſhines upon the wall before the wall can
re-ſhine any beams of the Sun from it: ſo there muſt
be the work of God upon the heart, the grace of God
muſt ſhine there before the heart can return, take hold,
and carry the ſoul to Jeſus Chriſt: And there are two
Premiſes, two Propoſitions that do carry on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion

be ſaved, if left to his own diſpoſal or ſufficiency.</p>

Chriſt is made voyd by them, Chriſt is of no effect

            <p>Firſt, That we carefully maintain the neceſſity and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie,

of it in the converſion of man:<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Practic. Uſe. </seg>
               </label> This is one practical
and excellent Uſe; that you carefully maintain theſe as
Advocates of the grace of God; the grace of God muſt
be maintained and defended in theſe properties of it:
there hath rarely been found in the whole world in this
point any man, no not <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelf, that hath uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
excluded or exploded the concurrence of the
grace of God in the Courſe of ſalvation, but have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it either for the inchoation or beginning of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or in the augmentation and increaſe of Grace, or
elſe in the conſummation and finiſhing of it: either for
the ſole work or the ſocial work of it, in and with man;
even very ſhame, and the evidence of the point together,
forbids man to exclude that to which he is obliged: not
only for a more eaſie converſion, but for converſion it
ſelf; for many have allowed it a place in making conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
more eaſie, for a man to return and believe: But we
ſpeak of the neceſſitie of it, that converſion cannot be at
all without it: as therefore I may give it you by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon;
they that do allow the work of a Mid-wife in
the helping of a child into the world, do not by that,
make her the Parent of the child: So, they that allow the
grace of God to be requiſite to help man to converſion,
the knowledge of God and Faith, do not thereby affirm
the grace of God to be the Parent, the Worker, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
and begetter of this Grace; and therefore they
ſay too little that make grace only an aſſiſtant. And
therefore as the Prophet in <hi>Zachary</hi> 4. ſpeaking of the
ſecond Temple after <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was burnt down
by the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſhould cry, <hi>Grace, Grace to
it;</hi> not by might nor by power, but that the Grace of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53665:121"/>
God ſhould be ſeen in the building of the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
So I may ſay of the building of this ſecond Inner
Temple in man after the death of the firſt, (I mean
Gods Image in Man) that it is a work all of Grace; and
therefore to ſet it in common place, ſhews leſs ſence of
Gods honour by it, and of our obligation to it then it
requires. Thoſe that grant that man more eaſily comes
to Heaven by grace adjuvant, do ſay truth, as Chriſt
helping up <hi>Lazarus;</hi> (but raiſing him from the dead,
was more then ſo, for he gave him life whereby he riſe)
ſo to grace, that it helps up man, is to ſay Truth; But
if you will be good Advocates, and plead the cauſe of
Gods grace aright, (which men were famous for in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times when it was diſparaged;) you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
preventing and preoccupating grace, which wholly
raiſeth the dead man, in that ſence in which <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls
it preventing, that comes before our Act, that praeoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
a man, not barely helping the man to riſe alone,
but raiſing the man dead, and begetting a new life in him.
Thoſe who are only for adjuvant grace, eclipſe the
glory of divine grace, ſo as if they ſhould ſay, Chriſt
helped up <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who elſe could not ſo eaſily have
riſen up, but it would have coſt more ado to have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it. Theſe are ſuch as make the grace of Converſion
to be as one horſe in a Teem, that helps indeed to pull
out the ſtalled Cart the more eaſily, but doth not come
ſo home, as that of Chriſt, John 15 4. <hi>Severed from me ye
can do nothing:</hi> But let us account it to be the onely
ſtrength whereby we are pull'd out of the pit of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and perdition; the Conteſt of Nature with Grace
for place and power to make abatement of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ſoveraignty, freedome and power of Grace in mans
Converſion, hath been in all times very great: and ſome
have given a greater ſhare to mans power therein, then
others that have given too much: Therefore there have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53665:121"/>
been <hi>Pelagdians</hi> (they went to the full) and ſemi-<hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians:</hi>
And (for ought I know) there may be quarter-<hi>Pelagians,</hi>
that deny ſome part of the Grace of God:
But it is to be obſerved, that God by his Word hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
determined the point for his own grace. In his
great Oracle, which I account the caſe of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
to be; when their Mother went to inquire, the Lord
anſwer'd, I love the younger and hate the Elder, and
that before they had done good or evil; It is my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſo to do, for I will have mercy on whom I will.
Now if you will go about to ask me how Reaſon um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
this point in the Conteſt between Nature and
Grace, we know that Nature vanquiſh'd by the Word,
hath ſtood upon ſome proud and captious reaſons, which
do rather ſhew that it is determined againſt her; For the
partie that mutinies and rebells doth confeſs it, go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: the mutiny of Reaſon is the great reaſon
that it goes againſt Reaſon in this point, as in that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<hi>Rom. 9. 19. Thou wilt ſay, Why doth he yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> Man muſt needs be
free and blameleſs, for God would have him ſo: Thus
Reaſon mutinies and complains, and comes with capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Arguments, but the Apoſtle reſtrains it. <hi>Nay, O
Man, who art thou that diſputeth, with God;</hi> which makes
it clear that God hath determin'd againſt that part which
holds up the waſters, and makes inſurrection. So then,
the Grace of God is alone, and that appears further,
that Nature at all times is willing to part ſtakes; and its
a ſign ſhe is the wrong Mother, becauſe willing to come
to diviſion, which Grace will not, it will have all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is it my deſign to cry down Nature further then it need
and ought; but this I ſpeak againſt, that thoſe men that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53665:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtickle for it, do not give ſomething only to Nature, but
plume it with the feathers of grace, and inrich it with
thoſe ſpoiles that I take ill, that me thinks is not right:
Let me give what I can, what I ought to Nature: Let
me adorn it but with its own, and if could be that Nature
might be adorn'd and grace loſe nothing, it was more to
be born: But where the Sea gains, the Shore loſes; ſo it
is in theſe two, as much as men ſet up Nature, they pull
down Grace. Therefore, you that will be Advocates
for free Grace, do you kiſs the hand of that Grace;
whereby as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>You are that as you are:</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Point </seg>1</label> Firſt, The reaſon of the difference which God makes
between any man that is ſaved, and one that is not, is not
Originally in Man himſelf; If you wave or quit this,
you loſe the point; for this threed will run through the
whole web. If we aſcend upwards, and accompt the
Heavenly Orbes, (S. <hi>Paul</hi> names the third Heavens) Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
name more; we muſt needs at length come to
ſome firſt mover, that we call the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> that
moves the reſt under it; and it ſelf is not moved by any
Orb above it: for no proceſs can be in <hi>infinitum.</hi> So we
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53665:122"/>
may in the courſe of ſalvation count from ſtep to ſtep,
for ſo doth the Scripture: But yet we muſt come to
ſome Original, to ſome firſt mover that moves all the
reſt, and is not it ſelf moved by any, whether we go
forward or backward: Whom he Elected, them he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
and whom he Called, he Juſtified; and whom he
Juſtified, them he Glorified; and ſo from ſtep to ſtep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but ſomewhere, we muſt begin; now go Retrogade in the
ſame line; Whom he Glorified; he Juſtified; and whom
he Juſtified, he Called; whom he Called, he Elected or
Predeſtinated. You muſt come at laſt to the firſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
whereof there cannot be given any higher cauſe or
reaſon; ſo then the reaſon of the difference is not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
in Man himſelf; ſomewhere we muſt begin, from
whence we cannot riſe higher. Now the free Grace of
of God is the firſt round in the Ladder of our Salvation,
not any thing in Man, or the will or work of Man. Here
are three things coucht under this head.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a difference made between every Man
that is ſaved, and every man that is not; for all that is
ſaving is difference making, whereby a man is taken out
of the heap and common lump of mankind. A veſſel of
honour is made indeed of the ſame lump, but differs
much from a veſſel of diſhonour; there belongs a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and a ſeparation to every man that is ſaved, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
not ſuch as they call local, from the wicked of
the world, but moral, whereby his ſpiritual Condition is
ſeparated from all the not ſaved: Though all grace that
is diſcriminant and differencing is not ſaying, that I
grant; yet all that is ſaving is diſcriminant: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you that will prove your ſelves to be in ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
are bound to prove the difference that is between
you and others that are not ſaved, nor can be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is the maker of this ſaving difference
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53665:123"/>
between the ſaved and others: In every ſtep of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
there is ſome difference made; in Election, there
are Elect and others, <hi>Reus.</hi> 11. 7. In calling, there is an
actual difference between the called and others, &amp;c. That
God is the maker is implied in the 1 Cor. 14. 7. <hi>Who
makes thee to differ from another?</hi> ſome body made thee
to differ; and therefore he that calls himſelf, converts
himſelf, is like him that begets himſelf, or raiſes himſelf
from the dead: Its a me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> imaginary thing, and if theſe
two be true, then,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It will follow that the reaſon of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
made by God is not originally in man himſelf; the
reaſon of comparative praeterition is not ſin, for then all
might be rejected, becauſe all men are under ſin. The
reaſon of Comparative election is not good works, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or worthineſs of man; for by that reaſon he ſhould
alwayes take the beſt of men and leave the worſt; but we
find the contrary, that God hath taken the worſt; Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans
and harlots go into Heaven before you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a famous place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. That the purpoſe
of God might ſtand; it is not made good by the works of
man himſelf; not of works, but of him that calleth is the
purpoſe of God according to election made good. They
conſult the Glory of Grace but ill, that pitch the
reaſon of Gods electing or calling, upon ſome Paritie or
Probitie, or fit temper of man himſelf; ſo our men liſp
now adayes towards a quarter-Pelagianiſme: (for I will
not ſay it is ſemi-Pelagianiſme) they ſay, God calls man
and indues him with ſaving Grace for that littleneſs or
probitie in man: But is this littleneſs or honeſty they
talk of of God or man, is it a work of nature or Grace? if
it be a work of Grace it is of God, and is no otherwiſe a
reaſon of Converſion then as one ſtep may be in order
to another, grace in order to grace: All this while there is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53665:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no offence: But if it be a moral temper, and of man
himſelf, then it is ſo much worſe, they make God to
build on man, and to take a moral humane Foundation
to a ſupernatural gracious Act, to build ſupernatural
grace upon the ground of common probity and honeſty;
this doth diſparage the Grace of God; for as God in
Creating of the world did not work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> matter
praeexistent, ſo we ſay it is, in the Act of Grace: 'tis
the Creation of a new Creature: which brings him out
of nothing, and not works him out of any praeexiſtent
matter. It is true I confeſs, that the beſt diſpoſition
that can be in man to come to the Lord Jeſus and believe
in him, is that which is called an Infant-like temper of
meekneſs and ſoftneſs, and tenderneſs; for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
gives that rule, <hi>Except a man be like a little Child, he
cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he doth not mean the Glory of everlaſting Life,
but the Church ſtate; he cannot be a true Member of
the Viſible Church, unleſs he be made tractable, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
meek and ſoft: But this is not a meer Moral or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
temper, as if Nature ſhould lead on Grace; but
'tis a ſubaction, a moulding the heart by Word and
Spirit to a willingneſs to be brought to nothing for
Chriſt; for there is ſomething in the work of mans
Converſion that's like a preparatory to the main
work.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Point </seg>21</label> Secondly, If we be true advocates of grace we will
diſclaim all worthineſs of man to be the firſt mover,
and all power of man as to be the firſt worker of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion:
God is both the firſt mover and the firſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the Converſion and bringing man unto Salvation.
A man would think that a man may rather merit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Eternal Life by the acting of grace, then he
can merit grace by the acting of nature; yet we ſay
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53665:124"/>
neither: The one of them the Papiſts hold, That there
may be merit of eternal life by a mans own acting of
Grace: But workes of Grace died in the blood of
Chriſt; for that's the beſt of their opinion: But that
a man-ſhould merit Grace, the firſt Grace by the works
of Nature, or by any good works done by Nature, that's
a thing beyond the underſtanding and imagination both
of us and them; for Heaven as the reward of gracious
works, we have a promiſe, if we walk with God in
holineſs; but for the firſt grace, as the reward of works
of Nature, we have no promiſe, that for performance
of what lies in us by the power of Nature, God ſhould
give us grace: therefore we are, and that juſtly, more
offended at the Doctrine of merit of Grace, then at the
Doctrine of merit of ſalvation; the reaſon is, becauſe
Grace is more unproportionable to works of Nature,
then Heaven is to works of Grace; and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven more proportionable to works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from grace, then Grace it ſelf is to thoſe works
that proceed from Nature; and therefore its too high
to conceive of merit of Grace, which is a merit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
and firſt things, and that's not uſual; but merit
is of the reward and end, and the Scripture inſiſts on that
word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35: <hi>Who hath firſt given to God?</hi> as if that
could not be to make man the firſt giver to God; for
that makes God a debtour of that which he cannot owe,
<hi>viz.</hi> Grace. For if it be Grace, it cannot be debt; for
its deſtroyed: and therefore though God may be a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
in regard of his promiſe, yet he cannot owe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
but it any thing, its reward to ſome precedent
work of Grace; and therefore, as it is uſual with us, that
the man ſollicites the woman, the woman thinks it unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to her ſex and modeſtie to wooe the man: So God

                  </gap>ou:</hi> Mark the Phraſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>The man was
not deceived but the woman.</hi> Was not the man deceived?
Yes; but not firſt: So it's expreſt: <hi>We love him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he loved us firſt, 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 19. And this God urges
as that which moſt endears him; that he is the firſt in
the work; he gives preventing, and not only ſubſequent
and following grace; he is the Author, not only the
finiſher; he both begins the good-work and finiſhes it;
and our will, doth not determine the will of God, (as
they ſay,) but his will muſt needs determine ours; the
reaſon is, becauſe the determining will is the maſter-will,
the determined is the waiting-maid: How incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
is it to ſence, that the will of man being made
willing, ſhould lead the will of God, and not rather
the will of God lead the will of man? How incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is it that working is ſet before Being? Every thing
muſt have an <hi>eſſe</hi> before <hi>operari;</hi> now its Regeneration
and Converſion that gives a Being, makes the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
For if a man ſhould work before he be, then it
would ſet even Philoſophy croſs to it ſelf: But man
doth not work, or make himſelf, nor give himſelf a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
being; for, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 10. We are his workmanſhip,
created in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. which is the Apoſtles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove, that ſalvation is not of our ſelves, no
more than Creation: As therefore the Tree muſt be
made good, before the fruit can be good, ſo the man
muſt be a new creature, and that he cannot make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be; and therefore Grace firſt workes, and this
preſerves its place, which is to begin and to create.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Point </seg>3</label> The third point which the Advocate of Grace main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
is, <hi>That God puts forth more or greater Grace in thoſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53665:125"/>
that are ſaved, than in thoſe who are not ſaved.</hi> This is
one of the greateſt points in the whole ſubject of Grace,
which if you underſtand and rightly, is that which ſtates the
Queſtion in difference in all this controverſie; namely,
that <hi>Peter,</hi> for example, is more engaged and bound to
God than <hi>Judas</hi> for the grace that is given him, and had
more beſtowed on him that <hi>Judas</hi> had; and if ſo, then
God puts forth more grace in them he ſaves, than in
them he doth not ſave. I diſpute not whether of them
that are ſaved, all are partakers of equal grace; thoſe
that had talents were not all equal: But I am ſpeaking
of the ſaved, and the not ſaved, and do ſay, That if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Grace be given to two, they will both be ſaved; if
equal Grace had been given to <hi>Judas</hi> as to <hi>Peter,</hi> then
<hi>Judas</hi> would have been ſaved as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> one as
well as the other: No, you will ſay, that follows not;
for there may be ſome one that hath leſs Grace afforded
him than another, and yet is ſaved by the leſs, when the
other is not ſaved by the greater; becauſe the one joyns
with and applies himſelf to the leſs Grace, when the
other reſiſts the greater; as a weak horſe that buckles
to it, will draw more than a reſtive lazy Jade, though
ſtronger, that hangs back; as in weighing of weights by
the ſcales, if there be a difference in the ſcale, and one
end be heavier, it ſhall weigh down a greater weight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it hath ſomewhat to help it, <hi>viz.</hi> the weight of the
ſcale it ſelf: But if this be granted, then man turns the
ſcale; for if one man may be ſaved with leſs Grace than
another, it is not Grace that makes the difference, but
it is the will of man, that by joyning of his forces with
the leſſer Grace, the weaker Grace makes the ſcales
praeponderate; and ſo it comes to that which we muſt of
neceſſity avoid, if we will defend the free Grace of God,
that that which makes the difference is in man, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53665:125"/>
what that he hath from himſelf that turns the Balance;
and therefore I conclude, (for I think it a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
that two men receiving equal Grace, will both be
ſaved; for if he that receives the leſſer Grace ſhall be
ſaved, and not he that receives the greater, that muſt be
becauſe the will of man ſtrikes in; then the will of man
hath ſomewhat to ſay and plead, I make my ſelf to
differ, I have reaſon to glory in my ſelf, becauſe having
leſs grace than another had, I determine my own will to
ſalvation.</p>

believe, but it muſt be maintained) <hi>it is far better, and
more for our comfort, that our ſalvation is carried on by
the free grace of God, and the Soveraignty thereof, than if
it had been committed to our own hand, and left to our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and power.</hi> The ſence of man doth rather incline
to think, it had been better for mankind that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
might have had ſome ſtroke in their own hands to
have brought themſelves unto ſalvation, and then it is
very likely that more men by far would have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
than will be ſaved now; and that there is more
Juſtice that men ſhould be condemned for not believing
when they may, and have power if they will; for he
that hath power to believe in Chriſt if he will, and doth
not, his condemnation ſeems more juſt: But that is a
great errour; for now that it is in Gods hand, it's more
likely and better for our ſalvation, becauſe now ſome
will certainly be ſaved; thoſe whom God hath choſen
and elected, and thoſe few on whom he determines to
ſhew his grace, they will be ſaved, their ſalvation will
be carried on infruſtrably and invincibly; but if it were
left to the liberty of man, as man is now, to diſpoſe
of himſelf, I ſay. Not one man in the world would
have been ſaved; for man being once a bankrupt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53665:126"/>
and having loſt that ſtock of Grace beſtowed
upon him at firſt, and having no power in his hand to
recover, all had certainly periſhed, or uncertainly been
ſaved, if left to themſelves; therefore the ſalvation of
Gods Elect is in a far ſurer hand, than if it had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in mans power; for they are infruſtrably brought
home, who, being left unto themſelves, neither would
nor could have been any more ſaved than thoſe that do
ſtand out againſt God; for if none ſo left do come in,
we may well conclude, that all in that caſe would have
ſtood out as well as theſe do. But here an Objection
may be made.</p>

<hi>Joh. 5. 40. Ye will not come to me,</hi> &amp;c. It's true, God hath
linked his Glory and mans chief good or ſalvation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and ſo there is a ſelf-love that's joyned with the
love of God; for the ſalvation of man being linked to
the Glory of God, it follows that there muſt be ſelf-love

ſelf-love: But obſerve, beſides this, there is a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

ſpeak of when we ſpeak of ſelf-love; that hath the
ſtronger bias of the two, and carries us from ſalvation
rather than to it; and this is the ſelf-love which prompts
us to that by which we are deceived all our life-time,

what hath the reality of happineſs and content: And
therefore that which is here alledged as a reaſon why we

ſhould all be ſaved by our own will, if ſo be there were a
power, becauſe there is ſelf-love in us, is rather the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why no man would be ſaved, there being two ſelf-loves,
&amp; every man naturally following the heavier bias
of the two, which wheels off to the body, &amp; to the world,
and to things ſpeciouſly good, and draws him off from
the concernments of his ſalvation; and this ſelf-love
rather is the cauſe of mans hate and diſlike of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he aſſigns and pronounces Judgment to ſin, which
ſelf-love loves, and tenders ſalvation in ſuch way as is

call ſpiritual ſelf-love, there goes much Grace to the

we ſhould have one of the greateſt fruits of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Grace: This is not naturally in man himſelf, nor

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Point </seg>5</label> Fifthly and laſtly, <hi>Let all Patrons and Advocates of
Grace maintain the prevalency of Grace by its own ſtrength,
and not becauſe of ſome acceſſaries that ſtrike in with it at
ſuch a time, as the tide that ſtrikes in with the wind.</hi> But
<hi>my Father draws,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. The Jeſuites that have a
hand in this controverſie, will tell you, That the power
of Gods Grace is prevalent, may fall out ſo or ſo in the
event, by reaſon of congruities and ſeaſons, fit moods
and tempers, and perſwaſions; <hi>Blanda: tempora fandi;</hi>
God ſpeaks to men in a ſeaſonable time: Few men (ſay
they) but may be wrought upon if they be taken by the
right eare; there are ſome times of ſpeaking to men
when they are in a good mood; but otherwiſe come to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53665:127"/>
ſpeak to them when they are off the hooks, in a moroſe
untractable condition, as <hi>Jonah</hi> was in when God ſaid
to him, <hi>Dost thou well to be angry? Yea,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I do well
to be angry to the death;</hi> then if you move them with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
they prevail not: A man ſo taken may reſiſt
the offers of ſalvation; but we hold that the Grace of
God is ſtrong, by its own ſtrength able to overcome
the moſt moroſe, obſtinate, croſs grain that can be, when
God intends it to be powerful: Maintain therefore the
prevalency of Grace, not doing as thoſe that will allow
Grace to be prevalent in event, but it is by reaſon of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
that hit at that time, as <hi>Auxilliaries</hi> that come
in and get victory; this is too little to ſay of Grace,
that it ſtands in need of ſuch helps; but it conquers the
moſt croſs grained and unwilling heart; and therefore
the invention is but to diſparage and diſgrace the Grace
of God. If you underſtood theſe things, it would, I
hope, ſettle you to be firm Advocates of the Grace of

the cauſe of humility. No men ſo humble as
they that are moſt ſenſible of the free grace of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, to make them ſomething when they were
nothing: <hi>If thou receive, why doſt thou glory as if thou

an idle word; the reſt were <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and took their
cleanſing to be a courteſie due unto them; but this man
thinking himſelf remote, and if he were a Saviour, yet
he was no Saviour to him, he was cleanſed and came

Obligation to dutie that I wonder any men ſhould
preach Free-Grace to looſen the ſilver Cords of Duty
and Obedience; the law of God is the ſtrongeſt, and
Free-Grace the ſweeteſt tie. <hi>For the Love of Chriſt

ſo often as he thinks of the Free-Grace of God to him,

makes it goe nimbly, ſweetly, and pleaſantly. The ſence
of Gods mercy, that God pickt him out, and made him

the cauſe of mans coming to Chriſt; ſo that though moſt

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53665:128"/>
man ſavingly doth believe and come to Chriſt, except
God by an Almighty and Omnipotent hand doe draw
him: The drawing of God is called the Act of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
man; the coming of man is called the Act of
man converting himſelfe; both you find in this text,
Gods drawing and mans coming: In the firſt of theſe,
man is meerly paſſive, in the ſecond mans coming unto
Chriſt, he is active as by way of compariſon: the Sun
ſhines upon the Wall, the Wall is Paſſive, doth nothing;
in the Walls ſhining back by vertue of the Sunnes ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon it, the wall may be ſaid to be active, becauſe
it ſhines back the Beams by reflexion, a plain caſe; God
giving this Divine grace, Man is paſſive therein: man
converting unto Chriſt, and believing in him, by vertue
of the drawing of God is active, and performes the duty
that is required of him: For though Faith be an Act
of Gods Power giving, yet it is an Act of Mans dutie:
<hi>I believed, therefore I ſpake:</hi> the Act is his, the power is
Gods; this point our Saviour proves affirmatively, by
an Argument drawn out of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that all
that have been taught of the Father believe and
come to Chriſt: and becauſe that every man ſo taught
doth come, therefore no man doth come but he that is
drawn, which is the Negative in the Text: from the
affirmative he proves this Negative; every man that
is taught of God comes to Chriſt; therefore no man
doth come but he that is ſo drawn; as in the natural
being there is the Creation of God, making us ſo to be:
ſo in the Recreation or making man a new Creature,
there is a work of God making us to be ſo; and I ſee no
reaſon but man may as well make himſelfe at firſt in
the natural being that he hath, as re-make himſelfe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:
And I wonder any man ſhould pretend that
man hath a greater ſtroke in making himſelf a new

Chriſt Jeſus? I anſwer, there is not active power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to come, but there there is a paſſive and obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
power, as the School-men call it, which is a power to
receive this work of God, to receive the impreſſion
from God, but not an active power to work it in man
himſelf: as in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> dry bones, the Queſtion was,
Can theſe dry bones live? there was no Power for
them to come together to work life in themſelves; but
a paſſive Power to receive the breath and life when God
gave it: So there is in Man, he is not a ſtock or block,
but hath a power obediential to receive the work of
God: the work of Regeneration and of Faith, is not
wrought <hi>ſine duobus,</hi> without two, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, the
one <hi>in quo,</hi> the other <hi>à quo:</hi> the one in whom it is wrought
as the Subject, that is impotent Man; the one by whom

it there were not ſuch a nature in man, a rational na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there is not <hi>quod ſalvatur,</hi> that which could be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if the arme of God were not revealed there is not
<hi>quod ſalvat,</hi> that by which man is ſaved; ſo that there
muſt be theſe two. From this point thus laid down and

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>1</label> Firſt, God is firſt in order of Cauſality; for
if you ask which of theſe is firſt; I ſay Gods work is
firſt, and then Man comes after; and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
proves; that man is not Saved and Juſtified by
works, <hi>for we are His workmanſhip,</hi> Eph. 2. 10. and the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53665:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dead doth not firſt work, but the living upon the dead,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. and as Iſhewed in <hi>Jer. 31. 18. turne thou
me and I ſhall be turned;</hi> Gods act of turning, Gods,
before mans being turned; <hi>and after I was inſtructed I
repented;</hi> you may further read this point proved in
<hi>Jer. 17. 14. Heal me, Oh Lord, and I ſhall be healed: Save
me, and I ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Gods healing and ſaving muſt
precede and go before our being healed and ſaved:
It's true in order of time, a Chriſtian is not alwaies ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to obſerve the time of Gods working, before the
time of his Converting; the work of God, and the act of
mango ſo near together; who can diſcern by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
any time between the ſhining of the Sun on the
wall, and the walls reflecting back the light of the Sun; &amp;
yet reaſon will tell you from the order of Cauſes, the Sun
muſt firſt ſhine on the Wall, ſo neither is it in this Caſe.
The Lords drawing and Mans coming are not ſenſibly
diſcerned in difference of time, but in order of nature
and Cauſality; Gods work is firſt which drawes, and
mans converſion next which comes to Chriſt; Chriſt
taught this Point in the compariſon between the fruit and
the tree; ſuppoſe the tree bad, it brings not forth fruit that
it may be changed into a good tree but firſt the Tree is
made good, and then yeelds good fruit, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 33. And
<hi>Austin</hi> hath a like <hi>Similitude: Non ideo currit rota ut fit
rotunda ſed quia eſt:</hi> the wheel doth not therefore run
that it may be round; but firſt the wheel or bowl is made
round, and then they runne; ſo man doth not work or
act that he may be made a new Creature, and walk in
Gods way; but firſt he is made Gods workmanſhip,
drawn by Divine grace, and then acts, and brings forth
fruit to God; and it is the ſaying of <hi>Hugo,</hi> ſpeaking of the
grace of God and the will of man, <hi>Gratia operatur eam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde
per eam;</hi> Firſt the grace of God works the will, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53665:129"/>
then it works by the will; here is the ſtate of the point,
grace makes the will and works it, and then works by it.</p>

and moral habits, moral habits are begotten by
Acts precedaneous, and foregoing; as he that will get an
habit of writing: muſt write, get a habit by the Act;
but infuſed habits are powred in before the Acts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as in that which we call <hi>potentia Naturalis,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties

there is an habit, and then there followes an Act, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53665:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
follows; we do not acquire them by acts of our own;
we have the facultie, the power, firſt given, and then
we act.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If God do but ſet the will of man in <hi>aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio,</hi>
like a paire of even ſcales, not determining it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
then he concurs but contingently, but concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly,
upon condition that the will do and move it ſelfe;
and this indeed would be no great matter; for by this
meanes, God doth leſſe in the Converſion of man, then
man doth; for the will of man gives the act, turnes the
ſcales, ſpecifies the event, not the grace of God; and how
diſgraceful is this to the will of God, that the will of
man ſhould do it, and the grace of God not: ſo it would
be, if God ſhould do no more then ſet the will of man in
equipoiſe, only make him able to turn himſelf:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, (obſerve this) Converting grace is given
with that intention by God, that the will and heart of
man ſhould be determined, that the ſcales ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and man ſaved; or elſe I pray what ſhould the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that be, which is called the calling of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. as thoſe that love God
are ſaid to be, ſuch as are called with an intention of God
to bring them to himſelf; and oh how powerful and
infruſtrable is that grace which comes and is given by
God with an intention to ſave you; for if that grace
ſhould not ſave you, you muſt ſay that God is not able
to ſave you: Oh! But, may ſome ſay, the hard heart
of man may refuſe, rebel, and reſiſt; not the intention
of God certainly, not the purpoſe of God doubtleſſe:
<hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks very well to this purpoſe, <hi>illa à nullo duro
corde reſpuitur quia durities tollitur;</hi> this grace, this
converting grace is refuſed by no hard heart, becauſe
it's therefore given, that the hard heart of man may be
taken away, and as a man may properly convey it to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53665:130"/>
you by this compariſon; light being given to take away
darkneſs; the darkneſs cannot reſiſt the light, becauſe
it's therefore made that the darkneſs be expelled; ſo that
grace which is therefore given and intended to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the heart of ſtone, (that is, the reſiſting heart) cannot
be reſiſted, becauſe the intention carries it; <hi>I will take
away the heart of ſtone, ſaith God,</hi> and ſo, to the comfort
of a man thus converted by grace be it ſpoken, the very
ſtonie heart, the hard heart cannot reſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, If converting grace give not an ability or
ſufficiency, but an indifferency onely, and a power that
a man may be ſaved if he will, but no act is determined,
the elect have no more then other men, a power only;
but they have no more reaſon of gratitude, becauſe its
their own will that inclines them to be ſaved, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are loſt; the Act of God therefore muſt be firſt,
otherwiſe men might ſay, it's true Lord, thou gaveſt
me a ſufficiency, and a power to be converted, but the
act, the determining, caſting voice that turned the ſcale
was my own; therefore thou gaveſt me no more then
thou gaveſt to <hi>Judas,</hi> and others as well as to me: And
here, beloved in the Lord, you may ſee from this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Why God will have all the praiſe of Salvation
to be to his grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, why God will have all the glorying to
himſelf; for it would not be juſt with God to rob the
will of man of glorying, if man himſelf deſerved it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God will have all the praiſe to be to his grace,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. that we may be <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his
Grace:</hi> 'tis glorious grace indeed, and that we may be
to the praiſe and glory of it, therefore God ſhewes,
and ſets it forth in all the great Turnes of the Salvation
of man: the firſt ſtep is Election, then Calling, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53665:131"/>
and glorification, in all which grace is ſet forth,
that ſo all may be to the praiſe of glorious grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God will have all the glorying to himſelf;
and truly this is the great mark of Goſpel doctrine, that
it brings the glory to God only, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>be that glorieth may glory in the Lord;</hi> therefore he hath
made Chriſt to be Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,

coming; here is Gods miſſion of Chriſt, and here is
Gods traction of man; the Father ſent me, the Father
drawes man; there muſt be both; had God ſent Chriſt
into the world, and had not alſo drawn man to Chriſt,
then had been nothing done; it was not indeed mans
faith, but Gods meer grace and mercie without the faith
of man that ſent Chriſt into the world; it was not
looking up that was required to the ſetting up of the
ſerpent on the pole; but God required mans looking up
for his being healed by it; ſo it was not mans Faith that
was required to Chriſts miſſion, but it is required to
mans Juſtification, for the reaping of the benefits of
Salvation by Chriſt: God requires that every one of
you do believe in Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore the
traction of God is required to this Faith: Chriſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and ſent to man by God without this Faith; but
that man may be ſaved by Chriſt, Faith is required; and
we are drawn by God to believe in Chriſt: he ſends
Chriſt to man, and thereby differences Man from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
to whom he is not ſent: he drawes man to Chriſt,
and thereby differences the Elect from reprobates, one
man from another; It's not ſending Chriſt to men, but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53665:131"/>
drawing man to Chriſt, that tells men who ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
who are elected; as God ſends Chriſt to man, ſo
he drawes man to Chriſt; as he gives Chriſt to man,
ſo he draws men to Chriſt, and thoſe he gives to him,
he drawes to him: For <hi>verſ. 37. All that the Father
gives to me ſhall come to me, and no man can come except
the Father draw him;</hi> therefore all that are given are
drawn to Chriſt.</p>

Chriſt was not written particularly in the heart of the

ſome remnants of the Law left, as fragments of the old
writing that were written in the heart of man at firſt,
but not a line of Chriſt in the Book of the Creatures,

ſince nothing of Chriſt was written in the Heart of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

therefore its ſaid: 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9, 10. That Chriſt hath

therein revealed:</hi> ſo that had there not been a book of
Revelation, revealing Chriſt to you, Chriſt had not
been known; if there had not been a hand of drawing to

Why? he is oppoſite to the righteouſneſs of another:
For every man naturally would be ſaved by his own;
he is oppoſite both to Juſtification, Sanctification, and
Salvation by another: and therefore that man may be
brought of his natural root and pride, whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes
and not ſubmits to the righteouſneſs of another,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. and to be be ſanctified and ſaved by another
being full of himſelfe: It muſt needs be that except

this man be drawn of God he will not, he cannot

given to Chriſt, nor Chriſt loſe one that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him. <hi>Of all that thou haſt given to me I have loſt
none, ſave the Child of perdition:</hi> that God might ſhew
his love to Jeſus Chriſt, he will draw thoſe that he hath
given unto him: the Elect of God are as deep in Sin as
others are, by their own natural condition, and if they
were not drawn by Gods mighty hand, they themſelves
could not come; and therefore the Lord will draw them,
that his gift to Chriſt might be maintained and made
good: there was great power ſhewn in bringing <hi>Iſrael</hi>
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was a Type of Gods bringing His
Elect out of the ſlavery of their natural condition
wherein they lay; the Elect are given to Chriſt and
appointed to be members of him, that Chriſt might
not be a head without a body, a bodileſſe Chriſt; he
will bring all his members and plant them into him, for
the Election of God doth not make a man a member of
Chriſt by his purpoſe, or decree; as the Clay appointed
to be a Veſſel of Honor, hath no more form or faſhion
by the election, until it come to working, than that which
is not ſo appointed: So Gods Electing you to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt Jeſus is by purpoſe; but Gods faſhioning,

in all times, not only thoſe, but theſe, ſo croſſe and
thwart is the receiving of Chriſt to the natural heart
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53665:132"/>
of man, that it is a work of great Power to bring men to

to mans coming, that if he were not drawn by

            <p>Firſt, Mans Reaſon, which looks for ſatisfaction, till

mans Free coming: Nor mans Free coming, any
thing contrary to Gods drawing, but both of them do
very well ſtand together: for one may ſay, if man do
come to Chriſt freely, as he is never more willing then
when God is pleaſed to work upon his heart; how is he
drawn? If he be drawn, how doth he come? We
ſpeak not of a Violent and Compulſorie drawing: <hi>Ita
credimus potentem, ut negamus volentem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Proſper.</hi>
We believe the Power of God faſhioning and forming
the heart, and bringing it unto faith, but we deny the
work of God to be violent and compulſorie: when the
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtrains us,</hi> there is a
Conſtraint of love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. and therefore dream
not of ſuch a drawing, which is whether you will or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for there is a powerful conſtraint by love it ſelfe: we
do ſo believe the love of God to be potent, as that we do
deny it to be Violent; this mans free coming to Chriſt
is nothing contrary to Gods powerful drawing: Its ſaid,
<hi>I will draw them with the cords of man, with bonds
of love, Hoſea</hi> 11. 4. which is not a promiſe of Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Compulſion, but of a gracious and ſweet
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53665:133"/>
drawing of the people to him: and doth not the Church
pray for this drawing, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. draw me and we will
run after thee: and do you think that the Church prayes
for violence to be uſed: No! the Church prayes for
ſuch a drawing of God as may be followed by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
running of men; is there any man that knows
how ſtrong and ſweet this drawing of God is, but doth
and can pray for it with as great affection, as he that
ſticks faſt in the mire will cry for ſome to help him out;
becauſe if it be a violence, it is pleaſing to him to be ſo
drawn, and therefore the old word in this point was
<hi>fortiter &amp; ſuaviter:</hi> God drawes men unto Chriſt,
ſtrongly and ſweetly: 'tis powerful, and therefore
ſtrong, and yet it is not violent but ſweet too: and is this
drawing any thing contrary to mans freedome? doth
not God know how to work upon the heart of man?
determining and carrying it out ſo as ſhall not prejudice
the freedome and inclination of it? Cannot the maker
of the heart work upon the heart, he that turnes the heart
as the rivers of water are turned in the channel? It
was the ſaying of <hi>Auſtin</hi> long agoe, <hi>De ipsis hominum
voluntatibus facit quod vult:</hi> God works upon the will
of man what he will: doth not the Workman that
makes the watch know all the ſprings, and can ſet the
watch going? and doth not God that made the heart
know how to move and determine it to himſelf? did not
God make the day without the Sun at firſt? and cannot
he move nature by his omnipotency without ordinary
courſe? Its true; I know men acute, men of the Schools,
do hold it hard, if not impoſſible, to reconcile Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with mans freedome, and think it not feaſible, but
rather that the one croſſes and thwarts the other; but
I ſay there is a harmony and ſweet agreement, between
Gods drawing and mans coming, when he will convert
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53665:133"/>
and bring in the Soul to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, as
there is between a weight or plummet of a Clock; that
accelerates the motion, and a natural propenſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Center, which both joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>:
so tis here, the will of man moves freely, and God by
his drawing doth give to it a greater weight that accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
the motion of the will; and by how much the more
the Lord drawes, by ſo much the freer is the will made;
Oh! that men would conſider this, and if they do not
underſtand this, let them believe that God doth, the I
pray what may be the meaning of that place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12.
<hi>Work out your Salvation:</hi> here is mans working for
Gods works in you to Will and to Do; a Text that
plainly ſhewes, that the work of God, and the work of
man may very well ſtand together: and the truth is,
there are four things that I think according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of learning (of Scripture I am ſure) that may
make Gods drawing man to Chriſt, and mans free co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
very reconcilable, ſo as the more man is drawn
the freer he ſhall be, he ſhall come, as the Text, Nay: he
ſhall runne, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. as the more weight, the freelier
moves the plummet downwards.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I hold it to be a great truth that was eſpied by
learned Naturaliſts, Philoſophers, that that which is a
mans chief good, and ſo apprehended to be, is purſued
with infinite deſire, and the will is neceſſarily carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it; there is no ſhineſs, no indifferency of a man to
this, for <hi>Appetit us summi boni <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </hi> the deſire of
my Chief good is an infinite deſire: Why? becauſe
the higheſt good muſt needs have the higheſt appetite,
there being nothing that may put meaſure or limitation
to that deſire, and therefore in the deſire thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
heart is neceſſarily carried, and not indifferently, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
remiſly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:53665:134"/>
Secondly, The chiefeſt good of man conſiſts in this,
the having and enjoying of God: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this is the higheſt
and moſt ſatisfactory good, that fills the appetite: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the heart of man can be taken up and that fully; and
there is but one medium to the attainment of this
chiefeſt good: there is but one line leads unto it; and
being ſo, the chief good and the line are equally deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
the meanes is knowing of Chriſt, coming unto or
coming in by Chriſt: ſo that when the chief good is
but one, and the meanes but one to it, there can be no
diſſent of mans heart to either of theſe when they are
known and apprehended; and that this is the chief
good and the onely meanes to it you are taught, in one
text of Scripture (as I conceive) <hi>John 17. 3. This is life
eternal, that they know thee, and him whom thou haſt ſent,
Jeſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> bonum,</hi> and knowing Chriſt the only means
that leads to that end, then without all queſtion the will
of man once apprehending this to be ſo, is carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
indifferency neceſſarily in the purſuit of both.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Now when enlightens, convinces, and
convictively teaches the mind to know and ſee this chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
good, this God: and to know the only mean to this
happineſſe, the having of Chriſt Jeſus, then is the heart
forcibly and freely drawn, and cannot be other; it cannot
but purſue and follow after: for the light of Gods tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
carries it, and the bias of the will naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
the dictate of that light of God; and ſo you have
both in one, Gods drawing and mans coming; and the
greater the drawing is, the more light the mind hath,
the freer is the coming with greater propenſion: and
it is this teaching of God by which our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
this word <hi>drawing,</hi> in the next <hi>verſe</hi> 45. Its writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Prophets, <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53665:134"/>
every man that hath heard and learned of the Father
comes to me:</hi> So that hence I prove, that the will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
followes this voice of God; and if this be Gods
drawing, Gods teaching, what contradiction can there
be between theſe two; Gods drawing, and Mans coming;
every one that is thus taught is a Comer, a Believer in,
and a Cloſer with the Lord Jeſus, and doth as freely
come as a man in the dark doth follow a Lanthorn or
light ſet up.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, The great ſatisfaction which the heart of
man finds in Chriſt Jeſus thus taught and revealed to it
in the light of the Spirit doth fully bind up and ſuſpend
the reſiſtance or actual oppoſition of the heart at that
time: I confeſſe, while corruption is in the heart of man,
there will be potentially ſome backwardneſs, ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and indiſpoſition to walk with God: as alwaies
in the bottom of a veſſel there will ſome dreggs remain:
but this the heart puts not out at the time of this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
felt; though at other times and in other matters,
it may like a bitter root vent out ſome gall that remaines;
yet when the Lord is working thus warmly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victively
upon the heart to turne it, at that time this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
is bound up and lies cloſe, and doth not break
out: but lies as if the hands were tied, the reſiſtance ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and the oppoſition taken off: as the exhalations
drawn up by heavenly bodies do during the influence
mount upwards on high; and yet there is a power in the
matter at ſome other time to move downwards again,
but that power is ſuſpended for that time; or as the freſh
water-ſtream will runne amain being carried back with
the tide: And yet when 'tis going back there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſneſs
in it to run down the ſtream; which to me
ſeems lively to ſet out this point to you: while the heart
of man that is rebellious and reluctant hath this convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

            <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is the Father of Chriſt that draws all the
ſaved unto Chriſt:</hi> He draws all the appointed Members
that are fore-given to his Son by him: The Father hath
given them; and the Father that hath given them, draws
them. Every one that is the Fathers gift to Chriſt, is
the Fathers workmanſhip drawn to, and created in Chriſt
Jeſus: For the gift of God which is by Election, is made
good by the drawing of God, which is by his calling, or
his operation according thereunto; now becauſe they
are the gift of God by election, therefore they ſhall
ſurely come to him by the Fathers traction; <hi>All that the
Father gives to me ſhall come to me,</hi> ver. 37. Why? <hi>becauſe
my Father will draw them;</hi> and if my Father will draw,
they ſhall come: And therefore God in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 2.
is compared to a husbandman that ſets in the graff,
Chriſt is the ſtock or body of the tree that bears and
feeds it, and the Believer is the graff that is ſet in by the
husbandman: Here is a diſtinct operation; God ſets,
Chriſt ſuſtains and maintains it, and he that is called and
converted is the graff planted into this Tree, and ſaved
by Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

work, in bringing men to Chriſt, yet we may thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
upon this objection, That Chriſt being cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and lifted up, draws all men to him objectively, as a
healing Serpent ſet on the pole, to be looked upon by the
eye of Faith: But God the Father draws to Chriſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
and powerfully, working that power and life in
them whereby they may come, begetting a new nature,
and giving a heart propending unto Chriſt, and cloſing
with him. And therefore if God ſhould ſend Chriſt,
and leave man to himſelf, (as moſt think they can believe
and be converted by themſelves) this great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
thereof would follow, that the Election of God
would be defeated and made fruſtrate; but thoſe he
gives, he makes to come to him to whom they are given,
and ſo becomes both Chriſts Father and theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond Branch of this fourth Obſervation is this,

But ſhall I tell you, by the relative name of Father is
(as often in other places) meant, except man be drawn
by a Divine hand, an omnipotent power and operation
of God; for that's the thing that Chriſt intends, that
no man can come and be a believer in him, except it be
by a Divine power and operation wrought in him, above
man himſelf; ſo that it is not any way intended to divide
the Three Perſons, or ſeparate any of them from this

poteſtatem,</hi> a moſt almighty power to go forth
from God that works the converſion of man, becauſe
it's ſaid, <hi>Except my Father draw him;</hi> and truly I know
not why that expreſſion ſhould be quarrelled at, if we
do but conſider the impotency of man to believe in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53665:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt and be converted; if we conſider next that it's
called a Creation, (<hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>) and a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the dead; and if alſo we conſider what the
Apoſtle ſaith of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 18. where there is weight
of words, the exceeding greatneſs of Gods power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that which God put forth in raiſing Chriſt
from the dead; we need not be aſhamed to ſay, that
God puts forth an almighty power in making man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
nor to look upon it as an uncouth expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I obſerve from this Point, <hi>How impotent and
unable man is to that which is his greateſt concernment.</hi> I
know we are weak in other things; but to be weak in
that which is the main concernment of ſalvation is ſad:
This I would have you to obſerve, that in that wherein
your life lies, and the way to life, in that very thing you
are weak as water, and no more able to believe than to
keep the Law; and yet you will ſay by rote, I think
many times that it is impoſſible to keep the Law of God,
but will not grant but that you can believe; and yet let
it be obſerved here, that God hereby ſignifies, that you
are as impotent to this, that is the great concernment of
man, as to any thing elſe: And,</p>
            <p>There might be a fourth thing obſervable, <hi>God that
thus imploys his power, doth it in his drawing man to Chriſt.</hi>
See the method whereby God will ſave you; he will not
go to bring you to the Father himſelf, the Father to the
Father immediately, as to an abſolute Judge, as <hi>Luther</hi>
ſaith, <hi>What have I to do with an abſolute God? he will damn
me, and not abate me a farthing of the righteouſneſs of the
Law, which I cannot keep.</hi> It's true, he could have made
man able to keep his Law, and have made man perfect;
but God will keep his own way, and ſave man in and
by his Son: Why, may ſome ſay, this is about; why
doth he bring men to Chriſt? Surely God is ſo ſtrict in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53665:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
keeping the way that he hath ſet for ſaving man, becauſe
that is his Covenant, and therefore brings to his Son
Chriſt, that he may ſave them; and as the husbandman
will graft you into him. And let this that is Gods way
be your way; if you could find another, do not look
after it. By this you ſhall know the power of God,
whether it be in you, by this which is the work of it:
It ſets you not to other ways, but draws to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of this fourth Obſervation may be three-fold.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, Learn hence, <hi>That a regenerate man is twice Gods
Creature:</hi> I may ſafely call him ſo; once as he is a man,
in his natural eſtate, made up of Soul and Body; next as
a regenerate man, created in Chriſt; and if men conſider
it well, that a believer is called a new man, a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
why ſhould there be leſſe power, why ſhould we
think it leſſe work to make a new man, then to make a
man to be? Lay your heads to conſider this point, and
you will find it very difficult why it ſhould be more the
hand of God in this, then to make man to be: man hath
a natural life, what is that to the purpoſe? for natural
life is but a death in compariſon; and therefore its ſaid,
<hi>them that are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
and whereas there was in the matter of our firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
no propenſion to become a man, more then any
thing elſe, ſo there was no oppoſition; but now to this
new creature, there is not only in us no propenſion, but
there is more, there is an antipathy and oppoſition, ſo as
God hath ſomewhat to take away, as well as ſomewhat
to give: <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone:</hi> ſo that it is
a harder matter to make a man a ſecond time, then at

a man is wrought to faith, learn, that as God in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53665:137"/>
of Miracles did uſe men as in healing diſeaſes and

uſeth the Agency of men even in working Faith
and Converſion: this I thought good to put in, becauſe
its clear, and that no man might ſtumble to look for a
kind of Enthuſiaſtical Converſion, that God ſhould
work Faith, and Repentance, without the uſe of any
means: God uſes inſtruments to awaken you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite

there are inſtruments uſed; though the power be
Gods, So, as a man that hath a Sore expects not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

and by the Power of God which goes to the making
man come, it appears that man is Impotent and Unable
of himſelf thereunto, and there is more goes to the
converting of a man, then is in man himſelf; which I
confeſſe is a point that I pitcht upon before, but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
properly now I am gleaning from the words of
the Text what can be further gathered, from which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
theſe three things follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That man is naturally at a diſtance from Chriſt,
being not in him already by his firſt birth: but is to
come unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:53665:137"/>
Secondly, This coming of man to Chriſt Jeſus is
a motion or paſſage from ſtate to ſtate, ſo that indeed
no man doth come to Chriſt, but he doth change his
eſtate and condition, Joh. 5. 24. <hi>he that believeth is paſs'd
from death to life:</hi> Oh! that God would make
you look out for this tranſition, that you may be ſure
you ſtand not ſtill in the firſt eſtate wherein you
were.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, It follows that man is impotent
to his greateſt concernment; not only for keeping the
Law, for whole and perfect obedience to God (which
yet may humble man) but alſo to that on which hangs
the great hinge of Eternal life, his coming to Chriſt, that
ſo you may be confounded in your ſelves and quite
aſhamed.</p>

               </label> Now by reaſon of an Objection that may be raiſed,
I ſhall ſtart out of my way by a degreſſion: may ſome
ſay, if God will uſe inſtruments in working Faith or
Converſion, as the word and Goſpel-miniſtry, as a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn
that holds out the light, it ſeems to us that they
do ſomething; therefore it followes, if God work by
them, and they work under God, that therefore God is
not the Sole worker, but theſe Inſtruments as working
with God, ſo the Scripture uſes the Word.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> God doth work by the word and inſtruments or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily:
but do not deceive your ſelves, we do not
uſe to ſay, the Ax did build this houſe; But the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
that wields and manages it; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the pen made the
deed or drew the conveyance, but the Secretary that
uſed it: this is proper in all ſpeech: we do not give away
the work of the principal agent unto the inſtrument: ſo
neither may we ſay that the Miniſter works, but inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally;
properly no otherwiſe then the pen drew the
conveyance, that we may bring all the honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53665:138"/>
to God that works in us; and therefore let no man
look for a ſudden enthuſiaſtick converſion, a faith
wrought in without the ordinary way and means we
do not prompt you to look for, or to look unto; and to
ſay all in ſhort, God can bring forth and work faith in
the heart of man by himſelf without inſtruments; as he
made the day before he made the Sun, ſo that you
ſee he did not need the Sun to make the day: but now
in the ſetled courſe of his providence he works by man:
Chriſt could have brought the Fiſh to hand to the ſhore,
but he would bring them to <hi>Peters</hi> net, that was the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
inſtrument to catch the Fiſh: ſo God that can work
to bring you to Faith in Chriſt, an extraordinary and
eaſie way, yet will bring you to the Goſpel net, becauſe
that's the means appointed for the catching of the Fiſh:
this hinders not, that God is the ſole worker of Faith,
and I make it appear by this <hi>Similitude:</hi> God appoints
Marriage for the procreation of Children, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of Mankind: and it cannot be in an ordinary
way without it: but will any man ſay, the Soul is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
the reaſonable Soul is traduced; No! you gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſay, God alone infuſes the reaſonable Soul into the
body of the Child, a fit inſtance to ſhew, that wherein
God only works, yet there muſt be means uſed: God
drawes to Chriſt by a powerful work, and yet he will
have man excited, awakened, perſwaded, and he will
have the door knockt at by the miniſtery of man: to the
end that man may firſt be made ſenſible of his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency:
and ſecondly, that he may know what God
doth for him, that when the means uſed do not, he can
with a Key open the heart: Thirdly, that he may deal
with man in a humane may, with man as man; in a moral
way, by Counſel and Inſtruction one man works upon
another. And doubtleſſe God doth ordinarily give the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53665:138"/>
quickening life, the life of Faith and Grace, when he
hath firſt excited and hewed man by his word, at leaſt to
make ſome preparation in man, if it be but ſo farre as
conviction goes: for conviction is the laſt work wrought
in man foregoing Chriſt Jeſus; look on your natural
formes, if but of a Chicken hatcht of an egge: It's not
introduced without preparations and previous works
foregoing; and that there ſhould be ſome preparations
wrought in man, in order to bringing him to Chriſt
doth appear: as without the ſenſe of a diſeaſe, no man
ſeeks to a Phyſitian; and the ſerpent on the pole would
have been of no uſe, unleſſe ſome had been ſtung to look
up to it for remedy: theſe things ſeem clear to me, that
there are ſome previous works going before; and I for
my part am of judgment, that the preaching of the law
uſed by divines for the humbling and awaking of ſecure
hearts to look out after a Saviour, was a proper way,
that the law as a Corroſive may eat and open the ſore,
and then bring in the Goſpel, which indeed is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
ordinance that works faith and the love of God:
as the poles that plunge the Water do not catch the
Fiſh, but the net, yet they drive the Fiſh into that which
doth catch them; ſo I ſay not, that the Law doth convert;
the doctrine of the Law ſetting home a mans Sins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
and humbling man doth not properly bring a
man in to Chriſt Jeſus, or faith in him, but drives him to
the Goſpel-net, to ſeek for refuge in the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt; and this I ſpeak, as to the preparation of a man
to Converſion, <hi>I have hewed them by my Prophets, and
ſlain them by the words of my mouth,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 5. Oh! that
we had theſe words of ſlaughter among us, though I
know and grant, a man may be wrought upon by the
Law, that never comes home to converſion by the
Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:53665:139"/>
Now therefore I will open what goes to this work
of Gods drawing, or what there is required to this
drawing of God, in a few things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I will lay down for the opening of this draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God this point, that you may know whether God
hath drawn you, Yea or No: Man is not ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by ſudden enthuſiaſmes, he knowes not when
or how, by ſudden raptures, but he is ordinarily prepared
and ſubdued by the miniſtery of the Word, as the Soil
is plowed, and by that fitted and prepared to be ſown;
for no man ſowes the Ground that is not prepared by
the plough: ſo it is here, and this is the work of the exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
knocking, awakning, convincing Spirit: to which
belongs converſion: and as the natural form hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
foregoing, ſo hath the Spiritual form of Grace
in the heart of man: it were a wonder to ſee a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in a night, to ſee the work of faith in an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the work of Converſion in a knotty weyward Soul
wrought in a night; that looks like the muſhromes of
Religion that grow up in our times of a ſudden, and
have no appearance or knowledge of any work that
might uſher them that way: and theſe preparations are
often works of time, ſuch as the healing of a ſore is: Its
a rare thing that a ſore, an inveterate ſore, ſhould be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in a night or an houre; to which purpoſe, as the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
one of them I know of in the New-Teſtament, (for
I know this Point is ſtriven againſt by a great many,
that there is no ſuch thing as a previous work preceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
to a mans Converſion; but God drops in ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
conſider <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> Preaching,
<hi>When they heard that Doctrine, they were pricks unto the
heart, and ſaid, men and brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and he ſaid unto them, repent and be baptized:</hi> Now,
to confeſſe the truth, this Text is not a certain Preſident:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53665:139"/>
nor doth it follow, becauſe theſe were, that all that are
brought to grace are brought ſo to, for God is not tied
to one and the ſame preſident to every man; but here
went before the full work of Converſion, a breaking of
the heart; there was a griefe, and fear of damnation ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon them; there was a deſire of Freedom to know
the way out, and ſome hope of pardon. This is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
miniſterial way, though as I ſaid before, it is no
certain preſident; for the Plaiſter doth not lie ſo long
upon every ſore as it doth upon ſome; therefore length
of time in Converſion is not in all alike; there muſt be
longer work of ſmart, and preparatories, on ſome, upon
others it lies ſhorter on and makes quicker work, and yet
the work may be as well done to: now theſe preceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
preparations, (for we ſpeak but vulgarly, not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
of this great point) may be conſidered two waies;
either as preparatives unto life, going before any ſparks
of Spiritual life begotten in the ſoul, or as latent effects
of life already begun; as they are preparatives foregoing
all degrees of Faith and Regeneration, ſo they may tend
to life, if they be managed thereunto by God: if God ſo
manage this grief, this ſorrow for ſin, theſe wounds, ſo
they may tend to life; but if they be found in hypocrites,
in men themſelves that God leaves, then they will be
like an egge, that may peradventure be hatcht to a
Chicken, but if left by the henne, will come to nothing:
ſo this ſorrow, grief, hope, &amp;c. that may be wrought in
hypocrites by the miniſterial call of the word, but are
not ſitten upon, will come to nothing; they die, becauſe
they have no root, and ſo are like the graſſe in the ſtony
ground; for the preſent its green, but it vaniſhes, becauſe
it hath no root abiding; Secondly, if they be latent
effects of a ſecret life already begun, which few men
know the time of its coming in (the knowledg of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53665:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time of converſion or dropping in this Spiritual life into
the Soul is a hard thing) but if theſe initials be latent
effects of ſome ſeed ſown, then they will abide, hold
out and continue; and there is a difference between pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives
going before life, and thoſe we call latent
effects of a ſecret life; the one being left to your manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will fail, and come to nothing; but if they be effects
of life, then they will continue: and let me give you in
this compariſon, as in the production of man: (For a
ſpiritual birth much anſwers the natural birth) there
may be, and are, ſome qualifications of the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the bodie is made, that foregoes the coming in of the
Soul: and there are ſome latent effects of the Soul
already come in; yet when this life came in, ſhe knew
not peradventure that is the mother; but here is the
difference; if they be effects of a body yet dead, without
life, they may go away and often doe; but if they be
effects of life, then they doe continue, and there is growth
and increaſe, and a ripening, till there be a full birth:
ſo tis in the Converſion of man; thoſe effects that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a life already begun will hold out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am ſure, I am thus farre right on the point: but
what were thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. they were preparatives
managed by God; for it ſeems they came to effect, did
go before an act of regeneration; <hi>Repent and be Baptized,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Peter;</hi> God gave the act after that; but God mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it ſo, that they came to effect, and brought forth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which had it been left to man, peradventure
had not wrought that effect.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Regeneration is properly the work of
God, in a man excited, prepared, quickned, awakened,
convinc'd; find this in your ſelves; come to the threſhold
before you come into the houſe; there muſt be buds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there be ripe fruit in the tree: let there be day-break
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53665:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before there be Sun riſe: but when may it be ſaid, now
the ſoul quickens, now it lives? 'tis when God actually
puts a principle of life into the Soul, and changes it by
habitual grace, puts in the New creature the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and gives it power to believe: And in this work
there are two things that God doth to be conſidered:
firſt, his taking away the heart of ſtone, the vicious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ſtocking up thoſe roots of gall and wormwood,
ſinne and delight in ſinne, and turning the heart into a
ſoftneſſe, and wearineſſe of ſinne; and this he cals a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of the heart of ſtone, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. And
then the ſecond work that joines with and followes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, is the planting of a new principle in its place, as
the heart of fleſh is given to come in the place of the
heart of ſtone, whereby it ſhall be inclined to the work
of faith and love; and this ſhall be (as Chriſt ſaid) <hi>a
well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life, John</hi> the
7th; and this is a work above the power of all means
uſed in themſelves, till God uſe this Pen to write by;
but every tendent and previous act is not regeneration,
but that which gives a ſpiritual being, and a vital princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
for until there be a ſpiritual being begun, there is no
new Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, There goes to this divine drawing a further
work; and truely that will not be acknowledged by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great men, that out of the heart thus changed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by habitual grace there is drawn out by the hand
of God himſelf the very act of believing in Chriſt: It
is a hard thing to conceive how that ſhould be; but it
is no otherwiſe then this, that as when the wheel is
made, you put on your hand to turn it: ſo when this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of grace and new nature is put into the heart of man,
God puts forth this eximious act, doth as it were lay his
hand on the wheel, turns the heart to draw out this
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53665:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
act of Faith, and this Chriſt ſpeaks of heer; coming is an
act, a motion, a man cannot come till he move; and ſo
in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, And <hi>Philip. 1. 19. to you is given
to believe,</hi> not to you is given the power to believe, but
God works the act, the will, not only the habitual change
of the will; when he hath habitually changed the heart,
then he drawes the act out; the reaſon is, if God had
given the power, and put a new principle into mans
heart, to turne and come to Chriſt, and then leave him;
he had done no more for his Elect then he did for <hi>Adam,</hi>
when he was in his integrity: God gave him a power
to obey, but he did not give him the act of obedience;
becauſe there was a habit and a power given him, and a
ſufficient power that he might have uſed, if he would, and
have ſtood by it; for if God had not only given him a
power, but this act, then certainly he had ſtood; but now
the Converſion of man is certain, not on a peradventure:
God puts a habit which he doth not leave to the will
of man to act alone; if he ſhould, I know not how it
would ſucceed; he doth not only habitually, but graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
perform theſe great effects in his Elect; and this
is that which you may pray and look for; and though
you were poſſeſſors of the grace whereby you might be
ſomeway inclined, yet look for this drawing of God,
whereby you may be dravvn to believing in Chriſt.</p>

Firſt, There is a ſort of people in the world in whom
God will magnifie his great power in drawing them
into a ſtate of ſalvation, by bringing them in to Chriſt
Jeſus, and they are deſcribed by a Character that
is before hand unknown to us, a great ſecret, that they
are a people known to him, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The Lord

Heb. 8. 10.</p>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53665:142"/>
Covenant of God thus made with his Choſen, before
the world began, is irreverſible, not to be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for 'tis a purpoſed grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. There is not
one of theſe in whom this undertaking grace ſhall not
be operative, working, and ſuccesful; this is as the waters
of <hi>Noah</hi> to me, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 54. 9. God compares his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with his people to the Covenant he made in <hi>Noahs</hi>
floud, and explains it thus; as I have ſworn that the flood
ſhall return no more, ſo that my Covenant concerning
the waters cannot be reverſt; ſo neither ſhall the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which I have made with thee be fruſtrate; for it is a

no more then there is required any ſuch condition that

            <p>Secondly, There are no <gap reason="foreign">

from the reſt of the world, until he that owns the ſheep

to his Elective purpoſe; and theſe be they of better or

they ſhall come; and if they cannot, or will not,
no more then the reſt of men, they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be all drawn;
they ſhall every one be taught of God in their times,

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Infer. </seg>1</label> Firſt, All are called by the Word promiſcuouſly,
for there is a promiſcuous calling, beſides this ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
call, according to elective purpoſe, all ſinners are
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53665:142"/>
called to repentance, to faith, and to Chriſt; for in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Goſpel there is no exception, it being given
to every creature; the condition of the Goſpel-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is, that every one <hi>that believes ſhall not periſh but have
eternal life,</hi> Joh. 3. 15, 16. Though this be made with all
that are outwardly called, yet this is not the inward
covenant which is purſued and followed by the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, that I have explained, I may ſet it forth by
this compariſon: A King or Soveraign Prince hath a
company of Rebels in priſon, and being minded to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
ſome of them, he ſends and proclaims to them this
word; if any of them bring and ſhew him his Privy
Signet they ſhall be pardoned; none can; but he ſends it
to ſome whom he pleaſes, whereby they are inabled to
bring it, theſe now are certainly pardoned; but yet the
Proclamation is to all that can, though the King be not
bound to ſend it to all. Here is the caſe; the major of
the Syllogiſme is, whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved:
the minor this, but you and you that are in my ſecret
purpoſe ſhall believe, and therefore you ſhall be ſaved:
here is the outward part of the Covenant proclaimed
to all; and here is the inward part, whereby he drawes
ſome that are known to him, whereby they are certainly
ſaved: the Covenant is but one, though there be two
propoſitions or parts in it.</p>

Thirdly, Let it work upon that deſperate crew that
hang all the care upon this pin; God undertakes, God
will perform, therefore ſleep ſecurely till he call; for
there is no intention of the end, but with deſtination of
means, which we are bound to wait on, as much as if
there was no election to ſalvation at all; I ſay, as much;
for the election of man, to the end, nothing impairs or
abates the uſe of means, as appears by Gods calling
upon them; ſo that there is no chuſing nor election of
God, but there is alſo a purpoſe as powerful, to bring
the Elect by means to Chriſt: <hi>God hath choſen you to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
that's the end, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. but this, is <hi>through
the ſanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth,</hi> as
the means; both of them appertaining to one election:
<hi>Epheſ. 14. Choſen us in Christ that we ſhould be holy;</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
is the means, for without it no man ſhall ſee the
Lord; and the end is ſalvation, to which we are ſaid to
be choſen: And therefore let no man hang upon ſo looſe
a point the ſalvation of his ſoul, upon Gods election,
which he knoweth not; but on Gods chuſing man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end, becauſe he chuſeth him alſo to the means;
and the truth is, the means are as much to be uſed as if
there were no election of man unto ſalvation; which I
ſpeak now, to confirm men in a neceſſity of the uſe of
means, which are to be uſed as if our ſalvation did
hang upon it, as being only to be wrought out by us.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Inference </seg>4</label> Fourthly, Set your ſelves with your all and utmoſt, to
wait on the ſaving means of ſalvation, for the gaining of
Faith, and the coming in to Chriſt Jeſus; for they are
firſt in execution; God firſt brings men to them, and
they muſt firſt be made good in you: And let me tell
you, You need not trouble your ſelves about any thing
of ſalvation, but the means that tend unto it; for the
means is that about which you are to be employed, the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53665:143"/>
end follows naturally of it ſelf; there is no new thing
to be done after the uſe of means, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the end; there needs no further ſeeking of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
than that we ſeek faith in Chriſt, and holineſs; all
your work and imployment is about means to be uſed,
and for ſalvation it ſelf, let it follow; it will, without
any new imployment of yours.</p>
            <p>Now for the further handling of this point thus laid
down, I ſhall in this method proceed, in which I ſhall
be as brief as I can.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To remove thoſe rubs at which the Reaſon of
man doth ſtumble in the conception of this Point.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſhew the nature &amp; properties of this drawing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, How we may know that we are drawn of
God; or how a Believer that is already brought home
to Chriſt, may know that he is drawn of God.</p>
            <p>For thoſe rubs that lye in the way of Reaſon, they are
three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That mans act is not aſſigned to man himſelf,
but God; as mans coming to Chriſt is aſſigned to
Gods drawing; which is eaſily reſolved; For mans act
is aſſigned to man, <hi>Rom. 10. 10. With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth;</hi>
It's not God, it's not Chriſt that believeth for
us, as ſome fondly ſpeak; but mans act is performed
by Gods power; <hi>Ille facit ut cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amus;</hi> For, faith
God, <hi>I will cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes,</hi> Ezek. 36.
27. ſo the hand turns the wheel, but it ſelf turns not; the
hand throws the bowl, but it ſelf runs not: So it is here,
God makes man to believe, therefore it's plain, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of our believing is not ours, whoſe the act is, but
Gods, whoſe the power is; though the act belong to
us, yet neither the glory nor the power; not the power,
and therefore not the glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This power of drawing forces the liberty
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53665:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of mans heart and will. I Anſwer, There is a conſtraint
of love, which is not of force; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The
love of Chriſt constraineth me,</hi> 2 Cor. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. God draws by
the cords of a man; that is, ſweetly; the drawing is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the will, becauſe it makes the will willing; it doth
not move the wheel againſt the wheel, or the natural
motion of it, but with it; and then the heavier the
plummet, the faſter the clock goes: If the power of
God go with the will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of man, it moves more freely,
as the ſtream doth with the wind and tide; then the
more power God puts forth, the more willing you come,
<hi>Thy people ſhall be willing,</hi> ſhall be voluntiers, <hi>in the day of
thy Power,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3. as if the power of God, in that
day wherein its put forth, ſhould make a man a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
in coming to Chriſt Jeſus. It's true, God moves
contrary to the natural ſtream, as the tide carries up the
River; but when the Lord puts a new Principle, a new
bias into the bowl, and that natural heart of ſin is taken
away, then this coming, though it be with drawing, is
ſo ſweet, that the ſoul prays, <hi>Lord, draw me, and I will
run,</hi> Cant. 1. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It is wondred at, that God ſhould command
what he works or gives; for if he mean to give it, why
doth he command? and if he command, how doth he
give? if it be a duty, how is it Gods work? and if it be
Gods work, how can it be my duty? I Anſwer, That
God gives the grace he commands; the duty bidden is
alſo given; and except it be given, it is not the bidding
will ſerve the turn. 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 23. This is his command, that
we ſhould believe in his Son:</hi> So then our believing in
Chriſt is a commandment of God. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 17 30.
<hi>God commands all men every where to repent:</hi> Here you
ſee that faith and repentance both of them are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of God; and its the command that makes them
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53665:144"/>
to be your duty: Well, yet for all this, both theſe are
given by God, <hi>Phil. 1. 29. To you li's given to believe,</hi>
2 Tim. 2. 25. <hi>If God peradventure ſhall give them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the acknowledgment of the truth:</hi> here you find
that both are given: Again, <hi>Circumciſc your ſelves to
the Lord, and be no more ſtifnecked,</hi> Jer. 44. (Oh Lord,
may ſome ſay? doth God put this impoſſible work
upon me.) <hi>Ezek. 18. 31. Make you a new heart and a new
ſpirit,</hi> here theſe two are commanded, Make you, and
Circumciſe you, and yet both theſe are promiſed and
given: Deut. 36. 6. <hi>I the Lord thy God will Circumciſe thy
heart,</hi> and Ezek. 36. 26. <hi>I will make you a new heart and
a new ſpirit:</hi> Can any thing be plainer then this; he
commands, and works that which he doth command;
he commands, to convince us of our debt, what is due;
and of our impotency that we cannot pay; that we may
fall down at the feet of this God: and yet he gives too,
for the magnifying and honouring of his free grace to
unworthy man, and his power to impotent man that is
unable; and therefore we diſtinguiſh between Legal
commands and Evangelical; thoſe of the law require
the dutie, but afford no ſtrength; but the Goſpel which
commands faith and repentance that are Goſpel-graces,
carry the grace and power with them; not unto all
that ſhall oppoſe and ſhut the door, but unto the Elect of
God, and the people of his inward Covenant; So that
for a man to ſay, it's a Goſpel command, is to ſay, that
'tis poſſible through grace, that is, there goes grace and
power with it, which the Lord will convey by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
for the commands of the Goſpel are <hi>vehicula
ſpiritus,</hi> carriers and conveyers that carry along the Spirit
with them: John 6. 36. <hi>The words that I ſpeak they are
ſpirit and life;</hi> being like the commands given to the
dead, <hi>Ariſe, come forth.</hi> It is a vain thing to ſpeak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandingly
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53665:145"/>
to the dead: true, had they not miniſtred
that which was commanded, it had not prevailed; and
ſuch are the Goſpel-commands of repentance, faith, and
making the new-heart: or elſe how ſhould the Goſpel-word
be called, as it is, the miniſtry of the Spirit,
2 Cor. 3. 8. <hi>The miniſtery of the Spirit is Glorious.</hi> So
much for the removing of theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </label> We ſhall propound a queſtion, for the further han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
of this point; why ſhould theſe Goſpel-graces, and
eſpecially faith, that bring us to Chriſt, require ſuper-natural
ſtrength and drawing, for their production?
And truly there lies ſome emphaſis in this word Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-grace:
for, may ſome ſay, what do you mean by
that? I mean that grace which ſerves to the recovery
of man to the Image of God, which he had, and hath
loſt; for in this ſtate of the Image of God which we
had before we fell, there was life; but in this Goſpel
grace, by that, there is a reſurrection unto that or a better
life then we loſt before, for God intended to reſtore his
Image unto man, in Chriſt who is his Image; and this
Image is reſtored by the begetting of this Goſpel grace
that brings us to cloſe with Chriſt; ſo that this faith or
coming to Chriſt is a grace of recovery or reſurrection,
through and by which, the Image we loſt is again repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
now for theſe graces, they do require a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſtrength.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> It ſeems to me, that a man that is able out of his own
experience to make this objection, is on the borders of
believing; for when as the difficulty of faith once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
and man comes to be ſenſible, and diſtruſts his
own oppoſition, then he begins to draw near, or to be
on the threſhold of faith; he that is at a loſſe is near his
way; the water being troubled, there is no queſtion but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53665:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is cure: I but, ſaith the cripple, the Angel moves the
water, but I have no bodie to put me in; ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
invites, the Word calls, but I cannot cloſe with
Chriſt there held forth. I am a cripple, and no need
but of a hand to help me; and whereas in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. there
ſeems to be a double expreſſion concerning this point
of faith, <hi>Lord who hath believed our report, and to whom
is the arm of the Lord revealed!</hi> A man may ſay; I heard
the report, and believe it to be true, but the baring of
the Lords arme muſt go to the making of man believe,
when we teach that men naturally cannot believe: men
wonder and ſay within themſelves, why ſhould not I
believe as well as another man? I am as learned and
knowing in the Scriptures, and as pregnant as others;
and why ſhould a man of a leſſer meaſure and altitude
of parts go before me in believing? when we teach that
men cannot keep the law of works, there is never a one
but will conſent to it: truly I cannot keep the Law: I
cannot love the Lord with all my heart, and might, and
ſtrength; men yield they cannot; but when we preach
that faith is above your power, you cannot believe and
come to Chriſt, though we report the report of Chriſt
to you, that you believe not; few men that believe the
one will believe the other: they will not believe but
that they can believe, as if it were an eaſier matter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt, then to keep the law; that is, as if it were
eaſier to obey the Goſpel, then tis to obey the law, and
that therefore ſuch an omnipotent power, as this divine
drawing imports, is not neceſſary to make a ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
Now I beſeech you conſider, the Law hath
ſomething in you: for being once written in the heart
of man, there do remain ſome fragments or rubbiſh,
(if I may uſe that word, in alluſion to a building form)
but of the Goſpel there is not a line in the heart of man
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53665:146"/>
by nature, becauſe it is wholly revealed; and therefore it
is as impoſſible by a ſaving faith to believe in Chriſt
unto ſalvation, as it is for a man to keep the law; it's as
eaſy for a man to love God above ſelf, which the law
requires, as to believe in Chriſt Jeſus with ſelf denial:
for in both, ſelf goeth down; to love with all the heart
which the law requires, is as impoſſible as to believe
with all the heart, as the Goſpel requires and commands;
and therefore men are miſtaken, that think faith is in
their power, and confeſſe that obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is not.</p>

is the difference; but to riſe out of this eſtate into which
we are plunged now (for we muſt ſpeak of a recovery

us to keep the law, all is one. Suppoſe a man dead, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to a ſtate of ſalvation and Gods Image: it's all one power
that is put forth, to raiſe a man by faith in Chriſt, which
is recovering Goſpel grace, as to ſet a man in the ſtate of
perfection, which is the life of Gods Image: but indeed
this is made poſſible (as I ſaid) through grace to believe;
but to keep the law perfectly is not made poſſible to us
in this life, no not by grace. God left it under an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
called the impoſſibility of the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and
therefore as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of that faith that is
wrought in thoſe that ſhall be ſaved: it is wrought by
an exceeding hyperbole of power, 1 <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 18. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

uſes ſuch a weight of words; the exceeding greatneſs
of his mighty power in them that do believe according
to the power that was exerciſed in Chriſt, when God
raiſed him from the dead: now Chriſt was perfectly
dead, and lay under the weight of the ſinnes of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and therefore the power that raiſed him up was
omnipotent; and is not this power exemplified in raiſing
you to faith which is a recovering grace; except men be
pleaſed to deny that man is not ſo dead as Chriſt was,
that he hath ſome degree of ſpiritual life, though Chriſt
had no degree of natural life; for then he had not been
dead, as neither we, if it be ſo; and I know not why they
ſhould deny the ſame omnipotent power, to raiſe them
from being dead in ſinnes to come to Chriſt; for to deny
the greatneſs of the power, is to deny the degree of the
death; and therefore I think it to be a good reaſon for
the concluſion of this digreſſion, from the privation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I reply, that in Scripture, eſpecially our Saviours
doctrine, the reaſon of believing, and not believing,
ſeems to lie very high and out of ſight; (as they ſay of
the head of <hi>Nilus</hi>) mark and take no offence, but let
your Reaſon ſtoop to God and his Word) <hi>you believe
not, becauſe you are not of my ſheep, John 10. 26. as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

to eternal life were the original or cauſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. But we ſhall look only into man
himſelf, in whom there is reaſon enough for his unbelief:
<hi>how can you believe, that receive honour one of another?
John</hi> 5. 40. there are ſo many reaſons for unbelief
as there are maſter ſins, for every maſter ſin, as it brings
the ſoul under great guilt; ſo it hinders the ſoul from
coming to Chriſt Jeſus: but then what reaſon in man
can there be given for his faith in Chriſt? We ſee many
ſimple men the Scripture calls them babes, believe,
learned men, do not. We have read of a thouſand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
at the firſt <hi>Sermon</hi> they heard, as at <hi>Peters</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
And again, many hear a thouſand Sermons, and
yet are not believers. In ſhort, though nature and
art in their works require the ſubject they work upon
to be diſpoſed and fitted with capacity, elſe the work
is hindred; (therefore the ſun hardens and ſoftens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the temper of the ſubject on which it works;)
but God that works this faith, if he do not find a ſubject
prepared (as indeed he doth not) he can make or create
faith in moſt indiſpoſed ſubjects; for Creation requires
not ſo much as matter to work on, but works out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

the point.</p>
            <p>Faith in Chriſt, as it is a duty in reſpect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God; ſo it is a principle of new life, in order
to the recovery of the ſtate of Gods Image: Now
let the conſideration of faith, as 'tis a duty, paſſe, and
conſider it, as 'tis a principle, ſeed, and root of ſpiritual
life, whereby we live unto, or with God; and then tell
me in a ſober judgment, whether nature can plant a
ſupernatural principle: (For plantation of principles the
ſtrength muſt be ſupernatural:) whether a ſupernatural
principle is likely to be planted by the power of nature;
I think there are but few that will affirm it: Formes
naturally begotten by generation are educed (as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers

a ſupernatural principle be educed by the power of the
matter? No, they riſe meerly out of nothing. I do
not diſcuſs now, whether every duty of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

but whether the principles themſelves, the habitual

for me to ſpeak it) ſhall we by our natural being,
confeſſedly be the creatures of God, and deny our
ſelves as new creatures, in regard of our ſpiritual being,
to be of God: there are but two places of Scripture
whereby I prove all this that I have recited, <hi>John</hi> 1. 13.
<hi>all believers are born</hi> (via<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a plain denial of the will of man, to be a concurrent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or cauſe in the work of regeneration: he denies
three things that natural generation hath dependance
on, and affirms one; <hi>not of blood</hi> as natural generation,
<hi>nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God:</hi>
This ſpiritual birth is left to be of God, and his will; and
mark, it is denied to be of the darling mans will: <hi>Deut.</hi>
29 4. <hi>you have ſeen great ſignes and wonders</hi> (that one

the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes

one would have thought ſhould have wrought faith in
the heart of man: But the reaſon why they had not
a jot of faith wrought in them for ſo long a time, was;
becauſe God had not given them eyes to ſee: ſo that
the natural light of man is not that, wherein faith is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
man may ſee and not ſee: ſee and wonder; but
not ſee and believe: a clear atteſtation that he muſt ſee
by Gods light; and perceive by a ſenſe given to the heart

which are four.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It makes the perſon drawn a volunteir.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Its a drawing by teaching, <hi>verſ.</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, It is ſuch as is peculiar and proper to the
elect of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is a victorious drawing, prevalent over all
reſiſtance that can be made againſt it: there is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
in the heart of natural man to grace, eſpecially to
faith, and no grace is ſo much oppoſed, tempted, belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guered,
and fought againſt by the Devil, as a mans faith;
and none that the contrariety of nature makes head, and
fights againſt, and reſiſts, by reaſon of the innate enmity
which is in it, as Faith; it makes reſiſtance, but how?
As a drop of water falling into a great fire, makes reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to the fire as a drop can do, but cannot make a
victorious reſiſtance to quench the fire, but is ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by it; ſo the reſiſtance that is made againſt the
power of God cannot be victorious, but that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God overcomes all reſiſtance and withdrawment:
My meaning is, when God engages purpoſely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally,
according to his elective purpoſe, to draw
men to Chriſt, then this power of God becomes and
appears to be victorious; then let <hi>Oneſimus</hi> run from
his Maſter to <hi>Rome,</hi> God will find him in a priſon there,
and convert him; let <hi>Naaman</hi> be in <hi>Syria,</hi> let the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of <hi>Sarepta</hi> be in a City of <hi>Sidon,</hi> that is, (as Chriſt
means) out of all high ways to converſion, the power
and grace of God will find them out; I ſay, when God
intends the work: For as <hi>Iſrael</hi> is prevailed over and
kept in ſlavery, until God ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen, I have ſeen
the affliction of my people, and am come down to deliver
them;</hi> then you know the deliverance is wrought in
deſpight of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> then there was no longer keeping
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53665:149"/>
them under ſlavery: So till the time be that God hath
appointed to draw his Children of purpoſe to his Son
by an actual call, a ſinful luſtful perſon lies in ſlavery to
every ſinful luſt, every cord holds him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then he
ſhall find a door open, and the reſiſtance removed and
ſuſpended for that time. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
an <hi>Egyptian</hi> fought againſt an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> he ſlew the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
in reſcue of an <hi>Iſraelite;</hi> it was a preludium or
preſage that he ſhould deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the
whole body of them; and therefore when the body
came to be delivered forty years after this, <hi>he did it with
a mighty hand:</hi> So God victoriouſly brings out of the
ſtate of ſin ſingle ſouls, and ſlays their corruptions, as
victoriouſly as the whole Church ſhall be delivered at
laſt from the greateſt <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> death, divel, and ſin;
and therefore obſerve the ſtile uſed in the Covenant is
very peremptory, <hi>I will give; I will put;</hi> and on mans
part, <hi>They ſhall come; They ſhall know; They ſhall not
depart away from me.</hi> The reaſon of the victorious
power of grace is, that the world moves by carnal and
ſenſual objects, and ſo the Devil and Fleſh they move
objectively, their motion whereby they move from
God is but objective, propounding pleaſing or fearful
objects to the mind of man, either drawing, or alluring,
or affrighting a man from faith in Chriſt; now if Gods
moving and drawing ſhould not be more powerful and
ſtrong then the devils, the worlds, or mans own with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing,
there neither would nor could be converſion
wrought, if the drawing of man to Chriſt were not
more powerful than mans withdrawment from Chriſt;
for there nothing could be done, nor could converſion
be wrought at all: If the ſtream be equal with the Tide,
then it would be ſtanding water, the tide could not run
up, nor the ſtream run down; ſo if theſe two, the things
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53665:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that draw me to, and that withdraw me from the Lord
Jeſus, were of equal power, it would be ſtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
there could be no converſion; but now the work is
wrought, becauſe the ſtrength is too hard for the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
withdrawment; <hi>You have overcome them, little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
1 Joh. 4. 3, 4. <hi>becauſe greater is he that is in you, than
he that is in the world:</hi> For reaſon teaches, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
power is the overcoming power God doth otherwiſe
move the heart of man to believe in Chriſt, than theſe
withd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>awers can remove; for the devil or world can but
move by ſuitable objects, that are ſuitable to preſent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and therefore they move by forreign motives; for
you muſt needs confeſs, I think, that the devil frights or
draws men by objects, that is all he can do; but how
doth God move? he moves by principle; there's the
clear difference, putting another principle into the heart
of man, which ſhall wholly attend, deſire, and thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the gaining of the Lord Jeſus: you may ſee the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in this inſtance; if you throw a ſtone upwards,
it's moved by a forreign motive, a ſtrength without it;
but ſee what becomes of it, ſee how the Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
overcomes the forreign power; for it abates by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
till it comes to turn, and down it comes again
without throwing, by virtue of the principle whereby it
is moved to its own center: So it ſhall be and is, when
God plants a principle in his people that ſhall propend
to Chriſt, as the chief good, theſe forreign motives,
though they may prevail to make agitation, and ſhake
the man, yet it overcomes; and God by giving a new
heart, and bidding the ſoul with power to come to
Chriſt, it ſhall come, and overcome all objective ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions;
otherwiſe I ſay again, the power of God in
the converſion of a ſinner would be leſs than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
power that withdraws, and there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53665:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wrought; but now there is ſomewhat wrought,
and therefore the power of God is greater.</p>
            <p>This victorious drawing of God is ſeen in two things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in overcoming that which doth reſiſt and would
hinder.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Inclining or enabling the heart to chuſe or
cloſe with Chriſt, to whom God would have it come.
Both theſe are in one Text, <hi>I will take away the heart of
ſtone,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. there is the overcoming of that which
lies in the way reſiſting: <hi>And I will give a heart of fleſh;</hi>
that is, I will turn the heart into a temper contrary to
what it was, that it ſhall relliſh what it diſtaſted, and love
what it hated; becauſe there is a new appetite and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
moving the other way, that he can with as much
eaſe and propenſion move and come to Chriſt Jeſus the
Lord, as before he did from him: For whether God
come in with greater ſtrength, as the tide into a River;
or alſo that the principle within be changed, as the bias
on the other ſide the Bowl, the heart will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>un contrary
to what it did before: The power of God in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of a ſinner muſt be victorious over all contrary
power. Thus I have ſhewn that 'tis a victorious draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">

               <note place="margin">Octob. 21. </note>2. The ſecond property of this drawing of God is,
that it makes the heart-more willing for the drawing: All
that ever come to Chriſt, they come as Voluntiers, they
come willingly, they do not come as forcibly conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for conſtraint is for ſlaves: <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and 'tis true, If Religion be conſtrained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>jam nulla
eſt,</hi> then it is none: Religion cannot be compelled; there
is nothing more voluntary than that which we call Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
So I ſay of the heart of man in this point, that a
forced will (if any ſuch could be) is rather <hi>noluntas</hi> a nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
than <hi>voluntas</hi> a willing: And therefore though
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53665:150"/>
man at firſt motion, when God by his Grace revealed
doth come to make ſeizure and take hold of mans heart,
do reſiſt, and ſay as he in <hi>Mat. 21. 29. I will not; Yet
afterwards,</hi> faith the Text, <hi>he repented and went:</hi> So when
this drawing comes, then the heart of nilling is made
willing: The Scripture compounds in one mans will and
Gods power; <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy
power,</hi> Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 110. 3. The exerting of Gods power makes
a people Voluntiers: And therefore though at firſt <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
be unwilling to be delivered; when <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Commiſſion to them, they did not reliſh the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they found fault, <hi>Exod. 5. 21. Thou haſt made our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſtink before</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>we ſhall be the worſe for thee:</hi>
And <hi>Exod. 6. 9. They hearkened not unto</hi> Moſes <hi>voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their affliction and cruel bondage:</hi> Yet this <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
after they had ſeen the hand of God with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the
miracles that he wrought, and thoſe impediments were
confuted, they were willing to go out in poſt haſte; they
went out in the night, and there was not a dog that bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or moved his tongue to give interruption to their
clear paſſage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. 7. So I may allude in this point
very properly; man filled with prejudice and enmity at
firſt, when the Lord begins to call diſlikes the motion,
fights all he can to maintain ſelf; but then the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
his drawings, and his knockings, over and over
again, till his arm becomes victorious in mans conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and then being made willing, and taſting a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

whereby the heart of man can be wrought upon; and
muſt he not needs know? As a workman that knows all
the ſprings of a Watch or Lock that he hath made,
knows every way to open it, can make a key to hit eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ward, which when he hath fitted to all the ſprings,
doth eaſily open it, without breaking it open by meer
ſtrength: Such is the merciful way of God in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſometimes he breaks hard knots indeed with hard
wedges, he brings in ſtomackful ſinners with hard uſage,
but many times ſweetly and ſtrangely; now there are
two things that go to the making of the heart of man a
voluntier, or the will of man is freed by theſe two acts
of God.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt he takes off and cuts in pieces the fetters of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
wherein its bound under ſin, concluded and ſhut
up under ſin, and in captivity thereunto, dead and bound
too; ſo man is ſaid to be in bondage, becauſe until he be
freed, and plucked from his predominant pleaſing luſts,
which are the ſtrongeſt fetters of all, he cannot ſtir a
foot, or move a ſtep toward God; till theſe fetters be
taken off, every natural man is under a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
joyned with freedom of ſinning; he acts freely,
but yet neceſſarily, ſins againſt God; as a bondman
freely doth ſervice to his Maſter, but yet neceſſarily;
man is free to that particular whatever it be, but yet he
is neceſſarily under ſin; if he go even to perform holy
duties he is under ſin, in regard of the manner of the
performance of them; or to give you a more lively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53665:151"/>
the fiſh is free to ſwim on this or that ſide of the
priſon in the Pond, but yet cannot get out of the Pond;
ſo is man free enough to evil, yet neceſſary is his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to it, that he cannot ſtir; he can do nothing but
ſin againſt God, a miſerable bondage and neceſſity of
ſinning, <hi>Joh. 8. 34, 36. He that committeth ſin is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of ſin: But if the Son make you free, ye ſhall be free
indeed;</hi> where you are taught this leſſon, they that live in
ſin are in bondage to it; that this freedom from ſin is the
work of Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore till theſe fetters
this bondage be taken off from the will of man, man is
neceſſarily under the power of it, and cannot come to
Chriſt. But you may ſay, The taking off the fetters
from a dead man makes him no more free than before;
for ſtill he is dead and ſtirs not. I grant that; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God takes away the innate antipathy of
the will and heart to God, the enmity that you will not
be perſwaded is in you, and creates a ſympathy in the
heart, to cleave and come to Chriſt; and this is by plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of another principle than was in it before: And this
ſhews this drawing of God to be of God, when it is ſo
powerful as it takes off thoſe bitter ſtrong reſiſtances that
are in the heart of man; as it ſhewed the fire that <hi>Elias</hi>
called for to come from God, in that it ſwallowed up
and lickt up the water: So when the power of God thus
drawing, ſhall ſo overmaſter the rebellion and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the will of man, which it makes, and whereby it
made head againſt God before, this ſhews that it is the
power of God: But he ſides there is alſo a ſympathy
put into the heart, inclining it, as iron toucht with the
Load-ſtone hath a property of moving and ſticking to
the Load-ſtone: Theſe are natural compariſons: If you
ſee ſuch thingsin nature, will you not believe, as Chriſt
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53665:152"/>
ſaith, <hi>when they teach you heavenly things?</hi> Will you not
believe that God is able by this ſympathy in the will, to
make the heart by power willing to come to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?
by virtue of which, if the option was given to
man, what would he chuſe? what Lord would he ſerve?
what of all things in the world would he pitch his
choyce upon, if he might have it for wiſhing? Why
nothing but Chriſt, ſaith the heart: But what ſay you
to victory over enemies? to worldly greatneſs, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
proſits of this or that kind? No, nothing but
Chriſt; the heart is toucht with this Load-ſtone, and
drawn to it from its proper center; and ſo willing is
this man to be drawn, that all his prayers (as at conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
every heart is prayer-ful, and every corner ſerves
for a Chappel wherein to vent his deſires to God) are
for drawing, <hi>Cant. 1. 4. Draw me, and we will run after
thee;</hi> that God would work a further taſte and a further
inclination in him: Therefore I may well ſay, that this
drawing and this free coming may well be compounded
and ſtand together: And yet man thus drawn, as he
comes freely, ſo he comes certainly; as it's ſaid, <hi>Turn
me, and I ſhall be turned; ſave me, and I ſhall be ſaved,
Jer.</hi> 31. 18. ſpeaking of the certainty that follows this
power of God in turning or in ſaving man. That is the
ſecond property. The</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Third property of this drawing is this, That it is a
drawing teaching, or a teaching drawing, ſuch a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as is by teaching; and this appears if you compare
the Text with the verſe following, where our Saviour
produces a proof out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. to prove this draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him; <hi>Is it not ſaid in the Prophets, All thy children
ſhall be taught of God?</hi> as all the children of the viſible
Church are taught by men, ſo all thy children ſhall be
taught of God; and he proves they are drawn, becauſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53665:152"/>
they are thus taught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the opening of which point,
in a word or two. You muſt know, that the knowledg
of God, is put for all religion; all acts of grace are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated
by this word, knowing God: this is the
phraſe of the Covenant, in <hi>Jer. 31. 34. they ſhall all
know me.</hi> And that theſe are a peculiar and ſelect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that do know him; ſee how it followes in the ſame
place: <hi>for I will forgive their iniquities, and their ſins
will I remember no more:</hi> There is none to whom this
knowledg is given, but thoſe whoſe ſins are alſo pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
who are taken into favour; they that are thus forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
do all know God; (for that which you call ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
knowledg, I ſpeak not of that now.) This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
refers, to teaching, and learning; not unto mans tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
but to Gods; of whom this covenant people do
learn, and are taught: and therefore inſtead of what is
ſaid, John 6. 45. <hi>Every one that hath learned of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
It is ſaid <hi>Hebr 8. 10. they ſhall all know me, little
and great;</hi> one and other that have learned, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>to learn Chriſt:</hi> and God is ſaid (as the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
renders it) <hi>Gen. 9. 27. to perſwade</hi> Japhet <hi>into the
Tents of</hi> Sem: and all this I ſay about Gods teaching;
mans learning; God's perſwading and mans knowing of
God; to ſignifie that this work of God, upon the mind
of man, enlightning, and convincing it, doth expreſs
this drawing of God: not but that the will of man in
his converſion is moved too; for the illumination of the
mind, and the made motion of the will, are two begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of Faith in man; but if the corrupt will be only
excited and awakened; and not healed, or changed, that
doth not do the work; when the word of God excites
and calls upon you, if the will be not renewed, the work is
not done: it would be but as the pounding of ſpice;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53665:153"/>
it ſweet, it will be more ſweet; if ſtink, it will ſtink the
more: the Peſtil doth not change the ſavour of the
ſpice; but draws forth that which is, by beating and
pounding it! All excitations, if they fall on a good and
godly heart, then indeed they breathe forth grace; but
if on a cranal and a corrupt, will; then theſe excitations are
denied, and gainſayed, and contradicted: that which
plants the vital principle in the will, that is it that doth it:
but whether the underſtanding, that reſpects <hi>verum,</hi> the
truth of a thing, or the will reſpecting <hi>Bonum,</hi> the good,
neſs of a thing, for the will chuſes that which is good,
be one faculty diverſly related, or no; it doth not much
matter to this purpoſe: But this is the thing that I am
upon, that the will muſt be healed, for it was corrupted:
and though ſome ſay, the will of man did loſe nothing
by the fall, nor gain nothing by Chriſt; there was
no ſin, nor grace ſeated in it, but a meer indifferency,
and liberty, that's contrary to reaſon; for the will of
man, being a principal faculty, it is a leaſe of the new
man, as it was of the old; and therefore muſt be
not only put into motion by the underſtanding, but
reſtored to life by grace infuſed; only this I ſay, that
as the ſeeing man goes foremoſt, and leads the way to
the blind man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the underſtanding goes before, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to natural order, and by, and through it is the
will changed, and renewed, as alſo the affections are.
It's a point of great controverſie, though perhaps it is
little ſeen to what it tends: <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Be ye tranformed
by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove, or approve
what is, the good, acceptable, and well-pleaſing will of God:</hi>
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye renewed in your mind, that you may prove, that
is, that you may accept the will of God: that you may
be pleaſed, and make choice to obey it; where it is plain,
that the action of the will, followes the renewing and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53665:153"/>
tranſlation of the mind: there muſt be a ſeeing of Chriſt,
and then a coming to him; for in <hi>Joh. 6 40. this is the
will of God, that he that ſeeth the Sonne, and believeth on him
ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> mark the order,
he doth not mean an <hi>ocular</hi> ſenſible ſeeing; but he that
by the underſtanding ſees the beautie, and neceſſity of
Chriſt, and then believes in him; there is an act of the
will that followes knowledg. And this is the light of
God; that he ſets up in dark minds, that when the Lord
finds you a fooliſh and ignorant people, not able to
diſcern the great things of God, he lights a candle in
your minds; he teaches you by the teachings of God;
by ſuch a powerful teaching, as draws the heart after it,
that it delights; and makes choice of the Lord Jeſus; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things, this is the light, by which the will is led
and converted, that hath in it ſuch convincing clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſo full and powerful a dictate it gives forth,
hath ſome what in it, that I confeſs I am not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain;
being a light ſhined into the heart by God; that it
carries all with it; and the will cannot ſtay behind this
convincing light, this fixed dictate of the mind, this
light and teaching of God: <hi>No more then</hi> (I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in another thing, whereof I can give no reaſon
neither) Eliſha <hi>could ſtay behind, when</hi> Eliah <hi>had caſt his
mantle on him,</hi> 1 Kings 19. theſe workings of God in
the hearts of men; convincing by light, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
gainſay nor reſiſt, theſe are things that the world
know not; and man cannot explain till he have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
no more then a man that hath eyes can explain
green, red, and yellow, to a blind man: the Apoſtle
ſpeaks peremptorily in this point: 2 Co. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. <hi>we can
do nothing againſt the truth, but for it:</hi> ſo powerful and
great a work is this of God when he will draw the heart
unto him: yea, when the converſation is never ſo bad
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53665:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and contrary; as ſometimes you have ſeen a great aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
in the woman to have ſuch an husband, who is
afterward purſued with as violent a deſire that cannot be
denied, without hazard of her life: ſo is it in cloſing
with Chriſt, though a man have as great a defiance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, as <hi>Paul</hi> had, and there be an averſion to him
and his rule; yet after the Lord hath dealt with ſuch a
mans heart: Oh! the violent affections, the raviſhments
that are wrought in the heart of this man to Chriſt;
even ſuch as if there had never been ſuch averſernes
before. There are two things that render this tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
a drawing-teaching.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the mind be convictively taught, that to
be acquainted with God, and in covenant with him, to
have God for ones portion and great reward; is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
good imaginable, either in this, or the next world;
that nothing in all the world is comparable unto it;
this, which no wiſdom of man could ever find out, God
himſelf teaches, and Gods people acknowledg it: many
will ſay, who will ſhew us any good? when ſhall we be
ſo happy, as that we ſhall have no ſorrow with it: <hi>Lord
lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us,</hi> Pſal. 4 6.
And in <hi>Pſal. 73. 25. whom have I in heaven but thee, and
there is none an earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee.</hi>
A ſpark leaping from the bodie of the fire dies preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but lives in its element: a twig cut off from the tree
will be dead before tomorrow morning; but ſticking
to the tree it flouriſhes. Such is man, ſeparated from
the favour and fruition of God, as all men in the ſtate
of nature are, dead, and miſerable; but adhering to,
coming acquainted with God is happie; for this is the
property of the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> that without the having
of other goods, it makes man happie; that is, the chief
good, that eminently contains all other goods in it; other
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53665:154"/>
things that are good, are not the chief good. Why?
becauſe the whole confluence of them (if altogether)
would not make a man happy; as a heavy body, as high
as the moon, will not reſt, but move to its center, and
there it is quiet: ſo let God be a mans portion; though
he hath no ſhare in the world, he is happy and at reſt.
Now let God reach this convictively, and he teaches
drawingly: Let this be the dictate of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
unvariable, unſhaken; that this is your chief good,
and it drawes all the ſoul after it, and not a hoof is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the mind alſo be convictively taught,
and inlightned, what is the only means to attain this
chief good; that is, God for a portion, and exceeding
great reward: there is but one means, one ladder of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> one way in the world to attain it; and that is the
knowledg of Chriſt, for out of Chriſt God is, as I may
ſay, an abſolute God, with whom I can have nothing
to doe: a conſuming fire, from whom man, a ſinner;
through guilt as <hi>Adam</hi> did at firſt, will fly away if he
can. God in the law, curſes, and condemns me; that
ſhewes that from an abſolute God a man will run, if
he can get away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore, as my text faith; that
no man comes to Chriſt, but by Gods drawing: ſo he
that couples, and brings me to God, to an adherence,
and injoyment of this chief good, muſt be Chriſt; the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
teaches him ſo to you; he teaches himſelf, to be the
way, the truth, and the life; that as the life is but one, ſo
the truth, and the way is but one, <hi>No man comes to the
Father, but by him,</hi> John 14. 6. and therefore, as one
chiefeſt good conſiſts in knowing God; ſo the only
mean, to know God is by Chriſt; to know Chriſt by
faith ſavingly: <hi>John 17. 3. This is life eternal, to know
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53665:155"/>
haſt ſent, Chriſt Jeſus; the Mediator; the mean to it:
Let this be taught to man, ſo as to control, and bear
down all carnal reaſonings; and there needs no other
drawing: for the will of man is neceſſarily carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
its chiefeſt good; it cannot but gratefully turn to it:
by this means which is the only means thereof, and ſo
farewel all remiſneſs, indifferency, and lukewarmneſs
when this conviction takes place; then ſaith the ſoul,
I will come I will ſeek thy face O God; for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
by its ultimate dictate (a point in the Schools,
diſputed) fixing this concluſion to the will of man:
that it's the beſt choice that can be made, to come to
God, and it's the only means to come by Chriſt: this
cannot be refuſed by the heart, this is the drawing-tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
or the teaching-drawing.</p>

Wreſtlings: So I may ſay, of this phraſe; the teaching

Chriſt is the only mean tending thereunto: yet mark;
when it comes to particulars; that is (as the Schoolmen
ſay) to <hi>Hic &amp; nunc in hypotheſi:</hi> to this time, and place;
when beloved ſins, and pleaſures and profits, riſe up in

it is not fixt, and clear, and reſolved againſt all other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings;
as I will give a clear inſtance. <hi>Eve</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that God had ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall not eat of the tree of
knowledg of good and evil.</hi> Here was a conviction in
the general: but when ſhe ſaw, that the tree was good
for food; the fruit pleaſant to the eye, and to be deſired:
then the general conviction gives place to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

and the affections againſt all contrary motives,

            <p>Laſtly, This drawing of God, is peculiar to ſome

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53665:156"/>
we call the elect, do come to Chriſt: theſe are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of this drawing of God, it is victorious, makes
man a volunteer; is a drawing, teaching; is peculiar to
the called, according to Gods purpoſe. The</p>
            <p>Second thing followes; How a man ſhall know, that
he is, or hath been drawn to Chriſt, by God the Father:
for as there are many things, whereof women have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that counterfeit impregnation, which is not ſo.
So there may be ſuch appearings of believing in a man,
as give but an uncertain, or falſ evidence thereof: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
you need know ſome certain evidences, that you
are drawn to God, for your comfort. And</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you be come, then you have been drawn:
this ſtands upon the evidence of the text; the effect
ſhewes the cauſe; <hi>for no man can come, except the father
drawes.</hi> If the wall ſhine, you may conclude, the ſunne
is up, and ſhines upon it; for it would give no light of it
ſelf, but by reflection; if you find in your hearts, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
receiving of Chriſt Jeſus, for your Saviour, and
Lord, that you have ſurrendred, and made a deed of gift
of your ſelves, to the Lord Jeſus to be his: certainly
you have been drawn by God; this light hath ſhined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, otherwiſe you could not reflect it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is thy faith an inchriſting, that is, a Chriſt
receiving faith? is it a marriage faith? I call that a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
faith, which accepts of the perſon of Chriſt, a
Saviour, and Lord; which ſome call, the faith of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
whereby you do not only believe, for benefits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him; but for the benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s with him: there is a faith in
formal hypocrites; and ſuch as the very ſound of the
word begets; as we ſee in all, or the generallity of us
here in <hi>England,</hi> that live under the ſound of the word
of the Goſpel; a kind of faith and opinion begotten in
all men of Chriſt; by a general, and uncontrolled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53665:157"/>
as thoſe that did believe, <hi>when they ſaw the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
that he did: but he did not commit himſelf to them,</hi>
John 2. 24. But that which is called <hi>the faith of Gods
Elect,</hi> in <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 1. that's not found in any, but they
that are thus drawn; and is that which he works in man,
in purſuance of his purpoſe of election; making good
the reſt of the links of the chain, after the firſt; namely,
effectual calling, and Juſtification, and Sanctification;
which every faith, or believing, doth not doe; every
faith you find in men is not in purſuance of this drawing
of God, as I have deſcribed it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When we can willingly ſubſcribe to the
courſe that God hath taken to ſave our ſouls: (which
the moſt of men do not:) now the courſe that he hath
taken, is in another, not in our ſelves: it is in Chriſt, by
whom God doth juſtifie, reconcile, adopt, ſanctifie, and
govern, all in Chriſt. A ſanctified heart, ſubmitting to
this courſe of God, is a ſign that God hath drawn
you, and given you ſome taſte of Chriſt Jeſus: and is
your faith ſuch a believing, yea, or no? then certainly
by the victoriouſneſs; of it, to bring you to this paſs, it
appears to be the teaching of God; as it is delivered
in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. It is powerful to bring every
<hi>thought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt:</hi> For man
naturally, and of himſelf, thinks very meanly of this
way, and means, of ſaving men by Chriſt; for ſo it was,
in the type at firſt: <hi>Iſrael</hi> thought very meanly of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
when he came into <hi>Egypt;</hi> one that ſeemed an unlikely
inſtrument to cope with <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and ſuch potent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments:
And therefore, the Jew hold faſt his own
righteouſneſs, and would not ſubmit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. And
mans pride makes greateſt head and reſiſtance againſt
this way of Salvation, that may be; until it appear, that
there muſt be no Salve or Chirurgerie to apply to the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53665:157"/>
ſting of fierie Serpents, on pain of death: but that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
way, of looking up to the brazen Serpent on the
pole; for he that uſed his own medicine periſhed, and
died. So when a man is convinced, that there is no
ſalve of his own making, no medicine of his
own applying will ſerve the turn; for a man may
die under his medicine, as well as under his ſinne,
if he do not fly to this only remedy, to look up
by faith to Chriſt Jeſus: When he is convinc'd of this,
he will ſubſcribe, and give up his hand to God the Lord,
as it's ſaid; and this ſubmiſſion doth ſtand in three
things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In a contented loſſe of that, which was his
gain; for every man hath ſomewhat to lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> upon, that
he may not lie open to the arrowes of the fiery law of
God, and his own conſcience; therefore ſome g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in
he will have to ſhelter him: and therefore, when he
can willingly eſteem all thoſe excellencies, dung, and
droſs, and adventure to make himſelf empty, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that he may be found in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Phil</hi> 3. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.
This is a ſign of ſubmitting to God; as the ſtorm makes
the Merchant at Sea to ſubmit: he loves his goods; but
the danger of his life, which the ſtorm puts him into,
makes him heave them all over board. It's good when
a man is willing to be a loſer of his proud ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,
or his beloved ſins, to gain Chriſt; for theſe are
our hardeſt loſſes; and to make Chriſt Jeſus our gain,
anſwerable, and valuable to, and with, all our loſſes: A
hard point; but 'tis a point of ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In a willing ſubmiſſion to the conduct of
Chriſt: as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if they will go out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they muſt
ſubmit to the conduct of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and go which way he
will lead them; for not the ſhorteſt, but the ſafeſt way
God leads them; wherein he will ſhew them wonders,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53665:158"/>
further miracles then he had ſhewn in <hi>Egypt:</hi> ſo this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to the conduct of Chriſt, in the wilderneſs that
he leads you through, where the croſs, the loſs may
make you more miſerable for Religion, for Chriſt, then
other men in the world are, as the Apoſtle ſaith; the
confeſſion of Chriſt makes us miſerable men in the
world; miſerable for religions ſake, which we might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
if we would ſhun religions; if this can be digeſted by
you, and there be a ſweetning of ſowre morſels by the
name of Chriſt: it argues well.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In a cordial ſubmiſſion to Chriſt his wayes;
eſpecially when they are quarreld by fleſh and blood.
Some men are ſo bold, as to account them fooliſh;
others as unreaſonable: moſt of us do account them
hard, and that we ſhall be contrary to other mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
or reaſons, or principles; and therefore it is a
hard thing, to ſubmit to the waies of God, without
conſulting with fleſh and blood; ſo as though reaſons
taken from religion are the ſtrongeſt with us in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
or conſultation; yet there is a propenſion in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to follow the guidance of our own reaſon, until
the Load-ſtone have toucht the Iron; and cauſed it to
look to the North point (as you uſe to ſay) till the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of God have taken place in our hearts, to draw them
to Chriſt Jeſus; then there is a ſubmiſſion to Chriſt for
righteouſneſs, and to thoſe waies and Commandements,
that he injoines us; be they never ſo hard and untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, When we find that God will not let us
alone in our diſtance, in our peace, in our eaſe, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of the pleaſures and profits of ſin: that is a ſad and
miſerable word, if ſpoken by God, <hi>Let them alone,</hi> Hoſ.
4. 17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> When
God finds a man joyned to his beloved luſts, as <hi>Ephraim</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:53665:158"/>
and the tenne tribes were joyned to the Idols that
<hi>Jerobeam</hi> had ſet up, to keep them from the temple, and
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> leſt they ſhould ſoduer, and ſement again:
oh! miſerable, when God ſaies, let a man alone in his
waies; when a mans intereſt lies in maintaining, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of his beloved ſins: <hi>So I gave them up to their own
hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels,</hi> Pſal. 81.
12. It is a ſinne, and a puniſhment, to be given up to the
luſts of a mans own heart, and to walk in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels:
men that are thus given up, the Lord hath puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
them ſufficiently; men that are awakened and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
of their peace, and courſe; that find themſelves
diſquieted from their dangerous waies, the pillow of
Sathan, on which they ſlept ſecurely: how often do they
miſtake God, and think that God doth it out of hatred
to them, when you ſee plainly that it is in mercy: they are
cauſed to tremble, and to be troubled, that they may
have peace; wounded that they may be healed: the Lord
doth as he ſaith in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 6. Find your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in that Text: <hi>I will make a hedg of thornes about
them, and they ſhall not find their path; then they ſhall ſay,
I will return to my firſt husband; for it was better with me
then, then now.</hi> God moves man by a kind of ſelf-love:
if a man find it better with him when he is with God,
then he was before: Oh! ſaith he; I will return to my
true husband; for I am diſquieted in this way of ſinne:
this ſeems to be the way of God; as the ſhepherd lets
looſe his dog; not upon his ſheep to worry them, but
upon the ſtray ſheep to bring it in again: ſo God lets looſe
ſome temptations, inward diſquietments, on the ſtray
ſheep, to this end, that, he may bring him in to his fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again, that he may be ſaved. And as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when his
Brethren came into <hi>Egypt</hi> for Corn, ſpake roughly to
them, and clapt them into priſon; becauſe he intended to

bring them and himſelf into better acquaintance; ſuch is
the way of God in converſion: the Lord Jeſus out of
love diſquiets the waters; and though he doth not uſe
other men ſo, yet thoſe that are his, he frowns upon, and
lets looſe temptations upon them, that he may bring
them in: when God will not let a man alone, in a ſtate of
diſtance, under ſinful peace, it is a good ſign, as its ſaid
in <hi>Deut. 8. 15, 16. God led thee through the terrible wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse,
wherein were fierie ſerpents, he fed thee alſo with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
he mixed mercy with ſorrows, <hi>manna</hi> with fiery
Serpents; mark to what purpoſe, that he might prove
thee, and humble thee, to do thee good at thy latter end:
here you ſee his manner of dealing, he leads through the
wilderneſs to do his people good; and ſo many as are
thus at firſt converſion aſſaulted, and buffeted by Sathan,

the prodigal was by famine out of the farre country,

may withdraw man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from
man:</hi> man being pitcht and reſolved on ſome way of ſin,
in defiance to God, and the loſſe of his ſoul, God will
withdraw him from his work, and hide pride from man:

be but a drop on the Rods end, as <hi>Jonathans</hi> was, to

the one drives, the other draws; that's the fourth mark

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Serm. </seg>31</label> Fifthly, We may know by our faith, whether we
were drawn by God; for if that be ſaving and unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
faith, it is of his drawing; if ſuperficial and dead, ſuch
as that doth not own ſuch an author; for God never
marries his Son to a dead ſoul, nor to a dead faith,
until there be a quickning: neither would Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himſelf to ſuch believers, <hi>John</hi> 2. 24. as he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
were hollow, and falſ-hearted, and did not receive
him in love. There is a faith in temporaries, hypocrites,
and common Chriſtians; which is not wrought by ſuch
power as Chriſt was raiſed by: as the Apoſtle tells
the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> Chap. 1. 18, Their faith, was wrought by
the ſame power that God put forth in Chriſt, when
he raiſed him from the dead: But as eaſily as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, begets
credit in the reader, without any divine motion: So
the report of the Goſpel begers a faith, which doth ariſe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53665:160"/>
by the calling of the word; not by that which is a calling
according to Gods purpoſe: but the faith whereby we
are drawn to Chriſt hath (as I may ſay) two faces (I
crave pardon for the word) it looks backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
to election, as a ſign of that; to ſalvation as the
cauſe of that: its a fruit or effect of our election, and a
certain means of our ſalvation; it bears upon it the
mark of them both; it alwaies purifies the heart wherein
it is; being never found in an unregenerate, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
heart. It makes the tree good, and then the
fruit. It makes the tree good, there is an alteration in the
man. And then the fruit good; there is the product
that it brings forth. It makes the flax ſmoak at leaſt,
though it be it ſelf never ſo little a ſpark, and unſeen: if
you have ſuch a kind of faith, without all queſtion you
have been drawn of God; for there is a double change
that faith makes, that ſhewes the truth of it.</p>

            <p>Secondly, There is a real change of heart, of courſe
of life; as if the ſtream did run in a new channel, with

all the things of this life, have an eclipſe put upon them;

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, God hath powerfully drawn thee to Chriſt,
if the knowledg of Chriſt do draw thee from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitioning
things beſides: Chriſt doth not woo in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but by his word, his Spirit, his virtue: haſt thou no
favourite luſt, that can overdraw him; that dares to ſtand
in competition with thy ſervice, and the conduct of the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53665:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord Jeſus? Is the promiſe of Chriſt more powerful
with thy heart than the performance of the world? his
abſent glory above the preſent inducements? Art thou
willing to be paid for thy ſervice in ſpirituals, and (if
God will) to forbear temporals? An admirable temper
in a Chriſtian. The Apoſtle obſerves of <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his ſeed, that came out of their own country, and found
themſelves not to be in the poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>they might have returned if they would,</hi>
Heb. 11. 15. but that they would not do, they embraced
the promiſes that they ſaw afar off; they took Gods pay
as he would pay it; though he would pay them nothing
in this world, they would take out the earthly Country
in a heavenly; and then it follows in <hi>ver. 16. God was
not aſhamed to be called their God;</hi> not aſhamed of ſuch a
people as ſtick to him: This is to live upon his word as
<hi>Elſhaddi,</hi> though he be not known to them by his Name
<hi>Jehovah:</hi> I did not perform my promiſes in being to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> but he lived upon me as God Almighty, as
it's explained in <hi>Rom</hi> 4. It's never known what value
and price a man ſets upon Chriſt, by ſaying nay to ſome
ſlight luſt, or thing which he can eaſily part with; but by
that which is <hi>peccatum in deliciis,</hi> our favourite ſin, our
delight, be it friend, or worldly content, or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
elſe it's known to be; as the uſual old ſaying is, The
Rabbits skin ſticks at the head; it caſes off from the reſt
of the body, eaſily, but when it comes to the head there
it ſticks: when God and his favour, and our own ſin
ſtand in competition, it ſticks not till it is come to that to
which he is married, to his favourite: When Chriſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the young man that had ſpoken great things, he doth
not inſtance to bid him do this or that; <hi>for theſe things</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>I have done;</hi> but he demandeth the ſale of his

there his heart was ſorrowful; for the Text ſaith, <hi>He had

the withdrawments of Chriſt, or of the Spirit, or the
light of Gods countenance do draw us more to ſeeking
and purſuit; this is a drawing by withdrawment,
its the caſe of many a ſoul; many times Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws,
ſtands behind the door, Gods countenance is
hidden; well, mark the effect and uſe of this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing;
doth it draw you more eagerly out in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?
doth this draw you to a more ſharp and vehement
ſeeking? that ſhews ſome touch of the Load ſtone hath

1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 3. as an Angler will ſometimes pull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

theſe withdrawments of God from his own people; you

<hi>My beloved had withdrawn himſelf, I ſought him;</hi> She

            <p>8. Laſtly, When the Name of Chriſt, and the
Grace from him and by him received is the ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
againſt ſin, the ſtrongeſt motive of duty and

the grace and Mercy of God is the ſweeteſt obligation;

Fornication, <hi>Shall I take the members of Chriſt, and make

and all the members of his body, are the members
of Chriſt; ſhall I proſtitute the members of Chriſt to

Argument that can be againſt ſin with a godlyman:
A Chriſtian hath more Arguments againſt ſin, more
Motives to obedience than any other man, becauſe he is
all, Chriſts, and <hi>all his members</hi> (as that Text ſaith) <hi>are
members of Chriſt:</hi> he is not his own, but the price of
anothers blood; and therefore let him carry the Name
of Chriſt always in his mind, as an excellent Argument
againſt ſin: So much for the Point, Whoſoever comes

ſaith, <hi>far off;</hi> nay, 'tis as certain as the reſurrection of
Chriſt, when he was dead in the grave, and lay under
the ſins of mankind, a terrible great ſtone to ly under,
yet he was certain to riſe again the third day; and the
power toward the raiſing of thoſe that believe is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the working of the mighty power that wrought
in Chriſt; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 18 now it's ſaid, that <hi>God looſed the
cords of Chriſts death, becauſe it was not poſsible that he
ſhould be holden of it;</hi> Acts 2. 24. ſo ſhall the cords of thy
ſpiritual death be looſed alſo, if you belong to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53665:162"/>
on of grace, though you be as dead and inanimate as
Chriſt himſelf was, this will ſet you free, knock off the
fetters of bondage from you, and all becauſe there is a
drawing of God, whereby you ſhall be made able to
come; for <hi>all that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me,
Joh.</hi> 6. 37. and Chriſt profeſſes that he hath the power
given him, <hi>that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as
God hath given him,</hi> John 17. 2. And that this is no bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
for deſperate ſecurity, to flatter it ſelf, and hang all
on that ſtring, If I ſhall be ſaved, I ſhall, appears by the
certain means that are uſed whereby this end ſhall be
effected, whereby all that are within this chain ſhall
come and believe; <hi>Joh. 17. 6. I have manifeſted thy Name
to them that thou gaveſt me;</hi> ſo then, ſay not, You ſhall
be ſaved you know not how; for the Name of Chriſt
ſhall be manifeſted to you; and then he ſhews that the
means uſed are effectual in and unto ſuch, <hi>ver. 8. I have
given them that thou gaveſt me thy word; and they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, and beleived in me, that thou haſt ſent me:</hi> them
that thou haſt given me ſhall live; unto them I have
manifeſted the means, and to them they have been effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual;
theſe are the perſons that are ſaved and called in
time, according to a purpoſe and grace given them in
Chriſt before the world began, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is certainly effected.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> Secondly, The people of God do receive grace from
God even before they believe in Chriſt; Firſt, in order
to nature; but I ſpeak not of the minute of time. What?
grace (may ſome ſay) before Faith? what grace is that?
I Anſwer, It is a grace to believe, a grace drawing them
and calling them unto Faith; this is the firſt work, this
is the motion whereby Faith is begotten in the heart, a
motion which Faith doth not go before, but follow:
Man doth not begin the work of his own grace; for
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53665:162"/>
then he ſhould be the firſt give; but <hi>who hath given to him
firſt,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5. For, as learned men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
Faith is given to unbelievers, as 'tis ſaid <hi>God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the ungodly,</hi> Rom 4. 5. true, when he is juſtified he is
ungodly; therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 5. Even when we
were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins he quickens us. When we
lay in our blood,</hi> Ezek. 16. 6. <hi>he paſſed by and ſaid, Live.</hi>
When did he ſpeak the word? When we were unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
he drew us to come unto and believe in Chriſt;
as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>When we were under the fig-tree</hi> (as
I may ſay) <hi>he ſaw us:</hi> So when you were far diſtant,
this eye and countenance of God was upon you for
good: and therefore as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, The will of man
doth forego many good works of man, (for God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at the will) but not all: Why, which is it that the
will of man rectified doth not go before? Not it ſelf;
it doth not begin its own willing; for that is firſt, and
that is made of God: So I may ſay, Faith goes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the workings of God, becauſe there is a drawing
of God that works it; as the putting of life into <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
was when he was dead in the grave, ſo the firſt grace
that's given to man is while is in unbelief; that grace is
to be expected and lookt for with intention and bent of
mind from this good and gracious God; and therefore
as it would have been a diſparagement to the Miracle to
have ſaid, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſtirred or breathed before Chriſt
ſaid <hi>Come forth;</hi> ſo all they do extenuate and leſſen the
drawing and free grace of God, that put ſomething,
ſome ſeed of faith into man before God work firſt:
For man doth not firſt come to Chriſt, and then God
draw him; that's like the mothers jeſt with her child
that's down, <hi>Come to me, and I'le help thee up;</hi> for then it
muſt up before: ſo 'tis as if we jeſted, Riſe, ſtir, move
your ſelves, &amp; then I'le put life into you, but God draws,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53665:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and then man comes, as the Text ſaith. But then there
is a great queſtion that hath not yet been handled; for
ſome may object,</p>

               </label> There may be ſome reaſon given why God gives the

of God: God made the Creatures of nothing, he made
the world ſo; well, you acknowledg it: Doth God
make temporal creatures, the bodies of men, of nothing?
And is not the new creature made of as little as the old
is? But to free you from all quarrels and ſelf-reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this point, if you will have a reaſon, Il'e give you
an old one, I'le aſſure you that it is elder than your
ſelves by ſome thouſands of years; <hi>It was,</hi> ſaith the
Text, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. his purpoſe and grace given you in
Chriſt before the world began;</hi> and therefore you are
called and ſaved: This ſhews that no man can begin the
firſt grace; he may pretend to come unto Chriſt Jeſus
himſelf, but he muſt receive this drawing firſt, that he
may be ſaved; there is no mark upon any man
that lies in the ſtate of ſpiritual death by which
he can know himſelf to be one that ſhall receive the
firſt grace; but it's reſerved as a ſecret in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of God: but when the firſt grace is given
and man is drawn to Chriſt, then he may know
that he ſhall be ſaved, true, there is means to be uſed,
but not a mark to be known by: But ſhall I tell you
the bottom of the point: there may indeed be a ground
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53665:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the firſt grace in that ſecret-covenant that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Chriſt; for doubtleſs, ſuch a one there
is; that all the members of Chriſt, thoſe whom God hath
given him ſhall have this grace, this new heart and ſpirit,
ſhall be all drawn and learn of God, this in the general;
<hi>all that the father hath given to Chriſt ſhall come in:</hi> if I
be incloſed within that gracious covenant, that God the
Father made with the Son, I ſhall certainly be drawn;
but for any marks of the firſt grace, who theſe are, and
how to be known; they have none until they be made
the children of God; for they are by nature children of
wrath, even as others: the Lord only knowes who are
his: there are means afforded that they may come;<note place="margin">Decemb. 9. </note> but
no marks that they ſhall be drawn.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> Thirdly, Conſider what may be deduced from this
point, for the advancement of practical Godlineſs: there
is no point more copious in its uſe, for the advancement
of free grace, then this doctrine of Gods powerful
working, and drawing men to Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It ſuggeſts matter of Humility; grace is not
looſe, though it be free: there is no glorying at all left to
us in the matter of our ſalvation: all boaſting is taken
away by Gods drawing; every point thats profitable is
ſo, ſo far as it advances practical Religion; and much
of that conſiſts in an humble frame of ſpirits; for as lower
grounds are richer, and more fruitful then hill tops, that
ſee further, but are more barren: ſo a man that hath
taſted of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, may
ſee further and diſcern more in matters of notion and
ſpeculation; but the humble ſoul that hath ſeen the hand
of God working its works in it, is more fertile and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It ſuggeſts matter of thankfulneſs; for
where humility goes before, there thankfulneſs followes
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53665:164"/>
after; and according to the proportion of the one is the
other, in 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 9. That you ſhould ſhew forth the praiſe
of him that hath called you out of darkneſs into his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
light;</hi> who were before no people: when we come
to conſider, and have theſe impreſſions ſet on our ſouls,
that he calls us out of our darkneſs, for darkneſs is
ours, <hi>into his marvellous light,</hi> thankfulneſs ariſes from
this: And as light came out of darkneſs, ſo God hath
ſhined into our hearts the light of the glory of God in
the face of Jeſus Chriſt. Whence came the firſt light?
out of darkneſs, where no man could have imagined
the light to be: ſo God hath called us out of darkneſs.
And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It calls for fruitfulneſs in requital of ſogreat
a grace, fruitfulneſs is, as we may ſay of varniſh, no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of it ſelf, but ſets off, and puts a beauty upon other
colours. Fertillity is the nature of good ſoyl; and
men look for fruit from land or tree proportionable to
the coſt and labour beſtowed: ſo doth God expect fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
according to the proportion of his goodneſs; the
meditation of this grace, quickens the ingenuous heart to
obedience: when a man hath the ſence of his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he is reconciled to God by the blood of Chriſt;
and that being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life:
as 'tis <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. 10. this puts him on to a high degree of
fruitfulneſs; this manures the Tree: and therefore in
1 <hi>John 4. 19. We love him becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> and
5. chap. 3 verſ. <hi>It's love that makes the Commandements
not grievous:</hi> Thus you ſee how it advances practical
godlineſs.</p>
            <p>And as it advances practick godlineſs; ſo likewiſe
it heightens all the obligations, whereby a man can be
obliged to God, either to be humble, thankful, or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
they are advanced by the ſence of the free grace of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53665:164"/>
God. Now for the advancement of obligations; they
are two-fold.</p>
            <p>Such as have ſtrength of Authority in them. Or</p>
            <p>Such as have ſweetneſs and conſtraint of love in
them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, obligations of authority are by the law of God:
For that doth not ceaſe to oblige a believer being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
law, that God hath ſet on man in all ſtates and
conditions: And then the</p>
            <p>Free grace of God is an obligation by a conſtraint of
love; <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtrains us,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.
<hi>Becauſe we thus judg,</hi> or have this ſence, <hi>that if one died for
all, then all are dead:</hi> ſo that the obligation it puts upon
you is of love, and ſervice above other men. God may
well expect ſome ſingular thing of you; as namely:
firſt;</p>
            <p>Becauſe he hath drawn thee, not others, yea, haply
hath left many, for one taken; thou art one taken, drawn
out of the herd, marked out for God (as I ſaid) made to
paſſe under the rod: <hi>Vobis datum eſt, non illis;</hi> to you it is
given &amp;c. not to others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe he hath drawn us, when we
withdrew; for every man by nature doth withdraw; even
as a heifer withdrawes, and will not be yoked; ſo man
withdrawes from the yoak of God, from the doctrine,
from the faith, the love, and from the acquaintance of
Chriſt Jeſus: and therefore its ſaid in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. laſt <hi>verſ.
I have ſtretched out my hands all the day long, to a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
or withdrawing people.</hi> Nay, he not only draws
us out of darkneſs, and nothing, but purſues and followes
us when we run from him; if the Lord ſhould let men
alone: yea, if the elect of God were let alone at firſt,
when God begins to draw, they would be deſerters,
forſakers, and relinquiſh God; you ſtiff necked people,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53665:165"/>
               <hi>you do alwaies reſiſt the Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> but now God
ſtill knocks; and if man comes not at firſt; God knocks
again; and this bends mans heart to God, that the Lord
purſues him with mercy, and followes him with loving
kindneſs: if God had let him alone he had periſh'd; but
God would not let him have his will to periſh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe he hath drawn thee, <hi>no better then
others of the ſame clay,</hi> ſaith the text; the potter makes the
difference, not the clay: are we better then they, the
Jew, then the Gentile? <hi>Romans</hi> 3. 9. No, in no wiſe;
and therefore God to ſhew that there is no difference
in man, inſtances in twins that tumbled in a belly:
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9 10. Rebecca <hi>conceived by one, even</hi> Iſaac, &amp;c.
Nay, it may be thou waſt one of lower and meaner rank
from whom God could not expect ſo much ſervice:
ſo babes have it revealed, not the wiſe; <hi>Baſe things of
the world are choſen, not many noble and great:</hi> Naaman
<hi>the</hi> Syrian <hi>is cleanſed, and not many lepers in Iſrael;</hi> who
would think that <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot ſhould be named
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>James</hi> 2. 25?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Lord found thee when thou did'ſt not
ſeek him: he overcame thy oppoſition and reſiſtance, waiting
that he might be gracious,</hi> Iſaiah. 30. 18. if he had taken
thy denyal and let thee alone, if he had not overcome
the evaſions and Tergiverſations of thy ſturdy ſpirit,
by purſuing thee with freſh forces, till he had brought
every thought within thee into captivity, unto the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. had he not ſtricken thee
down (as <hi>Paul</hi> was) until he made thee ſay, <hi>Lord what
wilt thou have me to do:</hi> what might have become of thee?
had he not hedged thee in with thorns, and laid muſtard
on the breaſt, to wean thee from thy ſweet ſins.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When God hath taken this courſe, and won
over and made the heart willing, then a man accompts
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53665:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his own gain, his arguments of confidence, his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
all droſs, and dung, for the excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Chriſt Jeſus, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8. when the Lord hath
given ſuch a taſt and ſweetneſs, then a man deſires it
himſelf, and is pleaſed with that with which he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
before: when the heart is thus overcome, then
it ſubmits; he ſtands faire in his own eyes no more; his
own face pleaſes him no longer; he rebels no more, but
ſubmits to the righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Ro.</hi> 10. 3. and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
Chriſt as the greateſt treaſure in the world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
free grace is a great obligation; it binds ſtrongly
by the conſtraint of love.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I cloſe all with a motive to examination;
whether you be partakers of this drawing, now before
the Sacrament; you are called, the Lord invites you to
his table; he invites his friends, his children; theſe he calls
by the word; every ordinance breathes unto you little
elſe but Chriſt Jeſus; for all ſanctifying, ſtrengthning,
and corroborating grace; from whence come they? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Hoſea 14 8. from me is thy fruit found:</hi> all your
ſtrength ariſes from the greater and further reception of
Chriſt Jeſus; therefore examine, whether this work of
God hath been on you, to draw you to Chriſt Jeſus:
faith is not a vulgar grace, it is not an eaſie thing, it comes
from divine omnipotency and power; as we ſay of the
reſurrection, whereby a dead man riſes from the grave;
it is a work of the power of God; and therefore Chriſt
confuting the Sadduces that denied it, ſaid, <hi>you erre, not
knowing the Scriptures, and the power of God: I am</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the reſurrection and the life:</hi> No man is
alive, till he take hold of, and believe in, the Lord Jeſus?
now can a dead man be raiſed from the dead, and not
be ſenſible? do you think faith is not a ſenſible work;
yes, as 'tis a powerful work, ſo 'tis ſenſible to man; yet
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53665:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I confeſs men may be deceived, as women are by falſe
tumors and ſwellings; ſo there are many deluſions,
whereby a man may take himſelf to be in a ſtate of
grace, when he is not; becauſe there is a falſe faith as
well as a true: it is the point of examination preſſed by
St <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. becauſe of ſuch moment,
examine your ſelves, whether you be in the faith; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chriſt be in you; many think of a Chriſt without
them; you are all glad to know that Chriſt gave himſelf
for you; that he gave himſelf to be the blood of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but is he yours by the blood of ſprinkling? the
Scripture puts this to the trial, by words that intimate
Chriſt within men, <hi>Galath. 4. 19. my little children of
whom I travel in pain, till Chriſt be formed in you:</hi> and
<hi>Epheſ. 3. 17. Chriſt dwels in our hearts by faith:</hi> Gal. 2. 20:
<hi>Chriſt liveth in me:</hi> theſe phraſes do difference the Jew
outwardly, from the Jew inwardly, and teach in like
proportion; that he is not a Jew that hath the outward
character, <hi>and not the circumciſion of the Spirit,</hi> Ro 2 28.
and let that obligation ſit on you; in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.
<hi>Let every one that names the name of Chriſt depart from
iniquity;</hi> for elſe its not the ſacraments will ſerve turne,
in 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 4, 5. they eat of the ſame ſpiritual meat</hi>
(with us:) <hi>But God was not well pleaſed with them; they
were wicked:</hi> and therefore examine your ſelves, what
work of God you have found upon your hearts; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you are renewed by the Holy-Ghoſt: in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.
<hi>God is ſaid to ſave man by the waſhing of regeneration,</hi> v. 6.
<hi>that being juſtified by his grace you might be made heirs of
eternal life.</hi> To move you, conſider;</p>

they did, or poſſibly might know God, by the foot-ſteps
that he had left of himſelf in the Creation, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

to no more than of his Being or Properties, not of his
Worſhip, eſpecially that which you call poſitive; and

As for them that aſſert the Sun and Moon to be

I may joyn them together with that Philoſopher who

it is granted, <hi>cap. 3. ver.</hi> 1. that <hi>much every way is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

ver. 25. but if, as we ſay of ſome Planets, their great
light be joyned with ill Aſpects and irregular motion;

becauſe God meaſures not men by their external ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments,

of heart and mortification of luſt; the one of theſe is in
the letter, the other in the ſpirit. What is the meaning
of this phraſe? How comes this word, not, in the letter
to ſignifie outwardneſs in oppoſition to Spirit or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
grace: ſo it ſignifies in the new teſtament, or in
Scripture; and I think peculiarly <gap reason="foreign">

not written with Ink, but by or with the Spirit; and ſo
the Scripture that knowes another writing, <hi>viz.</hi> by the
Spirit in the heart doth fitly oppoſe thereunto that other
manner of delineation which is outward by pen or
pencil, and ſo circumciſion by a mark in the fleſh is ſaid
to be in the letter; not that the Apoſtle decries the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the Jewes, or their profeſſion <hi>in ſenſu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,</hi>
but only <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> when the form goes
without the power for even Chriſtianity, which is not
ſo outward in all reſpects as Judaiſme was, hath a form
of doctrine, a form of worſhip, or elſe no ſacraments,

knowledg of Chriſt valued himſelf at a great rate by
thoſe things that were but outwardly, as a viſible

                  </gap> or the circumciſion of the heart, the power and
purity of Godlineſs within, hath the commendation of,
and acceptance with God: I ſhall need ſay no more,
for the general opening of theſe words; only before

leſs or more expect of theirs; the law given them for a
Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt, what did it teach them, but
works of their own righteouſneſs (as the Apoſtle calls

School-maſter of works againſt Chriſt: and though
they found out a Meſſiah for their glory, yet they looked
not for ſuch an one as ſhould be God-man, a mediator to

ſpoken of women there, that are moſt affected with the
outward dreſs; the life of your bodies doth not begin
in the legs, but in ſome of the vitals, the heart, the liver,
the brain, and as it begins there, ſo it rules and governs
there; that motion is but violent that comes from a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

are outward, if they be not actuated by ſome inward

faith he, <hi>is of the Jewes,</hi> and ſo I might ſpeak, and follow it
profitably, that ſuch is our profeſſion above the Papiſt.
But I am ſpeaking now of the Jew outward and inward:
the Jew reckoned himſelf a Jew by his deſcent from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and by his profeſſion of that religion eſtabliſht
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereof he had not the power: and pray what

traditional ſtorie from our Anceſtors; or taken up from
common report milkt into you, when you ſuckt the
breaſts, by cuſtome and education, without any work of
the Goſpel on your hearts. Can you ſay, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-miniſtry
hath wrought faith in me? (I will not tie
things ſtrictly, though this be common and ordinary)
there being not one of a hundred ſometimes that can
ſay, now I believe in Chriſt, not becauſe I have learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it by cuſtom and common report, but becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
hath been to me, and in me, the power of God unto
ſalvation; it's a rare thing: The Faith you have (how
ever you come by it, look you to that) is that kind of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
and dogmatical ſaith of aſſent to the truth of the
Scriptures: We know God ſpake by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but neither
receives Chriſt as Saviour, Lord, and Sovereign, nor
brings forth any fruit to holineſs, nor works by love.
Did not the Jew honour the great Names of <hi>Abraham</hi>
and <hi>Moſes,</hi> but were neither true Diſciples of the one,
nor Children of the other? And do not we denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
our ſelves by the Name of Chriſt, without any
memberſhip with him, or real union?</p>
               <p>Did not the Jew obſerve the Laws of his Religion
with mighty zeal and ſtrictneſs as ever Nation did? but
neither ſought nor felt any inward virtue therein, reſting
in the work done, and with great confidence promiſing
to himſelf ſalvation: And are you ſo zealous and ſtrict
in the outwards of your Religion as the Jew was? oh, no;
of a more looſe and luke-warm temper in this point than

your ſelves to be ſaved, with as much confidence as the

ſo ſollicitous to bring our children to be baptized, and we
muſt have it ſo, its a badg of our Religion; but are we any
thing ſollicitous to plant grace in their hearts, when they
are come to years of diſcretion? to plant the work of
Regeneration, as well as give them the outward mark?
Examine your conſcience thorowly, and ſee whether
or no you go beyond the Jew outwardly. And to the
Sacrament you will come, and pretend zeal in it; but do
you any thing but obſerve a fair <hi>decorum</hi> for that day or

where is the Lord Jeſus received and ſealed to your

your ſelves ſalvation thereupon, with ſuch a confidence

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53665:175"/>
ſome brokenneſs and ſoftneſs of heart, the heart of
ſtone taken away, ſome newneſs of ſpirit, ſomething
of Chriſt Jeſus: Had the Jew found out the entrails of
his Religion, he had found Chriſt there over and over;
but he dreamed of a National ſalvation, (as I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſay,) by virtue of a Covenant that had Inwards in
it, but he ſaw little: Let me ſay to you, You have ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Ordinances, look for Chriſt in them, he is the
kernel of all Ordinances: Go to God and pray, Lord
it is thy Covenant-promiſe to put thy Law into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of thy people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. and that there called
Inwards, the Apoſtle calls the writing of the Law in the
heart and mind, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. There are ſome (that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways
great men) that when they come to die, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they fly? Bear me witneſs, I die in the Proteſtant
Faith; I die in the Faith and Confeſſion of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> (which I have pitied them in;) for that
ſhews the rightneſs of the Faith which they profeſs, but
not the ſavingneſs of their Faith and profeſſion as to
them, except they look, as the Jews did, for a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſalvation, becauſe they are all of the true profeſſion.
Others there are, that when they have incorporated
themſelves into ſuch a Body, whereof the Characteriſtical
mark is a ſeparate opinion from other men, then they
think they are come into a ſtate of ſalvation, that they
have been in <hi>Egypt</hi> all this while, now they are come to
<hi>Canaan:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 3. 10.</note> Alas poor ſouls! you will find ſomething elſe

Papiſtically; I never like this frame; let the
holineſs that God hath appointed ſtand, and let us ſtand

that our Fathers</hi> (ſpeaking in an Eccleſiaſtical ſence)
<hi>did all eat of the ſame ſpiritual meat,</hi> honoured with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments

call for holy life, and for <hi>Circumciſion of the

the outward forms in reſpect thereof, <hi>Iſaiah 66. 3. To

<hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man what is good, to love mercy, to

viz. <hi>till the Jubile:</hi> but all your typical ordinances
had their date and period. God intended to ſhake them
down; that remaining things, the everlaſting Goſpel
might take place, which cannot be ſhaken, nor are to be

end, and uſe; but even then the circumciſion of the
fleſh was but, as <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith, a ſymbol of circumciſion of
ſpirit: and as the Apoſtle ſaith of your manna and rock,
it was but Chriſt; and ſo of your outward worſhip; the
ſhell is valued for the kernel, the bone for the marrow,
while the kernel and marrow is in them; and now theſe
typical ſymbols, though they be <hi>mortua &amp; mortifera,</hi> as
to their uſe, dead and deadly; yet they are the word of
God, and may and do teach very much Goſpel; as the
anatomie of a dead man teaches how the parts lie in a
living man; yet they continue not of further uſe to you:
and it may eaſily appear, that God did intend to draw
off this outwardneſs of worſhip, by his taking off, as you
account, fine things in the ſecond temple, which were
found in the firſt, and the Scripture promiſing a greater
glory in the ſecond temple than of the firſt, cannot be
underſtood otherwaies, then that the outward glory was
exchanged and recompenced by ſpiritual glory through
Chriſt, <hi>Hag:</hi> 2. 9. &amp; conſequently, that the carnal &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

that is, in their inwards, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. 9. 10. But inſtead of
lighting a candle to the ſunne, I ſhall endeavor ſhortly
to make a brief Anatomic of this Jew or Chriſtian,
that is one inwardly, and how he is diſtinguiſhed from
him that is ſo outwardly.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. There is in every true Chriſtian an inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
man; this is called, <hi>The new man,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24. <hi>The
inward,</hi> Rom 7. 24. 2 Cor. 4. 16. A dead man may have
inward parts, but he hath not an inward man, becauſe
there is no ſoul; ſo an outward Chriſtian may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, a dead knowledge, a dead heart, dead affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but no inward man, becauſe there is no work of
grace in him; and this is called an inward man, becauſe
as corruption ſpreading over the whole man is called
the old man, ſo this inward renewing grace ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into and over the whole man, the mind, will, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
is called an inner man; and this inner man is
that which knows God, believes in Chriſt, loves, fears,
thirſts after grace, delights in Gods Commandments;
and hath a continual oppoſition to the old man, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-luſting,
counter-deſiring, and counter-ſtanding it:
<hi>Chriſt dwells in your hearts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>The holy
Spirit is within you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; but as the ſoul never
is in a dead body, becauſe where it dwells, life is; ſo
Chriſt never is in a man that is dead; where he is, life is,
there is an inward man; he that hath not in him this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, cannot be a Chriſtian inwardly.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, There is an inward work of God that goes
to the forming and begetting of this inward man: Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ordinances may make a Chriſtian in the Letter,
but an inward work makes a Chriſtian in Spirit; <hi>I will

Theſe are Covenant-promiſes, performed to all that are
Covenant people: In this inward work we have but the

2 Cor. 3. 3. <hi>Miniſtred by us, but written by the Spirit of the
living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, In this inward man, wrought by an inward
work, conſiſts the being of a true Chriſtian; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this he that is called a Chriſtian is no more a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
than he that acts the part of a King is a King; the
name of a Chriſtian is given or may follow from the
outward profeſſion, but the nature is in this inward man:
He that begets, communicates his Nature to the begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
he that paints a man imploys Art only, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
no Nature: God in a Chriſtians new birth,
communicates holineſs, which is the Divine Nature;
but in an Hypocrite there is nothing but Art (as I may
ſay) or ſome outward work; for the outward forms may
be painted, yet inward forms cannot; the lineaments
of a Chriſtian may be drawn to the life upon the white
wall of an Hypocrite; but the inward man, which is
that <hi>quod dat eſſe,</hi> gives being to a Chriſtian, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, but in a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, He that is inwardly a Chriſtian hath ſome
marks of difference and diſtinction from the outward
Chriſtian, <hi>forma dat diſtingui;</hi> this inward work dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>renceth
him from all ſorts of them that are nominates
and Chriſtians outwardly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is diſtinguiſhed from the carnal Jew or
Chriſtian, that profeſſes Chriſt, but lives in ſin; for
though the outward Jew, or Chriſtian may hate ſome
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53665:180"/>
ſins; Thou abhorreſt Idols, thou hateſt Popery, and
doſt many good works, yet that is out of ſome peculiar
and particular indiſpoſition to a particular ſin, and ſome
particular approbation or liking of ſome good works;
but this hate of any ſin, or this inclination to a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of any good works, ariſeth not from an
inward nature or gracious principle, as it doth in
him that is a Chriſtian inwardly; and the reaſon is,
that contrariety to ſin which is in a true Chriſtian,
ariſing from this inward gracious Nature, is to the
whole ſpecies or kind of ſin, and is irreconcileable
to any ſin whatſoever; as contrarieties of Nature
are to the whole kind, as light is contrary to all
darkneſs, and fire to all water; ſo that this contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
to ſin, ariſing from the inward man, is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
to all ſin; though not an univerſal victory,
yet there is an univerſal contrariety; victory argues
ſtrength, contrariety argues nature; hence it is that
an outward Chriſtian may hate one ſin and love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
becsuſe there is not a gracious Nature in
him which would be contrary to all: And ſo alſo
he may do good works, but not out of a Nature
that is in him; for if it were from an inward Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there would be an univerſal ſympathy with,
and inclination towards God, and all that is of God,
his Children, his Commandments, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12 3.
Therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I delight in the Law of
God according to the inner man,</hi> Rom. 7. 22. not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
good inclination, but the Law in the whole
of it: It's the victory of a Chriſtian over corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may not be full, the performance of good may
not be perfect; but the inward Nature of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is to be judged by the univerſal contrariety of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53665:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his inward man to all ſin, and his univerſal incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to God and holineſs; and that univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
will beget a combate againſt all ſin; and
that univerſall inclination to God, an endeavour to
all good; but whether that combat be victorious,
or that performance be perfect, though it may be
much to ſhew the ſtrength of a Chriſtian; yet it
ſhewes not his inward nature; but the other, this
univerſal contrariety to ſin, can be in no man but
him, that hath an univerſal ſympathy with God,
and his whole law, and image in his children; they
are both in him that is a Chriſtian inwardly, and they
argue an inward nature of grace in him; in which
nature he differs from the carnal Chriſtian, who may
oppoſe ſome ſins, and do ſome good works out of
other principles and reaſons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This inward Chriſtian, is diſtinguiſhed
from a moral man, that to his dogmatical faith and
profeſſion of Chriſt addeth moral vertue; for there is
as great difference between grace and virtue, as between
the ſweet flowers ſpread upon a dead carkaſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
life: a man be full of virtue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and emptie of
grace; as a room exquiſitely painted without light: mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
virtue is like flowers of needle work, that are
made by art, but never grow from any living root:
natural temper, diſpoſition, education, produce mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
virtues; but now this inward man of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is, as I may ſay, made up of Chriſt: the knowledge,
faith, love, the taſtes and relliſh of Chriſt are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
that make up this inward man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all his
graces are but extracts out of Chriſt: It is the
knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt that alters the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of moral virtues, and turns them into Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53665:181"/>
graces, fruits of the Spirit; as the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ſoul makes the ſenſitive operations, which
otherwayes are in bruits to be the act of a
man: I know a Chriſtian may have more rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of nature, and more ſturdineſs of paſſions
then is in many a moral man; he that hath
more Chriſtianity may have leſs morality; as
there is more perfection of animal and ſenſitive
faculties in ſome bruits, then in ſome men: I
had rather fight againſt ſin by a little of Chriſt
in me, then beat luſts and paſſions quite out
of the field by the ſtrength meerly of moral
virtue; becauſe fighting againſt paſſions by the
faith and love of Chriſt argues a Goſpel inward
life, which is better then a freedom from vice by
a company of dead virtues.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This inward man is diſtinguiſhed from
all thoſe common gifts and workings which may
be in an outward Chriſtian; for there may be a
large knowledge, a kind of dogmatical faith, a
mercenary love of God, a worldly ſorrow for
ſin, a deſire of ſalvation, and grace, as a bridge to
heaven; but there is great difference between
gifts and grace: there is no grace but hath a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
that goes under that ſame name; and that
is it which deceives men: for likeneſs is the mother
of error, and it's that makes examination ſo hard:
knowledge, faith, love, repentance, are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed;
for there are that bear the name
of theſe, but are not; therefore this light oare is
to be diſtinguiſhed from true metal; the Spirit
works many things in thoſe whom it unites not
to the head; and many have large gifts by diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53665:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from Chriſt that have no grace by virtue of
their union with him, as heat from the body into
the clothes one weares; but they do not argue
union with the head. Now there is a peculiar
knowledg of God, which is by his teaching,
which a man may rather feel than diſcribe; there
is a love of Chriſt himſelf, not only of his benefits;
there is a repentance that riſes out of love; and
not out of ſlaviſh fear, and there are deſires of
grace for ſervice, and not only for a bridg to
heaven; this is the mark of true grace as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from common: it caſts out ſelf-love; and
as it comes from union, ſo it drawes the ſoul into
union and acquaintance with Chriſt himſelf: the
moſt intimate corruptions of men are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide and
ſelf, which are not mortified by outward and
common graces; nor doth common grace draw
into union with Chriſt, but is wholly upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
and reward; to ſeek God for God, or love
Chriſt for himſelf, is above the power of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſhining glorious parts or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and peculiar to this inward man.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A Chriſtian inwardly is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
from the outwardly formed, who in the form
of Godlineſs is as well dreſt as the true Chriſtian,
frequents ordinances, complies in ritual and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
duties, hath greater parts and abilities than
this Chriſtian inwardly we ſpeak of; but yet the
inner Chriſtian differs from the outward. 1. In
the principle that carries him, which is regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
grace, a well of wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er that ſprings up in him
to everlaſting life. 2. In the motive that impels
and conſtrains him, the love of Chriſt; the ſweet
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53665:182"/>
peculiar reliſhes of that love: 3. In the manner,
which is with delight in God, in his law, and the
commandments are not grievous. 4. In the ends
he aimes at, which are not the baſe reſpects of ſelf-love,
but the walking with God in communion,
and the enjoyment of God his God: but as for the
Chriſtian outwardly, he hath no principle, no root
in himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 21. his motives are forrain
ſprings and plummets, as your <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of performance is but artificial and unſavoury;
his ends are like <hi>Jehu's,</hi> that is, his own; and ſo his
faith that he brags of, is but want of temptation;
his aſſurance is but confidence in the fleſh; his qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs,
is but want of examination of his bottom;
his joy is the blaze of thorns; his deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es are but
the eructations of ſelf-love. I have thus ſhewn you
him that is a Chriſtian inwardly; and now for the

neither Jew outwardly, nor Jew inwardly, as the
text deſcribes both; for the Jew outwardly, is not

profit them nothing: And for the Jew inwardly, he
is not, nor can be; for their Ordinances as now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

heathen Rites: Indeed ſalvation was of the Jews,

to be built up in them; hold the vitals, hold the
head; and though all the world reel into pieces, you
have that will ſave your own ſouls.</p>
