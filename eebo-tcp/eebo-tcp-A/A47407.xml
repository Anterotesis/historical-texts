            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ſhall beg a part in your Prayers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to look over what Weakneſs you
may ſee in this ſmall Tract, for I am, you
know, but a Babe in Chriſt's School, and
know but in part.</p>
                  <p>And now to you, my Beloved Brethren and
Siſters, (who meet on <hi>Horſelydown</hi>) whom I
hope I may ſay are my Joy and my Crown,
whoſe Souls are moſt dear to me, and whom
I can ſay I truly love and long after; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices
my Spirit to ſee how generally you are
inlightned into this Goſpel-Duty; but 'tis
no ſmall grief to me to ſee (ſince the Church
in ſuch a ſolemn manner agreed to ſing the
Praiſes of God on the Lord's Day) to find
ſome of you ſo much offended; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
'tis for want of Conſideration, for
you have no new thing brought in among
you. Hath not the Church ſung at breaking
of Bread always for 16 or 18 Years laſt paſt,
and could not, nor would omit it in the time
of the late Perſecution? And have not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the honeſt Hearers (who have ſtayed
to ſee that Holy Adminiſtration) ſung with
you, at that time, and yet none of you ever
ſignified the leaſt trouble? And have we not
for this 12 or 14 Years ſung in <hi>mixt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
on Days of Thanksgiving,</hi> and never
any offended at it, as ever I heard? What is
done more now? 'tis only practiſed oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
and ſure if it be God's Ordinance, the
often practiſing of it, by ſuch who find
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:63351:5"/>
their Hearts draw out ſo to do, cannot be
ſinful.</p>
                  <p>And on that Solemn Day, when the Church
would have it put up, to ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
ſtood affected about Singing, almoſt
every ones Hand was up for it, or to give
Liberty to the Church at ſuch times to ſing.
And when put up in the Negative, but about
5 or 6 at moſt (as I remember) were againſt
it. Did any one of you, at that time ſay,
if we did proceed to ſing at ſuch times, you
could not have Communion with us? which
if you had, I perceive the Church, nay
every one of us who had born our Burden
for many Years, would have born it a little
longer? Beſides, did not the Church agree
to ſing only after Sermon, and when Prayer
was ended? And if thoſe few Brethren and
Siſters who were not ſatisfied, could not ſtay
whilſt we ſung, they might freely go forth,
and we would not be offended with them;
ſo far was the Church, or my ſelf, from impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
on the Conſciences of any. But is it not
hard that ſome of us ſhould ſo long be laid
under a Burden, when the Church generally
was againſt Singing at that time, and you
cannot bear it now it is come to be your Lot?
I am afraid the noiſe of theſe things are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented
abroad, and therefore I thought
it might not be amiſs to rectify Miſtakes in
you, or any other Brethren. The matter of
Difference that is at preſent between the
Church and ſome few of our dear and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:63351:6"/>
Brethren and Siſters, is not about Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf, nor ſinging with others, for that
has been all along the practiſe of the Church
for many Years (as before I hinted) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about ſinging on the Lords Day, unleſs it
be one Member, except the Judgments of
any other are lately changed.</p>
                  <p>But my Brethren will, I hope, ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of the Matter, and labour after that
Chriſtian Love, Tenderneſs and Forbearance
the Goſpel calls for. We are exhorted <hi>to bear
one anothers Burdens, and ſo to fulfil the Law of
Chriſt.</hi> For the Lord's ſake let us not fall
out by the way, and lay things grievous on
one anothers Spirits; for we are not Lords
over one anothers Faith, but Helpers of each

watch againſt Satan, and <hi>ſtrive to keep the

                  <p>IT cannot but be lamented to ſee what
Temptations many Men have been laid
under, by the great Enemy of Truth, in
every Age of the World, in their fierce op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
againſt one or another bleſſed Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt; and this
not only by bad Men, but alſo by Men fearing
God: All which, no doubt, ariſes, either from
their Ignorance, or elſe from that Prejudice there
is in their Hearts againſt it; from a fond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that it can't be a Truth of Chriſt, becauſe
they never looked upon it ſo to be, (nor ſome
wiſer than they); nor are they willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be a Truth, ſince ſome (who have not
ſuch Light and Knowledg in other bleſſed
Truths) do practiſe it: as if, becauſe ſome
Men, who hold and maintain ſome groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Falſities, can hold and practiſe no
Truths at all; whereas 'tis evident, the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is <hi>Mystical Babylon,</hi> are ſound
in the Doctrine of the Trinity, as far as I can
gather, and poſſibly in ſome other Points alſo:
For they believe the Reſurrection of the Body,
and the Eternal Judgment, and that Chriſt died
without the Gate of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63351:11"/>
ſome Men have a Fancy they know all the
whole Mind of Chriſt, and that they need not
be taught any other Truths, than thoſe which
they have received: notwithſtanding can't but
know, the Church is but newly come out of
the Wilderneſs, or Popiſh Darkneſs; and not
ſo fully neither, as to be as clear as the Sun, as
in due time ſhe ſhall.</p>
                  <p>Reformation, 'tis evident, is a hard and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

reſpect of Baptiſm, and Impoſition of Hands
upon Baptized Believers (as ſuch.) One would
even ſtand and wonder to ſee how many godly,
learned, and good Men, ſhould be ſo dark as to
maintain, and that reſolutely too, that corrupt
Practice of <hi>Pedo-Baptiſm,</hi> (or rather <hi>Rantiſm</hi>)
conſidering it hath not the leaſt footing in the
Word of God, but is ſo directly contrary to
the Nature and Conſtitution of a Goſpel-Church,
and Adminiſtration of New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Ordinances.
But let not thoſe of our own
Perſwaſion much longer wonder at this, ſince
ſome of them ſeem as blind and dark in another
Bleſſed Truth, and Sacred Ordinance of the ever
glorious God, that hardly was ever oppoſed
as by them; but hath been generally owned in
every Age of the Church, and that by the moſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63351:11"/>
godly and enlightned Chriſtians from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World till of late days; and
not now neither, but by ſome People of the
Baptized Way, and others who are againſt all
Ordinances. I muſt confeſs no Man (through
the Grace of God) can be better ſatisfied
touching the Truth of Baptiſm, as practiſed by
my Brethren, than I am, and of the true Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Conſtitution of our Churches, and
ſoundneſs of their Faith in all the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Religion; yet do I not think we have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to ſuch a perfection of Knowledg of all
practical Truths, that we need not enquire after
any thing which we may not yet have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, (as one obſerves) that the
great Deſign of Satan is, and always was, to
put a Cheat upon God's People, as well as to
hold the World in Blindneſs and Wickedneſs;
by the one (ſaith he) Satan holds Men in a
ſtate of Impenitency, and by the other he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes
Chriſtians to neglect their Duties, and to
obſtruct their own Comfort and Priviledg. He
acts as well in the ſhape of an <hi>Angel of Light,</hi>
as of a <hi>Prince of Darkneſs,</hi> ſtirring up vain
Scruples and Objections, eſpecially in the Minds
of weak Chriſtians, and filthy Imaginations in
thoſe who have not yet turned to God.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, I my ſelf, when firſt God
enlightned me into his Truth, was an oppoſer
of this Sacred Ordinance; but it was not for
want of Ignorance, and partly through Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63351:12"/>
perhaps to ſuch who I eſteem, and even
looked upon ſince that time, a corrupt People,
and falſe in their Church-Conſtitution, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
with humane Innovation, or Inventions of
Men: the abuſe of an Ordinance is ſubject to
raiſe Mens Spirits to a diſlike of the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But, bleſſed be God, I have, for near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years laſt paſt, been fully convinced of the
Truth of the Ordinance I now contend for,
and have an equal eſteem for it, (through Grace)
as I have for any other Truth, knowing <hi>every
Word of God is pure;</hi> and have found no little
comfort in the practice of it, publickly in the
Church, and in private alſo.</p>
                  <p>And that all may ſee upon what Authority
we have received, and do practiſe this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of ſinging of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> I have wrote this Treatiſe; and
do hope, with the Bleſſing of God, it may
tend to eſtabliſh ſuch who own it to be an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Chriſt, and convince others, who
either oppoſe it, or through want of Light, live
in the neglect of it.</p>

                     <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange to ſome wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, that I begin here; poſſibly they
will ſay, there is no need to ſpeak a word
about this, for all the World are agreed
in the Caſe; all know what it is to ſing, as well
as they know what it is to ſpeak. Though this
be true, yet I find a neceſſity to open this Act
of the Bodily Organ, as will appear by what
follows; for ſome Men, it ſeems, are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in their Thoughts, that they do not
know what Singing is, but think there may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63351:13"/>
a Singing without the Tongue, taking the
word [Melody in the Heart] to be all the Singing
the Holy Ghoſt exhorts to in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and ſo would have us believe there is a
mental Singing, as well as mental Praying;
nay, which is worſe, would wholly exclude all
other Singing beſides that, which is very hard;
if they ſhould do ſo by Prayer, it would
ſtrangely amuſe all good People, <hi>viz.</hi> that we
muſt have nothing but Heart-Prayer, without
a Voice. Others ſay, that one Perſon may be
the Mouth in Singing, as well as in Praying; and
ſo a multitude may be ſaid to ſing with him,
though there is none ſings but that ſingle Man,
as in Prayer. A third ſort there be, I find,
who conclude Singing is wholly comprehended
in the Ordinance of Prayer, and from hence
pleaſe themſelves that they do ſing, when in
Prayer they give Thanks to God, or praiſe
God. But very remarkable it is to ſee how
theſe Men are confounded by this laſt Aſſertion,
in reſpect of one Objection they bring againſt
Singing.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> What will you ſing your Prayers?
you may as well go to Common-Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have heard one or two worthy Men
ſpeak, not long ſince: Why, truly Brethren,
it appears you do ſing your Prayers, nay, and
that always too when you pray; for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
you never pray to God for what you
want, but you ſee cauſe to praiſe him for what
you have received. All that ever wrote of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63351:13"/>
Prayer, that I have met with, do jointly agree,
that praiſing of God, or giving of Thanks, is
one part or branch of Prayer, and that part, it
appears in your opinion, you ſing. And if
this be ſo, pray allow us to ſing ſome Prayers
too, and do not charge us with Common-Prayer,
unleſs <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms be a <hi>Common-Prayer-Book:</hi>
And then it will appear that
<hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is of Divine Inſtitution; nay,
and enjoyned on the Churches too in the New
Teſtament; for we know no Pſalms, I mean
called ſo in God's Word, but the Book of
Pſalms, or Pſalms of <hi>David.</hi>

heard, it would ſignify nothing to their purpoſe
in turning all ſinging unto Heart-Melody, or
inward rejoycing only, without the Tongue

and yet there muſt be a diſtinction even in
theſe; my Silence in Prayer ought to be
when I pray with another, and yet I may be
ſaid to pray as well as he, which is the mouth
of the whole, becauſe my Heart is with him
in the ſame Petitions, and my Deſires go e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with him: but in Preaching, where
Silence muſt be likewiſe from the nature of
the Ordinance, yet, tho I conſent fully with
the Matter, and agree in all that is ſaid with
never ſo much Affection, yet I can't be ſaid
to preach, but only he that ſpeaketh preaches.
So now as to Singing, there is a difference
likewiſe of another Conſideration, if only
one ſing, none elſe can be ſaid to ſing, tho
they joyn with the Matter and agree to it in
their Hearts; for it is an outward Act, and
terminated in the Perſon that performs it:
And tho in my ſilent Conjunction, I may
readily praiſe God, yet I can in no ſenſe be
properly ſaid to ſing with others, without I
do uſe my Voice and bodily <hi>Organs</hi> as they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63351:15"/>
do. This Conſideration, ſaith he, may give light
to Men that mind the nature and diſtinction
of Ordinances in their Adminiſtrations; that
which is the Confuſion of other Ordinances,
is the Beauty of this; for two to preach or
pray together at the ſame time and place, were
the greateſt Confuſion imaginable; but for
an hundred to ſing together, is moſt harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
and pleaſant, ſo far from the breach of
Order, that Harmony is moſt diſcovered by
it.</q> So far Mr. <hi>Sidenham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I hope our Brethren do not think there is
Confuſion in Heaven, where the Heavenly Hoſt
with one Voice-celebrate the Praiſes of God by
ſinging to him.</p>
                     <p>2. Further, to prove that Singing properly
can't be done without the Voice, it is material
to obſerve the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi>
104. 12. where our Dictionaries, as well as our
Annotators on the Bible, ſhew it ſignifies <hi>giving
a Voice,</hi> and ſuch a Voice too, that is melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in Odulation, or tuning the Voice. <q>And,
ſaith Reverend Dr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> To limit Singing
only in the Heart, and inward Melody of the
Spirit, is utterly beſides the Apoſtle's intent,
and contrary to the nature of Singing, and
deſtructive to all Edification or Advantage to
others by Singing. Where do we read of
ſinging in all the Scripture without a Voice?
How groſs, ſaith he, and ignorant a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the Adject, and abſurd Nonſenſe is
it to talk of ſinging in the Heart without
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63351:16"/>
a Voice.</q> Dr. <hi>Roberts</hi>'s <hi>Key of the Bible,</hi> p. 177.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> whoſe Learning and
excellent Parts and Wiſdom ſhines (tho dead)
through the World, poſitively affirms, That
Singing is an Act of the Voice, on <hi>Job</hi> 38. 7.
So that it appears from hence, tho there is
<hi>Heart-Prayer, Mental-Prayer,</hi> and that may
be ſaid as properly to be Prayer, tho the Voice
be not heard (as in <hi>Hannah</hi>'s Caſe) as that
which is vocal, yet there is no proper ſinging
but that which is performed with the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>3. Were it not ſo, all Mankind are and would
be miſtaken in one of the common Acts of
the bodily Organs, and not be able to reſolve
ſo plain a Queſtion, What is it to ſing? or
what is ſinging? But ſo eaſy a Queſtion is this
to be anſwered, that every Child can readily
reſolve it, that is not above ſix or ſeven Years
old; nay, if a <hi>Turk, Indian</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> ſhould
come into our Aſſemblies, that underſtands not
one word of Engliſh, and ſo can't diſtinguiſh
in other Acts of Worſhip the one from the
other, yet if he hears us a ſinging, he knows
what that is; and if but one Man ſings (tho
the reſt may ſhew their liking or approbation
of it) if any ſhould ſay they all ſing, every one
would ſay he told a Lie, there was but one Man
only who ſung; but in Prayer, that being an
Act of Worſhip, that may be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Voice, 'tis quite another thing, all may
be ſaid to pray, tho but one is the Mouth.</p>

Implying (ſaith he) that no Prayer is

Nor can I think that any gracious Soul doth

Prayer when he is at the Throne of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi>
Praiſing of God: Therefore this the Apoſtle

this, and as ſomething quite diſtinct from

in Prayer, or praiſing of God when
we pray unto him, then the Apoſtle uſes as
great and palpable a Tautology as can poſſibly
be; nay, and leaves all Men under a Cloud
and Miſtake, if he meant nothing elſe (or no
more) than praiſing of God in Prayer; ſince
all the World ever underſtood a clear diſtinct

difference between thoſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

Praiſes: for though all right Singing to God
is a praiſing of him, (nay, and in the highe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

manner that we in our mortal Bodies are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to do;) yet all praiſings of God are not
ſinging of his Praiſe. Moreover, the difference
there between Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Singing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

clearly hinted by the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> where he
exhorts thoſe in Affliction in an extraordinary
manner to pray: James 5. 13. <hi>Is any afflicted?
let him pray. And is any merry? let them

to praiſe God, as well as to pray unto him,
but to ſuch who are merry, or whoſe Hearts
were greatly lifted up, or affected with the
Love, Mercy and Goodneſs of God, why
then, and upon ſuch Occaſions, to ſing, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'tis worth noting, to obſerve, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

2. There is, it appears, a crying Noiſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                     <p>3. There is a preaching Voice, or a Noiſe
made that way.</p>
                     <p>4. A praying, or praiſing Voice.</p>
                     <p>5. A ſinging Voice. And all theſe diſtinct
from each other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> could readily reſolve the Doubt that
was upon <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when he lent his Ear to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the Noiſe of the People. Truly I am
almoſt aſhamed I have this occaſion to ſpeak,
and to be ſo large upon it; but knowing what
I have met withal, from ſome poor, weak, and
doubting Chriſtians, who ſtumble at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
about the very Act of Singing, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what it is, or at leaſt raiſe ſuch Objections
againſt it, I have thought good to begin here,
and if this may but ſatisfy them, I ſhall bleſs
God for what I have ſaid in all plainneſs; and
do know it makes an eaſy Paſſage to the next
Chapter, wherein I ſhall, by God's Aſſiſtance,
prove Singing (yea ſuch a Singing, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other known to Mankind) an Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God, and to be practiſed in the
Congregation of Chriſtians, and in Private al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
only let me conclude this Chapter with two
Inferences.</p>
                     <p>1. If this be ſo; then we may naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from hence, that all ſuch who never ſing
the Praiſes of God with a Vocal Melody, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all thoſe ſweet Rejoicings they
may have in the Spirit at any time, never ſing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63351:20"/>
at all. And if Singing be that which the Great
God looks for from, and enjoins upon his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and every one of them, that then they lie
ſhort of their Duty, and want an Ordinance.
Moreover, if it be our Duty, and that which
belongs to God, it is to take away one great
part of his glorious Praiſe, yea, the higheſt
manner of performance of it we are capable
of; and ſo it is a robbing of the Holy God, as
well as it deprives their own Souls, and the
Souls of others of much ſweet and Heavenly
Joy and Refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>We may alſo infer, that thoſe, who think
they may be ſaid to ſing with him that ſings,
when they approve of the Matter of his Song,
and are affected with it, are miſtaken, ſeeing
there is no proper mental or Heart-ſinging, or
joining that way with others in Singing, as
there is in the Duty and Ordinance of Prayer.
For all may be ſaid as well to preach, who like
and approve of what a Preacher ſaith, as they
may be all ſaid to ſing, who ſit and hear one
Man ſing with delight, when they themſelves
hold their peace and ſing not.</p>

from the Antiquity of this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
'tis as ancient as this World; the World,
and Singing of the Praiſe of God, came even
in together, or very near each other. I have
reſpect to that triumphant Singing of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When</hi> Jehovah <hi>laid the Foundation of the
Earth,</hi> Job 38. When the Morning Stars ſang
together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for
Joy.</p>
                     <p>I find an Eminent Writer paraphraſing thus
on theſe words, <hi>viz. Where waſt thou when I
laid the Foundation of the Earth?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>at which
ſight the Morning Stars ſang together, and all
the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy.</hi> Taking the
words as carrying an Alluſion to, or a Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
taken from ſome noble Buildings or Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whoſe Foundations uſe to be laid with

Solemnity, and with Singing or ſhouting Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.</p>
                     <p>See Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> on the Place, who after he
hath given ſeveral Opinions of Men about
theſe Morning Stars, ſome ſuppoſing they mean
the Stars in the Firmament of Heaven, he gives
two Reaſons to prove, by them are meant the
Angels of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There are ſome (ſaith he) who take theſe
Stars Metaphorically or Figuratively, for the
Angels, and then their Singing is proper:
And there are two Reaſons given why, by
the Stars in this place, we ſhould underſtand
the Angels.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Firſt, If we conſider the Truth or Courſe
of the Hiſtory; becauſe the Earth being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the firſt Day, the Stars were not in being
till the Fourth; unleſs we comprehend them
(as was ſaid before) as to their Matter and
Reality, under thoſe words of <hi>Moſes, In the
beginning God created the Heaven and the
Earth.</hi> But as to their Appearance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
ſo they were not till the fourth Day;
and if ſo, how could they ſing together the
Praiſes of God at the laying the Foundation
of the Earth?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>A ſecond Reaſon is given from this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
afterwards, Verſ. 31, 32. <hi>Canſt thou
bind the ſweet Influences of the Pleiades?</hi>
(or ſeven Stars) <hi>or looſe the Bands of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion?</hi>
&amp;c. Here the Lord treats with <hi>Job</hi>
about the Stars in proper Senſes; therefore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63351:22"/>
probably the Morning Stars here mentioned,
are not to be taken Properly, but Tropically,
for the Angels.</q> And then he goes on to
prove how fitly the Angels may be called
Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from this of the Stars or
Angels Singing, he infers;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Singing is an Act of Divine Worſhip,
they ſang to the Glory of God.</p>
                     <p>Note, Secondly, ſaith he, Singing is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of Joy: 'Tis very remarkable the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
ſang at God's bringing forth the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Will, and do it ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> with all readineſs
Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> tells us, They are not worthy to be

<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, As the Angels ſang at God's lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Foundation of the firſt Creation, ſo alſo
they ſang at the beginning, or bringing in the
ſecond Creation, as Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> alſo obſerves,
even at the Birth of Chriſt, they ſang, <hi>Glory to
God on High, and on Earth Peace, good Will to
Men.</hi> To teach us that as we ſhould ſing the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63351:22"/>
Praiſes of God for the Works of Creation, and
ſo much the more for the Work of Redemption.
Shall they ſing to ſee the good Will of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

who are thus raiſed to Glory, and magnified
by the mighty God, not ſing, or imitate the
Angels, to join together, with united Voices, to
ſing and celebrate his Praiſes?</p>
                     <p>When the Diſciples rejoiced and ſang thoſe
<hi>Hoſannahs</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed be the King

did not like the Muſick;</hi> and therefore ſaid unto
him, from among the Multitude, <hi>Maſter, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke

Devil is a great Enemy to Singing; he does

'twas he, no doubt, that influenced and ſtirred

they ſung; all generally underſtand thoſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannahs</hi>

hint, that it might be the name of a Song
that was uſed to be ſung in Feſtivals.</p>
                     <p>Moreover they tell you, that the Expreſſions
ſeem to be taken out of <hi>Pſal. 118. 24, 25, 26.</hi>
Alſo they were uttered as with one Voice. <hi>The
whole Multitude of the Diſciples began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
and praiſe God with a loud Voice,</hi> Luke
19. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and uttered theſe words, <hi>Hoſanna, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it he that cometh in the Name of the Lord;
Hoſannah in the higheſt.</hi> As God always was
praiſed with Singing, ſo now they ſeem to be
raiſed with holy Triumph, to expreſs his Praiſe
in the higheſt manner, and therefore they ſung.</p>
                     <p>But that I may cloſe this, take one or two
Arguments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg. 1.</hi> If Angels in Singing do the Will of
God, do that which is pleaſing and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, and in ſo doing worſhip God;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63351:23"/>
then Singing, or to ſing, is the Will of God,
well-pleaſing to him, and is acceptable in his ſight,
and is a part of his Worſhip. But Angels, in
Singing, do the Will of God, do that which is
well-pleaſing to him, and acceptable in his ſight,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>and in ſo doing they worſhip him. <hi>Ergo,</hi> To
ſing, is to do the Will of God, 'tis well-pleaſing
to him, and acceptable in his ſight, and in ſo
doing we worſhip him.</p>
                     <p>I never met with any that deny Angels to
ſing the Praiſes of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but all as one Man
grant, 'tis part of their great Work and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
And this being ſo, my Argument needs
no Confirmation, but is unanſwerable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg. 2.</hi> If Heaven, and all the Hoſt of Heaven,
or all that is therein, and Earth, and all that is in
it, are commanded by the Holy Ghoſt to ſing the

Ordinance of God, ſhall be taken from
the Nature of the Duty it ſelf, which generally
worthy Men call a Moral Duty, as well as it
is brought under expreſs Inſtitution, and ſo
conſequently a Branch of natural Worſhip. And
now, becauſe ſome weak Chriſtians are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at this Phraſe, <hi>viz.</hi> calling Singing a part
of natural or moral Worſhip or Religion, I
ſhall explain what we mean when we ſpeak
thus. Firſt of all, not but that 'tis a ſpiritual
Ordinance, and a poſitively Law: but we muſt
diſtinguiſh between Precepts that are purely
Moral, and meerly Poſitive. Breaking of
Bread, and Holy Baptiſm, are meer poſitive
Ordinances: and they had never been known
nor practiſed, if there had not been a poſitive
Inſtitution to give being to them; but to fear
God, to love God, to pray to God, and divers
other Precepts of the ſame Nature, had been
the Duty of all Man-kind, if there had been
no written Law or Preſcription poſitively to
injoin them on the Creature; and that by the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63351:24"/>
Law or Light o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> God in the Conſcience of
Men; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth in <hi>Rom. 2. 14, 15. For
when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do
by nature the things contained in the Law; thoſe
having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves,
which ſhew the Work of the Law written in
their hearts.</hi> All Mankind throughout the
World know, by that of God written in their
Hearts, they ought not to wrong their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they ought not to Steal, nor commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
nor Kill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are taught, in a
word, the ſubſtance of the whole moral Law
of God hereby, if not wholly darkned and
obliterated by their Sin and horrid Luſts. Even
ſo we ſay, if there had been no written Law,
or poſitive Injunction, to pray, and ſing the
Praiſes of God, yet the Light of Nature would
have taught us thus to do.</p>
                     <p>Remarkable is that paſſage of <hi>Moſes</hi> in
<hi>Gen. 4. Then began Men to call upon the Name
of the Lord].</hi> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſheweth that the
Text is taken two manner of ways, the
<hi>Chaldee</hi> in the <hi>Maſovites</hi> Bible ſaith, <hi>Then
in his days Men left off Praying,</hi> or became
prophane, <hi>ſo that they prayed not in the Name
of the Lord.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Others underſtand it directly the contrary
way,</hi> i. e. Then Men begun to pray, or call on
the Name of the Lord, or erected publick
Worſhip, Preaching in the Name of the Lord.
<hi>So</hi> Ainſworth.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take it either way, it appears they knew
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63351:25"/>
it was their Duty to Pray and Preach; yet
there was no poſitive Law, or written Precept
for either in thoſe Days, nor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for many Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
even till <hi>Moſes</hi> came; ſo that 'tis clear,
theſe are parts of moral or natural Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>And ſo is Singing no doubt: for as all the
Heathen generally invocate their Gods, pray to
them, ſo they ſing their Praiſes, as might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
be demonſtrated.</p>
                     <p>And what is more clear (further to evince
this) than that Paſſage of the Children of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi>'s
Singing after their great Deliverance at the
Red Sea, <hi>Exod. 15. 1. Then ſang Moſes, and
the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>this Song,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Either they did it by the Dictates of their
own Conſcience, as a part of Divine Homage
due to God, from the Law or Light of God in
their own Hearts, to magnify him for That
wonderful Salvation, or elſe by ſome ſpecial means
of Inſpiration or Injunction from the Lord,
though I incline to the former. Plain it is,
this was before the Law was given forth, or
there were any written Preſcription or Rule to
walk by; which clearly ſhews, take it either
way, it was no <hi>Levitical Ceremony</hi> (as ſome
are ready to aſſert) but a Duty it was, and it
has been practiſed by multitudes that never had
any knowledg of the Scripture or poſitive
Precepts.</p>
                     <p>Further, to confirm what we have ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this reſpect, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Singing the Praiſes of
God is a moral Duty, and a part of God's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63351:25"/>
Worſhip, as well as Prayer, take what
Mr. <hi>Robert's</hi> ſays; <q>Singing of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to God with the Voice (ſaith he) ſeems to
be part of God's natural Worſhip; which
upon due conſideration of God's Nature,
Man by the Light of Nature ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to him, though there were no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Law requiring it, nor Inſtitution ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>For, 1. Singing of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God,
is a king of Prayer; a Prayer, not in Proſe,
but in Meeter, with Melody. The Apoſtle
joins them together as of like Nature. And
who can be ſo groſs as to deny Prayer to
be part of God's natural Worſhip?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>2. Singing of Songs to God, was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by God's People at the Red Sea, before
the Law was given forth, or any particular
Law for that Duty.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>3. Singing the Praiſes of God is a Duty
of the firſt Commandment, peculiarly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all natural Worſhip to be performed to
him; and ſo it is ranked by the Godly Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and ſay, Singing with Heart and Voice
is a Moral Worſhip, ſuch as is written in the
Hearts of Men by Nature. As to pray in
diſtreſs, ſo when we have cauſe of ſolemn
Thankſgiving unto God, to ſing his Praiſes.
Now, ſaith he, that which is a part of God's
natural moral Worſhip, is a Duty under the
New Teſtament, as well as under the Old,
natural Worſhip is always and in all times
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63351:26"/>
a Duty obliging, <hi>ſemper,</hi> tho not <hi>ad ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
Doubtleſs even the Pagans by the Light
and Law of Nature, are bound to ſing
Praiſes unto God, for his inviſible Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
made known to them by his viſible
Works of Creation and Providence, tho
they never come to the Knowledg of the
Scriptures, of <hi>Pſalms and Songs.</hi>

<hi>Key to the Bible,</hi> pag. 172.</p>
                     <p>But further, to evince this, and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
yet plainer, that it is without all doubt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
Moral Duty to ſing forth the Praiſes of God,
I might argue thus; All Men are to pray to
God; every one ſaith Prayer is a Moral Duty,
then all are bound to praiſe him, ſince Praise
is comprehended in Prayer, as a branch or part of
it. This being granted readily by all, I further
argue; Ought not every Perſon then to perform
this Duty of praiſing of God in the higheſt and
moſt acceptable manner they are capable to do?
none to be ſure will deny this; why then, ſay
I, they are all therefore taught to ſing by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or moral Principles 'tis evident.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe to ſing forth the Praiſes of
God or Man, is the higheſt manner or mode of
praiſing, either God or Man, that we know of
or are able to attain unto: which doth appear.</p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe when any Man naturally is filled
with Joy and Gladneſs, or ſees extraordinary
cauſe of rejoicing, he by a natural Inſtinct falls
into ſinging, all the World knows this is ſo.
Now who is he on ſuch occaſions bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63351:26"/>
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and ſing to, but the Lord only, who
gave him thoſe good things he poſſeſſeth, or
delivered him from thoſe evil things he ſeared?
and ſo upon the one account or other filled his
Soul with Joy and Gladneſs. Why ought the
Saints particularly to rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and
ſing to him, but becauſe all that Good their
Souls are made partakers of, is in and through
him? Why did the People break forth into
thoſe ſweet and triumphant Songs of Praiſe to
<hi>David,</hi> when they ſang, <hi>Saul hath ſlain his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
and</hi> David <hi>his ten thouſands?</hi> was it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
from the Conſideration of thoſe ſingular Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
and Victories they had received from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and hoped further to partake of from his
Hands, as an Inſtrument in the Hand of God?
And if Moral Principles lead People forth thus
upon all occaſions of this nature to ſing to the
Inſtrument of Bleſſings and Salvation, how
much more to the great Agent and Author of
them, <hi>viz.</hi> the great God of Heaven and
Earth? <hi>who will not give his Glory in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. Becauſe this way of praiſing of God by
ſinging, is called by the Holy Ghoſt a praiſing
of him in the <hi>Heights,</hi> or as the heavenly Hoſts
Praiſe God with <hi>Allelujahs,</hi> or in the higheſt
manner; <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, praiſe ye the

                        </gap>ord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, All Creatures are called upon to
praiſe God, to ſing to him. Now ſurely the
Holy Ghoſt would not have injoyned this on
all that have Breath, if it did not belong to
them; and that which all Men are, and ought
to do, is certainly a Moral Duty; nay, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
there are more Precepts that injoin all
Men to ſing the Praiſes of God in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
than there are for them to pray unto
him: which ſeems to be done as if it were on
purpoſe to ſilence thoſe Mens Spirits (whom
the Holy Ghoſt might foreſee would in ſome
Age or another oppoſe this ſacred Ordinance;)
and ſo more reaſon to repeat it than that of
Prayer, that never was oppoſed or cavill'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That Faculty (as one obſerves)
which God hath placed in Men to praiſe him in
an harmonious or a melodious manner, ſhews that
it is a moral Duty belonging to all Men (tho
more eſpecially the Saints of God) to be found
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63351:27"/>
in the Practice of ſinging forth his Praiſe.
God, who made nothing in vain, but all things
for his own Glory, even the Tongue of little
Birds to warble forth with their pleaſant Notes
the Praiſes of their Creator amongſt the branches
of the Trees, <hi>Pſal. 104. 12.</hi> Who made our
Tongues, and placed that ſinging Faculty in
them but the Almighty? We ſee all Men and
Women more or leſs are naturally as apt and
ready to ſing as to ſpeak. Now was this tunable
and muſical Tongue, or that Faculty of Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not given to us and to all Mortals, think
you, to ſing forth the Praiſes of our Creator?
Can any be ſo weak as to think it was given
to be imployed to ſing any other Songs, but
ſuch as are ſacred and divine? If it be a great
abuſe of the Tongue, or rather a Diſhonour to
God, for any to imploy their Tongues to ſing
profane and carnal Songs, that ſtir up Luſt, and
promote Ungodlineſs, as all will ſay doubtleſs it
is; then it follows clearly, this tunable or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
note or faculty of Singing that God
hath placed in the Tongue, can be for no other
reaſon, but that thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> with a ſweet and
melodious manner, they, nay all of them,
might diſcharge this Duty of ſinging the
Praiſes of the Almighty God. And indeed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account, as well as any other (or more
than upon any other) the Tongue may be
called our Glory, <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe thereby we, in
the higheſt manner we are capable of, do praiſe
and laud the Name of God in ſinging and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth that Glory that is owing to him from</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:63351:28"/>
Now if to ſing God's Praiſe we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> not the
Duty of all Men, it would follow, God hath
given them one Faculty in that Member for no
uſe: But of uſe it is, and Men will uſe it too;
they will ſing, and, ſay I, they may, nay more,
they ought; but not to the Diſhonour of God,
not filthy, or vain and fooliſh Songs, but ſuch
as may be to the Glory and Honour of his Name,
who made all Creatures and Things for his
own Praiſe. And ſince Mankind are naturally
thus inclined to Singing, and that this natural
Gift and Faculty might be improved (as all
others) to the Honour of God, who (as
<hi>Auſtine,</hi> in his <hi>Preface to the Pſalms,</hi> obſerves)
has left in his Word, what they ſhould ſing,
and how to perform that Moral Duty: <q>

                     <p>
                        <q>Then God takes poſſeſſion of it as his
Dwelling-place, he is ſo affected with the
Praiſes of his People, when in a right manner
they ſing to ſet forth his Glory. And (as
he minds) for the neglect of this Ordinance
in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the not improving our
Tongues and Faculties, by the Aſſiſtance
of the Holy Ghoſt, in Singing the Praiſes of
God, he may withhold the Influences of his

                     <p>Fourthly, We may perceive what the Nature
of this Ordinance of Singing is, if we conſider
how often it is in the Holy Scripture joined with
Prayer. When we are exhorted to pray to him,
to worſhip him, we are called upon alſo to ſing
his Praiſes. And thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to join them
together in his practice, <hi>When I pray, I will pray
in the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and when I ſing, I will ſing
with the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>1 Cor. 14. 15.</hi> So doth the

                        </gap>inging is of the ſame Nature with Prayer, even

a Moral Duty. Theſe things I thought good
to communicate to the conſideration of all, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the ſake of ſome weak Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> What, you then <hi>(ſay ſome)</hi> plead for
a natural or carnal thing, natural Religion and
Worſhip. Away with your Singing, we thought
all our Religion ought to be Spiritual.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We plead for Spiritual Worſhip as
well as you, and ſay, That all the Parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Duties muſt be Spiritual, or they will
not be accepted of God. But what is this to
the purpoſe? Divers Ordinances, in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and proper Nature, are Moral, and part of
natural Worſhip: Is not Prayer in particular by
all acknowledged ſo to be? And may not Prayer
be carnally performed too, as well as Singing?
nay, and ſo may any other Ordinance of Chriſt.
Another Man will tell you, whilſt you plead for
Prayer, you plead for a Moral Duty, and a
Branch of natural Worſhip: But doth that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from its Glory? No ſure, all wiſe Men
know it adds greatly to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornelius</hi> (Act. 10. 1, 2, 3.) was a Man much
in Prayer, tho a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

in its Nature, than this of Singing Pſalms,
Hymns and Spiritual Songs, if this be duly
conſidered? But as to the true or right manner
of performance of this Duty, as in all others,
we muſt have our recourſe to the Word of
God.</p>
                     <p>For though Prayer is a Moral Duty, yet it is
commanded, and alſo the manner preſcribed
how to be performed as acceptable to God; ſo
is Preaching likewiſe: (Yet every Man, by the
Light of Nature, is taught to inſtruct his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Servants, nay, and his Neighbours too
as Matters may preſent): So is <hi>Singing of Pſalms,
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,</hi> brought under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Inſtitution. 'Tis required and enjoined on
the Churches and Saints of God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-days,
with Matter and Manner how to be
performed, (as ſhall hereafter, before I have
done, God aſſiſting) be fully proved: ſo that
'tis a miſtake in our Brethren, to think we pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

their own Nature, and ſo part of natural Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

without the written Word, (the Duty I mean)
though not the Manner how to be performed.
And from the whole I draw this third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

with Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> 
                        <q>was typical, and
ſo a Ceremonial Point of Worſhip, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ceaſed; but Singing, ſaith he, with
Heart and Voice, is a Moral Worſhip, ſuch as
is written in the Hearts of all Men by Nature.</q>
As to pray in diſtreſs, <hi>pag. 6.</hi> let it be obſerved,
that I am not alone in my Apprehenſions, as
touching Singing being a Moral Duty. Here you
ſee that this worthy Man poſitively affirms the
ſame: And again, he ſaith, <q>That ſinging of
Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not a Ceremony, but a
Moral Duty, and ſo continueth in the New
Teſtament, [<hi>Cotton's ſinging of Pſalms,</hi> pag.
23, 24.] But, faith he, ſuppoſe ſinging
with Inſtruments were not typical, but only
an external Solemnity of Worſhip fitted to
the Solace of the outward Senſes of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
under Age, (ſuch as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were
under the Old Teſtament, <hi>Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3.</hi>)
yet now in the grown Age of the Heirs of
the New Teſtament, ſuch external pompous
Solemnities are ceaſed, and no external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

they offered them up to God with Incenſe,
and divers ſuch like Abſurdities in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects

other Inſtrument to be uſed in ſinging but that
of the Tongue, well tuned with Grace, from a

Singing is given forth a-freſh in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

thrice repeated in the New Teſtament,
as binding on our Conſciences as the other?
eſpecially conſidering how it correſponds with
the Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as ſhall,
God willing, be further evinced. For we have, in
a word, both Precepts for it, and Examples too.
Tho if we had no Precedents for Singing in the
New Teſtament, yet theſe Precepts are sufficient;
and where we have the one, we need not the
other.</p>

Beſides, where there is the like Ground or
Reaſon of a Law, one would think that might
tend ſomewhat to ſatisfaction: Have not we like
cauſe to praiſe God, and to ſing forth his Praiſe,
as they had? And doth not God deſerve the
like Glory and Honour from us, as from them?
And do not our Souls need thoſe ſweet Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refreſhing

your utter neglect of it upon this pretended

as their Duty to do, is the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Duty of the Saints and Churches of Chriſt
to do and perform to the end of the World.
But Chriſt did practiſe the Singing of a Hymn
with his Diſciples in Goſpel-Worſhip, and his
Apoſtles did injoyn, or require the Goſpel-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

                     <p>The Minor, as to the practice of Chriſt and

is plain, read <hi>Mat. 26. 30. And when they had

Miracles, as other Ordinances were.</head>
                     <p>MY next Argument to prove it is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Ordinance
to Sing <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> is taken from that viſible
witneſs that God did bear to it, in the New-Teſtament,
it ſeems to me, (and others whoſe
Eyes God hath opened) that it was confirmed
by a Miracle, as all other Goſpel-Ordinances
more or leſs were, <hi>Heb. 2. 3, 4.</hi> As the whole
of Chriſt's Doctrine, or the Chriſtian Religion,
was confirmed by Signs and Wonders, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Spirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to God's own Will and good Pleaſure;
ſo were moſt, if not all, Goſpel-Ordinances
particularly.</p>
                     <p>1. Meeting together on the firſt Day of the
Week was miraculouſly owned, and confirmed
by that wonderful effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt,
<hi>Acts 2. 1, 2, 3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Preaching the Word was after the ſame
manner confirmed.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Peter</hi> yet ſpeak theſe
words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which
heard the Word, <hi>Acts 10. 44.</hi> For they heard
them ſpeak with Tongues, and magnify God,
<hi>verſ. 46.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

3. <hi>Baptiſm was as wonderfully confirmed
at the Baptiſm of our Saviour, for when he
came out of the Water, the Heavens were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and</hi> to, a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, This
is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,
<hi>Mat. 3. 16, 17.</hi> And the Spirit deſcended like

                     <p>4. <hi>Laying on of Hands was after the like
manner owned and confirmed:</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi>
had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghoſt came
on them, and they ſpake with Tongues, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
God, <hi>Act. 19. 6.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Alſo when the Apoſtles</hi> had prayed, <hi>'tis
ſaid,</hi> the place was ſhaken where they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled;
and they were all filled with the Holy
Ghoſt, <hi>Act. 4. 31.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. In the laſt place, we find. Singing alſo

had not this Duty, as well as others,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63351:41"/>
been to continue in the Church as moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, he would never have witneſſed to
it after this manner: but ſince he hath, let
ſuch tremble that ſlight and contemn it. As
theſe Miracles confirmed the Goſpel in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
ſo all muſt needs confeſs each Ordinance
thus owned and born witneſs to, was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
confirmed, and as others, ſo this.</p>
                     <p>Joyntly with this Argument, it is neceſſary
alſo in the next place to conſider, how Singing
of <hi>Pſalms</hi> was brought into the Church in the
Goſpel-times, as other Ordinances were, even
as a Doctrine, Propheſying, Interpreting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
1 <hi>Cor. 14. 26.</hi> Nay, and it ſeems it was in their
Publick Aſſemblies, when Unbelievers were
admitted to come in among them, as appears
by <hi>verſ. 33.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But this was an extraordinary Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or a Singing by an extraordinary Gift, and
there are none have ſuch Gifts now; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
none muſt ſing in theſe days, ſince the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Gifts are ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the <hi>Pſalm</hi> was extraordinary as
to the Matter, is doubtful; becauſe we know
no <hi>Pſalms</hi> but the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> or thoſe
called the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David:</hi> ſo that it is very
likely it might be one of them; but let it be a
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> or an <hi>Hymn,</hi> given forth by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Gifts of the Spirit, and ſung too by
the ſame extraordinary Spirit, yet this doth not
weaken, but ſtrengthen my Argument.</p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe, as I ſaid even now, all Goſpel-Ordinances
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63351:41"/>
were witneſſed to by the miraculous
Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, in the Apoſtles days;
and ſo likewiſe they had extraordinary Gifts
to diſcharge thoſe Duties reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>1. They had an extraordinary Gift of
Prayer, extraordinary Gifts to Preach and
handle a Doctrine; the like in Interpreting
and Propheſying, ſo no doubt likewiſe for Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But if after theſe extraordinary Gifts cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Church, the Saints were to ſing no
more, but leave off that Ordinance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Churches are enjoined to ſing by
the Holy Ghoſt:</p>
                     <p>Pray conſider the direful Conſequences of
ſuch an abſurd Concluſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Apoſtles
had an extraordinary Spirit, nay, an infallible
Spirit, in <hi>Preaching,</hi> in <hi>Praying,</hi> in <hi>Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
in <hi>Interpreting</hi> the Scripture; and in the
whole of their Work, in the Adminiſtration of
the Goſpel, in reſpect of every Duty and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
thereof; theſe are all ceaſed, ſince none
have theſe miraculous Gifts now. From hence
it will follow, There's none now can, or ought
to <hi>Preach, Pray, Interpret,</hi> &amp;c. or diſpenſe
any one Ordinance of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay,
and 'tis not unknown to many, there are ſome
have lately made uſe of this Argument againſt
all Ordinances: And this I will ſay, and by the
help of God ſtand by it too, That if Singing
muſt be rejected or thrown away, by virtue of
this Argument, <hi>viz. Becauſe none have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gift to bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> forth,</hi> all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are gone, or muſt be caſt off. God deliver
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63351:42"/>
poor Chriſtians from the pernicious Arguings of
ſuch weak Oppoſers of Singing of <hi>Pſalms,
Hymns,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Songs.</hi> Beſides, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
none of thoſe Duties and Goſpel-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations,
were tied up to ſuch who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> thoſe
extraordinary Gifts, but that others who had
but the ordinary Gifts, might and ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the Adminiſtration of the ſame Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Ordinances, as well as thoſe ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
endowed: for the main Buſineſs the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſtrives to do there, was not to order the
Matter of the Worſhip of the Goſpel, but to
regulate the Manner how thoſe extraordinary
Gifts in the Church ſhould be uſed to prevent
Confuſion; and that all might be done to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the People, whilſt God ſaw good to
continue them in his Church. Doubtleſs there
cannot be a ſtronger Argument brought to prove
and confirm this Ordinance. The Holy Ghoſt
inſpired the Saints with Miracles, Gifts of the
Spirit, to bring forth a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as well as to
bring forth a Doctrine; and ſo witneſſed to it,
and eſtabliſhed it as a ſtanding Ordinance in the
Church, as being of the ſame Nature and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with Prayer and Preaching, or any other
Goſpel-Inſtitution. I will cloſe this with one
Argument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> That Duty or Ordinance which was
owned and witneſſed to by the Lord in the New
Teſtament, with Miracles, and the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Gifts of the Spirit, is to abide in the Church
as a ſtanding Ordinance. But Singing of
Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was thus confirmed, owned, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63351:42"/>
witneſſed unto. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Singing of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
remains in the Church as a ſtanding Ordinance.</p>

and all learned Men I can meet with ſay, the

in a Hymn.</hi> That is to ſay, they praiſed
God by Singing. [See Dr. <hi>Du-Veil</hi> on <hi>Act.
16. 25.]</hi> Where is the Man that ſaith the
Word will bear a praiſing of God without
Singing? if there ſhould be ſuch a Perſon, I
perceive (by my converſe with ſeveral Learned
Men) that I ſhall bring twenty, may be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to that one that will refute and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict

                     <p>But let this be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> Though all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Singing is a Praiſing of God, yet all Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of God, are not Singing his Praiſe.</p>
                     <p>I have already proved that Singing in the
Spirit in a melodious manner, is the higheſt
manner to expreſs the Praiſes of God that the
Scripture bears witneſs of; ſo that 'tis no
marvel that ſome tell you it ſignifies Praiſing
of God. But it is a poor ſorry Cauſe that puts
Men upon a temptation to quarrel with the
Tranſlators of the Bible, who from the word
they <hi>hymned,</hi> poſitively affirm, they ſang a Hymn.
This is enough to ſtumble many weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who from ſuch Dangerous and unneceſſary
exceptious may be ready to conclude, the Holy
Bible is not truly tranſlated in other places,
and ſo may not know what to receive as a Truth,
eſpecially when they ſhall render a Greek
word <hi>Singing,</hi> and another ſhall ſay it ſignifies
no more than <hi>giving of Thanks.</hi> Yet Mr.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63351:46"/>
                        <hi>Marlow</hi> ſeems to affirm no leſs, <hi>pag. 30.</hi> All
know theſe are two different things, and tho
he ſays truth, that ſays they praiſed God, when
they ſung an Hymn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> yet if they did no more
than in the common manner ſay Grace, or
give Thanks, he that ſays they Sung, tells an
untruth; in plain Engliſh, he lies; and ſo
every Man will ſay: Should I give Thanks after
Supper, and one that is by ſhould ſay <hi>I ſung
a Hymn,</hi> would not others who were with

                     <p>Nor doth it ſignify any thing, if ſome

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This can't be, ſince there is ſo great a
difference between the nature of Prayer, and
that of Singing, which I have clearly opened
in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe; there is
<hi>Mental Prayer,</hi> praying in the Heart, and
Heart-rejoicing; but there is no proper ſinging
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63351:46"/>
without the Voice, ſo that this would be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to confound the Propriety of Speech. A
whole Multitude that hear a Sermon, and ſay
<hi>Amen</hi> to what they hear, may as well be ſaid
all of them to preach, as many may be ſaid
to ſing, when there is but one only indeed that
doth ſing.</p>
                     <p>2. But further, to remove this Doubt; I
muſt ſay with Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> 
                        <q>If the Diſciples
did not joyn in ſinging that Hymn, but
only by ſilent Conſent, then they might as
well be ſaid to have taken the Bread and
bleſſed it, and broke it and diſtributed it,
and ſo the Cup; for all this Chriſt did with
their ſilent Conſent. But what our Saviour
did alone, is expreſly recorded as done by
himſelf: He took the Bread and gave Thanks;
it doth not ſay, they gave Thanks; and he
took the Cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But obſerve, this of
Singing or <hi>Hymning,</hi> is <hi>laid down</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Number, <hi>when they had ſiung an Hymn,
they departed into the Mount of Olives:</hi>
They that departed into the Mount, were
they that ſung the Hymn: Now it was not
Chriſt alone, but his Diſciples with him
that departed into the Mount of <hi>Olives;</hi>
therefore, ſaith Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> it was Chriſt
and his Diſciples that ſung the Hymn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>

the Practice of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Children of

Prayer, Preaching, and Hearing of the

                        <hi>2ly,</hi> The next Scripture-Prophecy, that ſhews
clearly how the Lord's People ſhould ſing now
in Goſpel-Days, is that in <hi>Iſa. 52. 7, 8. Thy
Watchmen ſhall life up the Voice; with the Voice
together ſhall they ſing.</hi> It is worthy your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to conſider, what Time this Prophecy did
refer to; which you may ſoon ſee, if you read
the Context, <hi>How beautiful upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are the feet of them that bring good
Tydings,</hi> &amp;c. Which the Apoſtle abſolutely
applies to the Time of the Goſpel, and to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Miniſters,
<hi>Rom. 10. 15.</hi> And the Prophet
doth not only ſay, The Watchmen ſhall lift up
their Voice, and with the Voice together ſing,
but alſo calls upon the deſolate and waſte places
to ſing together; which can refer to none but
the Lord's People, who in Goſpel-Days ſhall be
made a Praiſe to him who had been as a poor
barren and waſte Wilderneſs. For (ſaith the
Prophet) in the next words, <hi>The Lord hath
made his Arm bare in the Eyes of all Nations,
and the ends of the Earth ſhall ſee the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God,</hi> Verſ. 10.</p>

                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:63351:50"/>
Now this place directly declares the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how we ought to Sing, that is, with
Voices together. And thus I find a moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
and Learned Man ſpeak upon the place:
<q>
                           <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms</hi> (ſaith he) were Sung toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heart and Voice, by the twenty four,
Orders of the Muſicians, who typed out the
twenty four Elders,</q> (which our Annotators,
and others ſay ſignify the Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt), and ſo ſaith this Author, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>All the Members of Chriſtian Churches, <hi>Rev.
5. 8.</hi> who are made Kings and Prieſts to
God, to praiſe him as they did; for if there
had been any other Order of Singing beſides
the Body of the People, to ſucceed thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
uſed, the Lord would doubtleſs have
given directions how or what it was. Not
<hi>Moſes</hi> only, but all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſang; and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as well as the Men, alſo intimateth that
that Song <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rev. 15. 3.</hi> which,
ſaith he, the Proteſtant Churches getting <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over the Beaſt, with Harps in their hands,
and Singing the Song of</hi> Moſes refers to
that Song and manner of Singing <hi>Exod. 15.</hi>
                        </q>
1, 2. And there is no doubt of it but it doth.
<q>Moreover, (ſaith he) <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretells, in the
days of the New Teſtament, that God's
Watchmen, and diſſolates loſt Souls, (ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by deſolate and waſte places) ſhould,
with their Voice, Sing together, <hi>Iſa. 52. 8, 9.</hi>
The Song of the Lamb (ſaith he) was with
many together, <hi>Rev. 7. 9, 10.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
expreſly command the Singing of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63351:50"/>
                           <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Songs,</hi> not
to any ſelect Chriſtians, but to the whole
Church, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16. Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas</hi> ſang together in Priſon, <hi>Act. 16. 25.</hi>
and muſt the Publick hear only one Man
Sang (I muſt ſay it would be a ſtrange ſight
to ſee and hear, and without any Warrant
from God's Word, or Practice of any Church
of Chriſt). To all theſe (ſaith he) we may
add the Practice of the Primitive Churches,
the teſtimony of the ancient and holy <hi>Baſil</hi>
is inſtead of many, <hi>Epiſt. 63.</hi> When one of
us (ſaith he) hath begun a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the reſt
of us ſet in to ſing with him, all of us with
one Heart, and with one Voice; and this
(ſaith he) is the common practice (ſpeaking
of <hi>Baſil</hi>) of the Churches of <hi>Egypt, Lybia,
Thebes, Paleſtina, Syria.</hi> To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

                        <q>The Objections (ſaith he)
made againſt this, do moſt of them plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
joying to Sing in Heart, as well as
in Voice, as that by this means others out of
the Church will ſing, as alſo that we are not
always in a ſuitable Eſtate to the matter
Sung, and likewiſe that all cannot Sing with
underſtanding, and are not all therefore
who have underſtanding to join in Heart and
Voice together. Are not all the Creatures
in Heaven, Earth, Seas, Men, Beaſts, Fiſhes,
Fowles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> commanded to praiſe the Lord?
and yet none of theſe, but Men, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

under the Old we read of ſinging together with
united Voices without Inſtruments, and the
ſame in the New: So that unleſs Inſtruments
of Muſick (as <hi>Organs,</hi> &amp;c.) were uſed in
the New Teſtament, they are unlawful to be
brought into the Worſhip of God; and in vain
is it for any to object againſt Singing, becauſe
Muſical Inſtruments were uſed under the Old
Teſtament, ſince the one is given forth in the
New, <hi>viz.</hi> ſinging Pſalms, without mention made
of Inſtruments of Muſick, and ſo practiſed
alſo. But to that Objection I purpoſe to give
a full Anſwer when I come to conſider of
Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi>'s Book.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg. 4.</hi> If Chriſt and his Diſciples never
practiſed, nor injoyned on the Churches any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
or Duty, but they left a ſufficient Rule
how ſuch Ordinances or Duties ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
and yet Chriſt and his Diſciples did
ſing, and injoyned ſinging of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63351:54"/>
Churches; then they left a ſufficient Rule how
ſinging of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be performed.
But Chriſt and his Diſciples did practiſe and
injoin ſinging of Pſalms and Hymns, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi>
Chriſt and his Diſciples have left a ſufficient
Rule to ſhew how ſinging of Pſalms and Hymns
ſhould be performed.</p>
                     <p>This Argument cannot be denied; therefore
let our Brethren conſider where the fault lies,
who do not ſee the way how to ſing, <hi>&amp;c. 'Tis
ſaid,</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful in all God's Houſe, as
a Servant,</hi> and was careful to do every thing
<hi>according to the Patern ſhewed him in the Mount;
but Chriſt, as a Son, is faithful over his own Houſe.</hi>
Now ſince Singing was required of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by Chriſt (for what the Apoſtles injoyned
by the Spirit, Chriſt injoyned) in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
certainly he has left a ſufficient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
how it ought to be performed, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it would reflect upon his Wiſdom and
Faithfulneſs. Strange! is Singing practiſed by
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and injoined on the
Churches, and is there no certain way to know
what that Singing is, nor how it ſhould be
performed? I ſtand in a maze to ſee how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
ſome are in their Minds and Sentiments

'tis no more than to praiſe or give Thanks to

                     <p>ONE Objection that is brought againſt
Singing, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> We do not know
what we ſhould ſing, and therefore do not ſing
in our Congregations. I muſt confeſs, if Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was practiſed and injoined, and nothing
was left in God's Word to ſhew us what it is
we are to ſing, it would be ſtrange, and a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Plea againſt the practice of it; but ſuch
a thing could not ſtand conſiſtent with the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Spirit. But, bleſſed be God 'tis
not ſo, as we by his Aſſiſtance ſhall now further
make appear: For we have, firſt, our Pattern,
which is Chriſt's practice with his Diſciples,
in this Caſe as in others. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Rule, which
are thoſe Precepts laid down in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Chriſt and his Diſciples ſung an Hymn.
And be ſure the Matter of it was Spiritual, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
performed by thoſe Sacred and Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63351:55"/>
and in the Sacred Worſhip of God, <hi>i. e.</hi>
just as they had celebrated the Holy Supper. But
to ſpeak to the Rule; ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Be ye
filled with the Spirit, ſpeaking to your ſelves in
Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and making melody in your Hearts to the
Lord. So, Col. 3. 16. Let the Word of Chriſt
dwell in you richly, in all Wiſdom, teaching and
admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, and Hymns,
and Spiritual Songs, ſinging with Grace in your
Hearts to the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here you have ſix Things obſervable, or the
words contain ſix parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, The Matter to be ſung in the general,</hi>
viz. <hi>the Word of Chriſt;</hi> Let the Word of
Chriſt dwell in you richly in all Wiſdom, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſinging with Grace in your Hearts.</p>
                     <p>Like as the Word of Chriſt ought to dwell
in us richly, that we may meditate thereon, and
be able to preach it, hear it, and underſtand
it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo to ſing it. The Word of Chriſt is
therefore poſitively laid down to be the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we muſt and ought to ſing in the general;
for we are injoined, to have it dwell richly in us
in this place, more eſpecially to ſing it, than on
any other account.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Singers, that is, the Church,
or Churches to whom he wrote, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Saints and faithful in Chriſt at <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
and at <hi>Coloſs,</hi> and in them to all other Saints
and Churches of Chriſt to the end of the
World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:63351:56"/>
Thirdly, More particularly the Matter to be
ſung, <hi>viz. Pſalms, and Hymus, and Spiritual
Songs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Manner, or how it ſhould be
performed, <hi>i. e.</hi> with Melody, or Spiritual Joy
in the Heart, or <hi>Grace.</hi> What he calls Melody
in our Heart in one place, he calls Grace in
the Heart in the other. The <hi>Tongue is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi>
but it muſt be tun'd with Grace, or
the Muſick will not be ſweet in Chriſt's Ears.
<q>In Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. (ſaith one) a
gracious Heart takes Wings, and mounts up
to God to join with the Celeſtial Quire: It
is Grace which fills the Heart for, and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the Heart in this Duty.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Maſter of the <hi>Chore,</hi> the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart;
we muſt look to the Heart in Singing, that it is
purged by the Spirit. God is the Creator of
the whole Man, and therefore will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
and praiſed with the whole Man. The
whole Man is bought with a Price; our Tongues
as well as our Spirits are not our own; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought to <hi>glorify God in our Bodies, and
in our Spirit, which are the Lords,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19,
20. <hi>My Heart is fixed, O God, my Heart
is fixed: I will ſing and give praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 57.
7. <hi>Awake my Glory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I my ſelf will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake.</hi>
What was this which <hi>David</hi> calls his
Glory? (all tell you) it was his Tongue; and
in Singing and Praiſing of God, the Glory of
it much lies, when the Heart is filled and fixed
with Grace in the diſcharge of this Duty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:63351:56"/>
                        <hi>So in</hi> Pſal. 108. 1. O God, my Heart is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
I will ſing, and give praiſe with my
Glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <q>It is not a muſical String,
but a working Heart that is harmonious.
<hi>Mary</hi> ſung with her Tongue, and her Heart
was in her magnificent Song.</q> And, as ſaith
another Godly Man; <q>When we ſing <hi>Pſalms,</hi>
&amp;c. let us take heed that we have the ſame
thing in our Mind, that we warble forth
with our Tongues, and that our Song and
our Heart do not run ſeveral ways. If (ſaith
Mr. <hi>Wells</hi>) we in Singing only offer the
Calves of our Lips, it will too much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Jewiſh Service.</q> Men may hear, or
pray, as well as ſing carnally; therefore we
ſhould remember to do as the Apoſtle teaches,
<hi>to ſing with the Spirit, and with the Vnderſtanding
alſo,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 15.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, The End, <hi>viz.</hi> to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
the Lord, and lift up his Praiſe. God is to
be our true and only Scope, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſet forth
his Glory ought to be our ultimate End, I
mean, when we ſing and perform all other
Duties of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Now then, ſince the Word of Chriſt is the
Matter in general that ought to be ſung; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
we are not left without Directions by the
Spirit about this Ordinance, (let Men ſay
what they pleaſe) for as 'tis Chriſt's Word we
ſhould and ought always to preach, and hear,
ſo 'tis his Word we ſhould and ought to ſing:
And as we are not tied up by the Lord in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63351:57"/>
Preaching, to do no more than barely read the
Scripture, or quote one Scripture after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(which would be rather Reading than
Preaching) but may uſe other Words to edify
the Church, provided they agree with, or are
congruous to the Word of Chriſt, or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scripture, (and yet we call that the Word
of God which is preached, and ſo indeed it is);
ſo when that which we ſing is taken out of
God's Word, or is Scripture, abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous,
truly and exactly agreeing thereunto,
it may as truly be called the Word of Chriſt,
as our Sermons are, and may be ſo called.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But you add words to your Hymns that
are not in the Text you refer to.</p>
                     <p>So we do in Preaching; but if thoſe words
agree with the Text, 'tis ſtill the ſame Word,
and may be opened thereby the better to the
underſtandings of the People. Beſides, let it
be conſidered, that we have not the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in thoſe words in which they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Pen-Men of the Scripture, for they
wrote the Old Teſtament in <hi>Hebrew</hi> words,
and the New-Teſtament in <hi>Greek</hi> words. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Tranſlators differ much in words in
giving the true ſenſe of the Original, ſo that
this Objection is a mere contentious Cav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>.
Moreover, there are in our Bibles (all Learned
Men know) a multitude of Suppliments, or
words added, to make good the ſenſe, the
Originals being too ſhort to expreſs it in
our Language. Now you may as well, nay,
if not with more colour of reaſon ſay, part of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63351:57"/>
the Scripture is Human, and not Divine, as to
call our Sacred Hymns ſo: And ſo you may
by the ſame Argument call our Sermons like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
'Tis evident, as Mr. <hi>Barton</hi> obſerves (in
his Epiſtle to his Book of Hymns) <q>That <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin
Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and many others
have ſignified the Primitive Church uſed,
not only <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> but other Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Scripture to put in Songs for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Hymns may (as he ſaith) be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than Pſalms, and more ſuitable to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-occaſions,
ſuch in which Chriſtians may
truly ſay they do teach and admoniſh one
another in; ſuch (ſaith he) as inculcate our
Duties, and reprove our Vices, out of moſt
piercing Paſſages of Holy-Scripture, and
ſuch as may anſwer or ſuit with all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and accommodate all Occurrences,
and are no Innovations, but reduction to
primitive Uſe and Order.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Remarkable is that paſſage in <hi>Euſebius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Chriſtians practice in ſinging of
Hymns to Chriſt as to God. <hi>Plinius Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
to clear the Chriſtians to</hi> Trajan, <hi>adds this,</hi>
viz. <hi>Only that they held early Aſſemblies in Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Hymns to Chriſt, as unto God,</hi> Euſeb.
<hi>lib. 3. cap. 33.</hi> Doubtleſs they were compiled
by ſome among them out of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Spirit of God might enable them,
in the ſame manner as they did, and we do
compile our Sermons: and I ſee no other obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
lies here againſt our Hymns, than lies, or
may be made againſt our Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:63351:58"/>
Thus as to the general Direction the Holy
Ghoſt has given about what we ſhould ſing,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Word of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But then, Secondly, we have particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
as to the Matter we ought to ſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Texts, viz. <hi>Pſalms, and Hymns,
and Spiritual Songs.</hi> I know ſome do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that all theſe three allude to the Book
of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> becauſe theſe three are the Titles,
they ſay, of <hi>Davids Pſalms.</hi> Though that
were granted, that ſome of <hi>David's Pſalms</hi> are
called <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> yet I ſee no reaſon
that all other ſpiritual Hymns and Songs ſhould
be excluded.</p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe we often find in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> or Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi>
mentioned, as comprehending all thoſe Hymns
and Songs contained therein, without calling
them the Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs
of <hi>David,</hi> ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 42. &amp; 24. 44. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
                     <p>Moreover this ſeems to exclude other Scripture-Songs,
that they themſelves own may be ſung,

our bleſſed Saviour, with his eleven Diſciples,

and ſing an Hymn when we have done, and ſo
exclude publick Aſſemblies for that part of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63351:60"/>
God's Worſhip. But to proceed; we read, as I
have again and again ſhewed you, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
injoins Singing on the Churches, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 19.
Col. 3. 16.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle injoins the Lord's-Supper
on the Church of the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 11.
23, 24.</hi> But ſome may ſay, he doth not bid
every one of them to break Bread; how doth
it follow every Member ought ſo to do? there
would be no end of ſuch Objections. But by
this Rule, any Precept injoined on the Churches
may be reſtrained to a few Perſons only, and ſo
it would open a Door to Men to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from being concerned in other parts of
Goſpel-Duties and Worſhip: therefore where a
Duty is injoyned by the holy Spirit on the
Churches, without the leaſt hint or intimation
that it concerns only ſome of them, nay, and an
Ordinance in which there is the ſame parity of
Reaſon, why one ſhould be found in it as well as
another, that Duty concerns the whole Church,
or every Member: but it is ſo in the caſe of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs:
pray what ground has one Man to ſing from
hence more than another?</p>
                     <p>Are not all equally concerned to praiſe God?
nay, and having received equal Mercies, Bleſſings
and Priviledges, to ſing his Praiſes, ſince 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of all, without the leaſt exemption of
any one?</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> But what ground is there to ſing
thus in the Church before or after Sermon?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> As much ſurely as there is to pray
before or after Sermon; nay, 'tis evident, if
we do not take our Rule to pray before and
after <hi>Sermon from thoſe general Precepts</hi> that
injoyn Prayer, then I do declare I know no
Rule at all for it in all the New Teſtament, for
we have neither Precept nor Example in the
caſe, but where we read of Duties that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
only ſome Perſons, and not the whole
Church, the Holy Ghoſt mentions the Perſons,
1. Either by their Relations they ſtand in one
to another; Or, 2. Elſe by their Condition
in the World. Or, 3. By their Office or Place
they ſtand in.</p>
                     <p>As there are particular Duties that concern
Parents, Children, Maſters, Servants, Miniſters,
Members: Alſo Kings, Subjects, rich Men,
poor Men, Men in Adverſity, or Men in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
all ſorts and conditions of Men.</p>
                     <p>But here this Duty comes under no ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Conſideration; but as 'tis the Duty of
all to hear God's Word, and to pray with united
Hearts, ſo to ſing together with united Voices,
there being no other manner or way preſcribed,
as I have ſhewed, for the diſcharge of that
Duty or Ordinance of God.</p>
                     <p>But I would fain be reſolved by my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
or any other, what Ordinance of God or
Duty it is that appertains to his Worſhip which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63351:61"/>
ought to be performed in private, that may
not be performed in publick.</p>
                     <p>Take what famous Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſpeaks as to the Anſwer of this Objection,
'tis thus ſtated by him, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> Scarce any Example can be given
of any intire Congregation that ſung together
mentioned in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 
                        <q>Tho no Example could be given
for it, yet it is a ſufficient Warrant for the
Duty if there be a Precept; and, ſaith he,
the Precept is plain, <hi>Col. 3. 16.</hi> where the
whole Church of <hi>Coloſs</hi> is exhorted to have
the Word of Chriſt dwell in them richly,
and to admoniſh one another in Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to ſing with Grace or holy Melody to the
Lord. If God, ſaith he, had reſerved this Duty
to ſome ſelect <hi>Choriſters,</hi> he would have given
ſome Directions in the New Teſtament for
their Qualification and Election; but ſince
he ſpeaketh nothing of any ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he
commandeth this Duty to the whole Church.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>2dly, The Practice of God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old,
(<hi>i. e. Moſes</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) is a
further Solution to this Objection; for there
is an Example of ſinging together; and beſides,
that there was a mixt Multitude with them
too is evident, who, no doubt, ſung with them,
having received the like Mercies they did. See
<hi>Exod. 12. 38.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Manuſcript I have by me before cited
(which ſeems to be wrote by a Man of Parts
and good Ability) who, ſpeaking to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63351:62"/>
ſays much to the ſame purpoſe; Firſt,
<q>That we have a Precept which is more than
a Precedent. Secondly, That we have Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
for it in the Old Teſtament.</q> And ſay
I, it being no ceremonial Rite, but a moral and
perpetual Duty, that in the Old Teſtament is
as much a Rule for us herein, as their religious
reading the Scriptures, and keeping of Days of
Prayer and Faſting, and Days of Thankſgiving:
if this be not ſo, in vain are our People preſſed
and ſtirred up to thoſe Duties by the Authority
of thoſe Texts in the Old Teſtament, as I ſaid
in <hi>Chap. 4. pag. 47.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, we find 'tis propheſied of, that in
Goſpel-days, as has been ſhewed, <hi>Sions</hi> Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and deſolate Souls, or waſte places, ſhould
lift up their Voice, and with their Voice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall ſing, <hi>Iſa. 52. 7, 8.</hi> And certainly
that in <hi>Rev. 19. 1, 2, 3, 4.</hi> thoſe Hallelujahs
that ſhall be ſung in the Goſpel-Churches at the
downfal of <hi>Babylon,</hi> will be doubtleſs with
Voices, ſince 'tis ſaid to be the <hi>Voice of much
People, as the Voice of many Waters, and as the
Voice of mighty Thunderings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Chriſt (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>) and his Diſciples
when they received the Lord's-Supper, which
was a Church-Act, they were an intire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and they after Supper, ſung an
Hymn. To ſay that one ſung it, ſaith he,
and the others joined in Spirit, ſaying, <hi>Amen,</hi>
hath no foot-hold in the Text, it might as
well be ſaid, they all took the Bread, they
all bleſſed it, and gave it, in that one did
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63351:62"/>
it, and all the reſt joyned in Spirit and
conſented in that, and in the bleſſing of it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 'tis ſaid [they] ſung the Hynm, not he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
yet [he] is ſaid to give Thanks, or to bleſs
the Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>It is no ſtrain of Wit, ſaith he, but a
ſolid and judicious Expoſition of the
fourth Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to make it
a Deſcription of a particular viſible Church
of Chriſt, according to the Platform and
Patern of the New Teſtament; whereas the
four living Creatures are four ſorts of Officers,
ſo the twenty four Elders ſet forth the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the Church in reſpect of their
ripe Age, <hi>Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3.</hi> and twenty four
in number anſwering to the twenty four
Orders of Prieſts and Levites, <hi>1 Chron. 25.
9, &amp;c.</hi> and theſe are all ſaid to joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſinging a new Song unto the Lamb.</q>
If his Expoſition may not be admitted, yet
all Expoſitors agree, that by the four Beaſts
and twenty four Elders, are meant the Church
and the Officers in the Church, and then their
ſinging together doth confirm the manner of
Goſpel-ſinging with united Voices together in
God's Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But what ground is there for the
Church to joyn in ſinging of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with
Vnbelievers?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Unbelievers joyning with them,
is one thing, and their joyning with Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
is another: And ſince 'tis a Church-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(as we have clearly proved all along it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63351:63"/>
is) what Rule or Ground hath the Church
to put Unbelievers forth of their Aſſemblies if
they knew them from others? there may be
Unbelievers in the Church, and there may be
Believers out of the Church.</p>
                     <p>2. What ground hath the Church to pray
with Unbelievers? certainly the Communion
together in Spirit is more cloſe and intimate
than that of uniting the Voice; ſo that if it
be unlawful to let them ſing with us, 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to let them in their Hearts joyn in Prayer
with us.</p>
                     <p>Muſt not the Children have their Bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Strangers will get ſome of it? Beſides, in
the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when Singing was
brought in amongſt them, as well as a Doctrine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Unbelievers coming
into their Aſſemblies: and 'tis one Reaſon he
gives why they ſhould take heed to prevent
Confuſion, and not to ſuffer one to bring in a
Doctrine, (or many together) and another an
Interpretation, and another a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to put
them all on Singing, and ſo have all theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
confounded together, in a diſorderly
and confuſed manner: So <hi>1 Cor. 14. verſ. 26.</hi>
compared with <hi>verſ. 23.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. If Singing be a part of natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or a moral Duty, as Prayer is, this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is gone for ever: So that he that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
what we ſay here, will do nothing unleſs
he can make it appear Singing the Praiſes of
God is a meer poſitive Precept, and had never
been known to be the Duty of Mankind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63351:63"/>
ſome written Law or Preſcription. Are not
all Creatures called upon to ſing and praiſe their
Creator? and have not Unbelievers cauſe to
praiſe God, nay, ſing his Praiſe for the Mercies
and Bleſſings God doth beſtow upon them?
Nay, have they not cauſe to praiſe God for
Chriſt and the Goſpel? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is Singing
but praiſing of God? And would you not have

the Law of Creation, to ſeek to God for
what they want, and to thank him for what
they have: this is due unto God, owing
unto him as Creator and Benefactor; and
though Singing be a part of inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
yet it is as an addition of Order, and
a regulation of a natural Duty: And as
there is no Man but is bound to pray for

                     <p>3. In the third place, which is yet worſt of
all, you would have this of <hi>Teaching and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing

3. 13. which you apply to ſuch who had the
Gift to preach Miniſterially, and to ſing too by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63351:68"/>
the ſaid Gift. In anſwer to this, in the first
place, I thought we ſhould not have had you
to affirm, the Apoſtle means, by Teaching and
Admoniſhing here in this place, to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                     <p>Now as to the firſt part of your Aſſertion;
had you read Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> it might
have removed this Miſtake, and ſo prevented
your pains to trouble the Reader with ſuch an
Expoſition of the Text: I find him anſwering
an Objection, that directly includes part of
yours, in theſe words following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 
                        <q>The Apoſtle to the Epheſians and
Coloſſians doth not ſay, Sing one to another in
Pſalms, but ſpeak or preach one to another;
or, in other words, Teach and admoniſh one
another; the Pſalms dwelling in their Hearts
they were to diſpoſe them in a way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and admoniſhing; but as for ſinging, he
makes no mention of that, until he came to
teach them the manner of diſpenſing the words
of Chriſt unto God in one Verſe, and then
indeed he teacheth them to ſing in the Spirit,
making Melody with Grace in the Heart.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>If I do not miſtake you, this Objection
contains part of what you ſay, and pray take
his Anſwer; I do not doubt but he gives the
true ſenſe of the place.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 
                        <q>Such as tremble at the Word, saith
he, (as the framer of this Objection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
himſelf to do) they ſhould rather
bow their Judgments and Practice to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Language,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63351:68"/>
than bow the Senſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to their own Conceptions againſt the
Language of Scripture; it is one thing to
ſpeak one to another in <hi>Pſalms, and Hymns,
and ſpiritual Songs,</hi> as is done in ſinging,
and another thing to preach and teach one
another out of the Pſalms, and Hymns, and
ſpiritual Songs. 'Tis true, they were to teach
and admoniſh one another out of the Pſalms,
and the ſcope of <hi>Paul</hi> will teach that; but
if <hi>Paul</hi> had meant that, to wit, that they
ſhould teach and preach one to another out
of the Pſalms, he would not have ſaid,
Speak ye one to another in Pſalms, or with
Pſalms, but out of the Pſalms, for ſuch is
the Language of the Holy Ghoſt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing

                     <p>'Tis evident, my Brother, that <hi>Paul</hi> is not
a ſpeaking here to Miniſters, but to the whole

he doth, much leſs about the exerciſe of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

granted 'tis intended by the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Col.

you hint or imagine of one ſinging alone has
been fully anſwered, that never having been the

                        <q>And, ſaith Mr. <hi>Sidenham,</hi> many think
there can be no ſuch uſe of Singing, as to
teach and admoniſh one another by it; but
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63351:69"/>
if we conſider, there are many Leſſons to
be learn'd one of another from this publick

the Word, Baptiſm, and Breaking of Bread
alſo? The <hi>Quakers</hi> have not only got a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

for Heart-Preaching alſo: And what you ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Eſſence of theſe Duties being in the
Heart, (and how 'tis the Heart or Spirit only
in Duty and Ordinances that God looks at) and
from hence ſeek to make void Singing with the
Voice, it doth (as all Men may ſee) ſtrike
through the Loins of all External Acts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip, as before ſhewed: For as I told
you in the firſt Chapter, the Eſſence of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and every other External Duty, may as
well be ſaid to lie in the Spirit as this of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pſalms and Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, ſince
God is ſo much pleaſed, as you intimate, with
the bare Internal Worſhip of the Heart, without
the bodily Organs, and with Prayer particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
why do you not excuſe the Tongue from
that Service likewiſe, and ſay, that External
Expreſſions in Prayer, or praiſing God with
the Tongue, is a low formal thing, and to be
rejected?</p>
                        <p>But I can't but ſmile at one of your firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;

firſt Chapter I have proved; I mean, that which
you call the Eſſence or Being of Singing in the
Heart, or inward Joy. Brother, I have ſhewed
you, that Singing and Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of a different Nature to that of Prayer;
Prayer may be performed in the Heart without
the Tongue; but there is no proper Singing or
Preaching without the Organs of the Tongue,
and therefore all your whole Fabrick is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with one blaſt: for this Error of yours,
is like that of the firſt Concoction; If you have
got no other proper ſinging of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> than
what we plead for and practiſe, nor no other
can be found warranted in God's Word, Then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> muſt be the true and right Ordinance,
and manner of performance of it, likewiſe.
Let Men but deſtroy the practice of an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as 'tis by ſo many practiſed, and has
been from the beginning, and as we conceive
and believe in a right manner, unleſs they have
another Form to preſent to our ſight, that we
may have time to compare them with God's
Word, to ſee which may be neareſt the Rule
in our Judgments, they do nothing but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
the World as well as us. You have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
us with one, I muſt confeſs, which only
has that Name given to it by your ſelf, but it is
not the thing, <hi>i. e.</hi> it is no proper Singing at
all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:63351:73"/>
You talk of <hi>the Eſſence of Sin in the Heart,</hi>
as well as the Eſſence of Duties being in the
Heart or Spirit. What do you mean? can sin
be no where but in the Heart, becauſe it is
there? or can a thing be where its Being or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is not? There may be much Evil in the
Eyes; we read of <hi>Eyes full of Adultery.</hi> Nay,
and I muſt tell you, that the Eſſence or Being
of Sin is in the Tongue likewiſe. Pray ſee
what the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the Tongue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

a Fire, a World of Iniquity: ſo is the Tongue
amongſt our Members, that it defileth the whole
Body, and ſetteth on fire the whole courſe of
Nature, and is ſet on Fire of Hell,</hi> Jam. 3. 6.
Certainly the Eſſence of Sin is in the Tongue, as
well as in the Heart, or you are out in your
term; and the Eſſence of Singing, ſome will
tell you, is wholly in the Tongue. And now
ſince the Tongue doth thus diſhonour God, (by
the way) let me tell you, there is great reaſon
it ſhould not be idle, but be imployed to praiſe
and ſing to the Honour of God.</p>
                        <p>If by Eſſence of Sin, you mean the Riſe,
Spring, or Fountain of Sin, I ſay you ſpeak
Truth, and good ſenſe too; for it is out of the
Heart <hi>that proceeds Fornication,</hi> &amp;c. Yet ſome
Sins may be ſaid, to have their proper Eſſence
or Being in the Life, as well as in the Heart,
and may riſe from a Temptation from without
alſo.</p>
                        <p>We will grant you likewiſe that the Heart is
the Fountain or Spring of moſt Actions, all our
Duties muſt ſpring or flow from thence; <hi>i. e.</hi> the

of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
for Correction, and for Inſtruction in

then the Book of the Pſalms, and for inſtruction
by Singing them too, becauſe ſo required by the
Holy Spirit, <hi>Eph. 5. 19. Coloſſ. 3. 16.</hi> May you
not as well ſay they are of no uſe to us? The
Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> good Men look upon as the
Heart of our Sacred Bible, and as fruitful a Book
for Saints in Goſpel-times as any Book in the
Old Teſtament; but if there be any <hi>Pſalms</hi>
that can't ſo well be ſung as ſome others, God's
People are at their liberty whether they will
ſing them or no: however, unleſs you can tell
us there are others called <hi>Pſalms,</hi> beſides theſe,
you ſay nothing, for we are required to ſing
<hi>Pſalms.</hi> And as to thoſe things contained in
<hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms</hi> that are hard to be underſtood,
they may be opened to the People before they

                        <p>As touching ſinging Prayers, I have ſpoken
to this already. Though we are againſt humane
Forms of Prayer, yet the Singing of <hi>David</hi>'s
Pſalms (wherein there are ſome Prayers) are of
Divine Inſtitution; and therefore 'tis lawful to
ſing Pſalms and Hymns that have ſome Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
Prayer-wife in them. Our Brethren ſay,
praiſing of God in Prayer, is Singing; and
indeed, if they did not thus conclude, I am
perſwaded they could not ſatisfy their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to lie wholly ſhort of this Duty; and
therefore in their ſenſe, ſinging of ſome part of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63351:77"/>
Prayer is lawful, or elſe Singing is ſomething
they do not as yet own, nor can tell us what
it is.</p>

Singing, or elſe you have it not; and that is
the chief thing, the only thing from whence
it's called Singing, that is, a melodious Voice,

take that away, and 'tis no more than inward

ſufficient to juſtify the lawfulneſs of Womens
ſinging together with the Men the Praiſes

                        <p>What need you talk of Order about Singing,
or of Womens Singing, when the Eſſence of
it being in the Heart, is ſufficient, though the

                        <p>But to proceed;</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This you ſay we have plainly and clearly
delivered to us,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 20, <hi>to</hi> 34. How is it
then, Brethren? when ye come together, every
one of you hath a Pſalm, hath a Doctrine, hath
a Tongue, hath an Interpretation; let all things
be done to edifying.</p>
                        <p>That which you infer from hence is, that
this is the Rule for our Practice, <hi>viz.</hi> one by
one, or one after another, muſt ſpeak and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
their Gifts, and not all together; and ſo
he that has the Gift of a Pſalm, he is ſingly,
or alone, by himſelf to ſing as in Prayer and
Preaching.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle directs that Church in
the exerciſe of extraordinary Gifts. There
was, 'tis clear, confuſion about the exerciſes of
thoſe Gifts in the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> it ſeems
this was their practice ſome times, <hi>viz.</hi> Every
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63351:82"/>
one of them who had a Doctrine, and that
had a Pſalm, and ſo of the reſt, would come
forth with them together. May be many Preach
together who had Doctrines, and at the ſame
time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every one that had a Pſalm, they would
come forth with their Pſalm and Sing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> and
ſo thoſe who had the Gift of Tongues, and a
Gift to interpret, might do the like, which the
Apoſtle ſhews them was Confuſion; and if
they did thus, and Unbelievers come into their
Aſſemblies at ſuch time, would not they ſay
they were mad?</p>
                        <p>Now, 1. to open this place of Scripture, it
will be neceſſary to conſider what diſorderly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
it was <hi>Paul</hi> reproves them of; and no
doubt it was the Confuſion before mentioned,
two, three, or more, bringing forth their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
together; and others, who had other
differing Gifts coming forth together with them
too, ('tis very like at the ſame time).</p>
                        <p>2. The Rule to regulate theſe Diſorders.
And now let this once and for ever be noted,
and well heeded, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ordinary way
of the Adminiſtration of all Gifts, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all Ordinances in the Churches, muſt
be the Rule for the extraordinary Gifts, and
performance of Ordinances.</p>
                        <p>3. Then in the third place, we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the manner of the performance of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and exerciſe of Gifts, according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Gifts and Ordinances.</p>
                        <p>And now as to the Gift of Teaching, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting,
Propheſying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only one was to be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63351:83"/>
the Mouth; <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak one by one,
and let the other judg: if any thing be revealed
to him that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace.</hi>
To act contrary to this Rule, is Confuſion; and
ſo of ſome other Gifts and Ordinances, whole
Nature were in themſelves the ſame, ſo they were
to be done. And now as to Singing, that being
always performed with Voices together, both
in the Old Teſtament, and by Chriſt and his
Diſciples, and by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
on the Churches; they who had a Pſalm,
that is, as I conclude, a Pſalm of <hi>David,</hi> to
bring forth by an extraordinary Spirit, which
might not be the Matter of the Pſalm, but the
Manner of bringing it forth in an unknown
Tongue, and it may be in a Tune too that
others might not underſtand, and ſo upon both
reſpects others could not ſing with him, nor the
Church be edified; he was not ſo to bring forth
his Pſalm, unleſs there was an Interpreter who
might give it forth to the People, that they
might ſing together, as always that Ordinance
was practiſed in the Publick Congregation.
And this appears to be the ſenſe of the place by
<hi>Paul</hi>'s own words; <hi>When I pray, I will pray
with the Spirit, and with the Vnderſtanding;</hi>
that is, in a known Tongue, to my own
Underſtanding, and to the Underſtanding of
others. <hi>And when I ſing, I will ſing with the
Spirit, and I will ſing with the Vnderſtanding
alſo:</hi> that is, If I ſing in the Church, I will
not ſing in an unknown Tongue, ſo that others
cannot underſtand what I ſing, and ſo cannot
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63351:83"/>
ſing with me. He doth not mean, doubtleſs,
his own Underſtanding only, but the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of others alſo; ſo that, according to
the Nature of the Ordinance, all might be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and all might be comforted.</p>
                        <p>Now this being ſo, as I am well ſatisfied 'tis
the meaning of the Spirit, what an endleſs ſtir
is here of one Man's ſinging alone in the exerciſe
of an extraordinary Gift, which cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Wit of Man from the Text? much
less had it been ſo, would it have been a Rule
to the Churches in ordinary Adminiſtrations of
Chriſt's Ordinances. Though for ſeveral to
preach together, that would be Confuſion; yet
to ſing together would be none, but the greater
and the more ſweet Melody, as <hi>Mr.</hi> Sid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Congregation ſing together, ſay, Are they
not mad? becauſe this ſort of Singing was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
practiſed, both among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
among the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations. And ſo much
to this Text.</p>
                        <p>And whereas you ſay, If any one had ſuch a
Gift, and came forth to ſing alone in the
Church, (as you fancy ſome did in that

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny the latter, Singing was no

Spirit and Manner, than Prayer, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all other Ordinances; and by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

now to perform one Duty, ſo not another.</p>
                        <p>And if we muſt throw one Ordinance away
from thence, we muſt (as the <hi>Non-Churches</hi>
ſay) lay them all aſide, and practiſe none at all,
till we are endowed with Power from on
High, as the Apoſtles were, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Preach,

Propheſy, and ſing Pſalms, Hymns, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Songs, by Inſpiration,</hi> or by the <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For as Singing, (it being a moral Duty as
well as Prayer, ſo it was in the Church of the
<hi>Jews</hi> before the Glory of their Temple-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip):
ſo Prayer and Preaching, being ordinary
Duties, and parts of Natural Religion (as
well as brought under Divine Inſtitution for the
more orderly and ſpiritual performance of
them), yet in the glorious Time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
were all done by an extraordinary Spirit,
or by Miraculous Gifts; 'tis evident, therefore,
extraordinary Gifts in the Goſpel-day, were
not only ſuited (as you imagine) to tune their
Hearts and Tongues to ſing the Praiſes of God
only, but alſo to <hi>Pray, Preach, Propheſy,</hi> and
ſo to perform the whole of Goſpel-Ordinances
and Worſhip, which was to confirm each Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
in particular, and the whole of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion in general, <hi>Mark 16, 17, 18, 19.
Heb. 2. 3, 4.</hi> And therefore we have no more
reaſon to lay aſide or neglect Singing the Praiſes
of God, till thoſe extraordinary Gifts ſhall
return, (which we have no ground to expect
ever will) than we have to lay aſide Prayer,
Preaching, Baptiſm, the Lord's Supper, and
every other Duty and Ordinance, ſince Singing
of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is injoined on the Churches as

Men ignorantly apply Prophecies to the

what you ſpeak, <hi>pag. 28.</hi> makes againſt
your ſelf; for if the Inſtitution of Singing
which was in the Levitical Temple-worſhip,
was compleated as to the Antitype in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

is no doubt but 'tis ſo, for when the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type

are Songs, which contain the Praiſe of God.
If it be Praiſe, and not of God, it is not an
Hymn; if it be Praiſe, and of God, if it
be not ſung, it is not an Hymn: it muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that it may be an Hymn, have theſe
three things, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> Praiſe; 2. And of
God; 3. And a Song.</q> Now this being an
Hymn our Saviour and his Diſciples uſed in
praiſing of God, the Doctor affirms, they ſung;
and ſo did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas.</hi> But this is the old
way of ſuch who ever oppoſed a Truth, when
pinch'd, preſently fly out upon the Tranſlators,
'tis <hi>ſo to be read in the Greek,</hi> &amp;c. whereas all
the World knows, that as our Tranſlators were

Men: Beſides, our <hi>Annotators,</hi> and all
Expoſitors, generally ſay 'tis truly rendred;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63351:87"/>
and 'tis a bad thing unjuſtly to find fault with
the Tranſlators of the Holy Bible.</p>
                        <p>To perſwade your Reader, if you could,
that the Diſciples did not ſing with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
(or they did not ſing together) you bring,
that Paſſage of <hi>Hannah</hi>'s <hi>mental praying,</hi> or
ſpeaking in her Heart, 1 <hi>Sam. 1. 11, 13.</hi> How
impertinent this is, I may leave to all. You ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſtill, becauſe there is a Mental or Heart-praying,
there is a Mental or Heart-ſinging al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:
you may, after the ſame manner ſay, there is a
Mental or Heart-preaching likewiſe. There is
no proper Singing, I tell you again, without
the Voice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But you think you have done it at laſt,
from</hi> Acts 4. 24. <hi>Where it is ſaid,</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
lifted up their Voice with one accord
to God; and yet did, <hi>as you conclude,</hi> do no
more than pray as we do, that is, only one was
the Mouth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Some ſay they lifted up their Voice
by an extraordinary manner, by a miraculous
Spirit that was upon them, and all uttered the
ſame thing together Prayer-wiſe.</p>
                        <p>2. Others ſay, they lifted up their Voice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Singing: And I find one great Author
calling this <hi>the Apoſtles Song.</hi> 'Tis evident, the
Matter they uttered, is part of the Second
Pſalm.</p>
                        <p>3. Our Annotators intimate, as if all their
Voices were joined together, in ſaying <hi>Amen.</hi>
Now there can be nothing concluded or inferred
on any certainty for your purpoſe from hence:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63351:87"/>
If I ſhould ſay, that as they prayed, for ſo
they did the Text ſays; yet when 'tis ſaid they
lifted up their Voice to God with one accord,
they ſung the Second <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it may be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
ſo as any thing elſe. However, I have
made it appear plain, that it may be ſaid, there
is a Praying together, (though but one is the
Mouth) but there is no Singing together, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
but one ſings, and the reſt are ſilent, and ſing
not.</p>
                        <p>In your ſixth place, you reply to that in <hi>Acts
16. 25.</hi> about <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſinging Praifes,
you ſay juſt nothing, <hi>pag. 32.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For though <hi>Hymnos is nto praiſe;</hi> yet, ſay
the Learned, 'tis ſuch a Praiſing as is by Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Here I perceive you would quarrel again
with the Tranſlators: 'tis plain, you are not
willing to have any Singing to be in your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
If there is no Singing, you ſhould not
have told us ſo much about the Eſſence of it:
don't abuſe the Text, 'tis not ſaid, they prayed
and praiſed God; but, 'tis ſaid, they prayed,
and ſung Praiſes unto God. Though all Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, is a praiſing of him, yet all Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
is not a Singing his Praiſes.</p>

                        <p>Pray, Brother, let you and I leave thoſe nice

the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and to all Sacred Hymns
and Songs.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe, 1. Here is Singing enjoined,
that's evident.</p>
                        <p>2. Here is the Word of Chriſt preſcribed, as
the Matter in general to be ſung.</p>
                        <p>3. Here are <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual
Songs</hi> as the Form; and this cannot be denied,
without palpable Violence offered to the Spirit.</p>
                        <p>But you would not have Old-Teſtament
Names given to New-Teſtament Things, <hi>in
Singing,</hi> but give no reaſon for it; Prayer was
called <hi>Prayer</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and Praiſes
called <hi>Praiſes,</hi> and Laws called <hi>Ordinances;</hi>
and ſo they are called in the New: And why
not Singing calling <hi>Singing,</hi> and Pſalms of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
called <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> called <hi>Hymns</hi> in
the New Teſtament, as well as in the Old?
Theſe Cavils argue you want Matter to object
againſt Chriſt's Ordinance of Singing, as you
fain would do. You intimate, as if the Holy
Ghoſt had injoined Singing of ſuch Pſalms,
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, that no Body
knows what they be; but you think they may
be known hereafter; as if we had an imperfect
Goſpel, and can't underſtand the Duties of it,
till ſome extraordinary effuſion of the Spirit
comes upon us. So it may be objected in other
Caſes, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do about <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and
the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> who cry down our Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

have any Rule to expect Men ſhould bring forth
any thing in the Worſhip of God by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Spirit to be preached or ſung, but what
is contained in the Word of Chriſt, or is taken
out of the Scripture, or agrees thereunto; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that is a perfect Rule both for Matter and
Form, in the performance of all Religious
Worſhip, and Ordinances of the Goſpel; and
that which you call carnal and formal, I ſay, is
ſpiritual. The Prayers that a Miniſter makes
in the publick Congregation may, and oft do,
contain many Scripture-Expreſſions, (may be
half his Prayer may be ſuch) and who ſhall ſay
he doth not pray ſpiritually? Nay, moreover,
and that Prayer ſome will tell you is a Form to
others, which he that is the Mouth puts up,
and many times I have heard ſome good and
godly Chriſtians ſpeak ſoftly over the ſame words
in the Congregation. Now ſince all Forms are
cried down by you, ſure this muſt needs be a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Crime, or a carnal and formal Practice.
There is nothing, I tell you again, without its
Form: Is not the reading of God's Word a
formal thing? and yet dare you ſay that is no
Duty to be performed in the Church? If a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
thing, then, by your arguing, ſay I, 'tis no
Duty to read the Scripture in private neither.
Now becauſe all legal Forms are gone, muſt
all Goſpel and Spiritual Forms go too? In all
Adminiſtrations we ſhould ſee to our Spirits that
they be not formal, but that with Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
we perform every Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Have we
not a kind of Form preſcribed us by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63351:92"/>
and Siſters, and others too when they put
up their Bills, and tell us what they would
have us to ask or deſire of God for them? this
would run us into ſtrange <hi>Scruples.</hi> Muſt we
tell them they muſt not put words into our
Mouths, we muſt pray as the Spirit moves us,
and can't tell whether we ſhall pray for them
or no?</p>

                           <q>that we ſay, that Prayer under the
Goſpel is an Ordinance of the ſame nature
it was under the Law, and therefore Singing
under the Goſpel may be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

under the Goſpel as it was under the
Law.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But their Prayers, you ſay, were delivered
formerly with dark Shadows and carnal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances;
for whilſt the Prieſt was offering
the Sacrifices, the Prieſts and Levites in Songs
with Inſtruments of Muſick delivered ſuch
Prayers, and Pſalms, and Praiſes as were
appointed for the publick Service of God:
Therefore (ſay you) whatſoever Singing
hath been, or ſtill may be in Goſpel-times,
may as well differ from the Old-Teſtament-Temple-ſinging.</q>

                           <pb n="163" facs="tcp:63351:92"/>
For we muſt not ſing with united Voices,
with Grace in our Hearts to the Lord, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the ſinging in ſuch a form or manner
under the Law, is no Rule for us; becauſe they
sing not only with their Voices, but had Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Inſtruments alſo.</p>
                        <p>Why now I reaſon thus; We muſt not pray
with our Voice in Goſpel-days, or at leaſtwiſe
the Saints ſo praying under the Law can be no
Rule for us, becauſe they had dark Shadows
mixt with their Prayers as you affirm they had;
ſo that ſince we have the Eſſence of both theſe
Duties in our Spirit, which God looks more

not with our Tongues neither pray

one follows as naturally from the
Premises as the other, by which all may ſee
the Conſequences of your Arguments againſt
Singing.</p>
                        <p>Alas, the true matter of the caſe is this; If
People would be rightly informed:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vocal Prayer</hi> is God's Ordinance, and a
Moral Duty as well as inſtituted; and the Saints
praying and keeping Days of Faſting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Days of Thankſgiving under the Law,
is a Rule for us: but all Shadows and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
they uſed in Prayer under that Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,

And ſo in like manner the ſinging the Praiſes
of God with our Voices is God's holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

<hi>Calvin</hi> ſhews God diſcovered the abſolute
need and neceſſity of a perfect and compleat
Righteouſneſs in order to Juſtification and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
with God, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the Creature
muſt be without Sin, or attain to a Ceſſation
from the Thoughts of Evil, which figured
forth the neceſſity of Chriſt's perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
and of that Spiritual Reſt ſuch who
believe in him enter into. All that are in the
old Nature, or whilſt they remain under the
old Covenant-ſtate, do labour and are heavy
laden, there is the ſix days work in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type,
but when they come to Chriſt, believe
in Chriſt, then they ceaſe from their own
Works, and enter into Reſt, according as
Chriſt hath promiſed, <hi>Mat. 11. 28, 29.</hi> then
they enter into the Antitype of the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,

                        </p>
                        <p>3. This alſo appears by the Nature of the

Singing the Praiſes of God; but the External

                        <p>But the Truth is, if there was no more to

ſome contend for) than what you have ſaid,
they might be lawful too. Therefore I ſhall

Prayer; but we ſhould conſtantly go to God
as we can, not only for continuance of thoſe
Mercies we have, but for further ſupplies of
our inward and outward Wants, which are
the chiefeſt part of Prayer. But Singing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a fulneſs of enjoyment, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Breaking forth,</hi> and therefore requires a
greater Meaſure of the Holy Spirit; for we
can pray for what we have not, but we ſhould

Lips, when our Hearts are far from him,
and our fear towards him taught by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Men; and therefore when I conſider
the preſent State and Frame of the Churches
of Jeſus Chriſt, I wonder that ſo many ſhould
be for Singing, when their Hearts are ſo much
below Prayer; for if we ſhould go from
Saint to Saint, we ſhould find that this is the
general Cry, I have a dead and ſtony
Heart—I can't pray, I want the Spirit.—
Now if thus it be, then where is the Spirit
of Singing? Will you lie, and expreſs that
with your Lips to God, which you have not in
your Hearts? <hi>Pag. 46, 47.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſubſtance of what you ſay here,
is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That a greater Meaſure of the
Spirit of God is required in Singing, than there
is required in Praying; but you give no
Reaſon for it. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When I
pray, I will pray with the Spirit; and when I
ſing, I will ſing with the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>1 Cor.
14. 15.</hi> He doth not hint, he needed greater
help to do the one, than to do the other. There
is no Duty nor Ordinance of the Goſpel,
that can be performed acceptably to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Spirit, or the gracious Influences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And certainly no Man beſides Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi>
will ſay there is more need of the Spirit in its
greater Influence in ordinary Occaſions, or in
common Worſhip to praiſe God, nay, to ſing
his Praiſe, than there is to pray, and in the
doing other Duties. You mention that in <hi>Iſa.

52. 38.</hi> of <hi>Breaking forth.</hi> Why is that then
a Vocal Singing? it was hinted by you (even
now) to be ſome kind of ſhouting or rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
<hi>pag. 29.</hi> as if it was no ſuch thing (as
here you ſeem to grant it to be) when you
think it will ſerve your turn another way: But
all may perceive, by your arguing againſt Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the manner you do, (that though the
Eſſence in your ſenſe be in our Spirits, and as
others ſay, Singing is comprehended in their
Praying, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they Praiſe God); yet none
of theſe in truth is proper Singing in your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for it it be, you contend againſt that which
all Chriſtians ſay they do own and perform.</p>
                        <p>But to proceed. There may be, 'tis plain, an
extraordinary Spirit of Prayer at ſome times,
and an extraordinary Influence in Preaching,
and an extraordinary Occaſion to perform thoſe
Duties likewiſe, and ſo in Singiug: But muſt
not we therefore be found in the performance
of each of theſe Duties at any other time? And
have not all true Chriſtians always in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the chiefeſt cauſe or ground of Singing
forth the Praiſes of God that can be, <hi>viz.</hi> the
conſideration of Redeeming and Regenerating
Grace, though ſometimes to ſuch degrees, they
do not find that livelineſs in their Spirits to do
it? Moreover, we ought to ſtrive to be filled
with the Spirit, that we may both Pray, Preach,
and Hear alſo. But ſometimes we have not
thoſe fillings of the Spirit in ſuch a meaſure as at
other times, yet muſt Pray, Preach, Hear, and
Sing alſo; for the Argument or Motive of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63351:97"/>
(as of our other Duties,) doth not lie in our
being ſo exactly qualified to do it, or in our
extraordinary fitneſs for the Duty, but in the
requirement of God, 'tis his Ordinance, and
may be our Sin if we are not ſo fit to praiſe
God as we ſhould be, nor are no more fit to
pray and hear the Word preached.</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>But ſome may object,</hi> Doth not
<hi>James</hi> only injoin Singing of Pſalms, when
People are merry, or find great cauſe of inward
Joy in the Lord?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, by no means, this muſt not be
granted: for if ſo, then People muſt never
pray but when they are afflicted. Do but read
the Text, <hi>Is any among you afflicted? let him
pray. Is any merry? let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> Jam.
5. 13. Sure 'tis the Duty of the Lord's People
to pray as well when they are not afflicted, but
are in Health, and in Proſpirity; 'tis always on
fit and proper Occaſions to be done, but when
afflicted more eſpecially, then in a more than
ordinary manner to be in the Duty of Prayer.
So, and in the like manner, 'tis our Duty to
rejoice and ſing the Praiſes of God always, on
all proper Occaſions; but when any are more
then ordinarily lifted up with the Goodneſs of
God, or filled with the Comforts of the Holy
Spirit; which is intended doubtleſs in that
phraſe, <hi>Is any Merry?</hi> then they ſhould in an
eſpecial manner ſing Pſalms, or Hymns, of
Praiſes to God. Alſo from hence we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that as it is the Duty of one afflicted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thus by himſelf to pray, ſo when the whole
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63351:97"/>
Church is afflicted, they in an eſpecial manner
ſhould keep days of Prayer together; and ſo
they oftentimes do on ſuch an account: Yet
it is the Duty of the Church to pray at other
times notwithſtanding. Why ſo it is in the caſe
of Singing, when the whole Church of God
hath received ſome ſignal Mercies in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner, they ought together to give
Thanks to God, and ſing his Praiſe; but yet,
notwithſtanding, they ought to ſing the Praiſes
of God at other times, as well as pray at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times; and nothing is in the leaſt hinted
here in this place by the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> to the
contrary.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But we have no Command to ſing in
our Publick Aſſemblies, either before or after
Sermon, nor any Precedent that any Goſpel-Church
did ſo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt take heed and avoid need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Queſtions and Contentions. We have no
Command to pray in our Publick Aſſemblies,
either before or after Sermons; nor no Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that any Goſpel-Church did ſo, Muſt we
not uſe that Practice therefore? I am ſure this
Argument is as ſtrong againſt the one as 'tis
againſt the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> But we are commanded to pray always,
and that is a very convenient time when the Word
of God is preached; every thing is ſanctified
by the Word of God and Prayer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> So we are commanded to <hi>rejoice ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
1 Theſſ. 5. 16. and in every thing to give
thanks to God, Phil. 4. 4, 6. And to ſing his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63351:98"/>
Praiſes, is the higheſt way or manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jocing
and giving Thanks to God we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of attaining to, as it appears in all the
Scripture; And alſo by the example of the
Holy Angels, who this way rejoice and give
Thanks to God. Beſides, the Preacher may
pray before he comes out of his Cloſet, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
in his Heart when in the Pulpit, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
thoſe general Precepts: ſo that you may
ſee what ſuch kind of Cavilings will bring us
to. 'Tis evident we read of ſeveral Sermons
the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preached, and <hi>Paul</hi> too, and
ſome of them in Church-Aſſemblies, but no
more mention is made of praying before or after
their Sermons, than is of their Singing. And
is it not as convenient a time when we hear
the Excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Love of God, and the Happineſs of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
opened, then to ſing and praiſe God,
as it is a proper Seaſon to pray to God for a
Bleſſing upon the Word? there is the like pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Reaſon for the one as there is for the
other. If any has the advantage, 'tis the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Singing, for two Reaſons; the one
is a Precept, the other a Precedent. The Precept
is given us by <hi>David,</hi> containing a Prophecy
of the Goſpel-days, and Goſpel-Church. Pſal.
100. 1. <hi>Make a joyful Noiſe unto the Lord, all

And in the New-Teſtament we have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

and to give themſelves to reading and
meditation, and to hold faſt the form of
ſound Words, rightly dividing the Word of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63351:100"/>
Truth—So that where the Scripture gives
us a liberty, we may uſe it; but it is our Sin
to take it where it is forbidden, as you ſay,
you have ſhewed in a form of Prayer and
Singing.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> In vain is all this: for all the Saints
and Miniſters of Chriſt in all the World, know
there is no one form of Preaching laid down
in all the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>We have no direct Precept nor Example
to preach in the form of taking a Text of
Scripture, and to raiſe a Doctrine from it, and
then Generals and Particulars, with Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
'tis left to the faithful Servants of God
to make uſe of ſuch a Form or Manner as the
Spirit of God may help them to, and the beſt
Form or Method they ought and do make uſe
of, which they judg may moſt tend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the People. That place you mention of
our Saviour taking a Text, and then preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it, is ſcarcely true; however 'tis a
greater proof for a Form of Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in our Publick Aſſemblies, than for taking
a Text to preach from it.</p>
                        <p>The Text ſaith, <hi>He went into the Synagogue
of the Jews on the Sabbath-day, and ſtood up
to read. Aud there was delivered to him the
Book of the Prophet</hi> Iſaias; <hi>and when he had
opened the Book, he found the place where it
was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Luk. 4. 17, 18. And he cloſed the Book</hi>
(ſo do not we) <hi>and gave it again to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
verſ. 20. And began to ſay unto them, This
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63351:100"/>
day is this Scripture fulfilled in your Ears,</hi>
verſ. 21. We read of no more he ſpake unto
them from that Scripture. And as touching
thoſe general Directions you mention, of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
ſpiritual Things with Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>1 Cor. 2. 13.</hi> the Apoſtle doth not preſcribe a
Form of Preaching, but ſhews, as <hi>our Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
obſerve, how they did diſclaim thoſe Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Athenian Philoſophers, uſing a plain
and ſpiritual Stile, giving the naked Truths of
God, without any paint of gawdery Phraſe,
ſpeaking the Oracles of God as the Oracles of
God, fitting Spiritual Things to Spiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or opening one Scripture by another.</p>
                        <p>But certain it is, they preached by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and extraordinary Spirit or Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And ſo do not we, but by an ordinary
Spirit from the mediate Word, and therefore
muſt ſtudy, and are left to uſe what Method
we think may be (as I ſaid before) moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for the Edification of the People: ſo
that although the Matter of our Sermons are
God's Word, and ſo Divine and Sacred, yet
the Form or Method, you may as well call
Formal and Human, as ſo to call our Sacred
Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God hath graciouſly owned ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
this form of Preaching, and daily
doth, for the converſion of many Sinners;
and ſo he doth our way of Singing, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
and refreſhing the Souls of many Saints.
—We have matter to be ſung plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Word of Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and
they are well known; and alſo Hymns and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63351:101"/>
Songs, which are alſo eaſily known by
ſuch who are Spiritual, whether they be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Word of Chriſt as to the Matter of them
or not, as it may be known, that the Doctrine
is ſo which we hear preached.</p>
                        <p>As touching <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
God's Word as well as materially ſo: and
ſince we are exhorted to ſing Hymns and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Songs, I ask whether thoſe Hymns and
Spiritual Songs could be without a Form, either
immediately, or mediately precompoſed by the
Spirit? and whether the Spirit of God doth
not, may not aſſiſt God's Servants now in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed
Hymns, as he did of old?</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>But may be you will ſay,</hi> They are
not in Metre in the Scripture, but other words
are added to make them fit to be Songs, and that
is humane.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have none of the words in our
own Tongue, which were originally given forth,
by the Holy Ghoſt; for the Holy Men of old
who gave forth the Scriptures, ſpake them either
in <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> words. And therefore
ſome may object our Tranſlation of the Bible
is Humane, and our Scripture not God's Word;
beſides we have many humane Supplements, as
I ſaid before, added, to make the ſenſe good in
our Engliſh Tongue: And as touching Meter,
Proſe and Verſe is all one, if the ſame Truth
be contained in the Verſe as is in the Proſe: And
if it be equal Feet, or meaſured fitly to be
ſung, we do not matter Rhime at all. And ſo
ſome tell you <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms</hi> were left in the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63351:101"/>
Original. But ſhould we miſs it, either in the
form of Preaching, or Singing the Praiſes of
God, ſince we can appeal to God we do both
as nigh the Rule of the Word as we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Light and Underſtanding, Who do you
think will be moſt excuſable in the Day of
Chriſt, we, or ſuch, who becauſe they are not
arrived to a ſatisfaction about the Form or
Manner of Preaching, or of Singing, will do
neither of them, or at leaſtwiſe wholly live in
omiſſion of the laſt, and yet ſay they believe
'tis an Ordinance of Chriſt?</p>
                        <p>And let me tell you, to admit of this nice
Exception againſt practiſing of an Ordinance,
becauſe we do not know the exact Form, this
will run us into a multitude of needleſs and
frivolous Objections in the adminiſtration of
other Ordinances; one or two of which I have
met withal.</p>
                        <p>As for Example. In Breaking of Bread,
(ſaith one) you ought to have but one Loaf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Chriſt's Body was but one entire Body,
and the Church is ſaid to be but one Bread;
therefore (ſaith he) if you have many Loaves,
you err, in the form of this Ordinance; and as
by you practiſed, 'tis humane and deviſed. Saith
another, As ſoon as you have broke the Bread,
you muſt pour forth the Wine; becauſe ſo ſoon
as Chriſt's Body was broke, his Blood came
forth. Saith a Third, You muſt eat all, and
let none remain; which others deny. One ſays,
We muſt eat plentifully, for Chriſt ſo bids his
Friends, <hi>Cant. 5. 1.</hi> Saith another, A little
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63351:102"/>
quantity of Bread, and ſo of the Cup, will
anſwer the Form of the Adminiſtration.</p>
                        <p>So in the Form of Baptiſm, one may ſay, You
muſt Baptize the Perſon forwards; ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Backwards; one may ſay, with a ſwift
Motion; another may ſay, it muſt be done with
a ſlow Motion, and let the Perſon lie ſome time
buried in the Water, that we may have the clear
Repreſentation of the Burial of Chriſt. Would
not theſe be ſilly Objections? And yet theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to the Form of the Adminiſtration of
Chriſt's Ordinance. But as the Apoſtle ſaith,
1 <hi>Cor. 11. 16. If any ſeem contentious, we
have no ſuch Cuſtom, nor the Church of God.</hi>
We read, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a long time
had loſt an Ordinance, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>ſitting in
Booths in the Feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> Nehem. 8.
14. <hi>which had not been done from the days of</hi>
Joſhuah <hi>the Son of</hi> Nun, <hi>verſ. 17.</hi> ſo that none
were then living to tell them the Form of thoſe
Booths. Suppoſe now that one had ſaid, they
muſt be made this way, and another that way;
and they ſhould not have agreed about the
Form or Faſhion of theſe Booths, would this
have juſtified ſome others among them to have
ſaid, We will have no Booths at all, unleſs there
be ſome extraordinary Prophet to ſhew us the
Form or Manner how they ſhould be made?
No ſure, there were none among them that we
read of that were of ſuch a Spirit; or if there
had, doubtleſs they would have been worthy
of Reproof: but they all, <hi>according as they
found it written in the Law, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:63351:102"/>

Alſo there is an Art in Preaching; and all young
Men, when they begin to take upon them that
Work, need inſtruction how to handle a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And ſo I may ſay in Praying too; but
I have ſhewed in this Treatiſe, that Men are as
apt; by natural Inſtincts, to ſing, as they are to
ſpeak: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews, in 1 <hi>Cor. 14.</hi> that
all who have Spiritual Gifts, ſhould uſe them
with all Wiſdom; ſo that the Church, and all
God's People, may be edified. <hi>If the Trumpet
gives an uncertain Sound, who ſhall prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63351:103"/>
to the Battel?</hi> The Method of Preaching
muſt be learned and improved, and that well
too. Some who have great Gifts, yet cannot
utter themſelves in an Eloquent manner
to the profit of others, and it may be, becauſe
they are againſt ſtudying the Rule or Art of
Speaking: But all the World knows the way
of Singing is eaſily learned; And who gave
Men thoſe Faculties of Learning? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Gifts, as well as Spiritual, are to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the Honour of God. Is not Reading of
God's Word an Ordinance of the Goſpel, and
part of God's Worſhip? and muſt not People
learn to read? And is not that a piece of Art as
well as Singing? can People read unleſs they are
learned?</p>
                        <p>'Tis well if ſome of them who make this
Objection, do not ſuffer their Children to ſing
vain Songs, whilſt they plead againſt ſinging of
<hi>Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs.</hi> But ſince
'tis ſo natural for all, eſpecially in Youth, to learn
to ſing, and ſo eaſily attained, ought not Parents
to inſtruct their Children about what they ſhould
ſing, and what not, that ſo Art and Nature too
(as ſome call them) may be improved to the
Honour of God? Grace makes Natural Gifts
and Arts to become Spiritual; for the very
words of gracious Perſons are, or ought to be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual:
the more of Art Men have to expreſs
themſelves, the more uſeful, by the Grace of
God, they are made to others. If it had not
been for Art and Learning, how ſhould we have
come to the knowledg of the Scriptures, they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63351:103"/>
being locked up from us in unknown Tongues?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> Some have objected againſt Singing,
becauſe that Gift and Manner, as they ſuppoſe,
which was uſed in the Primitive Time in Singing,
was not continued, and ſucceſſively handed down
to us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the ſame manner they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
againſt the Bible, and ſay, We ought not
to receive it, becauſe God did not continue the
Gift of Tongues in the Church, that by virtue
of thoſe Gifts, the Old and New Teſtament
(without Humane Art) might be delivered to
us: Nay, and againſt Preaching too, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
thoſe Gifts in the Apoſtolical manner of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was not continued nor handed down to us;
nay, what Ordinance had not loſt its Primitive
Form under the Apoſtacy?</p>

you; and notwithſtanding your Concluſion ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of much Bitterneſs, I would fain have
mine end with all Sweetneſs: if there is any
Tartneſs, I cannot well help it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt. Whereas you infer ſinging together of
<hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, or any humane precompoſed
Forms, is a corrupting the pure Worſhip of
God, in mingling Law and Goſpel, or humane
and divine things together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:63351:104"/>
Firſt, I infer, That to ſing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms and
Scripture-Hymns, and ſacred Songs taken out
of the Word of Chriſt, together in the publick
Worſhip of God, is an holy Ordinance of
Chriſt, and not in the leaſt to mingle Law and
Goſpel together any otherwiſe than the Holy
Ghoſt hath done it; for Moral Duties are the
ſame in the Law and Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; Whereas you ſay, This will lead us
to return from whence we came, <hi>at a Dog to
his Vomit, and as a Sow that was waſhed, to
her wallowing in the Mire.</hi> I ſay, 1. You do
not write like an humble and trembling-hearted
Chriſtian, but ſhew too much Gall and Worm-wood
in your Spirit. And, 2. I ſay, to ſing
the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and other <hi>ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Hymns
and ſpiritual Songs,</hi> is to build up
the <hi>old waſte places, and reſtore the ancient Paths
to dwell in,</hi> and a going forward and not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly; You would, you ſay, have the
Leaders among us ſeriouſly conſider, that are for
ſuch formal Singing (as you call it) whether
they will be able to plead at the Bar of Chriſt
for this Practice, tho they may urge it on their
fellow-Brethren here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you put up a
kind of Prayer, that God would give us a
true ſight and ſenſe of the evil Conſequences of
this Error (as you are pleaſed to call it) that
we may not cauſe his People to ſin, but that
with ſound Doctrine we may ſtrengthen the
weak Hands and feeble Knees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:63351:104"/>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt intreat you to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will be able to give a good account at
the Bar of Jeſus Chriſt, for endeavouring to
diminiſh from God's Word; nay, from Chriſt's
New Teſtament,; for ſure we are, ſinging of
Psalms, Hymns and ſpiritual Songs is one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
found therein, which you ſtrive to take
way, and fooliſhly plead only for a thing called
the Eſſence of it, without the Act or diſcharge
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Duty according to the nature of the
Ordinance, and ſo contrive a new kind of
ſinging out of the dark Imagination of your
Heart, and add that in the ſtead of it, which
is not underſtood by the generality of Mankind,
and ſo make us to believe (if you could)
that Chriſt hath left an Ordinance that there
is no way to come to any Certainty how it
ſhould be performed; and hereby alſo lay a juſt
occaſion of Offence, or a Stumbling-block in
the way of weak Chriſtians, to think they may
practiſe Ordinances acceptably to God (which
requires the bodily Organs) without the Body,
and ſo deny the Body to glorify God, tho re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
to that end; and expoſe our Glory
(<hi>viz.</hi> our Tongue) to Reproach and Shame, and
conſequently rob God of ſome part, nay, one
great part of his glorious Praiſe, and his poor
Church of much ſweet Comfort and Soul-Refreſhment
in his bleſſed Ordinance, as I have
ſhewed in the firſt Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, conſider what an account you will
have to give to the Judg of the Quick and Dead,
for ſaying, when the Scripture ſaith <hi>they ſung,</hi>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:63351:105"/>
(viz. <hi>Chriſt and his Diſciples</hi>) they did but give
Thanks, or <hi>ſay Grace,</hi> from the remote and
indirect Signification of the Greek Word; or
elſe ſung alone, and not his Diſciples with him.
See what Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> hath ſaid in

                     <p>
                        <q>4. Chriſt and his Apoſtles would not have
uſed it in the Lord's-Supper, which is a
Feaſt of the New Teſtament; nor would
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> have uſed it in Priſon among
the Gentiles; nor would the Apoſtle have
injoyned it on the Churches.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>5. The Light of Nature is never wont to
teach us Types and Shadows; doth it not as
well teach us to praiſe God in ſinging with
our Tongues in times of our rejoycing, as to
cry to God with our Voices in times of
diſtreſs?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly; Whereas you would have us to
conſider, that if we err from the Rule in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Praiſes to God contrary to his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether we do not worſhip God in
vain? I ſay to you, whilſt we thus offer Praiſes
to God, it appears we worſhip him according
to his Appointment, and so acceptable to him,
and to his Glory, and our Comfort.</p>
                     <p>Strange, ours is not right and ſpiritual Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!
and yet you can find no other way according
to the Rule to perform that ſacred Duty and

                     <p>2. 'Tis the Muſick of Ordinances, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

and moſt ſublime Ordinances of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>3. Singing is the Muſick and Melody of

                     <p>5. 'Tis and ſhall be the Muſick and Melody
of Heaven, the glorious and glorified Saints
and Angels ſend up their Praiſes this way.</p>
                     <p>But, my Brethren, be intreated to cry to God,
that you may <hi>pray and ſing with the Spirit, and

                  <p>IT grieves me I have further occaſion to
trouble you after this manner: I know not
what ſhould move Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> to write
his <hi>Appendix,</hi> juſt at a time when he was told
I was writing an Anſwer to his firſt Diſcourſe:
he might have had a little Patience, and have
ſtaid till my Treatiſe was publiſhed, whereby
he might the better have perceived, whether
what he wrote the laſt Year would abide the
Teſt or Trial of God's Word or not: This is
therefore his ſecond Attempt in publick againſt
God's holy Ordinance of ſinging of Pſalms,
Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before any body appeared viſibly
to oppoſe, or put a ſtop to his undue Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
For what Call he had to begin this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
at ſuch an unſeaſonable time, I know
not; but ſince he has done it, certainly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> none
can ſee any juſt cauſe to blame me for ſtanding
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63351:109"/>
up in the Defence of that Truth of Jeſus Chriſt,
which I am ſo well ſatisfied about, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in, and that too as it is practiſed by the
Church, to whom I am related as an unworthy
Member, and above twenty Baptized Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
beſides in this Nation. Tho before I went
about it, I offered my Brethren (him or any
other) a ſober and friendly Conference in the
Spirit of Meekneſs, which I could not obtain,
tho I did not give ſuch a publick Challenge as
my Brother intimates in that ſtrange Epiſtle he
hath wrote to me; but upon the coming forth
of his Book, I was troubled, and would have
had it been diſcourſed in the General Aſſembly,
but that was not conſented to; and then I
told my honoured and Reverend Brethren my
purpoſe was to give an Anſwer to his Book, but
did not enter upon it till I was urged by ſeveral,
and particularly by Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> himſelf, before
divers Witneſſes, in ſuch kind of words as theſe,
<hi>i. e. Anſwer me like a Man.</hi> Whether he is
anſwered like a Man, or but like a Child, is left
to your Conſideration, 'tis done according to
that Light and Ability God hath been pleaſed
to beſtow upon me.</p>
                  <p>But if he, or any of his Helpers, do ſee
cauſe to reply, they muſt anſwer ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who have wrote upon this Truth, like
Men, and Men too of great Parts, Learning
and Piety, or let them not trouble me nor the
World any more. As touching his Epiſtle to
the Churches, I ſhall take but little notice
of it, nor of that he hath writ to my ſelf,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63351:109"/>
ſith in my Judgment, neither of them ſignify
much; you are Men of greater Wiſdom than
to be frightned out of an Ordinance, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
from ſeeking after the Knowledg of it,
with theſe ſcurrilous Names of <hi>Error, Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Human Tradition, prelimited Forms, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Error, Carnal Forms, Carnal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
&amp;c. Theſe are hard Words, and do not
beſpeak a trembling Heart, nor a humble Spirit,
and better becomes a Man that pretends to Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.
But what ſome Men want of ſound Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
they think to make up by hard Words
and Confidence; but this will never do with
you. How hath our Practice of baptizing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> been branded with the reproachful
Name of Error? and 'tis very obſervable how
ſome Men of far greater Parts and Ability than
my Brothers or mine, either have cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Reign of Chriſt, Converſion of the
Gentiles, and calling of the Jews, as a groſs
Error, as witneſs Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of late. 'Tis Arguments I know you
look for, and if you find thoſe of Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>'s
to prevail againſt what I have ſaid, do not
regard what I have wrote in the leaſt; for I
would have your <hi>Faith</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks)
<hi>to ſtand in the Power of God, and not in the
Wiſdom of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n.</hi> The ſmallneſs of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our Churches who are in the Practice of
this Ordinance, I alſo know will ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with you, provided it be proved to be
a Truth of Jeſus Chriſt: What tho there was
not one of our Churches that had Light in it,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63351:110"/>
it would certainly the more concern them to
enquire after it. And tho he hath ſo courſly
ſaluted me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet I am not concerned at it
further, than to bewail his Confidence and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
to ſay no worſe, I know no Men in
any Age, who appeared firſt to vindicate a
Truth, which others call an Error, but have
met with the ſame Uſage I meet withal from
our Brother; who, I hope, is a good Man, and
means well, yet is he ſtrangely beclouded. As
I have been a Preacher up of Spiritual Worſhip
(as he ſays) and that too more than thirty
Years (tho a poor and unworthy one;) ſo
through the Grace of God, I hope ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to do unto the end of my days; and 'tis
only Spiritual Worſhip, you may perceive, I
plead for, in contending for ſinging of Pſalms,
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, none of which
three can be without their ſpecial and particular
form. But muſt they needs be therefore carnal
and humane Forms which appertain unto
them? I ſee 'tis time to ſtand up for the Form
of Ordinances, for the Form of Doctrine, and
for the Form of ſound Words; for if we muſt
part with ſinging of Pſalms, Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from
his pretended Arguments about Forms, all
external Ordinances muſt go as well as that of
Singing: In a word, we muſt give up our
whole viſible Profeſſion, and wait for thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gifts of the Spirit that were in the
Primitive Time, if we muſt not ſing till
we have that extraordinary Gift to do it,
which ſome had in the Apoſtles Days, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63351:110"/>
like in diſcharge of every Goſpel-Ordinance,
which were to abide in the Church to the end of
the World.</p>
                  <p>He may as well therefore ſay, I do but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
that excellent Gift in Preaching (when
I preach) which was in the Primitive Goſpel-Church,
as thus to charge me in the caſe of our
ſinging by the ordinary Gifts of the Spirit:
Read his Epiſtle to me, <hi>Append.</hi> p. 15.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me as if my Brother does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the nature of Moral Duties, or natural
Worſhip, but miſtakes, and thinks natural or
moral Worſhip muſt needs be carnal, tho we
never plead for the performance of any Duties
that are moral naturally in themſelves, without
the help and aſſſtance of God's Spirit, and the
Graces thereof in our Hearts. Is it not part of
natural Religion and Worſhip, to fear God, to
love God, and truſt in God, and that too with
all our Hearts, and with all our Souls, and with
all our Strength, and love our Neighbours as
our ſelves? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Duties appertain to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion; yet without the divine Help and
Influences of the Spirit, we can do none of them
in a right manner; no more, ſay I, can we pray,
nor ſing the Praiſes of God, which are Duties
comprehended in our fearing, honouring, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping,
and loving of him. And whereas
Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> reflects on me, as if I ſingled out
my ſelf more than others in <hi>London,</hi> in puſhing
on this practice of Singing. I muſt tell him,
I have abundance of Peace in my Spirit in what
I have done therein: And if our People (I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63351:111"/>
mean, the Church to whom I belong) are one
of the firſt Churches of our Perſwaſion in this
City, found in the practice of this Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
I am ſatisfied it will be to their great
Honour, (and not to their Reproach) and
that not only in ſucceeding Ages, but alſo in
the Day of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But, bleſſed be God, the greateſt number of
our worthy <hi>London</hi>-Elders are as well ſatiſfied
in this Truth as my ſelf, and many of their
People too, and will generally, I doubt not,
in a little time get into the practice of it.
Our Reverend Brother <hi>Knowllys</hi> 'tis known is
clear in it, and has practiſed it for ſome Years,
though at preſent 'tis not uſed in his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
He told me lately, he is about to
write in Vindication thereof, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to publiſh in a ſhort time, if the Lord
pleaſe to ſpare his Life.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> affirms, as if I

to the grief and trouble of many of our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
it is falſe, for 'tis known the Church
hath been in this practice near twenty Years
after Breaking of Bread, and near 14 Years on
Thankſgiving-days in a mixt Congregation.
And what was done of late in bringing it in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

regular Act of the Church in a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
And though ſome of our worthy Brethren

better than to go about to impoſe on the
Church or Conſciences of their Brethren, or to
ſtrive to pull down that which the Church
and themſelves too, have been a building for
ſo many Years. Can there be a Man
ſo left of God as to countenance any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

they cannot forgo a Duty they have ſo
long been ſatisfied in the practice of, and ſo

a few Perſons, as if they had Power over our
Faith? We do not ſay our diſſatisfied Brethren
ſhall ſing with us, or we will have no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

impoſe on their Conſciences. We do not look
upon Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> an Eſſential of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
'tis not for the being, but for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and well-being of a Church. We have told
our Brethren (ſince we ſing not till after our

make ſtrange Confuſion in our Churches. And
ſince he thus publickly hints at this private
Caſe amongſt us, I had I thought a clear Call
to open the matter plainly as it is, to clear my
ſelf and the Church, to all who may read his
Epiſtle and this my Anſwer, for we have done

                  <p>I ſhall add one word to the conſideration of
the Brethren of our Church, I doubt not but
they will conſider it.</p>
                  <p>1. If they look upon us equal in Knowledg
and Uprightneſs towards God with themſelves,
they may ſee we have the ſame ground to be
offended with them in diminiſhing from God's
Word, as they may be with us, for adding (as
poſſibly they think) to God's Word.</p>
                  <p>2. And let them conſider 'tis a horrid Evil
to break the Bond of Spiritual Union, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
to wound the Body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Whoſe Work is it thus to do, but the Devil's?
and what a reproach doth it bring upon the
Truth? and how grievous is it to all truly
Godly Ones, and grateful to the Enemies of
our Sacred Profeſſion? Beſides, upon ſuch a
trifle, can it be ſo hainous a Crime to be found
often in that Duty, which they with us have ſo
often and long been in the practice of, and in
a mixt Aſſembly too, many and many times?

of his Attempt, if any Body regarded what he
hath ſaid upon that account.</p>
                  <p>But, pray, what Call has he to rebuke me,
after this publick manner, eſpecially before the
whole World? If I had done any thing amiſs
in his Judgment in that Matter, I could wiſh
he had had more Wiſdom and Prudence, or elſe
left the Controverſy to ſome more diſcreet and

                  <p>I cannot forget the two Brethren that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

not comply with the Church, (though they
did not ſeparate themſelves from the Church)
when firſt the practice of it was received
amongſt us near twenty Years ago. One

enjoined us to do; nor do I fear, but through
the Help and Authority of God's Word, I

To Mr. Marlow's APPENDIX.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FIrſt of all you tell us,</hi> That to praiſe God,
or praiſing of God, is not confined to Songs
of Praiſe; but that there are other ways
and manner of praiſing of him than ſuch melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Singing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We never yet aſſerted there was no
other way or manner to praiſe God, than by
ſinging of his Praiſe. Nor is there a Man who
affirms any ſuch thing that I know of; but it is
one thing to own thoſe other ways of praiſing
of God, and another thing for you utterly to
deny this way, or the way we uſe in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Praiſe.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt tell you, moſt Learned Men, nay,
all that I have met with, do conclude, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or thoſe Children you ſpeak of <hi>Matth.
21. 16. Luke 19. 37.</hi> did ſing thoſe <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi>

the firſt Chapter of the foregoing Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>I perceive you have now at laſt raiſed the
Auxiliaries againſt this Bleſſed Truth of Jeſus
Chriſt. But as a worthy Brother hinted the
other day, Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> is a preſs'd Man, and as
forced in ſo, he doth you no ſervice at all, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63351:115"/>
will appear by what follows; but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by what my worthy Friend has wrote at
the cloſe of this our Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor, from <hi>Heb. 2. 12.</hi> from the
Greek word <hi>Hymneſo ſe,</hi> 
                     <q>I will hymn thee,
<hi>i. e.</hi> I will praiſe thee; ſaith, (1.) what
Chriſt will do, <hi>viz.</hi> He will ſing Praiſe to
God. (2.) Where he will do it, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the
midſt of the Congregation. The expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of both theſe (he ſaith) is accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto the Declaration of God's Name,
and praiſing of him in the Temple. The
ſinging of Hymns of Praiſe unto God in the
great Congregation, was then a principal part
of '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>2. The chearfulneſs and alacrity of the
Spirit of Chriſt in this Work, <hi>he would do
it with Joy and Singing.</hi>
                     </q> Theſe are the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
words, as cited by you, <hi>Appendix,</hi> pag. 4.
And thus did Chriſt ſing with his Diſciples,
in that great Repreſentative Church, as our
<hi>Annotators</hi> call it.</p>
                  <p>Now what is this to your purpoſe? the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
tells you, that <hi>Hymneſo ſe</hi> is Singing
Praiſes to God: And how do you know but
Chriſt might alſo often ſing in the Temple,
and in other great Congregations, though we
do not read of it, ſince 'tis ſaid, that <hi>many
other things did Jeſus that are not written?</hi> Joh.
21. 25.</p>
                  <p>1. Eſpecially conſidering, ſince it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
of him, that in the great Congregation
he ſhould ſing God's Praiſe.</p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63351:115"/>
2. Becauſe, as the Doctor obſerves, Singing
in the Temple was one great part of God's
Worſhip; from whence 'tis not likely our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſhould neglect that part. Moreover, he
poſitively affirms, Chriſt did, with chearfulneſs
and joy, give Praiſe to God by Singing. 'Tis
well known Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> owned no other Singing
than what we do; he doth nowhere talk of the
Effence of Singing in our Spirit, and ſo exclude
vocal or proper Singing.</p>
                  <p>1. He acknowledges Singing, is Praiſing of
God, ſo do we; and ſay, 'tis one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ways of Praiſing him too.</p>
                  <p>2. He intimates there are other ways of
praiſing of God, beſides Singing his Praiſe;
though it clearly holdeth forth that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
would praiſe God that way, namely, by
Singing. And you would do well to obſerve
what our late Learned Annotators ſpeak upon
that of <hi>Heb. 2. 12.</hi> theſe are are their words.
<q>Chriſt and they are of one Father, (that is,
the Saints are here called his Brethren)
he by Nature, and they by Grace, and
from one Humane Parent, <hi>Luke 3. 23,
38.</hi> and both of one Fleſh; He ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſung and Praiſed his Father with them
(ſay they) at his Supper, <hi>Matth. 26. 30.</hi>
in that Repreſentative Church, <hi>Mark 14.
26.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet we, as I ſaid before, do readily grant,
as the Doctor intimates, thoſe other ways of
Praiſing of God, and that Prayer, the <hi>Word of

But (ſaith he) the direct, immediate genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and primary ſignification of the word
<hi>Baptizo,</hi> is Immerſion, Dipping, or to dip,

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> or common praiſing of God in Prayer:
'tis, ſay I, but an improper, indirect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
ſort of Singing of God's Praiſe, that the
Word will admit of in that ſenſe, and ſo no
Singing at all.</p>
                  <p>If you diſcourſe with learned Perſons, they
will tell you, that ſome Greek words do,
in an improper or remote ſenſe, bear ſeveral
Significations; but the direct, genuine, and
proper ſignification of the Word is Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or, they ſung. And now do you not think
you are greatly to blame to make ſuch a ſtir
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon a word you underſtand not, after the
manner you have done, and thereby cauſe
Doubts to ariſe in the Minds of poor weak
Chriſtians about the Tranſlation of the Holy
Bible, and render our Famous and Learned
Tranſlators unfaithful? But I hope our People
will not regard or mind what you unadviſedly
have wrote and ſaid upon this Account. Have
not the Tranſlators, (who compared divers
Greek Copies together,) been more faithful to
give the proper, genuine and direct ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word, they hymned, they ſung
an Hymn, than from the remote ſenſe, they
ſaid Grace, or gave Thanks? We read he gave
Thanks when he took the Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the
word there in the Greek is, he Hymned. I have
often ſaid, to ſing to God in aright manner, is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63351:117"/>
praiſing of God, but all praiſing of God is
not ſinging his Praiſes; therefore they that
tranſlate the word, <hi>they praiſed God,</hi> ſpeak the
Truth, but they do not ſpeak all the Truth.</p>
                  <p>But if our Saviour and his Diſciples did no
more than in an ordinary manner give Thanks,
as we do after Supper, our Tranſlators do
affirm a falſe thing, to ſay they ſung an Hymn,
as elſewhere I have more fully demonſtrated;
becauſe Singing is more, and a different thing

Hymns are Songs which contain the Praiſe
of God: If it be Praiſe and not of God, it

if it be not ſung, it is not an Hymn; it muſt
therefore (ſaith he) that it may be an Hymn,

one of them, we muſt do none of them:
And therefore in oppoſition to what you ſay,
<hi>Pag. 13.</hi> of your Appendix, If the Practice
of Chriſt and the Primitive Church, doth not
bind us to the Obſervation of one Ordinance,
<hi>viz.</hi> that of Singing, it binds us to the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of none; 'tis time to look about us, for
your manner of arguing, I do declare, (as 'twas
intimated to me the other day by my Reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Brother <hi>Knowles</hi>) tends to the overthrow of
all Goſpel-Ordinances whatſoever; therefore I
warn all my Brethren to take heed how they
hearken to you in this matter, as they tender
the Glory of God, and the Eſtabliſhment of all
Goſpel-Worſhip and Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: 'Tis an eaſy thing (for
any wary Reader, who is not willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
to perceive the Man hath a bad Cauſe
in hand, and that he reaſons not like a wiſe
and enlightned underſtanding Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Which doth fully appear, if we conſider
the falſe and prepoſterous Mediums or Ways
he takes to make out what he pretends to
prove.</p>
                  <p>1. For one while he ſeems to aſſert, that
the Eſſence of Singing, which is (he ſays)
in our Spirit, that will ſerve our turn in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the Duty of ſinging forth God's
Praiſes, without imploying our Tongues or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Organs in it, which, as I have, again and
again ſaid, doth as well exclude vocal Praying
and Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Singing. See <hi>Pag. 8.</hi>
of his firſt Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63351:119"/>
2. Then again at another time, becauſe there
are other ways to praiſe God beſides ſinging
of his Praiſes, we muſt not ſing his Praiſes at
all. <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>3. At another time he ſeems to exclude all
Singing out of the Bible, from an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Signification of a Greek word, and strives
to make it out 'twas only common Praiſes or
Thankſgiving in Prayer. See the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to me,
and <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>And ſo quarrels with the Tranſlators of the
holy Bible, as if they wanted Skill in the Greek
Tongue, or elſe Faithfulneſs in rendring the
Word, <hi>they ſung an Hymn,</hi> which he tells you
they ſhould have rendered, <hi>they gave Thanks,
or ſaid Grace.</hi> But further, to clear our God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Learned and Pious Tranſlators of the Bible;
let it be conſidered how carefully they were in
other Caſes, particularly in reſpect of the word
<hi>Baptizo,</hi> which they never ventured to tranſlate
<hi>Rantizo,</hi> ſprinkling, to favour their own Practice,
but rather choſe to leave the word in the Original
Tongue, and not tranſlate it at all, than to give
a falſe Signification of it.</p>

fail him, he flies to another broken Refuge, <hi>viz.</hi>
intimating that the Ordinance of Singing doth
not belong to us now, but may be practiſed
by the Saints hereafter in the thouſand Years
Reign, or ſeventh thouſand Years of this
World. Which is a very doubtful Point, I mean,
whether there will be ſuch a thouſand Years
Reign or not, in his ſenſe; and yet this Duty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63351:120"/>
lies amongſt other Goſpel-Ordinances and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
given out by the Spirit, and enjoyned on the
Churches, which is enough to ſhake the Faith
of our People in reſpect of other Ordinances,
which they have as much reaſon to ſay, may not
belong to us, but ſhall be practiſed in time to
come, when the Church (as the Seekers ſay)
ſhall attain its firſt or original Purity. See
<hi>Pag. 27.</hi> of his Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>5. And laſtly, like a wary and fore-ſeeing
Man, to be ſure to carry his Cauſe, he retires
to his laſt Fort and Strong-hold, and affirms,
That the Ordinance of ſinging of Pſalms,
Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was only in the Primitive Time
performed by an extraordinary Gift; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we have ſuch a Gift, we muſt not ſing
the Praiſes of God now in theſe days.</p>
                  <p>Tho I have ſaid enough to detect this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

Conceit, yet ſince he leads me in this Path, I
muſt, I perceive, reply again, as I have already
done, that this Objection lies equally againſt
Prayer, Preaching, and interpreting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſith all theſe Goſpel-Duties and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
in the Primitive and Apoſtolical Days,
were performed by the ſaid extraodinary Gifts
of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>If he could make this appear, there was no
need for him to trouble us with the Greek
word, nor with any of his other Mediums he
uſes to exclude Goſpel-Singing; it cannot but
appear by this laſt ſhift, he acknowledges that
Singing is ſomewhat more than that Praiſing of
God he ſpeaks of: But theſe things betray the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63351:120"/>
Man's Integrity, or rather his Weakneſs, and

                     <hi>There is no ſuch cauſe or ground from the
Reception of Tongues, or the extraordinary
Gifts of the Spirit, (as you intimate) to ſing
the Praiſes of God;</hi> For many (our Saviour

in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt
out Devils, and in thy Name have done many

Though I ſpeak with Tongues of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and have not Charity, I am become as
ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal, 1 <hi>Cor.

                  </p>
                  <p>From whence it appears that inward Joy and
Peace of which you ſpeak, as the Cauſe of
Singing in the Apoſtles Times, did not flow
from that extraordinary Gift of the Spirit, but
from the ſaving Graces of the Spirit; either it
flows from the conſideration of common or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Mercies and Bleſſings, wherein all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to ſing the Praiſes of God, who gives
them fruitful Seaſons, filling their Hearts with
Joy and Gladneſs; or elſe it flows from thoſe
ſpecial and internal Bleſſings which only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> Union with God, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c. Tongues
were for a Sign, not for them who believe, but
for them who believe not,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 22. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gifts were to convince Unbelievers
of the Truth, and not for the Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of ſuch who did believe. Men that have the
Gift of Tongues, may be graceleſs, and ſo
without Chriſt, and periſh eternally in Hell;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63351:121"/>
therefore the extraordinary Gift of the Spirit
fits not, tunes not the Heart nor Tongue to
ſing the Praiſes of God. You may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Saints may not, ought not in theſe our
Days rejoice in God, nay, not praiſe him in
any other manner of ways, as well as not fing,
from this Argument you make uſe of here on
this account.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it follows that you ſtrangely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
<hi>pag. 15. Appendix,</hi> in intimating, when
<hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Saints to covet after the beſt
Gifts, he means the extraordinary Gifts of the
Spirit; for certainly thoſe are the beſt Gifts that
moſt tend to the edification of the Church,
which Tongues could not be ſaid to do. And
in the very next words he ſpeaks of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ways, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Charity or Love,
which refers to the Graces of the Spirit. And
of ſo little uſe were thoſe ſpecial or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Gifts to the Church, that if there were no
Interpreter, they were to be ſilent, and not uſe
them in the Church at all who were that way
gifted.</p>
                  <p>2. You confound Tongues (which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to all ſorts of Gifts) with Prophecy and
Singing: He that had a Doctrine, might have the
Gift of Tongues to bring it forth; ſo might
he that had the Gift of Prophecy, and he alſo
that had the Gift to Interpret; and ſo might
he alſo that had the extraordinary Gift to
bring forth a Pſalm. And, pray, why muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
praiſing of God be now admitted? and
Preaching, Propheſying, and Interpreting the

do you give for this? Is not this to darken
Counſel with words without Knowledg?</p>
                  <p>I have demonſtrated, that the End of thoſe
extraordinary Gifts that were then in the Church
in the Adminiſtration of every Duty and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
was to confirm the ordinary practice of
all thoſe Ordinances, and ſo to continue them
in the Church to the end of the World. And

Singing is not there mentioned. But all that
you ſay there, has been anſwered already; ſo is
what you infer from <hi>Col. 3. 16. Epheſ. 5. 19.</hi>
For to think the Apoſtle refers to the ſpecial Gift
of Singing in thoſe places, is of a pernicious
tendency; for you may as well ſay the ſame of
all other Precepts enjoined on the Churches,
and ſo free us from all Goſpel-Obedience for
want of ſuch Gifts. Why muſt not Spiritual
Songs be allowed, as well as Pſalms and Hymns?
What do you mean in <hi>pag. 23?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brother, you were better be ſilent till you
can diſtinguiſh better between <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> and the manner of the
bringing of them forth by a ſpecial Gift. A
Doctrine may be as Spiritual that is precom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
as that which was brought forth by a
ſpecial Gift; ſo may an Hymn, or Spiritual
Song, though 'tis by the ordinary Gifts or
Help of the Spirit precompoſed; there cannot
be an Hymn, nor Spiritual Song, without its
Form; but if it be a Spiritual Song, it has a
Spiritual Form. The very word may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

taken out of Chriſt's Spiritual and Sacred
Word, the Form is Spiritual; and if it be

That Aſſertion or Notion againſt Singing the
Praiſes of God, that hath a natural tendency
in it to overthrow the practice of all Goſpel-Ordinances,
as well as ſinging the Praiſes of
God, is a vile and pernicious Aſſertion or Notion.
But for a Man to aſſert, the Saints and People
of God now in theſe days, ought not to ſing
Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, becauſe
we have not that ſpecial or extraordinary Gift
of the Spirit to do it, hath a natural tendency
in it to overthrow the practice of all Goſpel-Ordinances
in theſe days. <hi>Ergo.</hi> That Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denyed: the <hi>Minor</hi>
I have abundantly proved in this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. You ſeem to Anſwer what we

Singing the Praiſes of God is more than a
mere poſitive Duty.</p>
                  <p>What you further ſay under this Head, doth
but betrary your own Ignorance about moral
Precepts, and needs no Anſwer, I having fully

of God? ſee <hi>Append.</hi> p. 28. 'Tis not ſo

                  <p>In <hi>pag. 33.</hi> of your <hi>Appendix,</hi> you repeat
your former Objection againſt Womens Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Church, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith,
he <hi>ſuffered not a Woman to teach, nor uſurp
Authority over the Man, but to be in ſilence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>So that Chriſt (<hi>ſay you</hi>) makes it an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation

they ſhould not be the Mouth of the Church,
as in Prayer and Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63351:124"/>
Singing we have all ready fully refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but for the ſake of our good Women,
and to detect this falſity, I ſhall add a word
or two further in way of Reply. 'Tis a hard
caſe that Women ſhould be debarred to ſpeak
in any ſenſe, or any ways to Break Silence in
the Church, as you affirm through a miſtake of
the Text.</p>
                  <p>1. For then they muſt not ask a Friend how
he or ſhe doth when in the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>2. She muſt not be ſuffered to be an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Church againſt any Offender, in
the caſe of Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>3. Then ſhe muſt not ask, where the Text
is, if ſhe comes too late, for that is in ſome
ſenſe a ſpeaking and breaking Silence.</p>
                  <p>4. Nor muſt ſhe then ſay <hi>Amen</hi> at the cloſe
of Prayer, for that's a breaking Silence.</p>
                  <p>5. Which is worſt of all, ſhe muſt not in
the Church give an account of her Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or declare how the Lord was pleaſed to work
upon her Heart: for I have ſhewed in that Act
there is much inſtruction, nay, 'tis ſo full of
teaching to others, that what ſome pious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have ſpoke in the Church upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
God hath bleſſed to the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sinners, as well as it has refreſhed and
ſweetly comforted divers Believers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
herein you abuſe the ſenſe of the Holy
Ghoſt, and indeed are not, I fear, fit to be a
Teacher of others, but to learn in ſilence your
ſelf.</p>
                  <p>2. The way therefore to underſtand this as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63351:125"/>
well as other Scriptures, is to have recourſe to
the main drift or purport of the Spirit of God
therein. And evident it is, the main thing the
Apoſtle drives at in both theſe places, or doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
is this <hi>viz.</hi> That Women ought not to be
allowed to take part in the ordinary Miniſtration
of preaching the Goſpel, or miniſterially, or
authoritatively to preach the Word: becauſe he
that has received a juſt Call ſo to do, may and
ought to exhort and command in the Name of
our Lord Jeſus with all Authority, <hi>Tit. 2. 15.</hi>
and this Work therefore Women ſhould not
take upon them, becauſe they muſt be in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and not uſurp Authority over the
Man. To take the bare letter of the Text, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing the ſcope and drift of the Spirit of
God in it, would make ſad work, as I might
ſhew from many Scriptures, and has occaſioned
many abominable Errors, nay Hereſies, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in the World.</p>
                  <p>3. As to that teaching which is in Singing,
it doth not lie in a Miniſterial way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not intended by the Spirit of God here;
Preaching or Teaching is not Singing, nor
Singing Preaching or Teaching, though there
is a Teaching in it. You muſt learn better
to diſtinguiſh between different Duties and
Ordinances, before you take upon you to
teach others. Read what I have before ſaid,
and alſo what Mr. <hi>Cotton, Sidenham,</hi> &amp;c. have
ſaid, as you will find it repeated in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
in reſpect of the Nature of Teaching and
Admonition that is in the Ordinance of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63351:125"/>
and you may further ſee how you miſs and
abuſe theſe Scriptures: for he or ſhe that reads
the Scripture may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to teach,
there is much teaching in it; yet ſure a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may be ſuffered to do this, as a caſe may
preſent it ſelf, both in the Church, or at home
either, in her Husbands preſence, and not be
deemed to uſurp Authority over him: for the
Uſurpation the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, reſpects a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
own Husband (if not chiefly) as well
as others; and therefore if ſhe muſt not ſing in
the Church, ſo by your Argument ſhe muſt
not ſing nor read the Scripture at home in the
preſence of her Husband, becauſe there is a
kind of teaching in both thoſe Duties; and if
ſhe ſhould, as you intimate, ſhe would not
only break Silence, but uſurp Authority over
the Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> her Head and Husband, which
is forbid. The Lord deliver poor Women, and
Men too, from ſuch kind of Doctrine as this.</p>
                  <p>4. 'Tis evident the Apoſtle lays no other
reſtraint upon Women than what the Law laid
them under, they are <hi>to be ſilent,</hi> or 'tis not
(ſaith he) <hi>permitted unto them to ſpeak; but
they are commanded to be under Obedience, as
alſo ſaith the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 34. And 'tis as
clear, they were always under the Law ſuffered
to ſing in the Congregation as well as the Men,
therefore it was not ſuch a Speaking or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as is in Singing, that <hi>Paul</hi> intends in thoſe
Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>5. Whereas you affirm, that Women were
not admitted to pray nor propheſy in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63351:126"/>
Church neither in the Old nor New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is doubleſs falſe, as our late Annotators
well obſerved on 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 34.</hi> which is the
very Text you mention, take their words;
<q>This Rule muſt not (ſay they) be reſtrained
to ordinary propheſying: for certainly, if
the Spirit of Propheſy came upon a Woman
in the Church, ſhe might ſpeak. <hi>Anna,</hi>
who was a Propheteſs in the Temple, <hi>gave
Thanks to the Lord, and ſpake of him to all
them that looked for the Redemption of</hi> Iſrael:
and I cannot tell how <hi>Philip</hi>'s Daughters
propheſied, if they did not ſpeak in the
preſence of many. The reaſon given why
Women ſhould be ſilent, is, becauſe they are
commanded to be in Obedience. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(ſay they) might ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> to the
publick Prayers, and alſo ſing with the
Congregation to the Honour and Glory of
God, but for her to ſpeak in an ordinary
courſe of Propheſy to inſtruct People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſhe is forbidden. The Apoſtle, ſaith a
Friend (in a Manuſcript) doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
all manner of ſpeaking, for that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 5, 6.</hi> where
Women are admitted to pray and propheſy:
for Prayer, <hi>they may ſay, Amen</hi> to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers of the Church: and for Propheſy
they may ſing Pſalms, the Apoſtle uſing the
Expreſſion according to the Ideum of the

                  <p>2. But Prayer and Singing differ the one from
the other; we may uſe other words in Prayer
than what we premeditated, as the Spirit of
God may help us. But we are limited by God's
Word to ſing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, or elſe Hymns and

Forms of Singing be Spiritual, yet
the Heart muſt be Spiritual too, or Grace
and Melody muſt be in exerciſe in performing
of them: The Grace of Joy muſt be raiſed

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> We need no more the ſpecial Gift
in Singing, to render our Singing Spiritual,
than thoſe ſpecial Gifts in Preaching to render
our Sermons Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>2. As to have Grace in our Hearts, not only
in the Habit, but alſo in the Exerciſe in Singing,
we acknowledg it is neceſſary to a right perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it: And ſo 'tis in Prayer, Preaching,
and all other Spiritual Duties of Religion. And
let me tell you, we need no greater aſſiſtance of
the Spirit in Singing, than in Praying or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing,
therefore what ſignifies that which you

Prayer; ſo the leaſt exerciſe of gracious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
Joy, gives Eſſence to inward Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
And (<hi>ſay you</hi>) as we ought not vocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pray in the Publick Worſhip of God in
the Church, without a ſufficient Gift of the
Spirit; ſo alſo we ought not vocally to ſing in
the Church, unleſs it be by a ſufficient Gift
of the Spirit. And ſeeing we have not ſuch
a Gift, we are not capable of vocal Spiritual
Singing.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By this way of arguing you may lay
Godly Chriſtians under Temptations about
Prayer, eſpecially in the Church, becauſe they
may plead they have not the Gift; whereas the
Grace of Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> a broken Heart, is that
which God chiefly looks at, and ſo ſhould we
too. This makes no more againſt Singing, than
it doth againſt Praying. And thus I muſt argue
upon you, If I have not the Special Gift of
Singing, I muſt content my ſelf with the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of it in my Heart, and yet (as I have
ſhewed) the eſſence of it is not in the heart as it
is in the Voice; and ſo ſince if I have not the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Gift of Prayer, I muſt be contented with
the Eſſence of Prayer, only Heart-Prayer, and
not pray vocally at all.</p>
                  <p>But you intimate, that none ought to ſing
but ſuch who are in the full aſſurance of the
Love of God. But you might as well ſay, none
ought to rejoice in the Lord, nor to praiſe
him, but ſuch only, as well as to ſay what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63351:129"/>
you do here againſt their Singing who want
that aſſurance.</p>

                  <p>THE Foundation of Singing Pſalms,
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs in the
Publick Aſſembly of the Saints, is
too firmly laid in Scripture, and in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Practice of Chriſtians in general, to
be ſhaken by the New Notions of ſome few
amongſt us, whom I hope the Lord in his time

and make them ſenſible of their injurous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to overthrow and remove it, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> in his late Book and Appendix,
which are anſwered in the preceding Tract;
and no more is intended in theſe few Pages,
but ſome ſhort Remarks on the two firſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Appendix. In the firſt whereof
he would not have Praiſing God, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ed to
Songs of Praiſe, or Vocal and Melodious Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For my part I know not where he
will find an Antagoniſt in this Point; for
without Controverſy it will be generally grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all Creatures, according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63351:132"/>
hereof doth not in the leaſt injure the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which he ſtrenuouſly pleads againſt.</p>
                  <p>As for his long Citation out of the Learned
Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on <hi>Heb. 2. 12.</hi> to me ſeems very
little for his purpoſe, for the Doctor, after he
had made ſome Reflections on the tranſlation
of the former part of the Verſe, ſaith, in the

yet its moſt frequent uſe, when it reſpects

                        </gap>,
<hi>ſibi hymnos canam,</hi> I will ſing Hymnes unto

thee with Hymns; which was the principal
way of ſetting forth God's Praiſe under the

genuine and proper ſignification of the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and although the Doctor in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of this place, extends the ſenſe of the
word to its utmoſt latitude, that it might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all ways whereby our bleſſed Mediator was
to Praiſe the Father: yet certainly he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to exclude that particular way princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
pointed at both in the Hebrew and Greek
word, which we find in the evangelical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſo directly and expreſly accompliſhed,
<hi>Mat. 26. 30. Mark 14. 26.</hi> as were alſo all
other things propheſied concerning him; yet I
grant that the Prophecy had not its full and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63351:132"/>
compleat accompliſhment therein; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Chriſt in the whole Adminiſtration of
his Mediatorial Kingdom, is to ſet forth the
Praiſe and Glory of his Father; and every
Member of his Myſtical Body ſhould concur
with him in this Work, in all the Modes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it can poſſibly be performed; becauſe God
is to be ſerved with all our ſtrength and
might.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is evident that the Doctor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended to undermine or overthrow the
Duty of Singing; for herein he would have
oppoſed his own Judgment, which he hath
publiſhed to the World in the account he gives
of the ſeveral parts of Goſpel-Worſhip, where
he makes Singing one, though he terms it a
fond Imagination for any to think that God
cannot be praiſed in the Church without it;
and I doubt not but that all ſober Chriſtians
agree with the Doctor therein.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now paſs to the ſecond Section, and
conſider ſome parts of it, which I was deſired
to take notice of. Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> begins with the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which, whatever he pretends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the generality of its ſignification, moſt
properly denotes a Song of Praiſe; And what
he cites out of the Learned <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Pſal. 3.</hi>
to favour his Purpoſe, will not ſerve it at all;
for he there intends nothing leſs than a Song
of Praiſe, which is fitly compoſed to be ſung,
as will appear to any one who conſiders the
whole Paragraph without Prejudice; and this
import of the word is agreeable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63351:133"/>
ſenſe of Learned Men, notwithſtanding
what is cited to the contrary. His firſt Citation
is out of <hi>Conſtantin</hi>'s Lexicon, whence he tells
us that <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> is a Nuptial Song. And
what if it be, it is altogether impertinent in
the preſent Enquiry; for this is a word of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Family, and deſcends from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a word
well known amongſt Learned Anatomiſts.
And if he conſults any of them, he may ſoon
know the full meaning of it, and alſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> is uſed for a Nuptial Song.
This word being thus diſmiſt, as foreign to
our preſent Purpoſe; we may conſider <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which according to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as
cited by him, primarily and chiefly ſignify an
Hymn or Copy of Verſes, made to Praiſe, and
to ſing ſuch an Hymn or Verſe. And as for
the latter word, he ſays alſo, it is uſed for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or pronouncing ſuch an Hymn; and the
reaſon may be, becauſe ſaying or pronouncing
is neceſſarily included in Singing: for Singing is
but a particular Mode of ſaying or pronouncing.
And if it was not thus, I might ſay it is the
common fate of all Words to be ſtretched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their prime and moſt proper Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and who can help it, ſeeing that the Wit
and Fancy of Men, are ſuch luxuriant things,
that will make bold ſometimes, not only with
Words, but Perſons too. The Object of an

Song of Praiſe to God; and it is the Opinion of
many Learned Men, that Chriſt ſang this with
his Diſciples, tho <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks that Chriſt made
another on that occaſion. Now as to the three
Authors Mr. <hi>M.</hi> mentions out of Mr. <hi>L.</hi> who
differ in their verſion of theſe words, we may
juſtly ſppoſe that by Praiſes, they mean Praiſes
in Verſe, and by ſaying Praiſes, they mean ſuch
a ſaying as was accompanied with ſinging,
otherwiſe their rendering may be cenſured as
improper.</p>

Montanus,</hi> I will confeſs, yet if he doth
not mean ſuch a Confeſſion as was to be made
by ſinging the Song of Praiſe to God, for his
manifold Benefits beſtowed upon his Church,
his Verſion is not ſo agreeable to the Context,
as that of the Septuagint, who render it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
I will ſing Praiſe; and the like may be ſaid of
his Verſion, <hi>Iſa. 12. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is ſaid in the third Paragraph, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the fourth, concerning the rendring
thoſe words before mentioned, and ſome others,
is of little importance in clearing the preſent
Controverſy, ſeeing it is granted already that
God may be praiſed without Singing, tho
Singing is a principal way of ſetting forth the
Praiſe of God, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith. And certainly
that which is the principal way of praiſing
God, ought not to be excluded by Chriſtians<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
neither can we think that theſe Tranſlators had
any deſign to do it, ſeeing they uſe ſuch words
as include this as well as other ways of praiſing
God. And whereas Mr. <hi>M.</hi> thinks he hath
got clear and undeniable Evidence for his ſimple
praiſing God only, he hath got none at all,
unleſs <hi>three</hi> be not contained in the number
<hi>four,</hi> becauſe <hi>one</hi> is. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wringing
of the Noſe brings forth Blood;</hi> and ſtraining
the words of theſe Tranſlators, may bring forth
a ſenſe which they never intended. I ſee no
ſuch reſtrictive terms uſed by them, which may
reaſonably be thought to reſtrain the Duty of
Praiſing God to the particular mode of this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63351:136"/>
Author; but if they did intend it, I could (if
the Bounds of my Paper would admit it)
produce ſix or ſeven Tranſlators who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
eſteemed by learned Men very accurate,
who have render'd the words for that way
of praiſing God which is pleaded for in the
foregoing Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Author which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> cites out of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorate</hi>
on <hi>Mat. 26. 30.</hi> pretends it is uncertain
with what words they praiſed God; that is,
whether it was with the common Paſſeover-Hymn,
or ſome other of Chriſt's own, which
might be more ſutable to the occaſion; and
whether they ſang this Praiſe, or ſpake it ſimply,
the following words of the Author not being well
render'd by Mr. <hi>Tymme,</hi> I ſhall ſet down, they are
theſe, <hi>Graecum verbum laudem quidem, maxime
quae Deo debetur, includit; non autem neceſſario
evincit, quòd cecinerint,</hi> i. e. the Greek word
indeed includes Praiſe, chiefly that which is due
to God. But undoubtedly it doth evince, that
they ſang, 1. From the genuine Signification
of the Original Word. And, 2. From the
current of Learned Men who go this way.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; I ſincerely deſire that the Lord
would make this Friend ſenſible of the Evil and
Vanity of this Attempt, to remove out of the
Church this part of Religious Worſhip, which
hath been kept up ſo many Ages, both under
the Law, and under the Goſpel.</p>
