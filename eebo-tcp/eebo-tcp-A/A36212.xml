         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not unknown to many of you, what
Conteſts have been about Religious
Concerns in this Nation, and what Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
Means have been uſed to bring all
<hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi>
and altho' the Penal Statutes, allowed both
a lawful and reaſonable Excuſe, that would
not be allowed, but ſome of the moſt ſottiſh
and buſie Men of the <hi>Clergy</hi> always obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, under pretence that no Law was to be
allowed, but in caſe of Old Age, or Infirmities
of Body; by which means, the Magiſtrates
that were moſt ignorant and buſie, were
meer drudges to thoſe <hi>Clergy-men</hi> of the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
ſort, and would hear nothing of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
many times, nor ſuffer Conſciencious <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
to ſpeak for themſelves: But our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
God, looking upon the Afflictions of
his People, moved in the Heart of the King,
and Civil Magiſtrates, to grant <hi>Tole</hi> in a do
the Proteſtant Diſſenting Subjects of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for which we are truly thankful, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38257:3"/>
I do really believe, that God hath a Bleſſing
in ſtore for all Kings that are ſo well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
as to grant Liberty in the Exerciſe of
Religion, to Diſſenting Subjects, although
of different Perſuaſions in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
'tis of greater concern than any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Intereſt or Profit, and will be a great
means to root <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> out of this Nation;
for forced Conformity makes <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> but
never makes good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or Subjects to
any Prince: Now Liberty is granted, there
can be no pretence of quarrelling with the
Government that is kind to them, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſome have lately pretended to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,

being uneaſie under the Liberty granted

I will now go down and ſee, if it be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
according to the Cry that is come
up unto me.</q> Thus he ſhews the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
how to perform his Office in true
Juſtice in the ordering the affairs of the
Nation.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe the ſaid <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> hath
accuſed us of matter of Fact, high Crimes
and Miſdemeanors againſt the Government:
It belongeth to the Civil Magiſtrate to take
notice of ſuch things; and we do deſire it,
that they would read our Anſwers to his
Aſperſions, that our Innocency may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of what we are accuſed off.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> ſays, that he was a <hi>Quaker</hi>
25 Years: He was but a Poor Man when he
came firſt among us, and Suffered Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeveral times, upon the account of his
Religion, when he was Poor; afterward he
grew Rich, and increaſed in Wealth very
much, his Father Died, and there fell to him
near 30 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, by Relation; he alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
an Eſtate at <hi>Milden-Hall</hi> aforeſaid,
with a fair Brick Houſe upon it, Built by a
Knight Baronet, for himſelf, to dwell in for
his Pleaſure, becauſe his Eſtate lay in a durty
Country; I knew the Perſon that Built it,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38257:4"/>
he was my near Relation. This <hi>F. Bugg</hi> had
alſo a great Stock, he was a Wool-man, and
uſed the Wool-Trade, and a Shop beſides of
<hi>Cloaths</hi> and <hi>Stuffs,</hi> and divers other things,
and an Adventure at Sea, in a Coal Ship at
<hi>Ipſwich,</hi> which he withdrew, becauſe of the
ſmallneſs of the Profit he received by it; this
ſhews he was a Rich fore-handed-man,
and now Poor, and blames the <hi>Quakers</hi> of
being the chief cauſe of it, which may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
proved to the contrary; neither was his
Sufferings more than other Rich Men, but
ſtill continued Rich ſo long as he was amongſt
us, but being uneaſie under his Sufferings,
he begun to contrive how to avoid them,
by ſubtle indirect means, he writ two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
Books againſt us, before he conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and when he
was in danger of having the Statute of 20 <hi>l.</hi>
a Month put in Execution againſt him, he
conformed to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and
went on Writing againſt the<hi>Quakers,</hi> until
he had ſcribled away his Eſtate, and run ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hundred Pounds in Debt, and now goes
about a Begging, with a Certificate from the
Biſhop of <hi>Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Year 1682. he came to my
Houſe at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and made great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of <hi>George Fox,</hi> that he had brought in
Innovations into the Church about Marriages,
that all Marriages muſt be publiſhed at twice
in the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens</hi> Meetings, whereas
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38257:4"/>
they uſed to be publiſhed but once former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
I heard him, but did not give my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this concern, but let it reſt until I
had inquired further of it; at laſt I underſtood
it was an Order of <hi>Marriage</hi> of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording,
in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting Book in the
<hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> and partly of his own making
(as I underſtood by <hi>John Ainſlo</hi> of <hi>Over,</hi> in
the County of <hi>Cambridge</hi>) he alſo told me
that <hi>F. Bugg</hi> was quarrelſome, and that he
ſee no way to prevent it, he was ſo given to
Contention. This I can prove by his firſt Book
he writ againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that he began the
Quarrel, and hath continued it to this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> came again to me, and renewed
his complaints againſt <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>George
Whitehead,</hi> that they were the cauſe of bringing
<hi>Innovations</hi> into the Church, he alſo brought
a Book to me of his own Writing, which he
had got Printed, I bought it of him, the Title
Page was, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience upon its true and
proper Ground.</hi> This Book, Doctor <hi>Gunning</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> read, and ſaid that it was an
<hi>Envious Thing;</hi> but the chief matter which
was the Grounds of his Contention was,
that he would have been a <hi>Ruler</hi> over the
<hi>Quakers</hi> to make Laws for them, that all
Preachers ſhould tell their Names when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
came into a Meeting to convict it,
whether they were asked their Names or no,
and pay their 20 <hi>l.</hi> Fines themſelves, if they
were able, if Poor, then Money ſhould be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38257:5"/>
gathered at the Meetings for that purpoſe
(if he were fined for a Preacher) that he
might pay only his own Fine, that did not
exceed 10 <hi>s.</hi> this may be proved out of his
own ſecond Book, intituled, <hi>The Painted
Harlot,</hi> &amp;c. no <hi>Quaker</hi> that I knew would
conſent to this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> might have kept from the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
if he was not free to ſuffer what Fines
the Magiſtrate laid upon him; for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
concerning the due order of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
that was but a Cavil to cover theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
but after we were Rid of him, we
have had no Contention about that, or any
matter in this County, or the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Ely:</hi>
But when he ſee he was ſlighted by his Friends
in theſe parts, he travelled about into other
places, to make Diviſion amongſt the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
in other parts of the Nation; and ſo
went on Writing, until he had Written 20
Books againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> firſt and laſt,
ſome of them are above 300 Pages, which
muſt needs be a great Charge, the Printing,
beſides his neglecting his Trade, and giving
himſelf wholly to Contention, and Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about upon that account, until he was
forc'd to fly to the <hi>Clergy</hi> for relief: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Norwich</hi> hath ſo far taken him under
his ſpecial Care, as to give him his charitable
Recommendation, and he, and thoſe <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
that have incouraged him in his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Books, ought to pay his Debts, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38257:5"/>
provide for his Livelihood; if they do not
they muſt needs come of with ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
in this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>At that time, when <hi>F. Bugg</hi> brought me
his firſt Book, I knew nothing of the grounds
of his Quarrel, I had not inquired into the
whole buſineſs, and knowing nothing to
the contrary but that he was morally Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt;
he being at my Houſe with his uſual
Complaints againſt <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi>
I told him, That I had not been at <hi>London</hi>
many Years, but I did intend to go thither
in the Spring, and examine the cauſe of his
Complaints. One of my Siſters, hearing of
my Intention, ſent to me to take up her
Lodgings, but they were to remote from
my buſineſs. In the beginning of the Month
called <hi>April,</hi> 1683. I took my Journey to
<hi>London</hi> in the <hi>Stage-Coach,</hi> a Maid Servant
with me; when I came at my <hi>Inn,</hi> there
met me a Woman in a Coach to conduct
me to my Lodging, ſhe was a Stranger to
me, but very Civil and Kind to me, ſhe
told me, That <hi>F. Bugg</hi> had provided me
Lodgings at her Houſe; I went along with
her, it was a Whole-Sale Mercer's Houſe, I
ſhall forbear to name him at length, but by
<hi>T. C.</hi> I was very kindly uſed by him in all
reſpects, but he was ſomething reſerved about
the Differences between <hi>G. Fox. G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
and <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> but he referred me to a
Manuſcript that lay in his Ware-Houſe, in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38257:6"/>
Folio, of a verry large Vollume, I read in it
divers times, when I was at leaſure, and
looked over ſome of it, the greateſt part of
what I read was about the Controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Quakers</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the late
Profeſſing Times, called <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Days; and
ſomething concerning the Magiſtrates alſo;
I told <hi>T. C.</hi> that it did little concern the
preſent Differences that was now in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
which might be written in a very
ſmall Vollume; he told me, he had ſome
thoughts of Printing a few of them; I was
unwilling he ſhould be at ſo unneceſſary a
Charge, which ſignified little or nothing;
I diſſwaded him from it; I ſaw that it
would not quit Coſt, to ſatisfie any Party
whatſoever,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Charges and Arguments (I take
to be moſtly in that Manuſcript) that he
hath writ againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from his own <hi>Genius,</hi> except it be
ſome of his Fantaſtical Whimſies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,
that he hath added to the Work.</p>
            <p>I had never ſeen <hi>George Fox</hi> before this
Journey to <hi>London,</hi> nor <hi>George Whitehead</hi> but
once, and that but a very ſhort time; I went
to his Houſe, where I met with <hi>George Fox,</hi>
I had but little Diſcourſe with them, the
Woman of the Houſe was Sick at that
time, but <hi>G. Fox</hi> directed me to the Meeting-Chamber
for Buſineſs, and the Clerk that
kept the Chamber would ſatisfie me in any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38257:6"/>
buſineſs I deſired; when I came there, he
ſhewed me ſome Books, one was writ againſt
<hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and ſome others, I looked into it,
and perceived the Differences were too wide
for me to Compoſe. I ſtay'd a Month in
Town, in that time I writ an Epiſtle of Love
and Good-will to my old Friends, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Sufferers,
in the late Times, the old
<hi>Royaliſts</hi> and their Poſterity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it to <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> who got it Printed
for me. When I had finiſhed my Concerns
at <hi>London,</hi> I paid <hi>T. C.</hi> what he asked for my
Bord, and he was very reaſonable; then I
returned home to <hi>Cambrige.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after I came home, I writ a Paper
of the moſt material Paſſages of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
that hapned in thoſe parts where
I dwelt, I ſent it to <hi>T. C.</hi> aforeſaid to be
Printed; it was Printed upon a Sheet of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
upon one ſide only, with no Perſon's
Name in it; <hi>T. C.</hi> ſent me down about a
Quire of them, and diſpoſed of the reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
about a Month after he ſent me this
Paper, I received from him the ſame Paper
Reprinted in half a Sheet, printed on all
ſides, with an Addition of Characters, and
Names in it, <hi>viz. G. F</hi>'s party, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>
and <hi>T. Ellwood,</hi> with my name to the Paper;
I complained in a Letter to <hi>T. C.</hi> that I was
abuſed in Printing that Paper without my
Conſent or Knowledge, and to ſet my name
to it; <hi>T. C.</hi> writ me word, That if I would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38257:7"/>
not own it, I might put out a ſhort <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement</hi>
in Print to diſown it, and he would
get it printed for me, and it ſhould coſt me
no more than a <hi>Burying-Ticket,</hi> which was Five
Shillings; I ſoon ſent up a quarter of a Sheet
of Paper, with a ſhort <hi>Advertiſement</hi> in it, the
ſubſtance of it was, That I did diſown the
half Sheet with the Characters and Names
in it, and what I writ in my whole Sheet
was not againſt Parties nor Perſons, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the wrong Spirit; when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this ſmall Paper, and the 5 <hi>s.</hi> he ſoon
got it printed, and ſent me down ſome of
them, and writ me word, that he had carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the reſt to the Meeting Chamber for
Buſineſs, and delivered them to the Clerk;
therein <hi>T. C.</hi> did honeſtly, and ſhewed me
kindneſs, but <hi>F. Bugg</hi> I always found to the
contrary, as may be ſeen hereafter.</p>
            <p>When I went next to <hi>London,</hi> I made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
who was the cauſe of the putting out
the aforeſaid half Sheet, <hi>T. C.</hi> would tell me
nothing; I was acquainted with none of <hi>F.
Bugg</hi>'s Friends but old <hi>John Penniman,</hi> I went
to him to know if he had a hand in the
Printing the half Sheet; he ſaid, he had ſeen
it, but he ſcorned to do ſuch an unjuſt
thing; the next time I ſee <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
him, if he had a hand in that piece
of Deceit, the half Sheet that was printed
without my knowledge, and my Name ſet
to it, he did not abſolutely own it, nor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38257:7"/>
diſown it, but laugh'd, and ſaid, That Paper
was true. In the Year. 1684. I had heard
he had Conformed to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
I asked him the cauſe, his anſwer was,
What will you have me do, the Statute of
20 <hi>l.</hi> a Month will be put in Execution
againſt me, and I have ſuffered enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?
Laſt Year he came to my Houſe,
I charged him with this, his anſwer was,
That the Statute was laid aſide in the Year
1684. I told him, That was falſe, and that I
knew that That Statute was put in Execution,
both in <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the County
where he dwelt that very Year. My Maid
was by when we had this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>This Year he came to my Houſe again,
a <hi>Clergy-Man</hi> came with him, one of the
<hi>Fellows</hi> of <hi>Sidny-Colledge,</hi> I charged him with
his <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> again, and told him of what
he ſaid the Year before, That the Statute
of 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Month was laid aſide in the Year
1684. he look'd down, and ſaid, They did
not meddle with me, he had Conformed
then to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and that was
the reaſon the Statute was not put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
againſt him, nor any elſe that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>I do intend now to take notice of ſome
of his Books, of ſome paſſages in them, but
not ſo far as entirely to Anſwer one of
them, they have been anſwered already
moſtly; for he writes but the ſame thing in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38257:8"/>
moſt of his Books, as to matters of Religion
and Government, and writes them over and
over in divers of his Books, and very many
times over in his late Book; I will ſhew
one paſſage in his Fifth Book, Entituled,
<hi>The Quakers detected,</hi> &amp;c. this Book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
two Years after he Conformed to the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, <q>The firſt Point under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
is, how I came to be a Member
of their Society, <hi>viz.</hi> In the beginning they
taught, that all Men were inlightned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. and that this Light,
<hi>wherewith Chriſt</hi> had inlightned them, was
ſufficient, if obeyed, to lead to Salvation;
and that it was the Work of the Miniſters
of Chriſt, to turn People from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to
<hi>Light,</hi> and from the <hi>Power of Satan</hi> unto
<hi>God;</hi> affirming that this <hi>Light</hi> was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Teacher, Leader and Guide to every
Believer, without the help of outward Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
Forms, Orders and Decrees of
Men; upon this and the like Notions, I
became perſuaded to try their Doctrine;
and when I came to ſee and obſerve their
Practices, Converſation and Deportment in
the beginning, &amp; what Simplicity and Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
attended their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> I was ſtill more
confirmed, that it was a Diſpenſation of the
Love of God ſent as a Viſitation to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
Being thus perſuaded, I reſolved to
bear the Croſs, and did utterly deſpiſe the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38257:8"/>
Shame, that attended them and their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
and was not behind any of my Equals,
both in doing and ſuffering for the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
thereof, as ſome among them can
ſtill bear me Witneſs; and in this manner
we went on for many Years, and loved one
another with Love unfeigned; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
God bleſſed our Meetings with the
Comfortable Injoyment of his Preſence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ſufficient Explanation of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy
ſince, it is a Truth that will ſtand for
ever, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> preach, that <hi>the Light
and Grace of God is</hi> Sufficient, both to lead
and bring us to Salvation, if it be obeyed:
For the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of God are all One,
tho' under divers Names, 'tis one Principle,
not divided; if this be not a ſufficient Guide,
I know no Man is able to procure Salvation
to himſelf, or others, without it; nor with
it, except they be obedient to it; it were
Blaſphemy to ſet any Man's Learning or
Natural Parts above it, or againſt it, neither
have they any Scripture to diſprove the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of the Light, the Grace of God,
except they Expound one place of Scripture
to make it Repugnant to another, which the
<hi>Clergy</hi> are Sworn to the contrary, ſee the
20<hi>th Article</hi> of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> thoſe
Articles are called, <hi>The Faith and Doctrine of
the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> Chap. I. <hi>An
Act to Reſtore the Crown to the Ancient Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38257:9"/>
over the State Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual,
and to Aboliſh all Foreign Power, repugnant to the
ſame:</hi> By this Statute all Commiſſioners are
limitted, that have Authority to Hear and
Determine the Offences of Error, Hereſies,
Schiſms, Abuſes and Enormities, ſo that they
ſhall not in any wiſe have Authority or
Power to Order, or Determine, or Judge any
Matter or Cauſe to be <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but only ſuch
as have formerly been Adjudged ſo to be
by the <hi>Cononical Scriptures expreſt in plain
words,</hi> &amp;c. This Statute ſays further, That
there muſt be Two ſufficient Witneſſes to
prove the ſaid Offences mentioned in this
Statute, and the Witneſs brought Face to
Face, if the party requires it. I write this
to put the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in mind of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and alſo to inform ſuch Perſons as
are ignorant of this Remarkable Law of the
<hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas we are accuſed of all, or
moſt of theſe Crimes mentioned in this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
by the ſaid <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> in his three laſt
Books moſtly, and Countenanced by the <hi>Biſhop</hi>
of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> it is my
Requeſt, That We, the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
may clear our ſelves, ſo as our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
may appear to the Civil <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi>
and not lie under <hi>ſuch Scandals</hi> and <hi>Reproaches</hi>
as we do, from every Unjuſt Charge, that
may render us Obnoxious to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and my reaſon is, Becauſe the <hi>Biſhop</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:38257:9"/>
of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> have
given Countenance to his Quarrel againſt us,
and ſome of them have given Credit to
what he ſays; but if the Truth be known,
I am fully perſuaded, it will not be for their
Credit, that have incouraged him in this
Work.</p>
            <p>I have Propounded nothing but what is
the Right of every Free-Born Subject of this
Nation, that the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
our Innocency. I believe there are
but few ignorant of what we have ſuffered
many Years by a long Grinding Perſecution,
both in our Perſons and Eſtates: And now
<hi>Liberty</hi> is granted, we ſtand upon equal
Terms of Juſtice and Right with our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers,
and in Matters that concerns Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
we are Accountable to God, and
have as much Right to common and civil
Priviledges as other Perſwaſions have. We
never were found in any Plots or Rebellions
ſince we firſt appeared to be a People in this
Nation, but always yielded true and real
Paſſive Obedience under all our Cruel Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>I will now take notice of ſome Paſſages
in his Three laſt Books, the 18th, the 19th,
and the 20th Book; the 18th Book, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>The Picture of Quakeriſm drawn to the
Life,</hi> there is not much in them but what
may be found in his former Books, which
have been anſwered already; for he writes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38257:10"/>
the ſame thing over and over again meer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly;
his Books are without method, moſt-rambling
Stuff, not worth the regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
had not ſome of the <hi>Clergy</hi> Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
him, and owned his Books, which
gives us occaſion to take notice of them, to
clear our ſelves of what we are wrongfully
Accuſed of.</p>
            <p>In his 18th Book, page 60. <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays,
<q>That there was a Rumour in the Country
in the Year 1663 or 1664. that <hi>George Fox</hi>
had in one Nights time 24 Languages given
to him by Divine Inſpiration; and I did
believe (ſays <hi>F. Bugg</hi>) and divers others
for Twenty Years.</q> That he did believe it,
this I know to be true; but for divers
more, I never heard of but one, and he
was accounted a Shatter-headed Man by all
that knew him. I heard this Story many
Years ago, and took notice of it, and ſpoke
of it to my Brother <hi>G. Barnadiſtone</hi> of <hi>Clare,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> a Man well known
to be a Wiſe and Honeſt Man; I told him,
that we had ſome Shatter-brained People
amongſt us, and if they went on ſo, we
ſhould want a Religious <hi>Bedlam</hi> for ſuch
Mad Folks; my Brother Replied, that it was
true, there was ſome Shatter-headed People
amongſt us, and the beſt way was to uſe
them kindly, ſo long as they were morally
Honeſt; for ſome had recovered, being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
Honeſt, but they were not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed,
for that would make them worſe. I</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:38257:10"/>
I always uſed <hi>F. Bugg</hi> kindly, for I ſaw
nothing to the contrary but that he was
morally Honeſt for divers Years, after this,
only I perceived he had ſome Freaks and
Whimſies at times, which I took no notice
of to him; I ſaw he was a Man capable of
managing his own Concerns well enough,
and ſome other Peoples buſineſs, if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
it.</p>
            <p>In his 18th Book, the Second Part, page
148, 149, and 150. there is a Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Common Bank; this Letter hath
no Name to it in that Book, but in his 19th
Book he chargeth this Letter upon me; I
read over his 18th Book twice, and did
not in the leaſt ſuſpect it to be mine, it was
ſo Metamorphoſed; but I do not charge <hi>F.
Bugg</hi> with the falſe Tranſcribing it; the Man
is dead I writ to concernig a Common
Bank, and I ſuppoſe it came into <hi>F. Bugg's</hi>
hands of late Years, ſince the Man died;
for if he had had it ſooner, I ſuppoſe that
it would have been Printed before the Year
1697. which is the Date of his 18th Book;
the Date of the Letter is 1684. After I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
he charged me with this Printed
Letter, I ſent for a <hi>Cambridge</hi> Man that I
uſed to imply to ſend Letters into <hi>Harford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
for me, that was acquainted with ſome
of my Concerns, I ſhewed him a Copy of a
Letter concerning a Common Bank, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
the Letter very well, for I read it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38257:11"/>
to him before I ſealed it, becauſe he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this Letter as well as my ſelf, and
ſent it by him, he ſince gave me a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
of the whole ſum of the Letter, which
is as followeth,</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>WHereas, <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> hath accuſed the
People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> of having a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Bank,</hi> in ſeveral of his Books, printed
1697 and 1698. by reaſon of a Letter he has
printed, that concerns <hi>Ann Docwra</hi> and my <hi>ſelf,</hi>
bearing date, the 11<hi>th</hi> Month, 1684. This is
to Certifie thoſe that deſire to know the Truth of
this concern; that about Twenty Years ago, a
Warehouſe in <hi>Royſtone</hi> was robbed, wherein I
had above 30 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Goods, which I loſt
then; ſoon after this loſs, my Friends in <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi>
at a Meeting, gathered 10 <hi>l.</hi> and ſent
it to me, towards my loſs, I knowing nothing of
it until the Mony was brought me, for I did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſire nor expect any Mony from them; their
Mony remained in my Hands about ſix Years, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
my eldeſt Son was about taking a Wife, which
was obſtructed by one of the ſeparate <hi>Quakers,</hi>
then a Priſoner at <hi>Hertford;</hi> and the aforeſaid
10 <hi>l.</hi> was demanded by him, pretending it was
but lent me; there was at that time in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
about 13 more of my honeſt Friends, they all
declared, that the Mony was given by them, and
ſome other honeſt Friends: <hi>Ann Docwra</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by me, how I was dealt with by the
Man that claimed the Mony, did bid me ask
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38257:11"/>
him what he would do with it, his anſwer was,
he would put it into a <hi>common Bank:</hi> She ſoon
after writ a Letter to him, which ſhe read to me,
and gave it me, to ſend it to him, which I did,
in that Letter ſhe charged him with a <hi>common
Bank,</hi> and none elſe beſides him, for all the reſt,
of the Friends in the Priſon, diſowned his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Bank;</hi> nevertheleſs, leſt he ſhould make
a noiſe for the Mony, and uſe further means to
obſtruct my Son's Marriage, I ſent him the 10 <hi>l.</hi>
Some Months after, he had a great loſs by Fire;
ſo that he ſaid, he could not ſubſiſt without ſome
help; then ſome Friends told him that it was
a juſt Judgment from God upon him, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding
me of my Mony, and ſetting up a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

Ann Dockwra,</hi> to tell ſolemn lyes to the
Magiſtrate to ſerve a turn, which being by
the Magiſtrate asked, whether the <hi>Quakers</hi>
had a common Purſe or Bank, ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>No;</hi> which, ſaid ſhe in her letter to me,
gave them great Satisfaction, yet in the
ſame letter to me, confeſſes to me that you
have a Bank, or common Fund; and that
it would never be well, whilſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> put
away their <hi>Dagon,</hi> as at large in her letter to
me, printed in <hi>The Picture of Quakeriſm,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>p.</hi> 148, to 150.</q> This is ſuch a piece of Forgery
as is ſeldom heard of, that I ſhould write
to him about a common Bank, after he had
conformed to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and
charge him with thoſe things in that letter;
this is the true liberty of an <hi>Apoſtate-Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
to Forge lyes of me that always uſed
him kindly, and never diſobliged him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
after he had printed theſe things, and
then I reproved him ſharply.</p>
            <p>I have dwelt above 18 Years in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
and I can truly ſay, that no Magiſtrate asked
me ſuch a Queſtion, whether we had a
common Bank or not; neither had I any
diſcourſe, with any of them, about any ſuch
thing, untill <hi>F. Bugg</hi> had printed this Story;
then I took notice of it to a Magiſtrate, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38257:13"/>
was then a Parliament-man, him I told that
the <hi>Quakers</hi> had no common Bank, that ever
I heard of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> had the Confidence to ſend me
this 19<hi>th</hi> Book to read; and a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he came to my Houſe, a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> came
with him, one of the Fellows of <hi>Sidny Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi>
I charged him with this aforeſaid Forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Letter, that he ſaid I ſent him; he ſtood
ſtifly in it, that I did ſend it to him; then I
asked him who that <hi>J. C.</hi> was, mentioned in
the Letter, he could not tell me that, then I
asked him who was the Man I writ the Letter
to, he could not tell me that alſo; I ſuppoſe he
did not know who I writ my Letter to then;
but I told the <hi>Clergy-man</hi> who the <hi>J. C.</hi> was,
and ſo <hi>F. Bugg</hi> came to know his name, and
printed it in his 20<hi>th</hi> Book; it is the ſame
Man that gave me the aforeſaid Certificate,
viz. <hi>John Clements,</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>I will ſay ſomething concerning the <hi>Prelacy</hi>
he charges me with, the matter concerning
a common Bank, do not belong to a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
it concerns the Magiſtrate only, if he
had called me a She-Lawyer, he had had ſome
grounds for this; for when I was about 15
Years of Age, my Father finding me reading
ſome Idle Books, he took them from me,
and told me he would have me read better
Books, and pointed to the great <hi>Statute</hi> Book
that lay upon the <hi>Parlor</hi> Window, and bid
me read that, and ſaid it was as proper for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38257:13"/>
a Woman as a Man to underſtand the Laws,
becauſe they muſt live under them as well
as Men; I ſoon applied my ſelf to obey his
commands, and was very diligent in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them: My Father was a Juſtice of the
Peace, in the Days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt,
many Years, but not afterward; although
he lived about Seven Years after the Wars
began: I have read ſeveral Law-Books, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Statute-Book, which were very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to my ſelf and others in the time of
the Perſecution: <hi>F. Bugg</hi> knew that I had ſome
underſtanding in the Laws and Statutes of
the Land, therefore he might have given
me a more rational Title than a She-<hi>Prelate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt of this little Pamphlet is writ againſt
<hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> who hath anſwered moſt of
his Books, as well as ſuch rambling Stuff,
full of Tautologies, can be anſwered: <hi>G.
Whitehead</hi> hath ſo gauled him with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
that he is the object of his Malice, in
moſt of his Books.</p>
            <p>I come now to his 20<hi>th</hi> Book, Entituled,
<hi>The Pilgrims Progreſs,</hi> &amp;c. In the front is his
Picture, and in the firſt and ſecond Page, his
Pedegree and Education, he ſays <q>his Father's
name was <hi>Robert Bugg,</hi> ſecond Son of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Bugg,</hi> who was Chief Conſtable many
Years; his Parents were of a good Yeoman
Family, and lived in good Repute, and
brought him up in the Profeſſion of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> I will ſay ſomthing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38257:14"/>
concerning this matter, as it was related to
me by my Uncle <hi>Docwra</hi> of <hi>Hinton,</hi> which is
as followeth, he told me that there was one
<hi>Bugg</hi> a Serving Man in the Family of the
<hi>Docwra's;</hi> this Man Debauched one of the
Daughters of that Family when he was a
Servant, then Stole her away and Married
her as was ſuppoſed: This <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s
Grandfather was one of the Poſterity of the
aforeſaid Serving Man, and was a Poor Boy,
ſome of the <hi>Docwra's</hi> bound him out Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
to the Wool-Trade, and when his
time of Apprentiſhip was expired, Money
was gathered in the Family of the <hi>Docwra's</hi>
to ſet him up; he grew Rich, yet he was
troubleſome to ſome of the <hi>Docwra's,</hi> prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them by indirect means, that I
perceived he was much ſlighted by the whole
Family at the time I was Married to my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
which is above 52 Years ago: <hi>Robert Bugg</hi>
(Father to this <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> that writes now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us) was a melancholly down look'd Man
by Relation, and dwelt with his Son, this
<hi>Bugg;</hi> ſome Years after <hi>F. Bugg</hi> was Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he aroſe from Dinner one Day and went
out, and was found Drowned in a Water,
where he had no occaſion to go to that place,
as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> and his Wife related; I had ſome
diſcourſe about it with her, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with him, ſo that they both concluded
he Drowned himſelf; nevertheleſs the <hi>Jury</hi>
was favourable, they had no proof he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38257:14"/>
drowned himſelf, and did not find it wilful
Murther; which ſaved the 30 <hi>l.</hi> a Year that
<hi>F. Bugg</hi> boaſts of in Page 31. for he cannot
prove that he had 30 <hi>l.</hi> a Year before his
Father's Death, which was long after he
came of Age, although he writes of much
more: It was the Advice of Friends to be
tender to <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> leaſt ſome ſuch Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſhould befall him when he was amongſt
us; and that was one reaſon that he was hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd
in giving him Certificates when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
which he hath ſince printed.</p>
            <p>As to his Religion, he ſays he <hi>was brought
up in the Profeſſion of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England;
this I believe is not true, becauſe he told
me, many Years ago, that he was a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
when he came amongſt the <hi>Quakers:</hi>
This agrees with his Books, where he Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
much with <hi>E. Burroughs</hi>'s Works, which
were written againſt thoſe People, when he
was Perſecuted by them in the late profeſſing
Times; when the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of Doors.</p>
            <p>In Page 4. he ſpeaks concerning our Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Meetings, in the beginning of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
he ſpeaks ſomething of Truth in this
weighty concern, although it is not ſo well
worded, nor confirmed by Scripture Texts
as our Preachers declares it. But afterward
he goes on and makes them as ridiculous as
he can, calling them <hi>Schools of Ignorance:</hi>
There hath been much written by the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:38257:15"/>
concerning them, and never contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Print, by any <hi>Clergy-Man</hi> that ever I
heard of; I have ſeen the ſame Exerciſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by a dignified <hi>Clergy-Man</hi> in Print, of
late Years, which he calls <hi>Vigils,</hi> but it is in
a more Dark and Unprofitable manner than
they ought to be; for he ſpeaks of the uſe
of them but in Saints Eves, or the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Saint's day, ſo called.</p>
            <p>In Page 7. he ſays, <q>He hath given a
Mortal Wound to the Female Government,
as appears in my firſt Book (Entitued, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. the Second Part,
Page 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.) a Wilder Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
never appeared amongſt the People
in <hi>Bedlam.</hi>
               </q> This he means by the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Meetings, which are alive and whole
as ever they were; they were ſet up to take
care for the Poor, and where there is need
of them, they are in as much uſe as ever
they were, where Friends are numerous.
The Men cannot perform ſo great a Work
without the aſſiſtance of the Women; the
Women meet together to take Care of the
Poor, and to inform the Men what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that Service, and agree about Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Sick and Lying-in Women that are
poor, and to help young Maids to Services,
and all ſuch Works of Charity: Theſe
Works are Ordinances of God, although
Men and Women are his Inſtruments to
perform them. But in ſome places, where
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38257:15"/>
we are but few, and can do that Service
without a diſtinct Womens Meeting; and in
divers Monthly Meetings the Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
meet together for the Care of the Poor,
and other Services needful, and not meerly
for Formality ſake, as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> would make
the World believe we do ſome things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> makes a great noiſe, in divers of
his Books, of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Addreſs to King
<hi>James,</hi> for granting liberty in the exerciſe
of Religion, and he ſays we have made no
Addreſs to King <hi>William;</hi> our Addreſs to
King <hi>James,</hi> is as juſtifiable as any other
Perſwaſion whatſoever, in the 3<hi>d.</hi> Month
called <hi>May,</hi> 1687. in a <hi>Gazette</hi> I find the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Durham</hi> preſented an Addreſs to the
King in the behalf of the City of <hi>Durham,</hi>
and the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> alſo another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
in the behalf of himſelf, and the <hi>Clergy</hi>
in general belonging to his Dioceſs; alſo
the <hi>Independants</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of the City of
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> alſo of the ſame
City; and it is likely there was more, for
I find all theſe before-mentioned in one <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette,</hi>
and all theſe Addreſſes were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
liberty in the Exerciſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>In my Judgment they did well to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the King to keep his promiſe, for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in the Exerciſe of Religion is a good
thing; and whatſoever is good in it ſelf
comes from God, altho King <hi>James</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to procure it; yet it ſtands to this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38257:16"/>
day, and there was no doubt but that King
<hi>William</hi> would confirm it; coming out of
a Country where Liberty is allowed, and hath
been ſo beneficial to that Government; there
was no need to incourage King <hi>William</hi> in
this concern: I have not ſeen any Addreſs
made to him by any Diſſenters, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they are all thankful for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays in Page 7. <q>That Quakeriſm
is ſuch a Sandy Foundation that they are
not able to produce the Articles of their
Faith they pretend to.</q> [The <hi>Quakers</hi> are
no <hi>Faith makers,</hi> they ſay that true Faith is
the Gift of God Only] This ſhews what a
<hi>Quaker</hi> he was when he was amongſt us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
the <hi>Quakers</hi> are no <hi>Faith makers,</hi> yet
they have the Principles of their Religion,
contained in a ſmall Book, about three Sheets
of Paper, entituled, <hi>Truth's Principles: Or,
thoſe things about Doctrine and Worſhip which
are moſt aſſuredly believed and received amongſt
the People of God called</hi> Quakers. (And other
Books alſo) theſe are our Ancient Principles,
and hath been reprinted three or four times
ſince I came amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which is
above 35 Years, I bought a dozen of them
at one time, and gave them amongſt the
moſt Eminent of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whereof Doctor
<hi>Gunning,</hi> afterward Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> was one
of them, I deſired an anſwer of him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
alſo, but never received one from any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38257:16"/>
of them; at laſt a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> came to my
Houſe that was related to my Husband, I
deſired him to anſwer them, he promiſed
me before he read them that he would, but
when he had read them, he ſaid that I ſhould
have no other anſwer than this (<hi>that he did
not intend to be a Fool in Print</hi>) theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
declares that our Faith is not a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made
Faith: Alſo, they treat of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of true Religion in General.</p>
            <p>I believe there are but few Magiſtrates,
that are not Prieſt-ridden, but may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
ſo much of the Priciples of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as to clear us of thoſe Aſperſions that
<hi>F. Bugg</hi> has caſt upon us in divers of his Books,
upon the account of our Religion; he charges
the <hi>Quakers</hi> with preferring their own Books
above the Scriptures; this is as falſe as any
thing can be, for the Scriptures are often
quoted and expounded in our Meetings, as
moſt People that comes to our Meetings can
witneſs, but for our Books they are never
quoted nor mentioned in our Meetings, by
our Miniſters in Preaching, that I know.</p>
            <p>But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> pleads that we read Epiſtles
from our Miniſters, and never read a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Bible; theſe Epiſtles are read after
our Meetings for Worſhip are over, at the
end of the Meeting, and that not once in a
Year ſcarcely.</p>
            <p>In Page the 25<hi>th F. Bugg</hi> ſays, <q>I have a
Letter by me which my Couſen <hi>Ann Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wra</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:38257:17"/>
Widdow of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> ſent me, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the 26<hi>th</hi> of the 12<hi>th</hi> Month, <hi>viz. G.
Whitehead</hi> hath ſent me one of his Books,
for me to read, and there is the old Mony-Story
in it, with I know not what beſides;
I was asked by an honeſt Friend if he was
not a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> I anſwered nay, it is not ſolid
enough for them to own, eſpecially when
they write to a ſolid People, there is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
much airy conceited Stuff in it.</q> This
Letter is a meer forged thing, I can truly
ſay I never writ any ſuch Letter to him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> ſend me any Book to
read with a Mony Story in it, or without
one; I was not ſo well acquainted with him
then, as for him to ſend me Books to
read: But I remember <hi>F. Bugg</hi> came to my
Houſe about that time this Letter was
dated, and complained of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> very
much, and of a Book he had writ that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
him; I remember'd I had ſeen ſuch
a Book in our Bookſellers hands, but I read
but little of it, becauſe I did not buy it,
but what is in this forged Letter, he ſpoke
to me then by word of Mouth, and not I
to him; he calls me Couſin, there is no
reaſon for that, I am ſure he is nothing a-Kin
to me, neither can he make it appear
that he is Kin to my Husband, I have ſeen
my Husbands Pedegree, and there is not the
name of <hi>F. Bugg</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:38257:17"/>
I will now take notice of ſomething of
Concernment in his Book, Page 58. he ſays,
that the <hi>Preachers take Mony for Preaching:</hi>
This is a ſtrange Story to me, that ſuch a
thing ſhould be amongſt us, and I not know
it, which have been above 35 Years amongſt
<hi>Them,</hi> and never heard any Body ſay ſo but
<hi>F. Bugg;</hi> a pritty many Years ago, I asked
him who paid them? He anſwered, <hi>They
were</hi> George Fox'<hi>s Penſioners:</hi> This ſhews that
<hi>F. Bugg</hi> gave them no Mony, for if he had
he would have printed it, and the Sum alſo,
in ſome of his Books: I can truly ſay I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave any Mony upon that account of
Preaching, neither was I ever asked for any,
only upon the account of a great loſs a
Preacher had by Fire; I gave Mony upon
that account: But if Preachers be Poor,
they ought to be relieved, I know no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Friend that will ſee them want, or
grudge what they do upon that account;
but to my knowledge ſome Apoſtate <hi>Quakers</hi>
have done ſo.</p>
            <p>In Page 34. <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, <hi>That his Charges
were greater to the</hi> Quakers <hi>Preachers in three
Months, than the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
have been in</hi> 15 <hi>Years.</hi> I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Preachers
ſhould lye upon <hi>F. Bugg</hi> more than upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
they want it not, they have the <hi>Tenth
Part</hi> of the increaſe of the greateſt part of
the Lands in the Nation, and of the Labour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38257:18"/>
and Induſtry of the Husband-man, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Incomes that I could reckon: <hi>I</hi>
partly know the Charge he hath been at for
the <hi>Quakers</hi> Preachers, which was ſometimes
a Nights Entertainment for them and their
Horſes, and that not without ſome Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s part; but this i know, by
what he ſaid to me upon that account, that
the grudged their entertainment although he
invited them to his Houſe; he divers times
told me, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were chargeable to
him: I told him it was his own fault to
give them entertainment, and then grudge
it.</p>
            <p>After the deceaſe of my Husband, I kept
a publick Meeting at my Houſe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
about three Miles from <hi>Cambrige,</hi> for
about ſeven Years, and entertained all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
Preachers, and ſome others alſo; I
did not find it ſo chargeable as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſpeaks
of; I do not think I was the Poorer upon
that account of entertaining Preachers, what
I loſt was upon the account of the Magiſtrate
in the Year 1673. who plunder'd me for
keeping Meetings at my Houſe; at a time
when the King, by Proclamation, had
granted Liberty of Conſcience in matters of
Religion; nevertheleſs I kept up the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at my Houſe for above Six Years after
that, until a publick Meeting-Houſe was
provided on that ſide of the Country where
I dwelt, and then there was no need of my
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38257:18"/>
Houſe; ſo I removed to <hi>Cambrige: F. Bugg</hi>
knows this, he hath been at ſome Meetings
at my Houſe, and lain at my Houſe alſo.</p>
            <p>In Page 62. F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſays, <q>if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Fox</hi>'s Order for Marriages, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that he points to have the matter laid
before the Miniſters, and therefore I ſhall
ſhew you a brief Teſtimony of one of their
Female Preachers, a Woman of Note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them;</q> in a Letter I have by me,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Margent he quotes <hi>Ann Docwra</hi>'s
Letter: This Letter I have diſowned before,
with a Certificate to prove it falſe, towards
the beginning of this Book; it moſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
a Common Bank, and obſtructing a
Lawful Marriage by an <hi>Apoſtate-Quaker;</hi> one
that went about to make Deviſions amongſt
us, as F. <hi>Bugg</hi> did; and to his report, that I
am a She-Preacher, that he cannot prove,
that I ever Preached in a publick Meeting;
I have dwelt above 18 Years at <hi>Cambrige,</hi>
and he cannot prove this to be true: That
is not the Office in the Church that God
hath called me to; I have no Commiſſion
from God to Preach in a Meeting; our
Preachers have a Commiſſion from God,
and they ſpeak what he requires of them;
they know when to ſpeak, and when to be
ſilent: And when God requires me to ſpeak
or write I will not be ſilent, as I am not at
this time to reprove <hi>F. Bugg</hi> in writing, for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38257:19"/>
abuſing ſo many honeſt Perſons as he hath
done in this wicked Book.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe that F. <hi>Bugg</hi> was not the Author
of ſome part of this Book, called the 20<hi>th.</hi>
Book, for divers reaſons; for I heard that
he was 16 weeks from home when this Book
was written; only he came home ſome
times for a night or two, leaſt his Family
ſhould be at a loſs for him, and think he
was come to ſome Misfortune. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he
was ſeen at <hi>Oxford</hi> at the ſame time when
this Book was about writing. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is
written ſomthing in a better Form than his
former Books are; yet there is much of <hi>F.
Bugg</hi>'s Whimſies in divers places in it, but
more particularly in the Front under his
Picture, he was <hi>firſt courted by the Library-keeper
of</hi> Bodleian <hi>Library</hi> at Oxford. See his 19<hi>th.</hi>
Book, called the <hi>Picture of Quakeriſm,</hi> the
Second Part, Page 164. there is a Letter from
the Library-keeper to <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> which begins
thus, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bugg, <hi>you muſt needs think it ſtrange
to receive a Letter from a Man ſo utterly unknown
to you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is matter of Admiration, that <hi>Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Men</hi>
ſhould take his Books for Truth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Credit and Relation of F. <hi>Bugg,</hi> being
a ſtranger to them, and an <hi>Apoſtate-Quaker,</hi>
which was never accounted good by any
Rational Honeſt Men, of what Perſuaſion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:38257:19"/>
I have read his three laſt Books lately, and
do affirm that there are as many repetitions
of Lyes as there are Leaves in thoſe Books,
only they are the ſame Lyes written over and
over again, very many times: But <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
met with Credulous Perſons, for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to make a Market on, to get his Debts
paid: For <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays in his laſt Book, that ☞ Oxford <hi>exceeded</hi> Cambrige <hi>in their bounty
to him.</hi> It is worth the obſerving, and
a Mercy to us alſo, that now they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
F. <hi>Bugg</hi> for their Informer againſt
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> they are obliged to pay him out
of their own Purſes: formerly the Informers
were paid out of our Eſtates, by the ſpoil of
our Goods.</p>
            <p>I now come to anſwer ſomething more
that concerns my ſelf and ſome others, page
64, 65. there are Verſes, F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſays, I writ of
<hi>G. Fox,</hi> this is Falſe, and that he knows in
his own Conſcience, that I have told him
divers times to the contrary, in former
Years, and lately alſo, a little before he writ
this laſt Book. The Verſes I writ had a
ſhort Declaration at the beginning, wherein
a Preacher is mentioned, but not <hi>G. Fox,</hi>
nor any other Man by Name: I always told
him that whatſoever I writ, it was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>G. Fox;</hi> theſe Printed Verſes are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mine, and partly his own; there is both
adding and diminiſhing from mine in ſeveral
places of them, and miſ-placing divers of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38257:20"/>
them; and making them hobble like his
own in the very beginning, by adding <hi>John
Story</hi>'s Name in them; the Man that theſe
Verſes did concern, was dead ſome Years
before <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s deceaſe. But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays
he hath the Manuſcript by him: That may
be forged; I writ a plain hand, eaſie to be
Counterfeited. I have ſeveral of the Copies
of my Verſes by me, and can prove that
thoſe Printed Verſes differs from mine in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places.</p>
            <p>I have ſomething to ſay of ſome of our
Preachers, which <hi>F. Bugg</hi> hath abuſed much
in Print: The firſt two are <hi>Thomas Green</hi>
and <hi>Samuel Cater,</hi> my Brother <hi>G. Barnardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton's</hi>
Companions, in his Travels beyond
the Seas, in the Service of Truth, to ſpread
the Goſpel in Forreign Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, that <q>
                  <hi>Thomas Green</hi> was a
poor <hi>Maſon,</hi> and now worth many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</q>
But he does not ſay of what; if
he means Pounds, I believe he does not ſay
true; <hi>T. Green</hi> hath neither Houſe nor
Land that ever I heard of upon enquiry,
his Wife, <hi>Ellen Green,</hi> had ſeveral Hundred
Pounds given her by ſome of her Relations,
as I have often heard, which ſhe being an
Ingenious Induſtrious Woman, imployed in
a Trade, ſo that between twenty and thirty
Years ſhe got enough to maintain them well
in their Old Age, now they have given over
Trading.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:38257:20"/>
F. <hi>Bugg</hi> quarrels with <hi>T. Green</hi> for not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
him at his Houſe, when he and
his Wife came to <hi>London:</hi> It cannot be the
Cuſtom of our Preachers, to entertain eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that comes to <hi>London,</hi> although they
have been entertained in their Travels, when
they viſited the Meetings in the Countries
where they preached; if they ſhould do ſo,
their Houſes would be like <hi>Inns.</hi> But F.
<hi>Bugg</hi> accuſes him for not keeping one of
his poor Brothers; there was no reaſon for
that, for what <hi>Ellen Green</hi> got by her Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
ſhould be ſpent by ſuch an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
woman as his Brother's Wife was, by
Relation, what they gave him, he ſhould be
little the better for, his Wife would devour
it: But <hi>T. Green</hi> kept his own Mother, and
his Wife's Mother many Years, in <hi>Meat,
Drink,</hi> and <hi>Cloaths,</hi> during their Lives; and
hired them a Houſe to dwell together, and
found them all other neceſſaries, as I have
heard. I never went to <hi>London,</hi> but they
always gave me entertainment, although <hi>T.
Green</hi> ſeldom came to my Houſe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and both <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Wife were
very ſerviceable to me, in providing me
Lodgings, or any other thing I deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel Cater</hi> I have known about Thirty
Years, he hath been a great Sufferer upon
the account of his Religion, Impriſoned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, Six Years at one time, a cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
for Three Years of the time not ſtirr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38257:21"/>
out of the Priſon. <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, that
<q>he was a poor Journey-man Carpenter,
and now a Rich Man, worth Hundreds of
Pounds.</q> What then, ſhall an Induſtrious
Man work more than Forty Years, and get
nothing? His Trade was a gainful Trade, if
it be wiſely managed, and yet he is not a
Rich Man; he hath a Commendable Houſe,
and the Lot that belongs to it, when the
<hi>Fenns</hi> were taken in, at little Port in the <hi>Iſle</hi>
of <hi>Ely,</hi> and two Acres and a half of Arable
Land in the Fields; and this is all his viſible
Eſtate that I can hear of; beſides a ſmall
Stock to carry on the <hi>Butter</hi> Trade, for he
is a Factor to ſend <hi>Butter</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> altho'
he is about ſeventy Years of Age, yet he gets
his living by that Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> makes a great noiſe againſt <hi>S. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
about a Meeting where <hi>S. C.</hi> was Fined
for Preaching, and had his Timber ſiezed;
but, <q>Had it again, ſays <hi>F. B,</hi> and had 10 <hi>l.</hi>
ſent him by his Friends towards his Loſs.</q>
That he had his Timber again, appears to me
to be a falſe Story of <hi>F. B</hi>'s making; for <hi>S.
Cater</hi> does affirm that he never had his Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
again, and that the Officers ſold it; his
Goods in his Houſe were ſiezed at the ſame
time, them he had again, a Neighbour
bought them of the Officers, and ſent them
to him: This ſhews what: a Malicious Lyer
<hi>F. B.</hi> is; and if any of his Friends were ſo
Charitable, as to ſend him 10 <hi>l.</hi> to help to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38257:21"/>
pay Debts, or to carry on his Trade, they
did well in ſo doing, better than <hi>F. B.</hi> in
upbraiding him.</p>
            <p>Now I come to <hi>George Whitehead; F. Bugg</hi>
hath vented his Malice againſt him in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
manner, in moſt of his Books, the
Cauſe whereof is, becauſe he hath anſwered
moſt of them, and laid him open effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
It is hard to recount how bitterly mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
this F. <hi>Bugg</hi> hath been againſt him, the
ſlanderous Lies that he hath vented againſt
him, are hard to be numbred, his own
Books will witneſs againſt him, that what I
ſay is true; for G. <hi>Whitehead,</hi> I have not
known him but by Report till of late Years;
<hi>F. Bugg</hi> reports him a poor Boy, came out of
the North on foot, his Father dwelt in a
poor Cottage not worth above 50 <hi>s.</hi> His Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
from his Youth ſhews to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
although I was not acquainted with him
but of late Years, yet I can ſay ſomething to
prove his Education and Learning in his
Youth, which is to be preferr'd before <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s,
that was but a Wool-Comber: <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
when he was a Young Man, travelled
in the Service of Truth, into <hi>Suffolk.</hi> I had
an Aunt, a Perſon of Quality, according to
the World's Account; ſhe was a wiſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and inquiſitive after Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that a Quaker might be brought to her,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38257:22"/>
to diſcourſe with. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> was brought
to her, and after her Diſcourſe with him, ſhe
told me and others, <hi>That the Quakers held the
ſame Opinion that her Couſin</hi> Barrow <hi>did, that
was hanged for his Religion in Queen</hi> Elizabeth'<hi>s
Days, and that this</hi> Barrow <hi>was Chaplain to her
Grandfather, Sir</hi> Nicholas Bacon: I heard my
Grandmother ſay the ſame thing, that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Barrow</hi> was her Father's Chaplain, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to his Children, whereof ſhe was one of
them; and that the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was the
chief Cauſe of his Death; and ſaid further,
that he was a very religious good Man; and
for <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> my Aunt ſaid, that ſhe did
believe that he was a Gentleman born, or
brought up under the ſame Education with
them, and call'd him the Gentleman Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
always when ſhe ſpoke of him.</p>
            <p>In Pag. 137, <hi>F. Bugg</hi> tells a long Story of
<hi>Stephen Criſp</hi> deceaſed, and <hi>Samuel Duncon</hi>'s
Wife of <hi>Norwich</hi> deceaſed. I have examined
the Truth of this Matter, and I find it to be
very falſe, and a wicked Report of <hi>Bugg</hi>'s
raiſing: He names <hi>Joſeph Carver,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Buddery,</hi> both of <hi>Norwich,</hi> for his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
Since I read this Book <hi>Joſeph Carver</hi>
hath been at my Houſe, I examined him, and
he ſaid that his Wife was <hi>Samuel Duncon</hi>'s Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and that he went often to <hi>S. Duncon</hi>'s
Houſe, and if there had been any thing as
<hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, he ſhould have heard ſomething
of it, which he never did; I deſired him to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38257:22"/>
ſend a Letter of what <hi>Tho. Buddery</hi> could ſay
in this Caſe. <hi>Tho. Buddery</hi> ſays, in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he ſent me, <hi>That this Story is like F. Bugg's
old Way of belying the Dead as much as the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
and ſays further, <hi>That</hi> Sam. Duncon'<hi>s
Wife was well known to all her Neighbours, to
be a ſober, honeſt Woman.</hi> This Woman was
lame, and made uſe of a Surgeon for Help;
and <hi>Bugg</hi> makes an Evil of that alſo. <hi>F. Bugg,</hi>
in Pag. 33. ſays, <hi>That</hi> Stephen Criſp <hi>was a
poor Weaver at the Beginning, and died a very
rich Man.</hi> What then if it were ſo? This
does not conclude him a diſhoneſt Man: He
married a ſecond Wife, that was a Dutch
Woman, that had Children by a former Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
It was ſaid that ſhe was very rich.
She died before him; and I have heard, that
when ſhe died <hi>S. C.</hi> gave all ſhe brought to
him, to her Children, and did not inrich
himſelf by her, therefore I have no Reaſon
to believe that he died a very rich Man. He
was a good Lawyer: I have made uſe of his
Counſel, and it was very beneficial to me;
but he took no Mony of me for it. He was
Guardian to many Orphans, and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
which he managed with much Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
and Honeſty for the Benefit of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans.
This I have heard from divers cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Fox</hi> is much quoted in F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s
Books, for <hi>making Laws for the Quakers.</hi> This
I muſt needs ſay, That he was a very wiſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38257:23"/>
Man, and a Man of great Courage in what
he undertook, and always ſucceſsfull, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had many Enemies to oppoſe
him, as well Apoſtate Quakers as others. I
never heard that he was worſted in any thing
he undertook: He was an Inſtrument in the
Hands of the Lord, to ſet up Meetings in all
Countries in this Nation, to take Care of the
Poor amongſt us, and poor Miniſters who
travelled beyond Seas, to be relieved with
ſuch Neceſſaries as they wanted, and this is
the Reaſon that <hi>F. Bugg</hi> calls them <hi>G. Fox's
Penſioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>F. <hi>Bugg</hi> knows, if he would ſpeak the
Truth, that we have no common Bank to go
to, but only occaſional Contributions for
charitable and neceſſary Supplies: Neither
hath he any Grounds to ſurmiſe it, only this
falſe Letter that he hath printed, which he
cannot prove to be a true Copy of what I
writ; but I can prove it a meer Cheat put
upon us by <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> or ſome of his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
            <p>F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſays, <hi>That</hi> G. Fox <hi>was a poor Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman
Shoemaker, and died worth Abundance:</hi>
I have heard that he did not die ſo rich as
F. B. reports; but he was an Adventurer at
Sea, and might get ſomething conſiderable
by that, if he uſed it many Years: F. <hi>Bugg</hi>
ſays, <hi>He lived in as much Plenty as any Knight
in England:</hi> I do not believe this; I have
heard this Story formerly from F. <hi>Bugg.</hi> I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38257:23"/>
had a Deſire to know how he fared: Some
Years before his Deceaſe, I being at <hi>London,</hi>
and underſtanding where his Lodging was,
I went about Dinner Time; when I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Room where he was, I found him ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down to Dinner, his Meat was upon the
Table, it was only a Piece of very ſalt Beef,
as big as a Man's Fiſt, it was cold Meat: I
ſate down by him until he had dined, but
did not eat with him, I did like his Dinner
ſo well: He had no Wine, his Beer was ſaid
to have Wormwood in it: I did not drink
with him neither; and this is the whole Bill
of his Fare at that Time: I had heard before,
by one of my Brothers that was well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with him, that moſt of his Diet was ſalt
Beef when he could get it, and Wormwood
ſtampt and ſqueezed into his Beer. After he
aroſe from Dinner, he made a ſhort Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to me, the Subſtance of it was, <q>That
I ſhould not look at him, but look to the
Light and Grace of God in my own Heart,
the Appearance of that would teach me
more than Man could teach me, that would
ſhew me who were God's Friends, and
who were his Enemies, if I were obedient
to it, and did wait in Silence for God's
teaching.</q> This was no more than what I
knew before, and had had ſome Experience
of it, nevertheleſs I kindly received his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and ſo we parted. I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to rehearſe the whole Matter of <hi>Bugg</hi>'s
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38257:24"/>
Charge againſt <hi>G. Fox,</hi> I will not trouble my
Reader with Tautologies that have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
already, but I will ſay ſomething
more of a new Charge againſt <hi>G. Fox,</hi> the
ſtrangeſt Lye that ever was heard of: Pag.
133. <hi>That he was, ſome Years before his Deceaſe,
like a Statue or unſenſible Image, which could
ſcarce ſee or underſtand, being grown ſo corpulent
in Bulk as two or three Men, and ſo dozed away
his Time with ſtrong Liquors and Brandy, who
left theſe Words for</hi> William Rogers, John
Rance, Ann Docwra, <hi>and others, who have
oppoſed his Tyranny and Uſurpation.</hi> For <hi>W.
Rogers</hi> and <hi>J Rance,</hi> they are wholly Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to me, <hi>A. Docwra,</hi> only I read ſome
Part of a Book that <hi>W. Rogers</hi> put forth: I
did not like it, there was many of <hi>F Bugg</hi>'s
Cavils in it againſt <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead:</hi>
For my own part, I never knew any Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or Uſurpation by <hi>G.</hi> F. I did not ſee him
for ſome few Years before his Deceaſe, yet I
always obſerved him much when I was in
his Company, becauſe his Enemies made a
great Noiſe of his Bulk.</p>
            <p>He was pretty tall of Stature, and a very
great Bon'd Man in my <hi>Judgment,</hi> but his
Face was not ſo fat as ſome fat Mens Faces
are, by much; his Hands were ſtiff and
ſwell'd, ſo that he could not well Write in
the latter part of his Days; his Limbs were
ſtiff, I could perceive that by his riſing up
and ſiting down, it is likely his Body was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38257:24"/>
ſwell'd, I have heard him ſpeak to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
he wore looſe Garments always when
I ſaw him, that I cannot diſcribe his bulk,
but I could perceive that he was ſomewhat
Burly, but not as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> deſcribes him.
And for his <hi>Dozineſs</hi> and <hi>Inſenſibility,</hi> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hundreds can Witneſs to the contrary;
for in leſs than three Days before his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,
he Preached in the Meeting in <hi>White-Hart-Court</hi>
in <hi>Gracious-ſtreet,</hi> he Preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a great Congregation of People, and
Prayed alſo: In his Declaration it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
Reported, That he opened many
weighty Truths, to the Refreſhment of many
of the Hearers, with as much Power and
Clearneſs, as at other times; and when he
came out of the Meeting, he was taken ill,
and ſoon took his Bed, and Deceaſed on the
Third Day following, in the ſame Week.
This is upon Record, ſee <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> p.
613.</p>
            <p>Now I come to Page 141, 142, 143. <hi>F.
Bugg</hi> ſays, <q>That <hi>George Smith</hi> of <hi>Little Port,</hi>
having a Wife of his own, ſince Dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Bailiff</hi> for a Gentleman in the ſame
Town, whoſe Wife was a handſome young
Woman; <hi>G. Smith</hi> in time grew very kind
to his Wife, the Gentleman falling Sick,
gave his Wife warning of <hi>G. Smith,</hi> he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there was room for him to accompliſh
his deſign.</q> This looks like a feigned Story,
that a Man ſhould entertain <hi>G. Smith</hi> for his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38257:25"/>
Bailiff to his dying Day, and be Jealous of
him concerning his Wife, and not put him
away before. <hi>F. Bugg</hi> goes on with a long
formal Story, more than he can prove by half;
he ſays, that <hi>the Widow had two Children by
G. Smith;</hi> the Woman was well known to
all her Neighbours to be a Light Woman, as
the General Report goes; ſo that no Body
could truly ſay who was the Father of her
Children. Nevertheleſs, <hi>G. Smith</hi> was ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as to own that Child that he thought
might be his; and it was made publick by
<hi>G. Smith</hi>'s Friends and Neighbours. After
this <hi>G. Smith</hi> did acknowledge his Offence,
and it is really Believed, that he did ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Repent; for he cauſed his Repentance to
be Recorded in our <hi>Quarterly Meeting</hi>-Book,
at <hi>Hadnam,</hi> in the Ille of <hi>Ely,</hi> and ſet his
Name to it. There was a Man in the Town
that would have Married this <hi>Widow</hi> at the
ſame time, when ſhe was with Child (with
that Child that <hi>G. Smith</hi> owned) but it was
put by then by her ſelf, or ſome other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
but ſhe happened to be with Child
again, and then the ſame Man Married her,
that would have Married her when ſhe was
with Child before; but the common Report
goes, that the Child ſhe was withal, when
ſhe Married, was neither <hi>G. Smith</hi>'s, nor the
Man's ſhe Married; but the Woman was
Rich, and that preferr'd her to a Husband.
It is ſaid, that ſhe lives honeſtly and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38257:25"/>
with the Man that ſhe is now Married to,
they are no <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, neither the
Man nor the Woman.</p>
            <p>After I read this Story of <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s, I made
ſtrict inquiry by credible Perſons, and have
made a true Relation, according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I received, although I knew moſt of
it before. This <hi>G. Smith</hi> I am acquainted
with, and will give this Character of him,
as moſt underſtanding Men in <hi>Little Port</hi> do
ſay, That he is a Man of excellent Parts to
manage any Buſineſs concerning Eſtates; he
has been Guardian to many <hi>Orphans,</hi> and
their <hi>Eſtates.</hi> not only <hi>Quakers</hi> Children, but
People of other Perſwaſions, have made him
Guardian to their Children's Eſtates alſo; and
he hath performed his Truſt with ſo much
Honeſty and Induſtry, for the advantage of
the Orphans, that he hath gained great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
in the Town where he dwells,
and Country thereabouts: I will Vindicate
him further, by a Warrantable Example of
<hi>David</hi>'s Sin and Repentance: For if there
had been no more Recorded in the Holy
Scriptures of <hi>David</hi> but his <hi>Adultery,</hi> he
would have been eſteemed a worſe Man than
<hi>G. Smith,</hi> becauſe of the known Murder;
but true Repentance wipes away the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Man's Sin, out of the Sight of
God and Good Men.</p>
            <p>But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, <hi>The Boy the Widow had,
is like</hi> G. Smith, <hi>which he does not own.</hi> It
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38257:26"/>
may be never the more ſo for <hi>Bugg</hi>'s ſay ſo,
and if it were ſuppoſedly ſo, that is no certain
Rule: There may be a ſecondary cauſe of
likeneſs after a Child is begotten, whoſoever
reads <hi>F. Malebranch,</hi> that Famous French
Man, in his <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> which is the
Title of his Book, may find therein many
excellent Things, both Divine and Natural;
but I do not juſtifie all that is in that Book,
but do approve of many things in it; he
hath a pretty large Diſcourſe of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
that happens to a Child in the Womb
of a Woman, after it is Begotten, in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
different likeneſs, with remarkable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>That which makes me the larger upon this
ſubject, is to ſhew <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Malice to ſo near
a Relation as <hi>G. Smith</hi> is to him; they are
Couſin Garmans, own Siſters Children: This
ſhews F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s ill Nature and Folly, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a Noiſe, to render ſo near a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
rediculous; but ſome cauſe of it is
plainly to be ſeen, in his Malice againſt <hi>G.
Whitehead,</hi> becauſe he ſaid, that <hi>G. Smith
was a well-meaning Man, one that hath liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
uprightly ever ſince he came amongſt us.</hi> F.
<hi>Bugg</hi> can prove nothing to the contrary,
when <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> writ this Relation of him,
nor any Body elſe that I know of; but it is
really believed he was really ſo then, this
that <hi>G. W.</hi> hath written, was ſome Years
before <hi>G. Smith</hi>'s failing, and we doubt not,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38257:26"/>
but that his Repentance will ſhew forth, that
he hath a real Principle of Sincerity towards
God and Man at this Day.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bugg</hi>'s <hi>Picture of Quakeriſm,</hi> the ſecond
Part, Page 164. the <hi>Univerſity</hi> Library-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Oxford</hi> promiſed F. <hi>Bugg, That his Books
ſhall be received into the</hi> Univerſity <hi>Library

in the Margent ſays, <hi>About four Years thereof,
I was in their Community labouring for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
His Book, called, <hi>The Painted Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,</hi>
&amp;c. ſhews that his Labour was to get
Mony when he was fined for any Preacher,
of whomſoever he could get it, amongſt us;
he got 15 <hi>l.</hi> of his Couſin <hi>G. Smith</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
by Fraud, upon that account, that was
no Preacher; this I know to be true, he
hath confeſſed it to me, and Printed it alſo,
and covered it with bold Excuſes, as much
as he could. F. <hi>Bugg</hi> was fined for a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
15 <hi>l.</hi> and got it by Fraud of his Kinſman
aforeſaid; the Juſtice that fined him, gave
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38257:27"/>
him 5 <hi>l.</hi> of the Mony back again, this he
concealed divers Years, until <hi>Edward Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
the Prieſt of the Town, where the
Meeting was fined, diſcovered it, and gave
a Certificate under his Hand, that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
told him that he gave F. <hi>Bugg</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> of
the Mony again, that he was fined for, at
that Meeting at <hi>Lacking-Heath</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> but
F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſays, <hi>That</hi> Edward Swanton <hi>the Prieſt
was a bad Man, and not to be believed: And
that the Juſtice gave him the</hi> 5 l. <hi>upon another
account.</hi> I have heard that the Juſtice was
Dead, before this Controverſie was on foot:
F. <hi>Bugg</hi> is now in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and
would have the Prieſts believed in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
but not out of the Pulpit, except it is
for his Intereſt: It is likely that this <hi>Edward
Swanton</hi> did give this Certificate meerly out
of Conſcience, when he heard that F. <hi>Bugg</hi>
had defrauded his Kinſman of the whole
15 <hi>l.</hi> upon the account of that Meeting, and
had concealed the 5 <hi>l.</hi> that the Juſtice gave
him back, a ſhort time after the Juſtice had
the 15 <hi>l.</hi> in his Hand.</p>
            <p>In Pag. 155. F. <hi>Bugg</hi> brings divers Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
to clear himſelf of ſeveral things,
whereof one is as followeth, <hi>viz. That</hi> F.
Bugg <hi>neither is, nor ever was diſtracted nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed
ſince any of us can remember him, or
that ever we heard of.</hi> This is the worſt Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of him that his Friends could give: But
if he be not ſhatter-headed, and diſcompoſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38257:27"/>
in his Mind: He is one of the greateſt Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and Lyers that this Age hath produced:
But my Judgment is more favourable. I
know, by the Diſcourſe I have had with
him lately, that he is diſturbed in his
Mind beyond all Reaſon, if he be croſſed in
any Diſcourſe or Writing againſt him, and
then he knows not when he ſpeaks Truth,
and when he Lyes: When he firſt writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, ſome Friends told him that he writ
Lyes: His Anſwer was, <hi>That his Pen would
run too quick ſometimes;</hi> and now lately, I told
him of ſome Paſſages in his Books, that he
had made falſe Quotations out of our Books,
and mentioned one to him out of <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
his Works, where he had rambled
above a hundred Pages, and gathered up
Words, and made one intire Paragraph of
them: His Anſwer was, that that was by
way of Paraphraiſe; ſo at firſt, when he
writ Lyes, his <hi>Pen run too quick,</hi> and now his
Lyes are <hi>Paraphraiſes,</hi> and ſuch crafty, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
crazy fooliſh Stuff his Books are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of, if he had been well in his Wits,
he would not have ſcribled away a fair E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and run many hundred Pounds in debt,
beſide to no purpoſe: I really believe, all
that he loſt by the Quakers, does not amount
to 32 <hi>l.</hi> ſee page 31. where he names their
names, and the Sums alſo; but in page
148. F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Quakers are
the chief Cauſe of my Misfortune, not only in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38257:28"/>
Reſpect of Controverſie, but Six or Eight breaking
in my Debt.</hi> If they had been real Quakers,
he would have named them every Man, for
he writes at large upon ſuch Matters; but to
my Knowledge, there was ſome that died
in his Debt that were of his own Fraternity,
that went about to make Diviſion amongſt us:
It was his reſtleſs Spirit, and ſhattered Head
that was the Cauſe of his Misfortune: They
that are well acquainted with his Books,
may perceive it: In the Title Page of divers
of his Books ſhews his wild Fancy, I will
quote ſome of them. His ſecond Book, the
Title Page, <hi>The painted Harlot ſtript and whipt,</hi>
&amp;c. The Title Page of ſome of the reſt; his
7<hi>th</hi> Book, <hi>battering Rams againſt</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
His 8<hi>th</hi> Book, <hi>One Blow more againſt New</hi>
Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His 9<hi>th</hi> Book, <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked,
and her Foundation ſhaken,</hi> &amp;c. His
10<hi>th</hi> Book, <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>arraigned, and out of
her own Mouth condemned,</hi> &amp;c. This Book is
the ſtrangeſt Fiction that ever I read. His
15<hi>th.</hi> Book, <hi>A Second Summons to the City</hi> Abeb,
<hi>by way of Metaphor, deliver up</hi> Sheba <hi>the Son of</hi>
Bichri, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. <hi>i. e. George Whitehead</hi> by
Name: This ſhews his Malice againſt <hi>G. W.</hi>
I know of a certain, that ſhatter-headed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are very malicious, and not to be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
and the Reaſon is, becauſe their
Imagination works ſo ſtrong, that it ſerves
for nothing but to make a Grave for their
Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:38257:28"/>
I have ſomething to ſay concerning <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Burrough,</hi> one of our Preachers; he was
before my time, I not being acquainted with
him, only by reading his Books, where I
find him to be a Man, both for Natural and
Supernatural Parts, extraordinary well Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.
But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, that he finds in his
Works, that he ſaid, <hi>That the Sufferings of the
Quakers were greater than the Sufferings of Chriſt
and his Apoſtles.</hi> There is ſomething upon
Record to that purpoſe, as I underſtand;
and this was in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Days, which he did
ſay, <hi>That the Quakers Sufferings were worſe,
in ſome reſpect, than the Sufferings of Chriſt.</hi>
And his Reaſon was, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Law for what they did; and the
<hi>Quakers</hi> Sufferings were very much upon
the account of ſmall Trivial Things, and no
Law, ſo much as pretended: Although no
<hi>Quakers</hi> do juſtifie this Paſſage, yet it may be
excuſed in ſome meaſure, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Truth. Some of the beſt of Men
have broke out into Paſſion under Sufferings;
and <hi>E. Burrough</hi>'s Sufferings were great at
that time, not only for himſelf, but ſeeing
ſo many of his Innocent Friends under great
Afflictions and Sufferings: Under the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Sufferings the beſt of Men have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much Weakneſs and Paſſion, when God
had forſaken them, or hid his Face from
them, for a ſhort time. And this was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
by <hi>Job,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38257:29"/>
others, our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs,
when he cried out, under the Agony of
his Suffering, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou
forſaken me.</hi> Now God's hiding his Face
from the beſt of Men, for a ſhort time, was
his Love to Mankind, to ſhew to Man his
Weakneſs, That no Fleſh ſhould Glory but
in the Lord.</p>
            <p>But <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> makes a great
Noiſe to have us retract our Books, if
they can prove Error in them; we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
what they can Charge us withal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and will do further if God Almighty
requires it; but will not concern our ſelves
with F. <hi>Bugg,</hi> and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> any further than
God requires us to do. Our Books are a
Teſtimony of the Sufficiency of the Light
and Grace of God in our Hearts, to bring
us to Salvation, if it be obeyed; to it we
have many Teſtimonies: For that, and our
Sufferings upon that Account, which we
ſhall preſerve, God willing, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to come may Rejoice in our Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
as we do Rejoice in the Teſtimonies
of the Suffering People of God in all Ages,
under what Denomination ſoever they are
Recorded: For ſuch People injoyed a large
Meaſure of the Light and Grace of God in
their Hearts, that bore them up above all
their Sufferings, in a publick Teſtimony in
all Suffering Times; which do witneſs, that
ſuch People are the Choſen People of God,

            <p>It will be Matter of Admiration to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
People, when the real Truth of this
Concern is known; that a Biſhop of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſhould appear ſo publickly
to Vindicate F. <hi>Bugg,</hi> and his Books, which
the Biſhop calls <hi>Uſeful,</hi> and that F. <hi>Bugg</hi> hath
taken <hi>great pains to Undeceive and Convert the
Quakers, and not without Succeſs,</hi> &amp;c. This
were a Matter of great Concernment, if it
were true. I intend to take notice of the
ſeveral Paſſages in the ſaid Certificate. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
As to his <hi>Honeſty and Induſtry;</hi> if he had been
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38257:30"/>
Honeſt and Induſtrious, as the Biſhop ſays,
he would not have loſt his Time, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
his Trade, for near Twenty Years, as
I can make it appear out of his own Books,
and ſpent a good Eſtate in Scribling againſt
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to no purpoſe, as will further
appear; and run many Hundred Pounds in
Debt, more than he was able to pay; and
his Creditors muſt needs have loſt much
Money by him, if this Project, with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
and ſome of the Clergy, did not take;
which was a thing doubtful, by his own
Confeſſion. In his 20th Book, p. 147. there
may be much more ſaid upon this account,
I will Inſtance but few of them. In or about
the beginning of the Year 1697. he Married
his Daughter, made great Feaſting and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
that was ſaid to be very
Chargable, and promiſed 300 <hi>l.</hi> Portion with
her, upon the Marriage: And at the ſame
time he was Indepted many Hundred Pounds
more than he was worth. He alſo gave
Bond, to make his Wife a Jointure of ſome
part of his Eſtate, which he hath ſince Sold
to his Son. Theſe things he has confeſſed
to me and others. And a few Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the aforeſaid Marriage of his Daughter,
he broke, and was ſculking about in the
Iſle of <hi>Ely:</hi> He then writ to me to conveigh
a Paper-parcel to <hi>Milden-Hall</hi> for him; the
Letter bears Date as followeth, <hi>June, Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
the 19<hi>th</hi> or 20<hi>th</hi> Day, 1697. When I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38257:30"/>
received this Letter, I was much ſurpriſed,
that F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſhould make ſuch a Requeſt to
me, which had held no Correſpondence with
him for above Twelve Years, nor ſo much
as read any of his Books in that time, only
I had ſeen the Anſwers to them. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to me, I looked upon as a Trapan,
that he might have ſome Colour to pretend,
that I was one of his Party in Print. I did
not intend to concern my ſelf with any of
his Paper-parcels, if they had been brought
to me; and I writ to him an anſwer to that
purpoſe: And in my Letter I reproved him
for his Apoſtacy alſo. So I cleared my ſelf
of his Concerns at that time. Theſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
things, concerning his Daughter's
Marriage, his Defrauding his Wife of her
Jointure, and Scribling away that which
ſhould have pay'd his Debts, ſhews that the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> lies under a great miſtake, as to F.
Bugg'<hi>s Honeſty and Induſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop, in his Certificate, further ſays,
That F. Bugg <hi>took great Pains to Undeceive
and Convert the</hi> Quakers, <hi>by publiſhing Uſeful
Books, and that not without Succeſs.</hi> This is
a Matter of great Concernment, if it were
true: I and many more can Witneſs, that
he neither proved us in Error, neither were
we ſo far Influenced by F. <hi>Bugg,</hi> as to give
Credit to what he writ; although F. <hi>Bugg</hi>
counted me to be one of his Proſelytes in his
20th Book, Pag. 133. where he ſays, That
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38257:31"/>
               <hi>I oppoſed</hi> G. Fox'<hi>s Tyranny.</hi> I never had any
Controverſie with <hi>G. Fox,</hi> from the time I
was firſt acquainted with him, to the time
of his Deceaſe: And when I had heard the
Controverſie on both ſides, I found that there
was many Lyes Forged of him, which made
me pitty him, and have the better eſteem of
him. I never heard any of the Separate
<hi>Quakers</hi> that oppoſed him, except F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſay,
that he was a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> But ſome of them
have ſaid to me, that now in his old Age, he
was Childiſh and Wilful: I did not perceive
any Childiſhneſs in him after that, but I
pleaded, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> had done much Service
for Truth; and if I had a Dog that had
done me good Service, I would not hang
him in his old Age, nor uſe him ill when
his Service was at an end; that ſhewed an
ill Nature to do ſo: But to return to my
former Diſcourſe, of what Proſelytes F. <hi>Bugg</hi>
hath made amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I have as
good Intelligence as the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> in our own
Concerns, and I hear of none that owned
F. <hi>Bugg,</hi> or his Books, except he counts
thoſe that Conformed to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the time of the Perſecution, to ſave
their Eſtates; and they may be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
accounted the Perſecuting Magiſtrates,
and the Biſhop's Proſelytes, than F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s;
yet I never heard that thoſe People owned
<hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Books.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:38257:31"/>
But F. <hi>Bugg</hi> may plead, That there are
ſome Separate <hi>Quakers</hi> that own him and his
Books; that was before he conformed to
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that many of them
did own his firſt Book, and his ſecond Book
was owned by ſome of them; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
me to write to one of them, of
my Acquaintance, That F. <hi>Bugg</hi> had written
Lyes in his ſecond Book, to give the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
warning of him.</p>
            <p>I believe it will be hard for the <hi>Biſhop</hi>
and <hi>F. Bugg</hi> to produce five Perſons that
ever was <hi>Quakers,</hi> that do own any of his
Books, that have been written for theſe laſt
ſeven Years, and more, even thoſe that were
called <hi>Separate Quakers.</hi> It is true, that he
ſpent his Time and Eſtate in making Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
amonſt us; and a Separate Meeting
was ſet up in <hi>London,</hi> which continued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Years, called, <hi>Harp-Lane</hi> Meeting; but
have been diſolved about two Years, and
thoſe People, excepting a very few, comes
now to our Meetings, as I underſtand. There
are divers honeſt People amongſt them,
they might ſee the inconveniency of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Meetings, and withdraw from it;
which might happen by <hi>George Keith,</hi> and
ſome others, making Diviſions amongſt
them, by raſing new Notions of Religion,
which was not entertained amongſt moſt of
them; but they held the ſame Principles,
as to Religion and Worſhip, as we do; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38257:32"/>
F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſays to the contrary, but he
does not ſay true, for I was at one of their
Meetings, and there was two Preachers, and
they preached the ſame Doctrine that all
other <hi>Quakers</hi> do, the Differences that F.
<hi>Bugg</hi> raiſed at firſt, was about ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Men, that was owned by ſome, and
diſ-owned by others, about <hi>Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
F. <hi>Bugg</hi> and ſome others were for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
without true Meaſure, this was Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſnt,
as appears by F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s own Books;
there came down from <hi>London</hi> ſome Orders
for <hi>Church Government,</hi> that were friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to us about ſeveral things: But
that which was made a Controverſie of, in
theſe Parts: Was, an Order to <hi>prevent Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine.
Marriages, and ſome other neceſſary
Things:</hi> Alſo, <hi>Men and Women's Meetings that
ſhould take care for the Poor.</hi> This was all the
principal Matter of F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Quarrels; and
not about any of our Principles of Religion:
I heard his complaints often, and they were
only theſe things I have here inſerted; I
did not contradict him, leſt I ſhould diſturb
his Head, and ſet him a ſcribling againſt me,
at a time when I was not willing to enter
into Controverſie with him, to put him to
Charges, it concerned others at that time,
that he had much abuſed in Print, to take
him in Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:38257:32"/>
And although I declined him then, yet
there is now a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and ſome part of the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> that have not only countenanced
him, but incouraged him alſo; which hath
imboldened him to be ſo inſolent, as to
Charge us in General, and me in Particular,
with Crimes that are meerly his own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which will not ſtand with his <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
or <hi>Clergy</hi>'s Reputation, if things be rightly
underſtood.</p>
            <p>See his <hi>Pilgrims Progreſs,</hi> Page 59. in the
Margent, where F. <hi>Bugg</hi> ſays, <hi>I told a Lye to
the Magiſtate, with deſign to Deceive, as bad as
Perjury:</hi> Altho' I have cleared my ſelf, and
my Friends, as to matter of Fact, in this
caſe, in the fore-part of my Book; yet
there remains a further Conſideration in this
point, that we may have ſome Satisfaction
from F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> if they do
not make good F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Charge, againſt
me and others, by credible Witneſſes,
which is no leſs than the Laws of the Land
requires: It is a diſparagment to my Friends
and Relations, to have one of them no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a Pillory'd Perſon. I and my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and my Father alſo, were of the old
Royalliſts, and ſuffered much in the time of
the civil Wars in <hi>England,</hi> in the days of
King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, upon the Account of
Loyalty: Therefore I thought good to let
the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> know, what my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and Relations are; not out of any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38257:33"/>
but to give ſome ſatisfaction to
my Friends and Relations, that I am ſo much
abuſed, and ſtand upon Record no better
than a perjured Perſon in F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Books,
and the Biſhops Certificate countenances
it.</p>

as appears by ſome of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38257:33"/>
have entertained ſuch a wicked Emiſſary, as
this <hi>F. Bugg</hi> is, whoſe deſperate Fortune hath
made him ſo reſolute, that he is not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Abuſe and Scandaliſe a great Body of
People in General, and vent whatſoever the
Devil puts in his Heart, who is the <hi>Father of
all Lyers,</hi> and thoſe that incourage them
alſo.</p>
            <p>Yet it is the deſires of our Hearts, that
they may come to Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life, if it be God's gracious Will,
that we may live peaceably in this day of
the viſitation of our bleſſed Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Jeſus Chriſt, wherewith he hath viſited
us, by his Light and Grace in our Hearts
and Conſciences, to bring us to Salvation,
and not to have any dependency on any
fallible or blind Guides; for as the Apoſtle
ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 8. <hi>For if the Trumpet gives an
uncertain Sound, who ſhall prepare for the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?</hi>
Now a true Chriſtian's Life, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<hi>Warfare,</hi> againſt the Enemies of their
Souls, and they ought to put on the <hi>Armour
of Light, Rom.</hi> 13. 12. This is the infallible
Guide to thoſe that live in Obedience to the
Teaching thereof; this is the gift of God,
that he hath given to all Mankind, to lead
them into the way of Righteouſneſs, if Man
do not reſiſt it, or be not lead out from it,
to follow the devices and deſires of his own
Heart, to imbrace the Delights, Vanities
and Deceits of this wicked World, which is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38257:34"/>
the cauſe that too many have laid down their
Heads in Sorrow, altho' they have had all
the injoyment this World could afford.</p>
            <p>I have a requeſt to my Reader, that he
would not be biaſed by any intereſt, but
ſincerely mind the Light and Grace of God,
in his own Heart and Conſcience, and then
ſhall my end be anſwered in what I have
written; and that the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> may
read the Ancient Principles of our Religion,
in the Light, and if he find any Error in
them, to ſhew it us in Love; and if he find
none, to give a Teſtimony he owns them to
be true; which is the ſatisfaction that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
for my Self and my Friends, for all the
uncharitable Cenſures and Defamations he
hath at unawares given Credit to; by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and incouraging F. <hi>Bugg</hi>'s abuſive Books,
full of miſ-repreſentations againſt us, that
deſire to live peaceably with all Men.</p>
            <p>Our Ancient Principles are inſerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this Book, I may repeat them that
they may be known more amply in this
place, 'tis Entituled, <hi>Truth's Principles: Or,
thoſe things about Doctrine and Worſhip, which
are moſt ſurely believed and received amongſt the
People of God, called</hi> Quakers. Theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are a Declaration of the Light and
Grace of God, which ſhews that That is
the <hi>Quakers</hi> Teacher, and Belief concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doctrine and Worſhip; but this is
accounted a dangerous Principle amongſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38257:34"/>
thoſe Teachers, that keep People always
in teaching that they may be always pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them: Theſe would ſpoil their Trade,
if People would come to be taught by the
Light and Grace of God in their own Hearts
and Conſciences, which is my Deſire for all
Mankind, that they may no more be led away
by the Craft and Subtelty of thoſe Men that
make a Money Trade of Religion, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
obſtructing the bleſſed Light and Grace
of God, which would ſhew unto all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
the true and real Way to Salvation,
and will no ways deceive them that be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to it, which will give more Satisfaction
to the humble and contrite Heart, than all
Worldly Injoyments, which is witneſſed by
me and many more that have had full Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of it, and deſire that all Mankind
would be ſo kind to themſelves, as to make
their Calling and Election ſure, by being
obedient to it: Farewel.</p>
