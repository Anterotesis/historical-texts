         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Mother Ierusalem, thou art made faire and sweet in thy delights, there is no such thing in thee as we suffer heere, and behold in this miserable life.

There is no darknes in thee, neither night, or any change of time. The light of the candle shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not in thee, or the bright Moone, or the beamy starres; but God of gods, the light of lights, the

There the quires of hymne-tuning Angels, there the societie of the supernall Cittizens, there the sweete solemnitie of all those that returne from this wofull pilgrimage vnto thy ioyes. There the prouident company of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, there the twelue number of the Apostles; There the victorious host of innumerable Martyrs; there the sacred couent of the saints Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors; there the true and perfect Monks, there the holy women, that haue ouercome the pleasures of the world, and the infirmities of theyr sexe.

            <p>THE first of the benefits is creation, of which, since it is notorious to all men, I will only enforce this, that a man for this onely cause is bound wholy to serue &amp; honour God who created him. For according to the

For this so great and excellent benefite, they ought to yeelde our Lord thankes, who acknowledge any notable fruit of this benefite in themselues. For let vs grant that this secrete is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from mortall eyes, yet whereas certaine signes of iustification are

            <p>Which beeing thus, wey I pray thee with thy selfe, ô man, vnder howe great an assurance our Lorde holdeth thee bound vnto him, for this immesurable benefite, namely to bee registred in that booke, of which our Redeemer sayde to his Apostles, Doe not reioyce in thys, that spirits are subiected vnto you, but reioyce because your names are written in the booke of life. Howe immesurable therefore is this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, to be beloued, and from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie elected, from which God was God? to rest in his most sweet bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, euen from the yeeres of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to be accounted the adoptiue Sonne of God then, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the more free it is, by so much the more holdeth it a man obliged.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the antiquity of this elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to bee considered, for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> not with the constitution of the world, but is more ancient then the world it selfe. Yea, it is of the same age that God himselfe is, who as he is from all eternity, so from eternity. loued he his elect, whom he behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with his fatherly and truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne eyes, remembring himselfe alwayes, to what an excellent good he hath fore-ordained and predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated them.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the rarenes of the reward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is to bee considered; Since that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst so many Nations of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people, and amidst so great a multitude of damned men, our Lorde would vouchsafe to call thee to so blessed a lot, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest bee of the number of those, which were chosen to euerlasting life, and that therefore he seperated thee from the masse of corruption of mankinde, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned for sinnes, and hath changed thee from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of corruption, into the breade of Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4179:65"/>In this consideration, a few things shall be found, which may be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and many things which may be weyed in minde, that the elected may be gratefull to our Lorde God for the perticularitie of this benefit, which is so much the greater, by how much the number of the elect is lesser, and of those which are to be damned greater, the number of whom (as Salomon affirmeth) is infinite.</p>
            <p>But if none of these things moue thee, yet at least-wise let the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the expence, which our most liberall Lorde had determined to make by reason of this benefite, moue thee. Such as is the lyfe of his onely begotten Sonne, and his blood shedde in the behalfe of thys benefit: who had decreed from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, to send him into this world, that hee might be the executor of this diuine determination.

            <p>Finally, with what seruices may the same bee recompenced? VVith what loue may a man aunswere this diuine loue? Who will bee so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull as to refuse now at length to loue him, of whom from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hee hath beene beloued?

            <p>Wherefore, since that in holie Scriptures, a friend of so many yeres is so much praysed and had in esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, who woulde change the possession and grace of so great a friende, for all the friendes of the worlde?

            <p>First, by it a man is reconciled to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Almightie GOD, and is restored to his loue and friendship.

<pb facs="tcp:4179:77"/>
by which we are reconciled to God, and of his enemies made his friends; and that not in the common degree of friendship, but in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that may be found, which is of the father towardes his sonne. This friendship Saint Iohn Euangelist de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth, when he saith. Behold what charity God hath she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed you,<note place="margin">1, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> that you are both bena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and be the sonnes of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not content to haue said, that wee are named, he addeth also that wee be, that the pufilanimity and little trust of men might manifestly know the beneficence &amp; liberality of God. And if in this world it be esteemed a thing of great moment, if any man should be honoured by his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, as by Bishops, Kings, Princes, or such like Potentates: I pray you what shall it be to be well thought of by the highest Prince, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Father, and the greatest Lord: in comparison of whom, all the principalities &amp; dignities of this world, are as if they were not?</p>
            <p>Another benefit fore-passing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> other, followeth: that Iustification deliuereth a man from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4179:77"/>
of eternall punishment, of which he was guilty for his sinnes. Which how great a benefit it is, he aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From all those punishments God hath deliuered them, whom he hath iustified, all which after they are reconciled, and receaued into his fauour, are freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wrath and paine of diuine reuenge.</p>
            <p>Behold another benefit more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, which is the reformation and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> innouation of the inwarde manne, which by sinne was defiled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered. For sinne doth not onely depriue the soule of God, but spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it of all supernaturall fortitude, and all the ritches and gifts of the holy Ghost, by which it was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, decked, and enritched: and as soone as it is depriued from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of these goods, it is wounded, maimed, and spoiled also of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall goods. For whereas a man is a reasonable creature, and sinne is a worke made against nature, and it is naturall that euery contrary destroy
<pb facs="tcp:4179:78"/>
his opposit: it followeth that by how much more our sinns are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by so much the powers of the soule are destroyed &amp; troubled, not in themselues, but in theyr to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings. After this manner doe sinnes make the soule misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, infirme, slowe, and instable to all goodnes, but ready and prompt to all euill, they make her weake to resist temptations, and slowe to walke the way of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Lord. They also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue her of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nion of the Spirit, and make her captiue to the world, the deuill, the flesh and her owne appetites: and after this manner, shee liueth in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der captiuitie then that of Babylon or Egypt. Besides, all the spirituall sences of the minde are made slow, so that they neither heare the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and diuine inspirations: neither see the great eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls that are prepared for them, neither smell the sweet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of vertue, nor the woorthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Saints, nor taste how sweet our lord is, nor feele his scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges nor acknowledge his benefites by which he prouoketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4179:78"/>
And besides all this, they take away the peace &amp; ioy of conscience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the feruor of the Spirit, and leaue a man defiled, lothsome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, &amp; abhominable in the sight of God and all his Saints. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite deliuereth vs from all these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. For the Abiss of diuine mercy, is not content to haue pardoned our sinnes, and to haue receiued man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fauour, except hee also expell all those euills which sinnes bring with them, reforming &amp; renewing our inward man. After thys manner he healeth our woundes, hee wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our vncleannes, he breaketh the bonds of sinners, destroyeth the yoake of euill desires, deliuereth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seruitude of the deuil, mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the fury of our peruerse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, &amp; restoreth vnto vs the tru liberty &amp; pulchritude of the soule, giueth vs peace &amp; ioy of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, quickneth our interior sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; maketh them prompt to doe all goodnes, &amp; slow to all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. He maketh them strong to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist temptations of the deuill, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doweth them with good works. To conclude, so absolutely renueth hee
<pb facs="tcp:4179:79"/>
and repaireth he our interiour man with all his powers; as the Apostle feareth not to call such kind of men, iustified, renewed, or rather new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> creatures. This renouation is so great, that when it is giuen by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, it is called regeneration, and when it is restored by repentance, it is called resurrection: not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the soule is raised from the death of sinne, to the life of grace; but because in a certaine manner it imitateth the beauty of the future resurrection. And that is so true, that no tongue of man is sufficient to expresse the beauty of the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied soule; but only that spirit kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth this, that beautifieth the same, and maketh it his temple, &amp; lodgeth himselfe in it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if thou compare all the ritches of this world, all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, all his naturall graces, and all his acquired vertues, with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ritches of the soule that is iustified, all of them shall seeme most obscure &amp; vild in comparison thereof. For as great difference as there is betwixt heauen and earth, betweene the spirit and the bodie,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4179:79"/>
betweene eternity and time, so great also is founde betwixt the life of grace, &amp; the lyfe of nature, between the beauty of the soule, and of the body, betwixt the interior and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior riches, betweene spirituall and naturall fortitude. For all these are circumscribed by certaine termes, are temporall, and seeme only faire to the out ward eye, to which the generall concourse of God is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but to those other, a perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler &amp; supernaturall concourse is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: neyther can they be called temporall, where as they bring to eternity, neither any wayes termed finite, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ause they deserue God, in whose eyes they are so precious, and of such value, that by theyr beautie they prouoke God himselfe to loue. But whereas God might worke all these thinges by his onely presence, he would not doe it; but it pleased him to adorne the soule with infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vertues, and with the 7. dowers of the holie Spirit; with which, not onel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it suffiseth not the diuine Spirit to haue led man in by the gate of iustice, but after that man hath entred, hee is likewise as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the same Spirit, and is led by the hand into all his wayes, till
<pb facs="tcp:4179:83"/>
the waues of this stormy sea beeing ouer-ceased, hee attaine safe and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to the hauen of saluation. For after that (by the means of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said benefite) the holy ghost hath entred into the iustified soule, hee sitteth not there idle, it su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hee sitteth there like the Father of a familie in his house, gouerning the same: hee sitteth there like a Maister in a schoole, administring it: like a gardner in his garden, trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it: like a king in his kingdom ruling it: like the Sun in the world, illuminating it: Finally, like the soule in the body, giuing him lyfe, sence, &amp; motion: not as the forme in his matter, but as the Father of his familie in his houshold.</p>
            <p>What therefore is more blessed, and more to bee desired, then for a man to haue in him-selfe such a guest, such a guyde, such a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, such a gouernour, finallie, such a tutor and helper? who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all in all, worketh also all things in the soule in which it abideth. But especially like fire hee illuminateth our vnderstanding, inflameth our will, and exalteth vs from the earth vnto the heauens.</p>
            <p>Hee like a Doue maketh vs sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, milde, peaceable, and friendes to all men. Hee like a clowd, coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, and defendeth v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of this number, the first is the grace

of the holy spirit, next after that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, the beginning of all other priuiledges, and celestiall gifts.

Another effect thereof is, not onely to adorne the soule, but also to strengthen it, by the meanes of

those vertues which proceede from the same, which are like Sampsons haires, in which con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In which words there is a double liberty insinuated, a false, and a true.

although they haue theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die sometimes free, somtimes thrale and captiue.

            <p>¶ Of this liberty of the good, &amp; thraldome of the wicked, there is a most excellent and copious treatise, in the first booke of the Guide of a sinner, part 2. chap. 19. to which place we refer the Reader.</p>

which the Apostle sayth; Being iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified therefore by fayth, let vs haue peace with GOD.<note place="margin">

               </gap> two men, and they contrary the one against the other; as are the interior and exterior; or the spirit and flesh; the appetite and reason.

               </gap> their sences &amp; appetites, and all their wil resigned into the hands of god, are not by any encounter so pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as that they loose theyr interior peace. This peace is promised by our Lord, to the louers of vertue, by the kingly prophet, when he sayth; Great is the peace of those that loue thy lawe,<note place="margin">

like a riuer, &amp; theyr iustice, like the waues of the sea. But what peace this is, may rather be vnderstood by the practize then speculation; For the iust man knoweth, howe much his hart differeth now when he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth God, from that which he bare about him, when he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersant in the world: For then, in all perrill of tribulation hee was suddainlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde, he trembled, in hart and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die he feared: But after hee left the world, and translated his hart to the loue of celestiall things, and planted all his hope in God, he ouer-passeth all things what soeuer chance, with a quiet hart subiected to Gods will. All the perturbations of his minde, as if dead, are at rest, neyther is hee prouoked by any affections: The inferior part of the minde, is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the superior gouerneth, &amp; that in great peace &amp; exelent order.</p>
            <p>But the wicked and sinners, are alwayes in warre, contention, and perturbation: for while on the one side they are depriued of grace, which is as it were a bytte restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theyr passions and mortifying them; &amp; on the other side, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled

That which is past, hee greeueth at; that which is present, afflicteth him; that which is to come, terrifieth him; and that he may sustaine himselfe with a litle morsel of bread, he must often labor all his life time.</p>
            <p>This one thing did so much afflict those wise men in time past with so much tediousnes, that among them there is one to be founde, that was not afrayd to say, that hee doubted
<pb facs="tcp:4179:107"/>
whether Nature were our mother, or rather our step-dame, which hath subiected vs to so many miseries. Which beeing so, what remedy (I pray you) hath hee left, who puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed man-kind so greeuously? Tel me, what remedy hath a man, weak and lame, that sayling by sea, with one misfortune looseth al his riches? I know what thou wilt say; if thou sayst hee hath not where-vpon to liue, neither that by reason of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie he can labour for his liuing, it must needes be that hee must beg: neyther hath a man other remedie left him, then like a poore begger to cry at the gate of our Lord. But thou wilt perchance aske me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this remedy be vniuersal, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery necessity of our life? To thys (since it wholy dependeth on gods wil) I can aunswere nought els, but that God chose vnto himselfe, to this end, witnesses &amp; secretaries, such as are the Apostles and Prophets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom one sayth; There is not another so great a Nation,<note place="margin">

we do pray, although we see no man that answereth vs, yet speak we not vnto the walls, but god himselfe is present with vs, who heareth and helpeth vs when we pray, hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of our necessities, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the remedy. What therefore more greater comfort may it be to him that praieth, then to haue assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of so certain a presence. And if this be sufficient to comfort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that pray, how much shall those thinges confirme them, which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe speaketh, saying; Aske &amp; you shall haue,<note place="margin">

A thousand &amp; more of such like authorities, might be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the sacred Scriptures, by which may bee gathered, that the godly are handled and heard like chyldren, but the vngodly reuerted like enemies.</p>
            <p>The tenth priuiledge of vertue is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that God helpeth the righteous in whatsoeuer theyr tribulations: For to the louers of vertue, there is a strength and fortitude giuen, that with ioy they may sustaine theyr tribulations, which shall neuer fayle them in this life. For we know, that there is not a sea so stormie in thys world, neyther an Euripus so insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as our life is.

And it is a thing woorthy of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to see, with howe great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the good and euill sort, doe passe ouer thys mutable Worlde. For the vertuous doe assuredly knowe, that they haue GOD for

theyr Father, and that it is hee that enioyneth them to taste thys cuppe, like a certaine medicine prescribed by a most expert and cunning Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. And that tribulation is as it were a refining or polishing, which the more sharper it is, so much the more pure and brighter dooth it make the soule, and clen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eth away all corruption: and therefore they cast downe theyr heades, and are humbled like young children in the time of tribulation.</p>
            <p>But if at any time the labour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, the help of the diuine grace, is presently at hand, that neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh the iust in time of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For GOD himselfe (as his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worde witnesseth) is neuer more neere the faythfull, then in the time of theyr tribulation, although it seemeth quite contrary.</p>
            <p>Reade and ouer-reade the sacred Scriptures, and thou shalt finde that there is scarcely any thing that is so often repeated &amp; promised in them, as that which we heare speak of. Is it not writt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Of thys those three holy young men had a feeling, when king Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonozer commaunded them to bee cast into the burning fornace in Babylon.

For euen as when the hart is vexed, all the blood from euery part in the body, hath recourse there-vnto, to succour it least it fayle; So when the soule is ouer-pressed with griefe and anguish, all the vertues do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently concurre, and help, her now thys way, straight another way: Fayth is at hand, bringing with her a cleere knowledge of the good &amp; euill that followeth after thys lyfe: Hope likewise commeth, which maketh a man patient in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in expectation of reward.

God is good, it is reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that man should be goode, and hope in him: who when hee is a most grieuous sinner, is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him into grace, if with all his hart he conuert himselfe vnto him. Because God is good, and so good, truly it is a double sinne to offende so great a goodnes. Therefore by how much the more thou amplifiest the goodnes of God, by so much the more doost thou make hainous thy sinne which thou committest against him. Nowe is it requisite, that so greeuous a sinne should bee punished: for such is the nature and office of the diuine iustice (which as thou thinkest is not opposite, but a sister and reuenger of the Diuine bounty) that it cannot leaue so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous an iniury vnpunished.</p>

            <p>BVt perchance thou wilt say, that the loue of thys world, &amp; the thinges that are therein, haue captiuated thy hart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and led thee from the way of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Thys is the excuse of a man that hath not tasted spirituall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, &amp; therefore these carnal goods are so much esteemed by him. The clowne thinketh, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more precious then his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4179:127"/>
because hee hath neuer seene the proude and stately buildings of great citties. The infant, issuing out of his mothers wombe, mourneth and weepeth, because hee knoweth not that the world is far more bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hee entreth into, then the prison from whence he issueth. The men of former times highly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their cottages made of turffe, and couered with straw, before they saw more substantiall buildings. To all these may carnall men bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, who neuer saw or had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the spirituall goods, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tasted the sweetnes, dignity, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and beauty of the same; and therefore they more esteeme these false and fraile benefites (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede are nothing lesse) then the spirituall, which are onely thought worthy the name of benefites.

thou say thereto. Euen as therefore men haue cast away their false gods, after they acknowledged the true God, they also shall cast away and despise the false goods of this world, euen presently, as soone as they shal taste the true and celestiall goods. For as soone as a man hath tasted the sweetnes of spiritual things (saith Saint Bernard) he despiseth the flesh, (that is, all the goods and pleasures of this world:) and thys is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reason of this error, which so much blindeth the men of thys world.</p>
            <p>Besides this errour, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, namely, that men not onelie knowe not spirituall thinges but are also vtterly ignorant of temporall.

God dieth, that sinne may die, and we will that that liue in our harts, to depriue thee of life, for which the very sonne of God suffered death: and what shall I say more? There are many reasons in this one, for I say not that Christ is to be behelde hanging on the Crosse, but whether so euer we turne our eyes, wee shall finde that all thinges exclaime, and call vs to this goodnes: for there is not a creature in this world, if it be well considered, that doth not inuite vs to the loue &amp; seruice of our Lord.
