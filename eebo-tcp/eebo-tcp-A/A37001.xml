         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Should be very ungrateful
for the many extraordinary
Favors, which Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has often shower'd upon me,
if I omitted studying all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ways to lay my Faithful
Acknowledgments at Your Feet,
who have so often been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to honor me with Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and several of the
following <hi>Poems</hi> with Your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
<pb facs="tcp:65399:3"/>
and Applause: And
since a POET can no better
way express his Gratitude, than
by an humble Address and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of his Endeavors, be
pleased, My Lord, to accept this
Book, as a Tribute due to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Merit; and as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of Thanks, for the Value
Your Lordship is pleased to set
on POETRY in General.</p>
            <p>My Lord, You not only Grace
and Dignifie my unworthy <hi>Poems</hi>
by Your Noble Patronage, but
are an Honor to the Age You
live in, by shewing such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
the Love and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
You have to Wit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
sufficiently demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:65399:3"/>
your Own Worth, for since
nothing can more Illustrate a
Young Nobleman, than Arts
and Sciences; You have taken
the securest way by Encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to declare your Heart
is not set upon the Vanities of
the World, so much, as to slight
or neglect the more solid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Soul, Knowledge
and Learning.</p>
            <p>Your Observations also in
your Travels, have given you
a greater Estimate than others
have acquired of the same Rank,
you have brought home more
than your Self again, Embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Languages, together
with a Survey of the Manners
<pb facs="tcp:65399:4"/>

            <p>I must beseech your Lordship
not to let a decent <hi>Encomium</hi> sound
harshly in your Ear, nor think

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NOT being able to Excuse my self from
the Importunity of some Persons of
Quality, and others of my best Friends, whose
obliging Requests, as well as generous Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
have been the chiefest Reasons of my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the following Sheets; it would be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
Fault, and indeed a Presumption in
me not to beg the unbiass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d and Impartial <hi>Reader,</hi>
to favor them with his good Nature, and wink
at the many Errors and loose Writing in several
of them, some having been written many Years
ago, and upon low Subjects, especially the two <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque
Letters,</hi> which were written for a Friend
in haste, and upon a Subject given me. The
<hi>Ladies</hi> too I must beg to Pardon me for a loose
Copy or two, particularly, <hi>Phillidor's Tale</hi> of a
<hi>True Intrigue,</hi> Page 40. which was turn'd
into Verse from the Story which the Gentleman
<pb facs="tcp:65399:6"/>
himself told me, and though the Freedom of it
may disoblige some of the Nicest of the Fair Sex,
who will be noted to understand more than they
should, yet 'tis my hope, that the more Iudicious
will only look upon it as it is, a piece of Mirth,
and a natural Description of a Comical Accident,
or else, which is much better, forbear looking
on it at all, and so be accounted extraordinary for
suppressing a Curiosity, which it was never known
a Woman was Capable of doing before. In Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
of this Nature, both good and bad, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and serious, generally mix, though not with
the <hi>Author</hi>'s liking, yet for the <hi>Stationer</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of swelling the <hi>Book,</hi> in which, I hope,
there are some others that will make amends,
<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Essay</hi> in Defence of <hi>Verse,</hi> The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legy</hi>
on the Duke of <hi>Ormond;</hi> The <hi>Dream;</hi>
The <hi>Ode</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> Page 180, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
have had the good Fortune to be approv'd of and
commended by some of the best Iudges of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
these latter Ages have produc'd; and
will, I hope, find the same success with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<hi>Reader;</hi> Though I must confess the
first is a Theme of that Value, that it were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:65399:6"/>
to employ the Inimitable Pen of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi>
than any <hi>Poet</hi> of a meaner Class, the Sordid
Enemies of this Noble Art being so numerous,
and consequently the defence of it so much the
more difficult; This has given me occasion to
recount in the aforesaid <hi>Essay</hi> the nature of
the Criticks and Iudges of the former Golden
Age, and compare them with our present Iron
one, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>The Sober Criticks were all Judges then,</l>
                  <l>And what they cavill'd at, could well maintain:</l>
                  <l>Instruction, and not Envy fill'd their Minds;</l>
                  <l>The Wits, and would be Wits, were different kinds:</l>
                  <l>Reason and Judgment founded their Disputes,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Orpheus</hi> there was safe amongst the Brutes;</l>
                  <l>But here where Routs of Bachanals do throng;</l>
                  <l>Alas, what <hi>Orpheus</hi> can defend his Song! <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
most of our <hi>Town</hi> Wits Criticising upon <hi>Poetry,</hi>
not through any solid Understanding they have
of the matter, but to insinuate a Value of their
Eminent Parts into some unheeding Auditor, that
easily could, but thinks it loss of time to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
them.</p>
            <p>Thus has dejected <hi>Poetry,</hi> in this Age, very
few or no real Friends; Those that judicially
<pb facs="tcp:65399:7"/>
can correct Errors, being modestly unwilling to
expose them, and those that cannot, most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
too forward in pretending to it; like a
Country Clown at Cudgels with a Master of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
still striking without Fear or Wit, though
at every blow the Blood runs about his own Ears,
through his want of Skill, and ridiculous Rashness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> that I have here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
have, I thank my Fortune, as well as those
formerly printed, generally pleas'd the <hi>Town,</hi>
and though some may appear a little rough
and unpolish'd in the Reading, the amends is
made when they are Sung, for I have still
taken care to put some Fancy and Thought
in them, and the Iudicious are sensible that 'tis
no easie matter, nor is it every one's Talent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
Sense and smooth Verse to Notes, the quality of
performing it well, being as particular as difficult.</p>
            <p>It does not, thank my Stars, afflict me
much to know, that a certain very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy
Author of this Age, has been this Ten
Years pecking at me about this matter, though
with as little Success as he had Reason to do so,
I having no Correspondency with him, nor to the
<pb facs="tcp:65399:7"/>
best of my Memory, have any of our Brethern
ever given him any occasion to shew the scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his <hi>Satyr,</hi> in expressing himself in such
Tropes as <hi>these, Fellows of no Genius, yelping
Curs, Parasites, Knaves,</hi> &amp;c. nor does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
us at all to know whether <hi>Poetitto</hi> or <hi>Poet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dungus,</hi>
be the best name for a comical Author,
we have, I think, two ways to expound him, and
I suppose he is pleased to new baptize us, either,
for diminutive Wits, or Persons: if for the first
we must comfort our selves, and be instructed
as well as we can; but for my own part if he
lashes me for want of shape, that I confess <hi>from
him</hi> troubles me extremely.</p>
            <p>I am not very uneasie neither to have if judg'd
whether my <hi>Grubstreet Songs,</hi> as he hints at
them, or his late <hi>Grubstreet Anniversary Ode</hi> be
the most notorious, or in his own Phrase, most
like the Stile of <hi>Tom Farthing:</hi> I know what
the Town says. And since it has sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
its own defects, I shall think my Injury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
to the full, and therefore rest satisfied till
farther Provocation.</p>
            <p>There is no Passion incident to Humanity
<pb facs="tcp:65399:8"/>
of so low and base a degree as Malice, which I
could lash to the quick; nor would the Title of
<hi>Poet Laureate,</hi> and <hi>Historiographer Royal,</hi>
at all deter me from a just Resentment, if I
had not an awful Veneration for that noble Patron

            <l>When th' Oaken Garland, and the Laurel Crown</l>

            <l>Tho Tuneful Verse delights each clodded Brain;</l>
            <l>Poet, and Science both, all Fools disdain.</l>
            <l>Fools ever hate an Art they can't attain.</l>

            <l>In vain is Study, useless is the School,</l>
            <l>Since every Art's abus'd by every Fool.</l>
            <l>Where Verse has not the power to Influence,</l>
            <l>What method ever can reform the Sence?</l>
            <l>What would a <hi>Cato,</hi> or a <hi>Virgil</hi> be,</l>

When times are so corrupt they cannot bear</l>
            <l>Reproof, it is a sign Confusion's near:</l>

            <l>To calm wild griefs, and still the stormy mind;</l>
            <l>And by a soft and pleasing Elegance,</l>
            <l>The sweets of Artful Rhetorick t'advance,</l>

            <l>Folly, and not Philosophy Rules there.</l>
            <l>Yet though good Writing be a gift sublime;</l>
            <l>How do the Poetasters of the time;</l>
            <l>Debauch the Science still with Dogril Rhime.</l>
            <l>Ne'er heeding what degrees of Nonsence swell;</l>
            <l>The guilty Lines, if they but Jingle well.</l>
            <l>'Tis Rhime the Readers reason must controul,</l>
            <l>Rhime is the Sence, the Substance, and the Soul.</l>
            <l>In a whole Poem let no Wit be found.</l>
            <l>If every Couplet end the with same sound.</l>
            <l>Poets, that justly would their fame advance,</l>
            <l>Should make Rhimes fall as if they came by chance.</l>

A Tuneful word the Verse more sweet to make,</l>

            <l>Show rather than the Wit, the heat of Brains.</l>
            <l>Since Nature bears chief Rule in Poetry,</l>
            <l>Than this, what more unnatural can be?</l>
            <l>To hear a King, in Rhime express his Rage,</l>
            <l>Or for his Cloak, in Verse to ask his Page.</l>
            <l>A Lady too in sounding Numbers tell,</l>
            <l>How oft she took a Glister, and how well.</l>
            <l>Such stuff the Reader every day may meet,</l>

            <l>Patron of Verse, thy soul on Earth did move,</l>
            <l>In the same glory now it shines above.</l>
            <l>Kindle in me, oh <hi>mighty Bard,</hi> thy fire,</l>

            <l>Whilst the wise few, do in this mirror see</l>
            <l>The sordid enemies of Poetry.</l>
            <l>First the Town Fop, in modern Stile, the <hi>Beau,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Inspir'd by learn'd <hi>Pontack,</hi> or wise <hi>Grilleau:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Dress'd like a Wax-Work-Baby in a Glass,</l>
            <l>That wasts the Morn consulting his odd Face.</l>
            <l>Studies his Stockins with a pensive Head,</l>
            <l>To know which best becomes, the Green or Red;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65399:13"/>
And Patches cuts, sented with Amber-Greise,</l>
            <l>To hide the Rubies in his pudled Phiz:</l>
            <l>Is one that does to Poetry worst spite,</l>
            <l>By the pretences that he has to write,</l>
            <l>Flush to <hi>Wills</hi> Coffee House he comes each
night.</l>
            <l>Confirm'd those Wits are all charm'd with his parts,</l>
            <l>As with his <hi>Beau Visage</hi> the Ladies Hearts.</l>
            <l>To prove this, straight some Poem is inspected,</l>
            <l>And by this Farrier barb'rously dissected:</l>
            <l>The mirth goes round, the Paper they condemn,</l>
            <l>Some at the Verses laugh, and more at him;</l>
            <l>But that's not heeded by his grinning Crew,</l>
            <l>Fools always laugh, when e'er their fellows do:</l>
            <l>And when a Jest is put, each has a pride</l>
            <l>To think whoever laughs 'tis on their side.</l>
            <l>Thus 'tis not known which Verse is good or bad,</l>
            <l>Because this Fop the Criticism made:</l>
            <l>For all the Wise owe Poetry a grudge,</l>
            <l>When such as he pretend to Write, or Judge.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65399:14"/>
His praise is fatal still, and if he Reads,</l>
            <l>The Martyr'd Poem still the worse succeeds.</l>
            <l>So Rats, that build in Country Barns their Nest,</l>
            <l>Part of the Corn devour, and spoil the rest.</l>
            <l>Such Fops as this the Poet's fame expose;</l>
            <l>This still is one of their invet'rate Foes:</l>
            <l>His managing the state of Verse so ill,</l>
            <l>On the whole Science brings a scandal still.</l>
            <l>In vain, alas, toils the aspiring Drudge:</l>
            <l>'Tis only Wit, that Wit can Write, or Judge.</l>
            <l>A Jewel rated at a price so high,</l>
            <l>That few have stock of Brains enough to buy,</l>
            <l>Yet all aim at the Jem to make'em fine;</l>
            <l>Nay, rather than they'll not be thought to shine:</l>
            <l>Deck'd with dull Pebbles, not true Warts of Rocks,</l>
            <l>Th' appear like Mrs. <hi>Hâ€”ton</hi> in a Box.</l>
            <l>Tho Wit, within it self, a Beauty be,</l>
            <l>'Tis still more charming dress'd in Poetry:</l>
            <l>A Robe, which is by Heavens peculiar care,</l>
            <l>Design'd for very, very few to wear.</l>
            <l>

For as an awkard, ill bred, Country Clown,</l>
            <l>From his dull Parents newly come to Town:</l>
            <l>Though his Court Taylor racks his Brain to dress</l>
            <l>The Booby, and set off his silly Face,</l>
            <l>Yet all find out the brutish soul within,</l>
            <l>The Ass is seen for all the Lions skin.</l>
            <l>So th' noisie Bully that oft plagues the Pit,</l>

            <l>The braying <hi>Momus</hi> is not hid from view,</l>
            <l>For the dull Ears will still be peeping through.</l>
            <l>The next ill Tribe that Poetry disgrace,</l>
            <l>Is, to their shame, amongst the Female race:</l>
            <l>A Wanton sort of Town Coquets there are,</l>
            <l>That Poets hate, because they Poets fear.</l>
            <l>Wholesom Reproof, like Age, still comes too soon,</l>
            <l>And worse than the Small-Pox, is a Lampoon.</l>

Rogues, to expose her faults to all the Town,</l>

            <l>What though to wanton Plays she'll railing come,</l>
            <l>Yet Act each night far lewder Scenes at home?</l>
            <l>What though her fame is known so well abroad,</l>

            <l>When she has bosom Friends, to prove untrue</l>
            <l>Each Amorous slip, though done in open view.</l>

            <l>Vertue on single Innocence depends,</l>
            <l>But favourite Vice is stor'd with many Friends.</l>
            <l>Howe'r of these, a numerous Tribe there are,</l>

            <l>So does her Wit each fond admirer warm,</l>
            <l>And with her killing Eyes has equal Charm.</l>
            <l>In her dear Breast, the Arts will flourish still,</l>
            <l>There lies no Malice, nor there wants no Skill;</l>
            <l>Her Divine Soul enjoys a blest Repose,</l>

            <l>Their choicest Friends they still deny to please,</l>
            <l>Yet if unask'd shall rudely Sing so long,</l>
            <l>To tire 'em quite with each repeated Song:</l>
            <l>I strongly then should take his Satyr's part,</l>
            <l>Lash the Performers, and despise their Art.</l>
            <l>But having studied long enough to be</l>
            <l>A little knowing in that quality:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65399:20"/>
I soon perceiv'd when I his Version met</l>
            <l>'Twas more from Prejudice, than Judgment writ.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Horace</hi> was in his Reproof more free,</l>
            <l>Because <hi>Tigellius</hi> was his Enemy,</l>
            <l>Whose resty Vice must bear this fierce Assault</l>
            <l>Whilst all the rest are lash'd for one man's Fault.</l>
            <l>Satyr should never take from Malice aid,</l>
            <l>For with due Reverence to <hi>Horace</hi> paid,</l>
            <l>Who rails at Faults through personal prejudice,</l>
            <l>Shews more his own, than shames another's Vice;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tigellius,</hi> as his Character is plain,</l>
            <l>Was of a Humour most adsurd and vain,</l>
            <l>Fantastick in his Garb, unsettled in his Brain.</l>
            <l>And if (as once great<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis reported of him, that <hi>Augustus</hi> once earnestly desiring him to sing, was deny'd.</note> 
               <hi>Cesar</hi> he deny'd</l>
            <l>When ask'd to Sing) 'twere the effect of Pride:</l>
            <l>Lictors and Fasces should have bluntly taught</l>

But if <hi>Augustus</hi> his Commands did lay</l>
            <l>When th' Genius was not able to obey;</l>
            <l>As oft with Singers it will happen so,</l>
            <l>According as their Joys or Troubles grow;</l>
            <l>'Twas no Offence then to excuse his Art,</l>
            <l>The Soul untun'd makes discord in each part.</l>
            <l>And Monarchs can no more give vocal Breath</l>
            <l>Than they can hinder when Fate summons, death:</l>
            <l>Though kind Complyance Singers ought to use,</l>
            <l>They often have just Reasons to refuse;</l>
            <l>A pleasure lov'd by one, is lik'd by more,</l>
            <l>Suppose, Sir, I have Sung too much before,</l>
            <l>Made my self hoarse, and even rack'd my Throat</l>
            <l>To please some Friend, with some fine treble Note;</l>
            <l>Chance does me then to you and others bring,</l>
            <l>The second Complement, is prithee sing;</l>
            <l>I swear Iâ€”Can't, can't say you, that's find sport;</l>
            <l>But all good Singers are so hard to Court:</l>
            <l>Come, come, you must, here's Ladies beg, not I</l>
            <l>What Soul so dull as Beauty can deny?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65399:21"/>
To make excuse then, modestly I tell</l>
            <l>How hoarse I am, with what that day befell,</l>
            <l>'Tis all in vain, you rail, I'm thought a Clown,</l>

            <l>I often have, ('tis true) to sing deny'd,</l>
            <l>But not through resty Vanity, or Pride;</l>
            <l>But that perhaps I had been tir'd before,</l>
            <l>Untun'd and ill, not able to sing more,</l>
            <l>Or that an hour of Infelicity</l>
            <l>Has rob'd my Soul of usual Harmony;</l>
            <l>Yet all's the same th' old Saw is still repeated,</l>
            <l>You Singers long to be so much intreated,</l>
            <l>Though at that time to me no Joy could fall</l>
            <l>Greater, than not to have been ask'd at all;</l>
            <l>Th' Harmonious Soul must have her Humour free,</l>
            <l>Consent of parts still makes best Harmony.</l>

BED.</head>

prepare</l>
            <l>To fright and punish the relentless Fair;</l>
            <l>Into that Bed, where by your cruel doom,</l>
            <l>No passionate Admirer e'er might come;</l>
            <l>Where Heaven on Earth no Eye but Heaven sees,</l>
            <l>And cold Virginity alone does freeze;</l>
            <l>Where Beauty blossoms, and in folded sweets,</l>
            <l>A Body whiter than the snowy Sheets:</l>

This black detested crawling thing was sent</l>
            <l>From angry <hi>Venus</hi> for your punishment;</l>
            <l>This is, she cry'd, her that prophan'd my Rites,</l>

            <l>Is now condemn'd by the avenging Fates,</l>
            <l>T' a Bed-fellow, which above all she hates.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Andromeda</hi> flourish'd in her Prime;</l>
            <l>Thus laugh'd at Love, and thus still lost her time,</l>
            <l>Whilst bounteous Pity her fair Breast did warm,</l>
            <l>The Powers above protected her from harm,</l>
            <l>But when her Rigour to contempt presum'd</l>
            <l>Her blooming Beauties to a Monster doom'd;</l>
            <l>And though the Cries of an afflicted Maid,</l>
            <l>Brought the renown'd <hi>Perseus</hi> to her aid;</l>
            <l>Had not her Will been tun'd t' another strain</l>

            <l>Love's Harmony in well tun'd Hearts appears</l>

No jarring Sounds the Consort can molest</l>
            <l>The charming Musick fills each happy Breast,</l>
            <l>Their Wills unite, and their charm'd Souls agree<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </l>
            <l>Like two soft Flutes, when sounding in one key,</l>
            <l>When honourable Love with humble Grace,</l>
            <l>And Merit pleads to fill the happy space,</l>
            <l>By your sweet side shall Spiders claim a place,</l>
            <l>Shall Rival Insects own a Love-like ours,</l>
            <l>And lay their sprawling filthy Limbs by yours:</l>
            <l>Ah, Madam, then must all Mankind proclaim</l>
            <l>'Tis punishment to you, to them a shame.</l>
            <l>No more Adorers then of Hopes bereave,</l>
            <l>But to your Bed some generous Love receive,</l>
            <l>Marriage, like <hi>Irish</hi> Wood has such a Charm,</l>
            <l>No Venom dares approach to do you harm:</l>
            <l>If you would have no hated Spiders come</l>
            <l>To Bed, let Love and Honor fill the Room.</l>

True INTRIGUE.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>DARK was the Night, and not a Star</l>
               <l>Was seen o'er all the Hemisphere,</l>
               <l>When lately musing all alone</l>
               <l>I rambled to a Country Town,</l>
               <l>To heal with Balmy Love my Breast,</l>
               <l>That had with Grief been long oppress'd;</l>
               <l>For there two Beauteous Sisters shone,</l>
               <l>As bright as the rejoycing Moon,</l>
               <l>When she with full Contentment cloy'd,</l>

                  <hi>Endimion</hi> in Eclipse enjoy'd.</l>

Young as the Spring, as sweet they smelt,</l>
               <l>And soft as down of Swans they felt;</l>
               <l>And I transported with delight,</l>
               <l>Could boast my self chief Favourite.</l>
               <l>Oh Happiness! too fierce to taste,</l>
               <l>Oh Pleasure! too refin'd to last;</l>
               <l>'Tis by the Change, we always see</l>
               <l>The Curse of our Mortallity:</l>
               <l>The one was fair as the first Maid,</l>
               <l>That once for Fruit the World betray'd,</l>
               <l>A Rosie Cheek, and such a Skin,</l>
               <l>As well might give excuse for Sin;</l>

               <l>Enclos'd in such Divinity;</l>
               <l>The other was of browner hew,</l>
               <l>Yet the more charming of the two;</l>
               <l>A shape Divine, and sparkling Eye,</l>
               <l>Her Foot, her Leg, her taper Thigh,</l>
               <l>Her Breasts, where Kings would wish to lye,</l>
               <l>Shew'd the soft path to killing Joy:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65399:30"/>
A solid Beauty, that would last,</l>
               <l>Smooth, plump, and fit to be embrac'd;</l>
               <l>Full of Delight, as Beauties Queen</l>

               <l>With lavish Bounty reach'd her Knee,</l>
               <l>Discovering Nature's Luxury.</l>

               <l>Forgive me, if for Beauties sake,</l>
               <l>I this prolix digression make;</l>
               <l>Since those that of its power have proof,</l>
               <l>Can never speak its praise enough.</l>

               <l>Cloy'd with Embraces Conjugal;</l>
               <l>Soon sent a <hi>Hermes</hi> to my Aid,</l>

               <l>And oftner op'ned Paradise,</l>

               <l>Such power has praise with profit joyn'd</l>
               <l>To charm a Mercinary Mind.</l>
               <l>Suppose me then close by the door,</l>
               <l>Through which I often went before,</l>
               <l>Giving a sign to let 'em know</l>
               <l>A faithful Lover was below;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65399:31"/>
For both were of my Heart possess'd,</l>
               <l>And had by Turns chief Interest,</l>
               <l>The Brown, when t' other was not there,</l>
               <l>And when Brown absent was, the Fair,</l>
               <l>Thus great, thus Turk-like did I rove</l>
               <l>In my Seraglio of Love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Scarce I the sign had throughly made,</l>
               <l>But word was brought they were in bed,</l>
               <l>And the old Aunt lock'd up at Prayers</l>
               <l>For blessings on her House Affairs.</l>
               <l>Then whilst I softly scal'd the Stairs,</l>
               <l>The trusty Wench with busie Broom</l>
               <l>Below, was scrubbing round the Room,</l>
               <l>Singing th' old Song of <hi>Troy</hi> betray'd,</l>
               <l>To hide the creeking noise I made,</l>
               <l>Darkness o'er all the World did sway,</l>
               <l>Yet led by Love I found the way</l>
               <l>To th' side where sweet <hi>Olinda</hi> lay:</l>
               <l>Whose charming Eyes in spite of Night,</l>
               <l>Like Diamonds shone with glittering light,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65399:31"/>
And ere she could my welcome speak</l>
               <l>Her Arms were twisted round my Neck,</l>
               <l>Whilst I a thousand Kisses stole,</l>
               <l>And every Kiss was worth a Soul,</l>
               <l>Nor did her Sister less employ</l>
               <l>Her Love, but with a grumbling Joy,</l>
               <l>Child me for my undecent Crime</l>
               <l>Of vent'ring thither at that time.</l>
               <l>I, modestly Excuses made,</l>
               <l>With all the moving Words I had,</l>
               <l>Telling her 'twas a greater Crime</l>
               <l>To let my Love be slave to time,</l>
               <l>All times for Lovers are most fit,</l>
               <l>When e'er they can admission get;</l>
               <l>And thus with some few fallacies,</l>
               <l>And tenders that I thought would please,</l>
               <l>All Scruples throughly satisfy'd,</l>
               <l>I laid me by <hi>Olinda</hi>'s side.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But first my durty Shoes from feet</l>
               <l>I pull'd, lest they should daub the Sheet,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:65399:32"/>
And that it never should be said</l>
               <l>A Man in's Breeches went to bed,</l>
               <l>I stole 'em off without offence</l>
               <l>To Dear <hi>Olinda</hi>'s Innocence:</l>
               <l>Who strugling betwixt Shame and Love</l>
               <l>To make a faint resistance strove,</l>
               <l>Then like an eager loving Fop,</l>
               <l>No Petruke on nor e'r a Cap,</l>
               <l>I clung to that soft Angels side,</l>
               <l>Close as a Bridegroom to his Bride.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Great <hi>Ovid</hi> in his mighty Verse</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Hermes,</hi> a strange Tale declares,</l>
               <l>How he to <hi>Aphrodite</hi> inclin'd,</l>
               <l>So fervently their Bodies joyn'd.</l>
               <l>Howe'r that Fancy might be false,</l>

Halls,</l>

On the late Holy Father Pope INNOCENT
the Eleventh.</head>

            <l>So strong it can disarm our prejudice:</l>
            <l>When <hi>Luther's</hi> Sons <hi>Romes</hi> prizeless loss bemoan,</l>
            <l>Less than a Miracle can there be shown;</l>
            <l>Yet see they mourn, and those our Doctrine bred,</l>
            <l>Hating the Body, yet adore the Head.</l>
            <l>This Truth, tho Ages past scarce understood,</l>
            <l>Ours boldly may affirm, <hi>one Pope was good;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Not partial, nor to private Interest sold,</l>
            <l>Nay, what's more strange than all, not fond of Gold;</l>
            <l>But durst against the stream of Avarice swim,</l>
            <l>St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys were never gilt by him,</l>
            <l>Nor did the Churches Biggots, till his sway</l>

His mellow'd Wisdom prop'd <hi>Romes</hi> tottering State,</l>

            <l>Willing the Churches variance to attone,</l>
            <l>Rail'd not at ours, nor less'ned not his own.</l>
            <l>When Heathens did in swarming Numbers list,</l>

               </gap>'s Second Recantation: A
PROLOGUE intended to be spoken
by him dress'd in a Turkish habit.</head>
            <l>MY Reconversion, Sirs, you heard of late,</l>
            <l>I told you I was turn'd, but not to what,</l>
            <l>The truth disguis'd for Cause best known to me;</l>
            <l>But now what really I am,<note n="*" place="bottom">Stroking his Mustaches.</note>â€”you see;</l>
            <l>In vain did <hi>English</hi> Education work,</l>
            <l>My Faith was sixt, I always was a <hi>Turk;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:65399:113"/>
Besides my rambling Steps ere I came home,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Constantinople</hi> reach'd as well as <hi>Rome,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And by the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who nice Virtue priz'd,</l>
            <l>For being so Circumspect, was Circumcis'd;</l>
            <l>'Tis true, I did endeavor to refuse,</l>
            <l>That dam'd old silly Custom of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Because I was asham'd of being shown,</l>
            <l>I was too plump a Babe, an Infant too well grown;</l>
            <l>But they would finish what they had begun,</l>
            <l>So between <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Iew</hi> my Jobb was done;</l>
            <l>I wish the promis'd blessing may appear,</l>
            <l>I'm sure, I bought Religion plaguy dear;</l>
            <l>For to be free, I greater Danger ran</l>
            <l>Of being an Eunuch, than a Musselman;</l>
            <l>But Constancy takes strangly in that Place,</l>
            <l>My manly Suffering won the Peoples Grace,</l>
            <l>I gain'd their Hearts, their chiefest Secrets saw,</l>
            <l>We whor'd and got Drunk contrary to Law:</l>
            <l>I had five Wives, thank the dear Prophet for it,</l>
            <l>A Black, a Blew, a Brown, a Fair, a Carrot,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:65399:114"/>
And by the way, 'tis worth your Observation</l>
            <l>To note, the sollid Wisdom of that Nation:</l>
            <l>Wives, are like Spannels there, and when ye marry</l>
            <l>You need but whistle, Wife must fetch and carry,</l>
            <l>A pretier Custom, if I understand,</l>
            <l>Than 'tis in <hi>England</hi> here where they Command;</l>
            <l>The Ladies here may without Scandal shew</l>
            <l>Face, or white Bubbies, to each Ogling <hi>Beau;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But there close veil'd, not one kind Glance can fall,</l>
            <l>She that once shews her Face, will shew ye all;</l>
            <l>Wits there are too, but Poet there's but one,</l>
            <l>A huge unweildy jarring Lute and Tunn,</l>
            <l>That spite of all my Parts the Laurel won,</l>
            <l>Not for his skill in Satyr, or in Lyricks,</l>
            <l>Or for his humble Stile in lofty Panegyricks,</l>
            <l>Or the rare Images that swell his Noddle,</l>
            <l>But sitting up and Joking o'er a Bottle.</l>
            <l>His Patron's Wit, still as his own is us'd,</l>
            <l>Yet never had a Friend, but he abus'd,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:65399:114"/>
What is his own has neither Plot nor Soul,</l>
            <l>Nor ever one good thought but what he stole;</l>
            <l>Eating, not Writing, is his proper Function,</l>
            <l>Supper's his Sacrament, his Extreme Unction;</l>
            <l>Like Whores condemn'd, that free themselves from
Chains;</l>
            <l>He pleaded for't his Belly, I my Brains,</l>
            <l>But Poet Belly routed Poet <hi>Haines:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Missing this Post, I get into the Wars,</l>
            <l>But finding quickly there's were real jars,</l>
            <l>Not liking that robust Confusion there,</l>
            <l>Sneak'd off in time, to get Commission here,</l>
            <l>Well knowing that what ever wrongs are righting.</l>
            <l>You <hi>London</hi> Blades, have wiser ways than fighting.</l>
