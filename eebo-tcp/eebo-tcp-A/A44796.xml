            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in all the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

pit, which hath been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

which have dimmed your eyes

could not behold, the pure Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial

dwels in it, whose presence
gives Life, nor any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the vail, because the vail
hath been spred over all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and it hath been so thick
that it hath been hard for any
to rent it, and the night of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy
and darknesse hath
been so long, since the woman
fled into the wildernesse, and
since the man-child which was
born, hath been caught up to
God, that few or none for this
many ages past hath come to
see the end of the night, but
hath mourned without hope,
and few or none hath seen or
hath been able to discerne the
time of the womans return
out of the wildernesse again
into which she fled, and few or
none hath seen to the end of


<pb facs="tcp:44981:3"/>
the times after which shee
should return, and mens sight
in the Apostacy hath been so
dime, and in the vexation, that
when the man-child, which
was caught up unto God,
would appear again, few hath
had faith to believe, or sight
to he hold him, or an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to deserne of the

Lord God everlasting, who
hath opened, is and opening
the windowes of heaven, and
showring down his wisdome
as a mighty rain, &amp; his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as the morning dew, and

            <p>And him that was before all
things is beholden, by whom


<pb facs="tcp:44981:4"/>
all things was made, who hath
been, as in a far country, all
this long night of darknesse,
but the time is fully expired
and now is he returning, and
his appearance is as a morning
without clouds, as clear as the
Sun, and as pure as Christal,
and now is he scattering the
clouds, fogs and mists, as with
the East wind, &amp; his pure breath
clears the air, and by his arm
which is mighty, is he renting
the vail of the covering, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

treated upon, aud opened
by the Spirit of the Lord,
who was an ey-witness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these things.</head>
            <p>1. THe work of the Lord
declared which was
in the beginning, when the word
was with God, and man in the
image of God.</p>
            <p>2. Although the heavens and the
Earth were created, and all things
therein finished; yet the world
was not begun, that lay in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which the Devil is the God
of; neither was Christ the mystery
hid, nor the Lamb slain.</p>
            <p>3. The understanding may
read the Wisdom of God in a
mystery, and also may see the


<pb facs="tcp:44981:6"/>
sottish Doctrine of the apostates.</p>
            <p>4. An objection answered.</p>
            <p>5. Another objection answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>6. How peace, joy and delight
possessed every thing that God
had made; how every thing which
he had formed glorified him with
one consent in the beginning.</p>
            <p>7. How man lost his state and
dominion and unity with God,
and all the creatures, and how
the Lamb came to be slain, and
the world that lay in wickedness
came to be framed in man after
the tempter entred; how endless
misery can in upon all, after the
transgression.</p>
            <p>8. How sin entred into the
world, and death by sin, and
how man is dead while he lives;
and all is dead works that he
acteth, and the state of all the


<pb facs="tcp:44981:6"/>
sons of men, and their works may
be seen in the fall.</p>
            <p>9. 3. Objections answered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this particular.</p>
            <p>10. Self righteousness, deeds
of darkness also, and dead works,
and are to be condemned also,
and man who acteth them in the
fall.</p>
            <p>11. An objection answered, as
to the present state of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the Nations, their practice
and their worship.</p>
            <p>12. An objection, as to the
Churches so called and their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the Nations.</p>
            <p>13. The dark and blind Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Ranters denyed.</p>
            <p>14. An objection about read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the outward practice of
the Saints in former ages.</p>
            <p>15. How all men upon the earth
in the degeneration &amp; in the fall


<pb facs="tcp:44981:7"/>
have corrupted themselves, and
have been Idolaters in every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
being gone from
the life and Power of God in
themselves, And having lost the
Power of God, man can neither
worship, honour nor obey God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
            <p>16. A few words to that which
is called Christendom, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
Christianity.</p>
            <p>17. Something about water-Baptisme,
to both Priests and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists.</p>
            <p>18. Something about <hi>Rome</hi> in
the apostacy, and all their worship
in the degeneration.</p>
            <p>19. The Protestants or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches so called, not
yet come out of the waters nor
from under the beasts Power.</p>
            <p>20. The Presbyters and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants
are yet under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
Reign, in the apostacy,


<pb facs="tcp:44981:7"/>
and have among them yet the
Attire of the Whore.</p>
            <p>21. How the woman that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
in birth, who was clothed
with the Sun, and brought forth
the man-childe, fled into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
when the Dragon had
power, and the man-child was
caught up unto God.</p>
            <p>22. How the woman comes out
again, and when, and he that
was caught up unto God, descends
again, and appears again to take
the Rule to himself, and how
he makes war with the Dragon,
and all the apostates, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
them.</p>
            <p>23. How the glory of the Lord
shall appear after the apostacy
greater then before, and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
into which them that
follow the Lamb shall be brought,
shall be more spiritual &amp; celestial
then before; for that shall appear
in which all visible types and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes


<pb facs="tcp:44981:8"/>
ends in, and shall be the
last that is to be expected by the
sons of men, the sight of which
hath appeared which yet cannot
be uttered.</p>
            <p>24 What the day of the Lord
is, and to whom it hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and how it is seen, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>25 What it is, and what it will
be to the wicked, declared.</p>
            <p>26. What it is to the righteous,
and how he appears to them, and
whether we are to look for it
while in the body, resolved.</p>
            <p>27. Where it doth appear, and
how it cometh, and how it is to
be looked for, declared.</p>
            <p>28. What the Spirit of the
Lord is, and how it comes to be
received, which discovers the
the things of God.</p>
            <p>29. How the spirit of truth
worketh, and operateth in them


<pb facs="tcp:44981:8"/>
who are convinced, and yet have
not obeyed it, shewed.</p>
            <p>30 How the spirit of the Father
worketh in them who hearken to
it, and are in some measure
made partakers of its power,
shewn.</p>
            <p>31 Vnto whom the spirit of the
Father bears witness, and seals
assurance of the Fathers love, and
of justification with God, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>32 What the grace of God is,
which is free, and to whom it hath
appeared, and where all is to wait
to receive it.</p>
            <p>33 whether all have received
the grace of God or no, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a sufficient teacher in it
self, demonstrated.</p>
            <p>34 Some objections answered.</p>
            <p>35 A word to the wise men of
this world who are glorying in the
sound of words.</p>
            <p>

Moreover, the terrestrial bodies were

this fulfilled, even then, which was

over all, yet in eternal glory: yet
let the wise in heart understand, this

are, even then the <hi>Lamb</hi> of God was

NOw this hath been a common

that while we are in this life,
there can not be an overcoming of

               <p>Now I say, had not <hi>Adam</hi> a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
body when he was in purity and

in the garden, yet was this any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to him to answer the will of
his Creator? No; For as the soul, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and body was moved by the <hi>power</hi>
out of which <hi>power</hi> he was not to stir,
then I say he had ability to perform
the will of his maker in the body, for
as he was created by the <hi>power</hi> in the
inward man, that led about the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
&amp; earthly or outward form accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its will, which will was pure,

was good, for the Celestial <hi>power</hi> in


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44981:15"/>
which he was made, moved the
whole man according to its will, and
while he stood in the <hi>power,</hi> he was in
innocency, and purity, and without

and peace, and he knew no evil.</p>
               <p>Ob. But some may say, what is this as
to the confutation of the doctrine which
hath been taught, as to the freedom from
sin in this life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This declares that there was
such a thing in being, to wit, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
body, and an earthen vessel, and
yet without sin, as he stood in the
power; for the earthen vessel was
good, as all the rest of Gods creation
was in its place to serve the <hi>power,</hi> as
the rest of Gods creatures did in the
beginning, and who ever comes to
know that state again, may come to
glorifie God in soul, body and spirit,
though in the body, in this taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
but take their own phrase for
the clearing of the thing, not to be
freed from the committing of sin in
this life, I say in the corruptable life,
or the life of unrighteousness, which
may be properly called death, there


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44981:16"/>
is no freedome from sin, neither of
soul or body or spirit, but who comes
to know regeneration or the Life of
men, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created in
the beginning, in that incorruptable
Life, there is no transgression, and if
he live in man, the body is dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of sin, and I know none who
have preached any other <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Life, who
hath spoke by the spirit of God, in
which freedome from all sin is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
but onely the life of Christ,
and whosoever comes to know the
Lord from heaven, who ruled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all in the beginning, and was
the life of all, and all moved in his
Life, before the fall, whether they
were things visible or invisible, &amp; that
same <hi>power</hi> or Life of Christ, the <hi>Lamb</hi>
of God, who was alive then, if he

by his <hi>power,</hi> as in the beginning he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in man, the soul and body and

and raised from under the bondage
of corruption, then death hath not
power over man (but life) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he lives in them, they live also,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44981:16"/>
their souls to praise him, and their
bodies and the members thereof to
be servants of righteousness, and so
that unbelieving Doctrine of the
world is turned into the pit, and
truth is set above it.</p>
               <p>Object. But further it will be objected,
that our bodies are not like Adams, in
innocency, we are in the fall, and
therefore we say they hinder from being
freed from all sin, and ever will, while up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That the naked truth may
appear to them that seek after true
knowledge, I answer freely, that I
grant that the soul lies in death, and
the creature is subject to vanity, and
the whole Creation groans in travel
and in pain, and waits for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of the Son of God, and the
Redemption of the body; and in this
state is all mankind upon the face
of the whole Earth in the first <hi>Adam,</hi>
but he who is the second <hi>Adam,</hi> the
Lord from Heaven, who was in the
beginning, and is now what he was,
and shall be for ever, I say, as man
comes to believe in the Son who hath


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44981:17"/>
life in himself, and he come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in man, and man subject to
his leading, he brings the soul out
of death, to have union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with himself, and restores
the creature from his bondage, and
and breakes the bond, and knocks
that down which hath imbondaged,
and so changes the body, I do not
mean the form of the body, but
the quality and nature thereof, for
the form of <hi>Adams</hi> body was not
changed, but the quality, and it was
degenerated from its pure nature,
wherein it glorified God, as he stood
in the <hi>Power;</hi> so I say, Christ who is
the life of men, the true light which
lighteth every man that comes into
the world, he changes all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him into his own nature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
the creature into his first estate
again into purity, that like as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man is renewed and restored
by the <hi>power,</hi> and serves the Power,
so the members of the body, is also
yeelded servants unto righteousness,
and they receive vertue and Power,
from the <hi>power</hi> the Life, and so the


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44981:17"/>
whole man comes out of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to glorifie his maker; &amp; the will of
God is don in earth, as it is in heaven,
and he saves to the utmost them that
comes unto him; now if he save the
soul and not the body, then he saves
not to the utmost; But this is a high
state, blessed are they who waites
in the faith, to the end are happy,
that they may see and know the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of their souls, and also the
redemption of their body; For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
redemption in the grave, or in
death, or after this life; for the holy
men of God never mentions a clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from sin in the grave, nor after
men be dead, for they that have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
sin in their life time, and served
the devil as long as they live, and
have yeelded their bodyes to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for uncleannesse while they live
upon earth, eternal misery will be
their portion, and not redemption;
think on this you who are holding
this forth for an article of your
Faith in the world, among poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
people, that they must not
expect redemption from all sin in


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44981:18"/>
this life, and so leads them on to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
misery, misery will be your
end, and in the day of the Lord you
shall witnesse this to be true; But to
return to the beginning again, where
there was no sorrow, but pure joy
and peace, both in heaven and earth,
but I goe hither and thither, as the
spirit leads, and shall speak as it
gives utterance, though but here a
little and there a little, yet shall it be
in truth and righteousnesse.</p>

out of the motion of the <hi>Power,</hi> he

out of the <hi>Power,</hi> and out of the

he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his

of knowledge of good and evil, for
God had forbidden it; now he went
out of the Power, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
of his own accord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

with the woman, and she was

we may not eats least we die; this
she knew, and the Serpent knew; now
the tree of knowledge was good in

not good for food, therefore God,
the truth, the life, the <hi>Power,</hi> did
forbid to taste of it, or to eat of

the motion of the light which made

lost, and so died unto the <hi>power,</hi> and
lived upon knowledge without the
<hi>power,</hi> and now became afraid of
the <hi>power,</hi> because he was in the
transgression of it; And thus the
Serpent who was most subtle, went
out of the truth, and acted in sin,
and led into transgression; and so
there became fear where was none,
and shame where there was none, and
nakedness where there was no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness

upon man, he was planted a noble

now when the Lord appeared and
examined him, and man knew his
fault that he had acted against the
<hi>power,</hi> yet that which acted in trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
would excuse, here is the
fruit of the Devils work, transgresse,
and then hide and excuse it, and so
the woman put it off to the Serpent;
he was the beginner of it, but if she
had stood in the <hi>power,</hi> he would have
had no place, nor his counsel; but
they all went out of the light and
Life, into the knowledge, without
the <hi>Power</hi> and Life, and so the curse
came upon all; Now the man cursed,
and the ground for his sake, and the
woman cursed, in sorrow to bring
forth, and the Serpent cursed, the
beginner of iniquity, cursed above all


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44981:23"/>
the beasts of the field, to go upon
his belly, and dust to be his meat for
ever, and an enmity put between the
seed of the woman and his seed for
ever, and an eternal decree passed
against him for ever; and he made
war against the seed of the woman,
which the Lord promised to bruise his
head; now came the miserable estate
in, that which led him into trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
grew, and he in it, and to be at
unity with it, then came hard ness of
heart, and then came the world to
be founded in his heart, and he grew
in the devouring beastly nature to
follow the earthly imaginations of
his heart, and became earthly, and
fed upon that which the beasts of

whether he would stand or fall.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I say, whose was the fault,
that he was not preserved, and saved
in that state, was it in God? nay, and
that he was left to himselfe, is also
as false, and unlearned; he left him
in the power, and in the dominion
everlasting, and commanded him to
stand there, and he was not to goe
out of it, but to act in the motion of
the word, and in the power by which
he was made, which was Christ, who
was glorified with the Father before
the world began; I say according to
Gods appointment and ordination,
man was not left to himselfe, but to
stand in the power and authority of
the word, wherein man had power
to fulfill the will of God, and keep
all in order according to Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
but he going out of the
power, contrary to Gods command,


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44981:27"/>
giving heed to the woman, and the
Serpent, who were gone out of the
command before; I say he of his own
accord going out, when the power
commanded him not to harken to any
such thing, but on the contrary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
him, so let in a lye, and believed
the woman, and the serpent, and so
went from his preservation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and salvation, &amp; so was catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the serpents snare, who abode
not in the truth.</p>
               <p>Ob. But then some may say he had a
voluntary will to doe as he would, and
was not that will good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The will was good in it self,
as it stood and went out in the lifes
motion, but moving or acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the motion of the life, was
not good; for that was out of Gods
order, and appointment, for nothing
in man or without man, of all that
God had made, was to stir or act
without commandments; now the
Son was not honoured by mans
faling, but both the Father and the
Son was dishonoured, and now the
Son or power was not revealed by


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44981:28"/>
the fall, but vailed as from men,
so the fogy mists of darknesse is scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and the blind doctrines of the
World layd waste.</p>
               <p>Ob. Some will be ready to say, how
dost thou say he was in dominion everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting?
then, how should he fall? that lasted
but a while.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I say he was made by the
word which abides for ever, and
in it which was in the beginning
with God, and was God; and Gods
Son, and his dominion is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
dominion, and his Throne
is established in righteousnesse for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and ever; and in it selfe it is what
it was ever, and after the fall, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the same power and authority in
it selfe, and so will do for ever;
mans power stood in it onely, out of
it he had none, so going out of it, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it, and not any more power to
do, or to will, or to order, or to rule
any thing but by it: but he lost the
feeling of it, and the guidance of it,
the vertue of it, and life of it, and
became dead to it, and alive in his
heart and mind to an other power,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44981:28"/>
to wit, the power of deceit, and to the
power of him which hath the power
of death, which is the Devil; so God
is clear, no fault in him, nor in the
power, nor weaknesse in the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and authority which he had; but
destruction meerly, wholly, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of himself, and he is to bear the
his own burthen.</p>
               <p>Thus man receiving in the Devils
conceptions, who was gone out of the
truth, and became one with it, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon knowledge without the
life (this was evil) thus sin entred,
and death by sin; man cut off from the
power, from life, from the dominion
which he had in the power; now man,
is dead while he lives, and in the day
he eat he died; dead to the power,
dead to the life, dead to good, dead
to truth, dead to purity, dead to
Righteousnesse, estranged and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from it; the grave covers him,
death hath prehemenence, and bears
rule, and not life, and he gone into
its nature, and loves it, and imbraces
it.</p>
               <p>Oh sad life! ah sad state! now


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44981:29"/>
his life cursed which is death, he

his conception cursed, all his works

and perplexity; Now all may as in

death and destruction lives, and man

               <p>Now the world set in the heart,
and the Earth in the heart, the heart

and bryers springs up and the Earth

man lives in it, and one with the

who was before his life, man now in
chains of darkness; when any thing

in the heart, Beasts, Rocks, Hills,
Mountains, dogs, swine, and brutish
creatures, and man becomes brutish

him, he a slave to all, all rules over
him, and death grew; and dead
works brought forth, he cannot now
perform any thing whereby he can
purchase the love of God, nor give
a ransom for his soul, now the root
of betterness grew, and the enmity,

is crost, or his will crost, then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

would kill that, and destroy that,

envy, murder, adultery, fornication,
uncleanness, riotousness, sporting,
covetousness, defrauding, cheating,

falsly, and left no roome for the

The Scribes and Pharisees in Christs
time, great worshippers, devout men,
devout women; zealous men for
Temple, Priests, tithes, days, Sabbaths,
oblations, and were acting all those
things that were commanded in or
about the worship of God, yet Christ
said unto his Disciplrs, except your
righteousness exceed the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Scrihes and Pharisees ye
cannot enter the Kingdom of God:
they might have said (which at least
they did in their hearts) this man says
he is the Son of God, and yet saith
and teacheth his Disciples, another
righteousness, then is commanded
in the Law, and moreover tells them,
except their righteousnes exceed ours,
they cannot enter into Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
where is there in all the earth


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44981:32"/>
any better righteousness then ours?
we do not as the heathen worship
Idol-gods, we keep the Sabbaths, and
purifie our selves and payes tithes, and
keeps the Ordinances given by the
Lord to <hi>Moses</hi> and our fathers; well
these things they were doing, but
they were but dead works, they were
out of the faith out of the Power and
had not Gods word abiding in their
hearts, from which their Power and
ability should have come to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the will of God; here was self-righteousness
although they did the
outward things which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of the Lord, yet they were
dead works; their Temple left deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
worship desolate, <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
compassed about with armies, not one
stone left upon another which was
not to be thrown down, and they
scattered among the heathen, their

these things with many more, which
I could instance, all shewing that

               <p>Ob. But some may say, what saist
thou to this generation of Ministers, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

and they teach that man is redeemed by

and the ordinances that we practice now
I hope you will not call them dead works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I say the ministry in these na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
made by mans will, and by the
will of the flesh, and that are seeking
their gaine from their quarter, and
are suing men at Law, and throwing
men in dungeons, and holes to the

and devoured like evening
Wolves, some mens estates wholly,
and some times taken ten fold the
value, who ravens from place to place
from one end of the Land to another,
and into other Nations also, for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
lucre, or a greater benefit; I say
they are in the fall, in the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
death rules in them, over them,
and they are Ministers of death, and
never brought any to God; but of
them many other brethren who are
in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ
hath borne a large testimony which
any considerate, wise, prudent, and
reasonable man may see them to be
Ministers of death, demonstrated by
many sound grounds and unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
arguments, and the scripture of
truth clearly bearing witnesse to the
same; and so I refer the Reader to
those things, and shall content my
selfe at present in what I have said
in this particular. Now as to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or ordinances or practices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
I come unto, and shall speak
no otherwise of any thing, then God
by his eternal light and spirit hath


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44981:34"/>
made me understand in the true
ground of things, else I know well
how to be silent.</p>
               <p>Now this I say to all sects, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and fellowships (though they be
devided into many heads or socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
man acting or performing any
thing of worship, ordinance, or any
practice whatsoever which the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
declares hath been or ever was,
though they should doe it in the same
manner, sutable in every circumstance
to that which others did, till all or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man come to believe in the
power again, which man went from
in the transgression, all that he doth
is selfe-righteousnesse, and dead
works, preaching dead, prayer dead,
Baptisme dead, their communion
dead, their conferences dead, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
dead, their fasts dead,
their offerings like as if one had
offered a dead beast under the law, or
a lame Lamb, which had been abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
even so I say till man
come to that which he hath lost in
the transgression, till man find the
power, the life, the light, the messiah,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44981:34"/>
and feel him in them, to work, move,
lead, guid, and act, all will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
with the Lord, selfe-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
dead works, dead fruit, and
if all would examine and try, they
might see the Nations almost spread
over with dead men in <hi>Adam,</hi> and
dead works abound, and coverings
which God will rent, and lay all
waste together, false rest, imitated
formes, and representations without
life, I say till men come into the
power againe that <hi>Adam</hi> went from,
and so died in that day, he cannot
doe any thing well pleasing to God;
and whosoever comes to that again,
passeth every step through death, and
denies himselfe and all selfe-actions,
selfe-righteousnesse, and must come
to be bare and naked again, even
as he was before he came out, he and
his wife were naked and were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed;
selfe-acting was not known;
now self-will, self-worship, self-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
nay, they moved in the power
righteousnesse was their covering, and
as I said before, there was no shame,
I might speak largely in this thing, and
truly my tongue is the pen of a ready

writer, oh that all had an eare to hear
that their souls might live, and that
every one might be unbottomed, of his
false rest, false and fained hope, and
faith; and of his own ragged garment,
and let goe his selfe-righteousnesse,
and his dead works, and come to
Christ the life of men again, that
man hath run from, that so he might
have life and peace.</p>
               <p>Ob. But some would say that thou
wouldst have all upside down, <hi>&amp;</hi> unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

and throw down all our worship, and then
what should we doe, all would be as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,

and trying is come, when nothing shall
stand but that hath the image, stamp,
and character of the living God upon
it, and all that which hath been
brought up, and raised up, since man
hath been in the transgression, must be
turned down into the pit again, and
all that have got a name of Christian,
and wants his life, to live among
them and in them, shall be scattered
as clouds with the East wind, and all


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44981:35"/>
imitated worships, and will worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and the fained faith, and the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
hope shall be confounded, and all
will worships and worshippers will
be overturned who are not come
yet to the true light that lightens every
man that comes into the World, and
till man comes to the light, and tries
his deeds and works by it, he never
sees what he is doing, nor what he is
working, nor what he works; and so
all that man doth here in the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
it is but sin, or selfe-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which is brought forth by him
who abode not in the truth, in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;
and so who be come to the
power which was in the beginning,
before sin entred, and death by sin,
hath and doth measure all deeds and
all works, &amp; man that is in the losse, in
the fall, &amp; sees that a dead man cannot
act a living work, nor bring forth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fruits unto God, nor living works
of righteousnesse, being in the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
neither the fruits of faith
being in the unbeliefe, neither the
works of the day being in the night,
neither the works of charity being in


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44981:36"/>
the emnity; in a word, without Christ
the power, the light, the life, which was
glorified with the Father before the
world began; I say (he said it himself
who is the beginning of the creation,
of God, the first born of every creature)
he said, and his testimony will be
found true, without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nothing that is wel-pleasing to
the Lord, nothing that ever shall be
acceptable; and here is the true state
of all the Earth discovered, and all
mankind drove out from God, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
naked, hopelesse, helplesse,
faithlesse, and so can doe nothing as
to the glorifying of God his maker, or
to the ordering of any thing in the
creation to his glory, having lost his
dominion and Gods wisdome, and
this being considered seriously by all,
and brought to the light in all, and
their deeds tryed by it, would make
the lofty bow, and the stout hearted
fear, and the conceited sit down in
solitarinesse, that they should so long
deceive their own souls with a conceit
of righteousnesse and redemption,
when as death yet reignes in them,
and over them, and not life eternall:


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44981:36"/>
So the Devil is a distinct being from
God, and his works are distinst, and
his deeds, from the works of God, and
neither he nor his works shall ever
be numbred among the works of God,
but he and they that obey him, and
follow him who is out of the truth,
they, their works (of what sort soever
they may seem unto men to be, whose
eyes the devil hath blinded) so I say all
is to be condemned, and shut out from
Gods presence for ever, and to be
destroyed by him who is a consuming
fire, and all the righteousnesse of man
burned, as combustable stuff in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> And by what hath been said, the
principle of that ranting crew (who
are become vaine in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and foolish, their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
being darkned) are seen, and
their principle overthrown.</p>
               <p>As that light and darknesse is one,
&amp; good &amp; evil one, and sin and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
one, and truth and a lye one,
and that God is all and doth all, and
what ever is done is of God, and that
there is no evil but to him that thinks


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44981:37"/>
it so, and it is onely a false apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things, and that there is no
such thing as sin, &amp; that sin is nothing:
Unto all these things I might speak,
but the understanding Reader may by
what is before written, see each of
these plainly declared, and the true
ground of things laid down as the
spirit gave utterance, and this shall at
present suffice in this matter.</p>
               <p>Ob. But some may object further, and
say, will not reading the scriptures and
conforming to the practise of the saints
in the use of his ordinances, will not this
make us accepted, and bring us out of the
fall, and make us good christians?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No, while death hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
in man, and over man, and
the vaile over the heart, man doth
not understand the mystery of Gods
kingdome, neither understands the
scripture which was spoken from the
spirit of truth, or any thing of truth
as it is in Christ, for none understands
the things of God, but by the spirit
of God, so that every man that comes
to have a good understanding, must
come to know the pure spirit of God


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44981:37"/>
in him to direct him, &amp; informe him;
(which spirit) was the original of
the scripture; for the holy men of God
spoke as they were moved by the
holy Ghost; and without the Holy

that which is infallible, the sayings,
the writings, the scriptures cannot be
understood, &amp; because of the want of
this, all the Earth is run into heads, &amp;
sects, &amp; opinions, &amp; large treatises and
volumes, &amp; expositions have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
&amp; yet differing one from another,
and all from the spirit, and in all
these particular sects, persecuting
one another, &amp; envying one another,
and hating one another, and would
compell others to believe what they
believe in what they say, if they had
but power; and for proof of this, it is
most evident in the scripture of truth,
and in latter ages since the Apostles, it
hath been, and it is evidently seen,
both among the Papists and Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
and among all them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the reformed Churches; but all
this is in the fall, and in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and in the Apostacy, and is


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44981:38"/>
an evident token, that they are all
under the power of the beast, who
makes War against the Lamb; so all
compellation, and they that do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
are not worshippers of the Lamb,
but of the beast which is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed

               <p>For the <hi>Jews</hi> under the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
had the Scriptures the good and
wholsome words of God, and the
Prophets and read the Law and the
Prophets, on the Sabbath dayes, and
yet the vail was over their hearts, and
and though they did perform many
things commanded, yet they being
erred from the spirit, did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
of what the Scripture spoke,
nor know him nor his mind, to wit,
Christ of whom the Scriptures spoke,
neither were they accepted of God,
but reproved and rejected by Christ
himself, who said they erred, not
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power
of God, doubtless they did know the
words naturally and read them, but
the spirits mind, in so speaking they
knew not; and <hi>Jude</hi> reproves all such,
and said what they knew, they knew


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44981:38"/>
naturally as bruit beasts, and in that
knowledg, they corrupted themselves,
and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> well said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many
things were hard to to be understood;
which the unlearned wrested (they that
were ignorant of the spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and had not learned of God, who
is a spirit) they I say perverted and
wrested the good and wholsom words
of the Scriptures, and were no more
accepted of God, then if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard the words nor read them at
all; and as for the <hi>Jewes</hi> conforming
to the outward commands, when the
vail was over their hearts, and their
hearts uncircumcised, these things did
not make them any whit more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then the heathen, so the Christians
since Christs time, in the Apostles days
and after the Apostles days, who held
the form of worship, and the form of
godliness, and the outward part of
worship, and holds and retains it in
that part which is above the seed, and
denies the power, this no more makes

any of these things do recommend any

unto God, but are covers made, &amp; rests
formed, from that part which is above

and the cursed seed sprang from
<hi>Hams</hi> stock; of whom was <hi>Nimrod</hi>
the hunter (before the Lord) the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Kingdom was <hi>Babel;</hi>
of the which became great Idolaters,
and of this seed came the Philistians
who were uncircumcised, who were
heathens, and the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasites,</hi>
and the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and <hi>Hivites;</hi>
and their generations were great in
the earth, &amp; they were great Idolaters;
and committed Idolatry with stocks
and stones, and with brick, having
forgotten the Lord, they began to
work exploits in the earth, and to
build Cities; and <hi>Babel</hi> having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the name of God, they would


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44981:40"/>
have got a name in the earth, and
builded a tower, whose top might
have reached to heaven; but the Lord
whom they had forgot scattered them,
and this was the seed of evil doers
whom God scattered and drove out
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who were great Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and gave it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who
feared the Lord, and to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to
his seed to possesse.</p>
               <p>And when transgression grew, he
added a Law (the sence of Gods
power and wisdom was so lost in
man, and they so gone from his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that a Law was added after <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
came out of Egypt) which was
outward, and written in tables of
of stone, wherein was the statutes and
the commands, that they should one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worship him, and that they should
not make them Gods of gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
neither the likeness of any thing
in heaven or earth, yet nevertheless,
that uncircumcised part which kept
the seed in bondage, and that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptable
earthly nature that ruled in
them, made gods like the heathen
<hi>Egytians,</hi> and they made a Calf, and


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44981:41"/>
bowed to the molten image, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
God, and provoked him to anger,
till many of them were consumed in
his sore displeasure, and tempted him,
and lusted, and eat and drank, and
rose up to play; and committed
whoredoms with the creatures, and
abused them; and therefore the Lord
sent his Prophets and rebuked them:
they abused the gold and the silver,
the stone and the wood, which were
good creatures, but not to make gods
of, nor images thereof, nor idols to
draw away their minds from the
Lord; but they in whom the seed was
not made manifest, they worshipped
dead things, and likenesses of things,
which were not life it self; and so
transgressed the Law, acting from that
part, and living in that nature, which
the Law was against (which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
because of transgression) to limit
the transgressor and to slay him, and
to bruise that under, till the seed came
up that fulfills the Law, but the seed
of the Serpent had so much rule in
them whom God had often delivered
out of the hands of their enemies,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44981:41"/>
so that many perished, <hi>Corah,</hi> and
many Princes, and many thousands of
<hi>Israel,</hi> who followed their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
and were cut off in Gods
sore displeasure, being gone from that
which was upright in which man was
created, &amp; followiug their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp; out of that mind formed idols
and images, and set them up, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that part in themselves which
transgressed the seed, &amp; not that which
doth overthrow all idols &amp; the ground
thereof; And after they were come
to the Land that God had promised
them, they were commanded not to
worship idols, as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did
(that were <hi>Hams</hi>-stock) who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed,
and set up cursed idols, yet,
nevertheless breaking the Law which
was to limit that part which had
transgressed; that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Law, was set up in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
even the nature of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
Gentiles</hi> and heathen, and then
they worshipped the heathens gods,
or else formed gods and idols and
images of their own, and worshipped
<hi>Baal, Ashteroth</hi> and <hi>Chemosh,</hi> and the
<hi>Sidonians</hi> gods, &amp; every Nations gods,


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44981:42"/>
and Images where they came, and so
the Lord sent his true Prophets, who
feared his name, and worshipped
him, to declare against them, even
the house of Israel a distinct people,
from the heathen, great professors,
<hi>Ezek. 14. 4. They set up idoles in
their hearts, and put a stumbling block
of iniquity before their face the Lord said
he would answer them according to the
multitude of their idoles, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone into vanity, they hearkned to
the Idols that spake vanity.</hi> Zech. 10.
2. And baked bread and rosted flesh
with wood, and of the same made a
God, and they transgressed at <hi>Dan,</hi> at
<hi>Bethel,</hi> at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> yea their Idols flood
in their hearts, and they formed such
without as was sutable to their hearts,
as you may re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

flood in the wildernesse in <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp; in
the Nations where they were scattered.</p>
               <p>Hab. 2. 18, 19. What profiteth the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

of lies, woe unto him that saith to the

into <hi>Gilgal,</hi> for Gilgall shall goe into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,

               <p>Furthermore, they corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in those things which God had
commanded, (which were commands
in their time) &amp; made Idols of those
things which were but figures or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of good things to come, which
they should have waited for, as the
Brazen serpent, temple, offering, obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Tythes, Priests, Sabbaths, new-Moons,
solemn Feasts, Circumcision,
Passeover, and all these things were
given to be observed til the seed came
(the end of all these things and of the
Law for righteousnesse) but Christ the
seed, the heire of all things, when he
came (after many Prophets had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of him from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> from
<hi>Samuel</hi> till <hi>Iohn</hi>) they exalted those
things above him, and neglected him
who had life in himself, &amp; would not
come unto him that they might have
had life, and then, their Temple,
Priests, Sacrifice, oblations became
Idols, and their practise Idolatry, and


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44981:43"/>
so are in blindnesse to this day; and
so in the daies of Christ, they held up
those things, and were counselled in
their works and observances, and days
and times, and came not to believe in
him in whom all daies ends in, and
so continued in their large observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
all along in the Apostles dayes,
and did as they had done in the days
of the Prophets, slew the Prophets that
were sent of the Lord, and set drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and such as prophecied for hire
and divined for money, and said no
evil should touch them, and they said
the Law should not depart from the
Priests mouth, nor vision cease from
their prophets, but believed their lies
and prophesied of wine and strong
drink, and cryed peace to them that
Gods controversy was against, and so
persecuted the Apostels from City to
City, and from place to place, till the
the wrath of God came upon them,
and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> compassed about with
armies, and not one stone left upon
another, and for their sakes <hi>Sion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a plowed corne field, their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
burnt, their Priests slain, their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44981:43"/>
ceased, and their oblations
at an end, and they scattered among
the heathen, and they and all their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
and their worship blasted and
cursed from God, and from being
a Nation to this day, and thus hath
the Lord brought shame and contempt
upon all through all ages, who have
worshipped the works of their own
hands, or that hath holden up any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
representation, and have set it up
and exalted it above the life, and
with it have opposed the power, the
life in which all figures, Types, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
ends in; And thus far
I have passed through generations,
and also through administrations, that
all who have a desire of the true
knowledge of God may see, that man
in the degeneration being out of the
Image of God, corrupts himselfe in all
things, and makes idols of all things,
being from the life in which man hath
power onely to fulfill the righteous
will of God.</p>
               <p>But to descend &amp; to come nearer to
our age, because all that which is called
christendome, will say this in nothing


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44981:44"/>
unto them, because they hold not up
the heathens Images nor the Jewish
Idols, nor the Jewish Types and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and therefore they are no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
when <hi>John</hi> the Prophet came
and preached repentance in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
of <hi>Judea,</hi> which was a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of the way, he baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi>
and many believed and repented, and
were baptized, and Christ also was
baptized, and so was he circumcised
and eate the passeover, and observed
what was written, because he came to
fulfill all righteousnesse, and also bad
his Disciples hear them that sat in
<hi>Moses</hi> seats for he was not yet sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
up, nor glorified; I say <hi>Iohn</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
not in his own name, but bore
witnesse unto Christ the Lamb of God
who takes away the sins of the world,
who came after him and was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before him, whom <hi>Iohn</hi> said should
baptize them with the holy Ghost
and with fire, and many of <hi>Iohns</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
followed Christ the true light,
that lighteth every one that cometh
into the world, and <hi>Iohn</hi> was not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at them for following of Christ


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44981:44"/>
but rejoyced; take notice of this, you
baptizers who are offended with them
that followes Christ the light that
lighteth every one that cometh into
the world, and excommunicates them
like the envyous Jewes, out of your
assemblies, and saith they are deluded,
and are so far from <hi>Iohns</hi> spirit, that
instead of bearing your testimony to
him, who is the (light) that you
would bind them up, and council your
disciples not to goe after him, the true
light that lighteth every man (the
Christ of God) I say to you, you are
in the Idolatry, who prefer your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before the (light) but <hi>Iohn</hi> bore
witnesse to Christ the light, and said
he was preferred before him, and
some Imitaters and Idolaters say
the baptisme of water is the door or
entrance into the Church of God,
when as Christ saith he is the door,
none comes into the fold but by him,
and none comes to the Father but by
him, and he is the way, so who sets
up an other entrance unto God, or
into the foule or into the Church,
which is the pillar and ground of


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44981:45"/>
truth, sets up an Idol, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
an Idol, above the life, and so
are in the Idolatry; But let none
mistake, that I say water is an Idol
nay, it is a good creature of God, or
that I say <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme with water
was an idol, nay he was in the power
and spirit of <hi>Eliah,</hi> and his baptisme
a figure of a good thing which was to
come, which afterward was received
by the diseiples, and Christs words
made good unto them; <hi>Iohn</hi> indeed
baptized you with water unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but ye shall be baptized with the
Holy Ghost, and with fire, not many
daies hence, that was Christs baptisme.
I am not Ignorant of the many and
great contests in this age, that have
been about these things, and I know
many scriptures that speaks of baptism
all which I have searched narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the measure of Gods spirit
given unto me, into the true ground
of things, &amp; the true state of each admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
and in this thing I am sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
fully, that the baptisme with
water was <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, and not
Christs, and the baptisme of the spirit


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44981:45"/>
is Christs, and not <hi>Iohns;</hi> I have no
desire to wrangle or Jangle about
words, or contest about shadowes, but
that all may come to know him in
whom all ministrations ends in, and
there will be peace and satisfaction
(to wit, in Christ)</p>
               <p>But to say some thing to the main
bassis, and foundation, which Priests,
and Separatists builds much of their
arguments upon, the last of <hi>Mat.</hi>
and the last, Goe teach and baptize
all Nations in the Name of the Father,
Son, and holy Ghost; as for all the
Priests about their baptising of Infants,
here is no ground at all, for here is
first teach and then baptize, and here's
no infants neither, and so I know,
what consequences hath been drawn
from this by the unlearned in their
imaginations, but them that hath the
least measure of true light, will not
take a consequence to build a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on, for this is contrary to their
own rule, they say the scripture is the
Rule, then their consequence is not
the Rule, and if the scriptures be the
Rule, let all people of your parishes


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44981:46"/>
know if you can by the Scripture shew
when <hi>John</hi> or any Disciple of his or
Christs, baptized infants and taught
them Principles of Religion <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. years
after, but they are willingly ignorant
that sees not you to be idolaters; and
as to the Baptists separates, who
builds upon this for their water ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme,
they are as groundles as the
Priests, and all their Arguments are
as invalled as the rest; for here is
baptizing the Nations in the Name of
the Father in the name of the Son, and
of the holy Ghost, and any who are
judicious or wise, and are in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Gods pure wisdom, will not
say that the Name of the Father is
water, or the Son or holy Ghost is
water; the name of God is <hi>I am,</hi> and
a strong tower, and the Name of the
Son is <hi>the word,</hi> and the word is the
power, but this is not water; but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they say the Disciples had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the holy Ghost, and did baptize
with water after, and they were
Baptized with water after they had
received the holy Ghost, &amp; they bring
divers Scriptures to prove this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:44981:46"/>
I shall not deny but <hi>Peter</hi> Baptized
with water, and <hi>Paul</hi> two or three
families, and thanks God he baptized
no more, and said he had declared the
whole counsel of God, and he makes
not mention in all his Epistles that
baptisme was any part of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
neither in all his counsel to the
Churches any where doth he exhort
either <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> or <hi>Apollo</hi> or
any of the brethren to Baptize with
water; but as for <hi>Peters</hi> Baptizing with
water, I know no more command he
had then <hi>Paul;</hi> as for the commission,
which <hi>Matthew</hi> writes of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and
19. and that <hi>Mark</hi> mentions, 16. 15.
there is no water, and so its the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme
of <hi>John,</hi> I grant, and Christ
bearing witness to <hi>John</hi> that he was
a Prophet and did baptize many, and
therefore he or they in honour to
<hi>Johns</hi> Ministry might baptize some, as
well as <hi>Paul</hi> did circumcise <hi>Titus,</hi> and
and then in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. said it was
nothing, and again in another place,
neither circumcision nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
did avail, but a new creature,
and because it was a figure which


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44981:47"/>
people did not Idolize so much then,
as they did circumcision, for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the people, for a time; and
the wise in heart may understand that
when any representation or figure out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
was set up, it was not easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
again, nor an easie thing to be
laid down, when the thing, signified
was come; for many of the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in Christ, and were said to be
brethren, and yet they came from
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and troubled the Church
of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and would have brought
them under the figure circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
again, and the Apostle, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.
asks them, now when ye know God,
why turn ye again to the beggarly
Elements, [Circumcision] observing
dayes, moneths, times and years; I
would ask the moderate a question,
whether water be not an Element, and
pertains only to the Elementary part
in man, which is to passe away and
be dissolved when the seed is raised
up whose nature is not elementary, but
Celestial? I shall say no more to
them at this present who are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who are so zealous for their


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44981:47"/>
water upon so weak a ground, but
take heed that while you are striving
about your outward water, you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
not the washing of regeneration
and the cleansing of the spirit; many
have been baptized, but which of you
hath received the holy Ghost? there
is not one among you dare own or
witness an infallible spirit, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
counts it an error that any should
speak, or witness, or look to enjoy any
such thing in these dayes; well, I
say unto you your day is a day of
darkness and gloominess you live in,
and thick darkness covers your
tabernacle; for who ever have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the holy Ghost or spirit of
truth in any measure, are led by
that which is infallible and not falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and if you look not for this,
you are no sons notwithstanding all
your washing the outside; for as many
as are the Sons of God are led by the
Spirit of God, and this is witnessed
praises to the Lord for ever; the Lord
is unto his people an everlasting
light, and this is the sum that water is
owned to be a figure of the one ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44981:48"/>
and was an Element, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to that which is Elementary;
but the Elements shall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
heat and be dissolved in the day
of the Lord, and then the seed comes
up which is heir of the promise,
which is nourished with the water of
life, which is not an Element nor
Elementary, but is Celestial, and
springs up in them that believe unto
everlasting life, and comes to be
born of the water and the spirit, and
enters into Gods Kingdom, dominion,
power, life, wisdom, excellency and
Eternal glory, happy is he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
and abides in patience unto the
end.</p>
               <p>Now since the dayes of <hi>John,</hi> the
Kingdom of God hath been Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as many as were ordained
to Eternal life believed, and many in
the day when Christ was manifest in
the flesh believed, unto whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the mind of the Father, and by
him was the Father glorified, he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the Law, and did many works
and miracles by the power of the
Father, and herein was the Father


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44981:48"/>
glorified, and them that did believe
in him, their faith was strengthened;
and he opened the mystries of the
Kingdom of God unto his Disciples,
and bore witness and prophesied the
destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and of all
their worship, and said, no more at
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> nor at <hi>Samaria,</hi> but the
time was coming when they that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
the Father should worship
him in spirit and truth, and declared
against the Pharisees righteousness,
and said to his Disciples, Except their
righteousness did exceed the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
they could not enter the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and yet the Pharisees
performed all the outward things
commanded, but were in the idolatry,
and did not believe in the life; Now
he declared of his suffering many
things, &amp; also how he would go away,
and how he would come again, and
would not leave them comfortless, but
these things were hard to be believed
then, by his Disciples, and further he
told them he must be betrayed, and
suffer and rise again, and when the
hour was come that he was betrayed,


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44981:49"/>
when he was with his Disciples, even
the same night he was betrayed, he
took bread, and broke it, and blessed
it, and said, take and eat, this is my
body which is broken for you, this
do in remembrance of me; and after
he took the cup, and after he had
Supped, saying, this is the cup of the
New Testament in my blood, as often
as you drink it; do it in remembrance
of me, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. 24. and <hi>Matthew,
Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> declares the same,
and this was reall bread, and reall
wine, which was a representation
of that which was to be enjoyed in
the spirit, and never intended for
any further thing, but as a figure or a
representation of the bread of life,
and of the cup of blessing which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they came to be witnesses of,
and as oft as they eat and drank, they
did shew forth the Lords death till he
came. Now this was practiced among
the Disciples after he was risen
from the dead and did converse with
them at many times, and exhorted
them and comforted them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
them, and told them that


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44981:49"/>
they should be witnesses of his name
unto the ends of the earth; and gave
them commandment to teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Baptize them in the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the holy Ghost, and did promise to be
with them to the end of the world, and
told how the Comforter would
come, and that the Father would send
him in his Name; even the spirit of
truth which was with them, and
should be in them to be their teacher,
leader and guide, and bring all
things to their remembrance. Now
that which he gave them as a figure,
and to be a sign unto them, of the
clearer manifestation of himself,
which afterward came to be fulfilled,
and they witnesses of it, who grew
up in the pure invisible being, and
did see the mystery, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the spirit, which did
more clearly show unto them the
mysteries within the vail; for as I
said of water, it was a sign of a good
thing to come, so the bread and the
cup was also a sign of a good thing
to come, as all outward figures were,


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44981:50"/>
but they that did believe, and grew up
in the faith, in the seed, Christ, they
came to see the substance, in whom all
figures ends in, and had communion
with him, within the vail <hi>after he was
ascended, where he was before; now the
Apostle he spoke as to wise men, judge ye
what I say,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 15, 16. <hi>the cup of
blessing, which we blesse, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the blood of Christ? the bread
which we break is it not the communion of
the body of Christ and</hi> v. 17. <hi>for we being
many are one bread, &amp; one body, for we are
all partakers of that one bread; mark all
they that did believe, though they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yet they were one bread &amp; one body, and
were all partakers of that one bread, which
bread was the flesh of Christ,</hi> John 6. 48. <hi>I
am the bread of life, and</hi> Joh. 6. 51. <hi>I am
the living bread that came down from
heaven; if any man eat of this bread he
shall live for ever, and the bread that
I will give is my flesh, which I will give
for the life of the world:</hi> Now I speak
unto wise men, and let the wisdom
of God (in them manifest) judge what
I say, for where the body of Christ is
witnessed, and the flesh of Christ
known, they know that which all


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44981:50"/>
the figures ends in, the Manna that
God gave to <hi>Israel</hi> in the wilderness,
they died that did eat thereof, which
was as pure a type of the hidden
Manna, as lively a type as bread out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
which was but a type of the
of the flesh of Christ, and both they
that did eats the Manna, and they that
eat the bread outward and drank the
cup outward are both dead, but he
that eat the flesh of Christ and drinks
the blood lives for ever; and he that
eats the hidden Manna hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
death and lives for ever, and
feeds upon the bread of life, feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Eternal life.</p>
               <p>Now this is a mystery to the Papists,
who are idolaters, who have sprung
vp in the Apostacy, though they have
Scriptures as it was to the <hi>Jewes,
John</hi> 6. 52. who strove among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and said, how can this man give
us his flesh <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o eat? and so the Papists,
who strives about the flesh of Christ
and his blood, and yet have the
Scriptures, and they say its in the
bread and in the wine, after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
&amp; so they worship the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44981:51"/>
of their own hearts, not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Lords body, and have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thousands, and taken away the
lives of thousands, because they would
not confesse their idol to be of God.</p>
               <p>And the protestants they are setting
up the bread and the wine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
themselves therewith, and are
making an idol of it, and comes not
to discerne the body of Christ, but one
saying he hath a carnall body, and
another a fleshly body, another a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
body, another sayes his body
is devided from his members, and so
speaks out of thick darknesse, their
own imaginations, and hath not
communion with the body of Christ,
neither knowes the flesh of Christ,
which is the bread of life, which is
given for the life of the World, <hi>Iohn</hi>
6. 51.</p>
               <p>And as godlinesse began to work,
and the mystery thereof in the dayes
of Christand the Apostles, wherein the
Lord discovered much of his wisdom
and power, &amp; manifested his pure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
&amp; poured out his spirit plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon, sons and daughters, &amp; fulfilled


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44981:51"/>
that which <hi>Joel</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>prophesied of, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.
28. which came to be fulfilled after
Christs ascention, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 17. and
they received the holy Ghost, &amp; spoke
the wonderfull things of God as they
were revealed by the spirit, which
shed it selfe abroad among them
that waited for it, so also the mystery
of iniquity began to work even in that
time, and as the Apostles laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of truth, and declared the truth,
Christ to be the foundation, even so
the Mystery of iniquity did work, and
a beginning or a foundation of error
was laid by them, who were gone out
of the truth, the false Prophets, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Anti-christs who were professors
and preachers, but they were such as
were covetous and greedy of filthy
lucre, and made merchandize of souls
for dishonest gaine, and denyed the
power of God, Christ, and were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Crosse, and gloried in the
flesh, and spake swelling words of
vanity, and did all live in the lust
of the flesh, and were proud boasters,
and denyed the Lord that bought
them; for denying the power of God,


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44981:52"/>
they did deny Christ, though in words
they preached him, as this generation
who are their off-springs doe out of
strife &amp; contention, as the Apostle writs,
&amp; they held the form of godlinesse but
denyed the power, and they were they
that once were convinced of the truth,
and came into the forme of truth, but
denyed the power of truth; but were
in craft and deceit, and they subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
whole houses from the faith, and
led them back into the world, into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe,
in the Apostles dayes, and yet
had a worship, and did worship, but
not the power, not the life, and this
began to worke, and wrought more
cunningly, and subtilly in the latter
times: And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in many
of his Epistles, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi>
declares against them, and <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
of them before his departure,
of grievous Wolves, which should
spring up, which should not spare to
make havock of the flock of Christ; so
the fall Apostles, deceivers, Antichrists,
and deceitful workers, they went out
then and did what they could to lead
disciples after them into the world;


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44981:52"/>
inwardly they were ravened from the
spirit, and was gone from it into the
earth, into the world, and served not
the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own
bellies, and the God of the world
which is the Devil, and they went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, and the world received
them; and then they and their disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
turned against the saints, and they
held truth in words, and the form for
a while, but it was in unrighteousness;
and here was the beginners, and the
beginning of the Apostats, and of the
Apostacy; it was began in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
dayes by them that went out of
the truth, out of the light, and were
ravened from the spirit, and erred
from the faith, and were enemies to
the power of God, and these were the
beginners and the layers of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and then it grew, that root of
wickedness faster then the truth; for the
Jewes resisted, and the heathen resisted
and the Apostates and false prophets
resisted, and they that were Apostatized
they resisted, and they caused many to
stumble, to erre, to make ship-wrack
of their faith, and so the world went
after them, the World, the Nations,


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44981:53"/>
the kindreds, the tongues, &amp; the people
went after Kings, Princes and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of the earth, &amp; in processe of time
they had over run-all &amp; killed the saints,
the woman fled into the wildernesse,
&amp; the man child was caught up unto
God; then all Nations who were gone
from the Rock became as a sea, reeled
to &amp; fro, unstable, unsetled; what were
they like to settle in the Sea? then a great
beast arose with his seven heads and
ten hornes, and the whore which had
defiled the bed, and she sat upon the
beast, and she reached out her cup of
fornication to the nations, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
was drunk with her cup, and
then the beast made war, and the
nations were drunk, and they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the beast and received his marke,
became cruel, and pushed at the saints
(and followed him) and made war
with them, and the whore, she drank
the blood of the saints, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
appeared, and with his tayle drew
the third part of the stars after him to
the Earth; the false Prophets they are
the tayle of the Dragon who were


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44981:53"/>
gone from the testimony of Jesus, the
spirit of prophecy, and drew after it
the third part of the stars from the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of his power into the earth,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 4. The man child was caught
up unto God, which was to rule all
Nations with a rod of Iron, and the
woman fled into the wildernesse,
where God hath prepared a place for
her, and then the Dragon went out
and made war with the remnant of her
seed, to wit, the womans seed.</p>
               <p>And so out of the Sea arose the
beast, out of Nations, kindreds,
Tongues, and peoples, which are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the Dragon gave power to
the beast, and his seat, and great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2. And all the world
wondred after the beast, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and <hi>ver</hi>
4. They worshipped the Dragon
which gave power to the beast, and
the beast likewise; and now the worl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

who is able to make war with the

in blasphemy against God, to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme

made war with the saints, and did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
them, and all that dwelt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>And the beast<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> deceived the Nations
and them that did dwell on the earth,
and now kindreds, Tongues, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and Nations, and all the world
which wondred after him, they who
had lost the image of God, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the image of the beast, that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
God and his Tabernacle, and
them that dwell in heaven, and now
the Kings of the earth that had drunk
the Whores cup of fornication, and
the Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues,
and people, who were become the
beasts image, now the image of the
beast spoke, and caused as many as
would not worship the beast and the
image, should be killed; take notice
of that, all who are called Christians,
it was not Gods image, who compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to worship or else be killed, but
it was the beasts image, and whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
compultion and killing is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44981:54"/>
and practised, they worship the
beast.</p>
               <p>Chap. 13. ver. 16. <hi>And he causeth
all both small and great, rich and poor,
bond and free to receive a marke in their
forehead, or in their right hand, and
none might buy or sell, but he which had
the beasts marke or his name, or the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his name;</hi> here was worship, but
it was the beasts worship, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
worship, and the Dragons wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
who sought to destroy the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child,
which all the Angels is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
all this worship is in the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>So let all take notice of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling,
causing, forcing, killing, and
destroying about worship, all they
that so do yet are worshipping the
beast on which the Whore rides, and
this is that generation who slew the
Lamb, and they are of the World, and
this is the Dragons brood, who sought
to devour the man-child, and this is
the Serpents seed, and a seed of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
who made war with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the seed of the woman through
all ages unto this generation, and so all


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44981:55"/>
that which is called Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
is more or lesse under the
beasts power, and hath his Image, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to this day; and yet some of them
are professing the saints words, and
imitating their actions, who were
followers of the Lamb, and kept the
faith; now this that <hi>Iohn</hi> saw as come
in, did grow deceivers, anti-christs,
false prophets, who were before &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
Churches at <hi>Galatia Corinth,</hi> and
made havock, brought in deceit and
infected many, as <hi>Coloss. Pergamus, Rev.
3. Sardis &amp; Laodicea;</hi> but now all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were erred and gone from their
maker, their husband, and did drink
of the cup of the whore, and were
adulterated from the life, faith, and
power, and now worshipped the beast,
and the whole world went after him,
there was some of his adultery, whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and fornication in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
dayes, and some had drunken
then, but now Nations, kindreds,
Tongues, and people drunk the cup of
fornication, and now <hi>Jesabel</hi> who
slew the prophets, and drunk the
blood of the saints, she reaches out


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44981:55"/>
her cup; Kings, merchants, Noble men,
great men, Nations, kinreds, Tongues,
and people were made drunk, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
sought to be devoured, flouds cast
out after the woman, the saints blood
drunk, the world worships the Dragon,
and the beast and his great authority,
and wonders after him; now <hi>Jesabel</hi>
the whore, who made the nations
drunk, she prophesies, all the Nations
made drunk with her cup of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and drinks in all her false doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,
and devised fables, now she
is as a Queen, now the Nations wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships;
after a beast arises, she gets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him and rides, she and the beast
becomes one, she drinks the blood of
the saints, the beast makes war, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells,
kills, being of one mind with the
whore; none to buy or sell but they that
have his mark of his name, or at least
some of the number of his name;
and who were not defiled, were killed
(or sought to be killed) this is since the
apostles days; so now we have found the
whore, her beginning in the Apostacy,
having lost the faith and power that
the Saints were in, we have found out


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44981:56"/>
the rise of the beast in the Apostacy,
since the Apostles, that all the World
wondred after and worshipped.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Rome</hi> we have found thy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and the beginning of thy rise,
and sees how thou art elevated, we
have thee and all that sprang out of
thy stock and root, betwixt this time
and the Apostles, and we read beyond
thee, though thou boast thy selfe of
antiquity, and glory in thy counsels,
and convocations, for thy proof we
have sounded thy bottome, I have thee
and all the Apostates sprang from thee
betwixt me and the Apostles, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-christs
false-Prophets, deceivers,
false Apostles, they began, they laid
thy foundation, who went out from
the Apostles, and denyed the crosse
of Christ and the power of God, and
the Apostle prophesied of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
here thy visible members began
to gather, and they went out into the
World, and the World received them,
according to Christs saying, out of
the light, out of the power, out of the
faith, out of the life that the holy
men of God were in, being ravened


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44981:56"/>
from the spirit, whored from the
life, they went out in an outward
dresse, had a shew, a form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Nations received the cup,
the Kings of the earth, the Nobles and
the mighty men, thou boasts of, they
drank of thy cup and were inflamed
with adultery after thee; and then the
Nations over which the whoredoms
spread, kindreds, Dominions, tongues
Nations peoples and become fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
all became as a sea, rolling, tossing,
foming, raging, casting up mire and
dirt, unstable reeling; then the Kings,
the great men, thy Nobles who were
Rulers over the people, being drunk
with the Nations cup of fornication,
they sprang up as a great Beast with
so many heads and horns, and their
teeth became as Lyons, their feet as
Bears, and then thou began to ride in
the Nations, and to sit as a Queen, then
thou associated thy drunken forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators
together then thou began to
usurp authority and then sit as Judge
over the heritage of God and of the
Saints, of the Apostles, and of them
that kept the testimony of <hi>Jesus</hi>


                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:44981:57"/>
then thou began to kill and destroy
and suck the blood of the Saints, and
to be drunk with it; and then thy
Kings whom thou calls converts and
Christians having drunken thy cup,
they formed Lawes and made Lawes
to guard thy whoredoms and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Idolatries, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
thy executioners, and what thou
said was good, the Beast maintained,
and what thou condemnedst by thy
Counsels for heresie, they became
executioners of; then came in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
to worship by the Beast that
rose out of the Sea, and then thou
cryed Hereticks and condemned the
just, and then thou got a cover, thou
wouldst not kil, but the beast must upon
whom thou rides; then if there was any
that kept their virginity and the faith
of our Lord Jesus Christ which was
in the Apostles dayes, then thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnedst
them for Hereticks; then the
Beast compelled, and caused to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but if they would not bow to his
image, then thy Merchants cries up,
they despise Governors and Rulers,
when both thy Doctrine and thy Laws


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44981:57"/>
is corrupt, then the Beast must kill,
then he blaphemes the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and his Tabernacle; and then
thou saith thou killest none, but the
beast must (upon which thou rides) and
shall have a whole Counsel to confirm
it to be lawful; And now thou cals thy
self the Catholike and Apostolical
Church, and thy seat the Apostolical
Chair, and the Rulers and leaders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of the faith. Nay, we finde
thee contrary to the primitive Church,
and thy seat and Chair is raised up
since, and thy bed of whoredoms
made since, and the Kings and Rulers
in thy Dominions are become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of thy idolatries and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and are indeed the beast that
makes War with the Saints, and hath
prevailed, and truth overcome; but he
is risen who is able to make war with
the Beast, and to take the whore, and
to burn her flesh with fire, for he is
able to judge her; and thy Beasts wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
and thine are carnal, but the
Lambs and the Saints are spiritual,
and so thy Doctrine and practice is
quite another thing, patched <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

as thy Altars, thy vestments (that thy
idolatrous Merchants wear when they
celebrate thy great idol the Mass)

all your works you call meritorious

by the Lamb (who is risen,) to be self-righteousness;

her and you, that are in the apostacy;
and waite to know the word which
was in the beginning, and the Gospel
which was Preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which endures for ever, whose joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sound is come forth in power and
great glory, which will shake the
foundation of your great City, even
mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not leave one
stone upon another which shall not be
thrown down; and then the holy men
of God shall rejoyce, and the Saints
of the most high shall sing, they that
have been as sheep for the slaughter
shall reign over the earth, and
shall say, The Lord God omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Reigns, and let us rejoyce and
be glad, and he hath taken to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
great power, and is coming to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Lambs out of your mouths,


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44981:61"/>
and to feed in a pasture you never saw,
which was manifest to the Saints in
light, before you apostates sprang, and
shall be again, when you and all your
dark muddy traditions, and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are gone down into the pit, where
there is no remembrance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be the pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church of Scotland, as it hath
been called, and the old Episcopal and
Prelatical Priests of England, who hath
borrowed their images to set up here will
be ready to say we have denyed, the whore
and the beast, and the apostacy, and we
have pure reformation, we have denyed
Bishops which was made by the apostate the
Pope, and now we have settled all things
according to the Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There never did spring up
any deceit since the Apostles or before,
but it called it self, by the best name;
as for the Priests of <hi>Scotland,</hi> their
doctrine and practice is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
and their Reformation by their
principles which I refer the Reader to,
intituled the principles of the Priests
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> their Reformation, and
discipline is nearly related to the


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44981:61"/>
Spanish Inqnisition; for their Doctrine,
they say grace is not free, and faith
is not without sin, and the Letter is
the word of God, and that they are
cursed that say there is a light within
which will lead up to God; and as one
said, although it meant Christ; and
if any will not submit to their words,
and conform to their practice and
traditions, then they call a counsel
together, as their forefathers at <hi>Trent,</hi>
and pronounces him a heretick, and
within this few years banished them,
or else took their whole substance
outward from them; and if any out
of conscience could not submit unto
their invented tradition, then if he
ever came to have any converse with
them again, be must have a penance
before he could get an indulgence
from them, like the Pope; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
if any deny them because
they are out of the doctrine of Christ,
and are contrary to the Scripture, then,
as I said, they excommunicate them,
and charges all people neither to buy
nor sell, nor eat nor drink with them,
nor work for them; and so the beasts


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44981:62"/>
power is exercised, compelling to come
to their Mass-houses; and as for the
denying the Bishops, then you have
denyed your fathers that begat you,
and ordained you, then, you have no
Ordination; but may be you have cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

so for setling your Gospel, you have
got a Commitee to ordain you, or one
company to lay hands on another, but
when receive ye the holy Ghost? Oh
that is an error in your Church,
but are you not got into the old
Cathedrals (so called) and into the
Steeple-houses, and the old Masse-houses,
and where you had, may be
20 pounds or fourty in the year, now
you have gotten a hundred, it may be
two; heres reformation indeed; well,
we must needs remember you of your
race and stock, the apostates since
the Apostle dayes, and the former
practices which is found among the
old Protestants and Papists is among
you, and you are still drunk with the
whores cup, and are crying for <hi>Cains</hi>
weapons to guard you; well, I say you
art part of the dragons tail, that draws
to the earth, and to the pit, which will


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44981:62"/>
be the end of all idolaters and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
except they come to repent.</p>
               <p>And as for the Independants
Churches, so called, you are a branch
of the same root, you have declared
against the Bishops and court Prelates,
and said they were in error, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you declared against them for
pluralists, because they had too great
benefits, and declared against Tythes,
as to be Antichristian, and whoso re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Tithes, denyed Christ come in
the flesh, who are wheeled about, and
now takes them your selves, and creeps
into the old Mass-houses, and hath
taken that up which you condemned
in others, and so have made your
former testimony void, and all sober
people sees your hypocrisie and deceit,
who have gathered a company toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which you call select people, or
members of your Church, and you
exclude the rest who have as good
right to your Ordinance as you, for
they professe Christ in words as you
do; And yet you will receive their
means, whom you judge not capable
of your Ordinance; and your Church


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44981:63"/>
will no more maintain you, then it
would maintain them that you have
denied in words, if you had not the
beasts power to compel, your vineyard
would starve you, your Gospel and
your Preaching is one with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and the people is the same in
nature they were before; you have got
Bishops Lands, agmentations and Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
more large then your forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had, for the most part, and sue
men at the Law, and hales them before
Judgement seats and takes away their
goods whom you look upon to be in
error; yet this stands as good with
you as any Article of your faith, to
force to compell, to sue, to hale into
prison, to take away their goods, and
get a Scripture for your cover, and say
he that Preacheth the Gospel must live
of the Gospel, and them that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hear you, nor receives you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believes your Gospel; yet you
conclude, its lawful to take their
goods and if you cannot get them,
hale the party into prison; are not you
drinking still the whores cup? and do
not you follow the Beast? and do not
you own that Law to be just that


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44981:63"/>
compels people to pay mony to you
who denyes your Ministry, and are
none of your sheep? and are not your
Ordinances and worship imitated
things from the Scripture, the Saints
words, and yet out of their life and
practice, are not you in the Apostacy?
have you not your profession and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of faith, to make year after
year as the Magistrate changes? doth
not this evidence, that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
and are yet in the waters upon
which the whore sits, and scituated
in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Mother of Harlots,
who yet makes you drunk, and that
makes all the filth and vomit appear
in the earth that stains the earth, and
your idols corrupts the earth; and all
seperates under what name soever,
who have not denyed the ground of
apostacy, but are in the apostacy, for all
sects since the apostles days have taken
up some part and left another, since
the life hath been lost, and the power
lost all hath been in idolatry, and the
Protestants who have denied the
Papists, yet they have not denyed
them in the ground of their worship,


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44981:64"/>
but hath retained some, part and hath
kept some part of their worship; and
all Sects sprung out of the Protestants,
in them all there is some part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
for they have not denyed
the ground of the worship set up in the
apostacy the whores cup i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and the Dragon hath power which
sought to destroy the man-childe, and
made war with the remnant of the
seed of the woman who was clothed
with the Sun; you all stick yet in
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and the best of you all, are but
yet in the suburbs thereof.</p>
               <p>For since the Apostles dayes their
foundation hath been either traditions,
Imitations, inventions of their own,
or borrowed things from the Jewes
in the first covenant, or at the best,
the letter hath been the ground of
their faith and their foundation,
which they have twined and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this way and that, according to
the wit, and reason of every particular
sect and opinion, and according to
the understanding of their private spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
now all these buildings, and
towers that men have builded up in


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44981:64"/>
the Apostacy, they would fasten upon
the writings of the holy men of God,
and so hath raised an imagination of
their own, and so would have the
scripture prove what they say; and
the writings of the Apostles, they all cal
the Gospel; &amp; the word of faith, &amp; the
light of the Gospel, &amp; the foundation
&amp; the tryer of spirits, &amp; the touchstone
and say its the foundation of their
faith and Religion; and so are all in
the distraction one envying another,
and persecuting one another about the
words of truth, spoken from the spirit
of truth, which cannot be understood
again but by the same spirit; and
so all them that have not the spirit
of truth, are in the Apostacy, And all
Sects Judgements and opinions that
hath risen up since the Apostacy, from
the faith that was once delivered to
the saints, when the woman trave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and brought the man-child, which
after, because of the Dragons power,
fled into the wildernesse, and her
child caught up unto God, all the faith
and worship, that since is sprung up
since the Whore hath sitten as a Queen
in majesty, is all denyed, the ground


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44981:65"/>
of their worship, Lawes, Traditions,
Inventions, and all their invented
practises, and formes and Images, and
likenesses are denyed, and disowned,
as to be the dresse and attire of the
Whore which hath allured people
through her inticing pretences and
shewes of holinesse, when indeed all
is but spiritual adultery, and this must
be all turned under again, the Whores
flesh burned, and her attire plucked off,
and her nakednesse appear, and her
shame to them that have committed
fornication with her, and they shall
be ashamed of themselves, and of her,
and abhor themselves, and abhor her,
and destroyed shall she be; and the
Lambs wife shall be beautified, and
come out of the secret places into open

into the beautifull place that the Lord

neither can it be believed by the most,
though it were declared; but yet a little

an eare will be opened in many who

in this I shall be silent, and treasure up
that which the spirit hath revealed,
till the time be fully accomplished
which God hath determined, and
then his glory shall be revealed, and
all the former things which have lived
since the man of sin hath been exalted,
shall all dye, &amp; an utter consumption

him the false prophet that wrought

were slain (that took part with the beast
by him that sate upon the horse and his
Army; whose sword proceeded out of his

their flesh) <hi>the Whore is burnt before,
the beast, the false prophet and his

               <p>And now the Angel descends having
the key of the bottomless pit from
whence the old Dragon, the Serpent,
the red Dragon, the Devil came; there
is his beginning, there was he brought
forth, and there he grew up, he that
reads let him understand, out of the

never deceived till he appeared, and
he appeared as I have said before, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the heaven and the earth was
made, and all things therein (I say
after) he was not before, he deceived
<hi>Eve</hi> in the garden, now he is grown

is King of Kings; and now is God
fulfilling that which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw in the

the work is begun, he hath appeared,
out of whose mouth proceeds the two

               <p>The manifestation of Gods glory shall be
as great after the Apostacy, as ever it was
in any age, before the rise of antichrist,
and the ministrations (into which them
that follow the Lamb shall be brought)
shall be as spiritual, holy, Celestial, and
divine as ever was before; For the end
of all our outward visible appearances

again to them that dwell on the

<hi>Abraham</hi> before either old or new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
was written; the latter, all
sects since the apostacy call the gospel,
and so greatly manifest their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
for that were to make two Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44981:71"/>
to call the scriptures the Gospel,
or that which is written, and they
who so erre in their judgements, are yet
among the smoke of the pit, &amp; are yet
under antichrists reigne, &amp; are ignorant
of him who is the saving health of the
Nations; And the living, infalible,
true, lasting, and everlasting spirit of
the Father shall be poured out again,
and many now witnesse it, and a
numberlesse number shall witnesse it,
and the time hastens; And the Lamb
shall stand upon mount Sion, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who are redeemed from the earth
and from among men which shall be
the first fruits unto God, and to the
Lamb, and they shall sit with him, and
shall reigne with him, and have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over sin, temptation, and the Devil,
Hell and the Lake, and this is to come
to passe, and is coming to passe, and
hastens greatly; and the voice out of
heaven shall be heard as the voice of
many waters, and the voice of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
harping with their harps, and the
new song shall be sung, the pure song
of the Lamb shal be sung by all who are
redeemed from the earth in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
kindred, Tongue and people,


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44981:72"/>
who have heard, believed and received
the joyful sound of the everlasting
Gospel again, and now they shall fear
God, and glorifie him, and honour
him, even they who have feared the
Beast, and glorified him in the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
they shall deny his power, and own
the Lambs power, and worship him
that sits upon the throne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
who lives for ever and ever, and
is eternal Life it selfe; the worship
shall be now in spirit and truth, where
the Dragon cannot come, neither the
beast, Harlot, false prophet, nor anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
nor none of his followers can
come, and here in the ministration
shal be more glorious, after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
then it was before; the worship
stood before in many outward visible
things, and representations, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
performances, and ordinances, &amp;
I manifestly say, the dragon, beast,
whore, and false prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
took up these things, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and kindreds, and Tongues, and
people who drunk of the whores cup,
&amp; all that were gone from their maker
their husband, they have been and are


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44981:72"/>
acting and performing, imitating like
<hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres;</hi> but since the daies
of the Apostles, they corrupted these
things, and hath made Idols of them,
and painted themselves with them,
and have got the sheeps cloathing;
therefore now will the Lord appear
and manifest his power, life and glory
in away more invisible and pure, than
before, and more divine, celestial and
glorious, where never an hypocrite shal
tread in the path; &amp; so the restoration
is a mystery that shall be after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,
the glory is not to appear in
externall things, for there the mother
of harlots hath hid her selfe long,
which hath made all Nations drunk;
but the cloathing of the Lambs wife
and of the bride shall be another
thing then the attire of the harlot,
for the spouse of the Lamb shall be
arrayed, in the same attire, that the
Lamb is cloathed withall, and with
the same vestment, and the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of God is to be with men, and he
shall dwell in them, even the Lord that
spirit, and shall walke in them, and
they shall be his people, and God


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44981:73"/>
himselfe shall be with them and in
them, and sorrow shall be done away,
and teares wiped away, and that done
away which was the cause of sorrow;
<hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 3. and 4. and there shall be
no more death, nor crying, nor any
more pain, for the former things are
passed away, to wit, death which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in by sin, it shall be destroyed, and
the earth out of which the second beast
arose, and the sea out of which the first
beast did arise &amp; upon which the whore
sate, and Hell, and the lake which was
prepared, and raised up, when man
was degenerated from the Lord, they
shall be destroyed, and he also which
hath the power of death which is the
Devil, he shall be destroyed and his
works, (the cause of scorne) and then
they shall see the Lord face to face,
even them that have but seen him
darkly, as in a glasse, or as in a cloud,
they shall see his pure living counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which giveth life, and death,
and Hell shall be cast into the Lake of
fire, and whosoever is not found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Lambs book of life must
be cast into the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:44981:73"/>
Then the new heaven and earth
shall be seen, and the heavenly City,
which shall come down from God
out of heaven; which no mortal eye
shall behold, neither shalbe able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
which hath twelve foundations,
and twelve gates, and the glory of
God shall be upon her, and her light
shall be as a stone most precious, and
as clear as cristall, yea all things
visible are too short and not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to it; for in it their need neither
Sun nor Moon to shine in it, for the
glory of the Lord shall lighten it, and
the Lamb is the light thereof, and all
who shall be partakers of this glorious
Ministration, shall walk in the light of
the Lamb; there shall be no night, nor
the least appearance of a cloud or
darkness, but transparent brightness,
and glory which shall be permanent,
durable and everlasting; for the Lord
God and the Lamb is the Temple of
the City, in which the Saints shall
worship him that sits upon the throne
for evermore, and shall give unto him
glory, and honour, and dominion, and
eternal praise for evermore, who alone
is worthy, who lives for ever in eternal

glory, and everlasting light and

               <p>And his face shall be seen in whom
all figures representations, &amp; shadows
ends in, and the pure river of water
of life which is as clear as Christal,
which proceeds out of the Throne
of God and of the Lamb; and all who
have kept the word of his patience
shall drink thereof, and be nourished
up in immortality and life everlasting
for ever. And the tree of life that
stands in the Paradice of God, them
that have overcome shall eat thereof
and live for ever; and the Nations,
Kindreds, Tongues, people and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
who have heard, believed and

who is their Lord and King, who lives

his name shall be in their foreheads,
and the Lord God shall give them

And know further, even in the
wicked, God hath a witnesse, which is
pure, which checketh often, though
they heed it not, because the God of

yet when Christ the life shall appear,
he wil make that see in the wicked

And many have been eye-witnesses of

Therefore said the Apostle. <hi>We

Now the day of the Lord cometh not
where the carnal mind may imagine,
nor when; Man will neither (according
to the carnal desire of the carnal heart,
neither according to the evil eye that
looks out) can see it; but it is seen
in Gods own light, and by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

day of the Lord is a mystery, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

all things, <hi>even the hidden things of
God,</hi> and the secret works of darknesse,
and reproveth for all evil, all iniquity;
that is the pure act of the spirit, which
convinceth every man, and as the

and shines forth more clearly, and

maketh it self known in its power and

it checks and reproveth, judgeth and

and bringeth all things to Light,

maketh manifest the intents of the

Now as there is a waiting
upon the pure appearance of it, and
the minde be still quiet, and calm, the
creature comes to feel and sensibly
to know his own condition, and sees
his minde is alive to other things and
other lovers, and not to God, and so
he sees himselfe dead to the things of

in the fall, and in the transgression;
now this which shewes the vain moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the dark power, and brings that

as it is believed in and waited upon,
and judges and condemns for all evils
for it is the discoverer of the mind of
the Lord to the sons of men; or the
Father by it makes known his mind to,
and in the creature, and doth discover
the things that be eternal in their true
property and nature (which onely
they that have the spirit, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

is invisible, and the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs

never received the things of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

not to the corrupt man, neither to the
sensual heart, neither to the vile affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

neither to the corruptible birth,
neither unto that which is born of the

yet notwithstanding, though it join
not to these, yet it is near man, even
the natural man; its manifestation or
the shining forth of its brightnesse
maketh all these things manifest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned to be evil; and thus
far the spirit of God hath appeared
to the world and all mankind, to
convince the world of sin, yet still it
remaines in its own purity; and while
the heart of any man is taken up with
that, and joined unto that which the
light reproves, (that is to say) the

not received the spirit, neither is made
possessor of it, nor injoyes it, but it
stands off man, and from man at a
distance, shewing the worker of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and the works of darknesse, and
manifesting to the creature in its light,
and letting him see to whom he is
joyned; for so far as a man denies
himselfe in acting or joyning to that

which the manifestation of Gods spirit
(shining forth in its own purity) in
him reproveth; so he comes nearer, and
comes to join in some measure to the

to receive it, and to feel the power of
God in some small measure, though
but weakly working in him, to the
purging out those things which the
spirit lets him see is evil, which hath
been reproved in him, and so in some
measure feels in himself what to wait

bring assurance of salvation unto
them; it assures their condemnation,
and also reveals sorrow. Now as
every one is turned to the measure of
Gods holy spirit, and keeps his mind
into it, he comes to feel and to see its
reproof, and so as the mind is kept
still into it, it arises in its purity, and
shines forth in the heart in more

man for it; so the strokes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
is still heavy upon his back,
being still in the disobedience of the
spirit; it never bears witness unto any
man in that state, but God through
it still sounds the alarum of War, and
terror in his heart; so that fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
him about on every side, and
though for moment, the cry may not
be heard, and through disobedience it
may seem as dead as unto him, yet if
ever the mind be but still, and a man
sober and calm, and ever mind what


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44981:89"/>
he is doing, it appears again; and
though a man may take up something,
and perform something which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
religious, and pray in words,

may live in disobedience, &amp; be at ease

no peace within, but the measure of

they do arise, and it purely draweth
the mind after it, and secretly worketh
&amp; breatheth forth its pure life in him
that waiteth in patience and in stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
not heeding the vayn thoughts
and imaginations that riseth in his
heart; but rather heeds the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the spirit, at whose bright ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
all the vain desires comes
to be extinguished &amp; there comes to be
a hunger begot within, to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of its purity and of its nature;
For God through the operation of the


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44981:92"/>
eternal Spirit lets forth his power,
which turneth and changeth the heart,
and cuts a sunder and divides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a man and those lovers that he
hath joyned unto, and makes a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
within, and carries a man further
from those things which the measure
of the spirit reproves, and this leads
nearer to God: And so they that do
believe in the measure of Gods spirit,
comes to feel what repentance from
dead works is, and the works and the
worker is seen; and who it is that
hath wrought, is manifest in the Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and as there is a diligent waiting upon
it; there is nothing that passeth
through the mind, but it discerns, and
gives a discerning to every particular
heart, who singly and quietly waytes
upon it. But yet after the spirit of
truth in some measure be felt, and its
living testymony in some thing; yet
it may be a long time before there be
a clear distingushment in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
so that one cannot clearly
discerne its moving from all other
false motions and high Imaginations


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44981:92"/>
which are above: And hence it is,
that the hasty and froward mindes
followes their own motions which
leads them into deceit, and then the
Questioner gets up, and then they
question all that ever the spirit hath
made manifest unto them before; a vail
then is drawn over, and the enemy
lodges in the vail, and in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
(which is entred) &amp; then as soon
as any hearkens within to that which
is the uppermost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doth abound, the
enemy that lodgeth in that, presents
motions as to obey this and that, and
all is deceit. So therefore all is to
keep back, that they may sensibly feel
between the pure motions, and the
drawing of the spirit, and the vaine
thoughts that arise out of the earthly
heart; and when any thing doth arise
which the Light doth not bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to, it's not to be followed nor
heeded, but a quiet, still waiting that
things may be cleared to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
and for want of this many
have run out, and have brought forth
Satans work, and acted things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44981:93"/>
in their wils, and so have clean
lost the true sense of that, which would
guide their minds, and have followed
the spirit of error, and have caused
the pure spirit of the Lord to be evil
spoken of; But as there is a keeping
back, and a quiet waiting out of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or running and haste; it arises
purely and stilly in the heart, and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
forth in brightnesse in the heart,
so that it giveth perfect evidence and
full Testimony of it selfe, that there
will be no doubting nor questioning of
its motion; for it will apparently shew
forth it selfe in its own transparent
brightnesse, with full assurance of its
own will, and then after it be clearly
seen, and its motion, then keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all reasoning, and keep out all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning,
and give not way to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that which moves of the
Lord of life, will carry thee through
in its own operation and power to
accomplish the will of God, and so
thou wilt have peace (being obedient)
and thy strength will be renewed; for
as any are brought to submit unto the
will of God, when it is known, and


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44981:93"/>
comes to obey by vertue of its own
power; that which is contrary unto
Gods spirit in thee, comes to loose its
strength, and to decay, and be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but as any disobeyes the pure
motions of Gods holy Spirit after it be
known, the enemy is strengthened, and
that which is of the flesh nourished, and
the spirit comes to be quenched, that
which would give thee power, if thou
submitedst unto it: But yet know this,
the spirit in it self never loses its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
neither can be quenched in its selfe,
but will bear its pure witnesse against
thee, and none shall be able to stop its
reproof; Thus the diversity of its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
comes to be known as its
hearkned unto, obeyed, loved, and
believed in; it puts forth its pure pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and gives strength, and seals peace
to the obedient; but disobeyed and
resisted, it condemns, judges, reproves
and seales condemnation to the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
and yet there is no variation
in it selfe, for it is alwayes one and the
same.</p>
               <p>But as it operateth upon different
natures or objects unto which it joyns


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44981:94"/>
to, or stands at adistance from, that
is to say, the good ground it causeth to
bring forth fruit unto God, and the
cursed ground, out of which bryers &amp;
Thornes do arise, it kindles a fire in,
that shall not quenched; but as there
is a submission unto its pure operation,
it burnes up and destroyes that which
hinders the growth of the seed, &amp; it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the heart (of them that have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in it) from all filthinesse both of
flesh and spirit, and worketh up the
creature into its own frame and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and fashions, and makes, and
moulds all that are in the Faith into
the Image of the Father; and so the
Fathers love comes to be shed abroad
in the heart: and as the wrath was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
through the spirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
so now the peace of God
comes to be enjoyed, and his conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
shed abroad largly, in which
there is pure rejoicing for ever.</p>

the creature now is joyned to it, and

and an assenting to the instigation of
the Devil, although when a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ariseth either within or without,
there may be a resisting and a striving
against it for a little; but the heart
not being kept close to the spirit, the
enemy often enters, and so captivates

agreement and a joyning to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
and so the spirit pronounceth
the sentence of condemnation upon
him who is joyned to the harlot, and
becomes one flesh, and joyned unto
strange flesh which is not the flesh of

joyned and consented to drink of the

before there can be the remission of
the transgression, or the Creature justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the fight of God: For sin is
not blotted out of the book of Gods
remembrance till it be turned from,
and repented of, neither doth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
stand clear in the sight of God,
when God judges in righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which the light in every ones
conscience shall answer, <hi>Now he that
is born of God sins not, for the seed of
God remains in him,</hi> which is life: And
as the creature joyns to that seed
which is heir of the Kingdom, and of
the Crown immortal, he comes to be
made partaker of its vertue and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
which seed is Christ, and by
his power by which he limiteth the
seed of the Serpent, and weakens his
strength in the creature, as man
cometh to believe in his strength unto
whom all power is committed, the
covenant with Death is broken, and
that agreement that the creature hath
made with death comes to be disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled
by the arm and power of the

Lord, and so the creature comes to
be delivered from the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and the new man comes to
live, or the new creature which is born
of God, which sins not, comes to be
framed and fashioned in the image of
the Father: and the Fathers love is
manifest unto him and in him, and he
hath the assurance in himself. The Babe
that is born from above, of the Spirit
which is from above, of which he is
born and brought forth of the just, by
the just he is justified, by the just God,
and the just witness of the spirit seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this in him: And he hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of his justification; <hi>For there is
three that bear record in the earth, the
water, the blood, and the spirit;</hi> and he
that is born of that which is pure in

three in himself, for they agree in
one: That which one beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witness
to, and for, the other doth
the same, and the record, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and witness of all these three
hath he that is born from above.
Moreover, <hi>there are three that bear record
in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the

is born of the Father, and begotten of
the Father in Christ the seed through
the Spirit, he and he alone comes to
feel the Fathers love made manifest in
him, and is justified in the sight of the
Father, and hath the record of all
these witnesses before mentioned in
himself; so that he hath his assurance
and evidence near him and in him,
the seal of the Father, the seal of the
Spirit: And so when the adversary
comes to tempt and to assault, and
would raise up doubts in the mind,
the evidence is near, which puts him
out of all doubt that he is in the love
of God, &amp; blessed for ever; and happy
are all they who have waited for these
things, have felt these things, and are
witnesses of these things; for flesh and
blood hath not revealed these things.
Now let every man who reads, this
prove himself, and try himself whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be in the faith or no, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

or no, that he is born of it, and knows

the same is he that sanctifies, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies,
and saveth them that believe,
and its the same vertue and power
that upholds the naturall man in his
pure nature, that upholds the spiritual
man, and by which he liveth unto
God: It's the same grace, I do not
say the same measure; for the same


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44981:105"/>
vertue and power by which all things
that are visible and living were made
alive, and subsists in their station and
covenant, and bound where they are
set and placed; the same grace, strength
power, and sufficiency upholdeth the
heavenly bodies, and moveth and
acteth in a higher sphear or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and preserveth all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and are quickned by him who is
the power of God in heavenly places,
and the same power and vertue that
discovereth the dark places, and the
hellish places, and the horrible pit;
it's the same power, life, strength and
vertue that leadeth all that believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Land of the living, into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place, into the peaceable habitation
into the holy mountain, into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Tabernacle made without hands:
And in few words, he that discovers
open sins, the same grace and the same
purity, discovereth hidden and secret
sins, (though the measure of its purity
shine in one more then another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
them that are in the unbeliefe,
the darknesse over-shadowes, and the
mountains are high, and the vail is


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44981:105"/>
thick, and the clouds are many, and
the ayre dark, so that it's resplendency
and brightnesse is not seen because of
the vail which shadowes it, that it hath
not much enterance) but in them that
believe, and have received that grace,
and is joyned to it, in which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
it renteth the vail, and maketh
the shaddow to flie away, and scatters
the clouds, and breatheth forth it self
in purity, and makes the air clearer,
so that its brightness shineth more
purely forth to them, and in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the heart is more open to receive
its vertues in, yet the same purity and
vertue remains still, and the same
grace keeps its purity and property
in it self, and its power and sufficiency
is alwayes the same, though it do not
appear so to the creature: So this I
say, and is my testimony of the grace
of God which is the gift of God,
which hath appeared in some measure
more or less unto all men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
and shewes gross and open
evils, even the same grace by its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and power, leadeth from the least
or impurest thought, and shews the


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44981:106"/>
secretest evils that lodgeth in the heart,
unbelief, and also every temptation
unto sin; and this shall be witnessed
to be the truth by the whole earth in
the day of the Lords appearing, and is
now witnessed by all the children of
Light who believe, with whom I have
fellowship in the pure living suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
perfect grace of God, which
is Gods free gift, which in some
measure hath appeared to all, whereby
all are left without excuse: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is the wonderful love of God made
manifest to all man-kinde; and all
that turneth to his grace, will see he
hath long waited to be gracious in his
grace, which is near, that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
might be partakers of his bounty,
love, mercy, favour, and free gift, by
which justification cometh upon all
that believe.</p>
               <p>Therefore my bowels and heart is
more open in this unto all, because
many have erred for lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and have wandred aside, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have not found a true guide.
Therefore in dear love unto all upon
the face of the Earth, where this may


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44981:106"/>
come, I write and let out my bosome
into this thing, that they may also be
partakers with me of the free love of
God, and the free grace of God, by
which I am saved, and know the <hi>wall
which is salvation, and the gates which
are praise,</hi> which the Saints are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
about with, and entered in at;
and for the sake of such who thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God, and the knowledge him, I
write for their information, and not
to satisfie critical men, nor them who
are in the Philosophy and vain deceit,
who are swollen big in their fleshly
understandings, &amp; puffeth up in their
earthly minds; for by such I desire
not any testimony, neither acceptance.</p>
               <p>But now to come to speak of that
which many are doubting about, that
is to say, the grace of God which
bringeth salvation, which hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to all men, whether this be a
sufficient Leader and Teacher of it self
if it be received; but in order to the
thing in hand, let all take notice of
this, that when I speak of the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of grace, and that it is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Teacher: I do not speak of it


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44981:107"/>
distinct from Christ, or of a thing
separated from the power of God, but
one with it, and him from whence
it comes; for as he is salvation it self,
so the grace of God is of the same
nature, by which he manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
and his salvation to them that
believe, and also reveals his witness
in them; for where the appearance
and presence of Christ is manifest,
there is his power and strength mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
either to condemnation or sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and though his pure appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and presence is one in it self, yet
them that have marred his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and pierced him; his presence
alwayes hath been, and will be very
dreadful and terrible; but unto them
that believe, and have continued with
him in his temptation, and have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
with him, and have longed for
him; his appearance and presence
will be amiable, beautiful, and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
sweet, pleasant, delightful, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable,
glorious, and admirable; so
that they who have seen it, have been
melted into tears, and dissolved as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
water, because of his love and


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44981:107"/>
beauty, who is the chief of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
Oh! that all that long after him
may wait for him in patience, in that
wherein he will appear, they shall see
him, whose sight will be a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for all longing and thirsting,
and desiring, and waiting; the sense of
longing and thirsting will be taken
away, when he that makes glad the
heart appeareth, who lifteth up the
light of his countenance, and maketh
whole them whose hearts have
been broken for him whom their
souls loved; therefore all wait, and
think not the time long: Keep in your
minds to his grace, which is his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and him you will feel, and
see, and be satisfied, and say, <hi>This is he
we have waited for, let us rejoyce and be
exceeding glad; for now he is come, and his
reward is with him,</hi> to give every one
that wait upon him in purity full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
and satisfaction, where peace
comes to be felt, <hi>and joy unspeable which
is full of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though God, out of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
love unto the sons of men, hath
followed man, and hath called him to


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44981:108"/>
return, yet that nature which is above
in man, which hath transgressed the
life, doth alwayes resist the drawing
of the Lord, and is not subject to the
Law of God, neither to the <hi>grace of
God which teacheth to deny all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and worldly lusts;</hi> that hath beset
and compassed the creature about as a
thick cloud, &amp; always maketh War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the soul; that till there be a list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
unto that which sheweth ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
(w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>h hath power in it self) none
hath power neither dominion over
that in themselves, which leads into
the transgression: Therefore, though
God who is salvation it self, hath let
out himself so far, and hath appeared
in his pure and perfect grace unto all
men, yet all have not received grace;
For, though the Lord proffer his gift
intentionally, that the creature might
receive it, and so have benefit, and
partake of its living vertue and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet while that hath preheminence
in man, which is contrary to grace, that
will never receive it, because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the life of the corruptible, and
takes its life away; and mortifies and


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44981:108"/>
slayes the enmity; therefore all must
be still and quiet, and wait in that
which is pure of the Lord, that they
may feel that raised up (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
grace) above the corruptible
thoughts and desires of the carnal
mind; but many who talk of free
grace, have put no difference betwixt
the precious and the vile, but hath put
them upon doing and working, who
are in the enmity, and curse, and in
death, and so hath brought forth dead
works; notwithstanding all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
they being dead to the life
of God, another acteth in them, even
he which hath the power of Death,
which is the Devil, and so have not
known that which was precious
in themselves, could not Minister unto
that which was precious in others;
but have been Ministers of Death, and
have ministred to death, and so Death
nourisheth it self in all them who are
not yet come to the separation, to see
betwixt the precious and the vile.</p>
               <p>Now though all have not received
grace so as to save them from the
committing of sin, the fault is not in


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44981:109"/>
God; <hi>Israel would have none of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
they stopped their ears:</hi> Neither is the
fault in the grace which hath <hi>appeared
unto all men;</hi> Neither is it because of it's
imbiscility &amp; weaknes: but because it is
not hearkned unto, and waited in, and
obeyed, believed in &amp; received: for this
eternal truth which shal for ever stand,
the least measure of the grace of God
hath power in it self to save man from
committing of that evil or sin which it
shews man: And as it is received, the
power comes more and more to be
made manifest, where all that believes
comes to be preserved out of evil.</p>
               <p>Object. But some have said, and now
say, there is common grace, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
grace, and restraining grace, and
saving grace; and the former, that hath
appeared to all, but the latter hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to the Saints, and to the elect onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Grace is Gods pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
gift, and is but one thing; I speak
not of quantity, but of quality; not
of so much as that the fulness of
grace hath appeared to all; but of a
measure of that fulness which is in
Christ the head, although I do not


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44981:109"/>
divide the least measure from the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in quality or nature, for it's one
and the same; for that which shews a
man he should not lie, nor swear, that
is as pure according to it's latitude
and proportion, as that which shews
a man all that ever he hath done;
and that same grace which leads a
man from drunkenness and excess, is
as pure, and of the same kind and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as that greater proportion which
leadeth a man from all sin; I speak
what I have seen from the Father,
though the dark world cannot receive
it: But people have been blinded and
darkned with sounds and distinctions
which men coyn and frame in their
natural reason, and by their natural
parts, which is out of the life, although
I do not condemn natural parts, which
are purely natural, if they keep their
bounds and compass, that is to say, to
the management of natural things of
the visible creation; but the things of
Gods kingdom are of another quality
and nature, and cannot be reached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by the natural; but as I said, men
through distinctions and names hath


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44981:110"/>
wracked peoples minds, &amp; confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their understandings, and have
led them into a thick wood, or a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness;
so they know not where to
get forth, neither what the thing is, of
which one speaks, because not being
spoken <hi>through the enticing words of
mans wisdom,</hi> which darkens the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of God. Now that which shews
a man evil after it be committed, is
the pure appearance of God: And that
which shews a man the temptations
when they arise, that is the same;
now this they call common and that
which preventeth a man, and keeps
him back, that he lend not his heart,
nor puts forth his hand to commit
evil, but restrains a man from it, is
not that saving out of evil, which
stops the adversary in his way
that he enter not; but preserveth the
creature out of defilement, and saves
him from it, is not this saving? is not
this the same thing that the Apostle,
who was well acquainted with the
grace of God, and of it's operation,
wrote of to <hi>Titus? That grace of God
which brought salvation,</hi> which had


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44981:110"/>
appeared, and doth now appear to all
men, which taught self-denyal, them
to deny wordly lusts, and also to live
godlily, or like unto God in this
present world, and now doth the same;
is not this sufficient to believe in, and
sufficient to save? Now I doe not say
but there is a greater measure let out
unto them that are converted unto
God, then is to them that are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of their evil by the same grace,
yet still it is one and the self-same
thing; one gift, yet a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of one and the same pure vertue
and power which is given to them that
obeys the life, which is already made
manifest by its appearance unto all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But some will be ready to say that
this is error, and that which is contrary
to scripture, and to Orthodox teachers;
that the grace which is saving, is near all
men, and hath appeared to all men.</p>
               <p>To that I answer; Though grace
be saving in it selfe, even the grace
that hath appeared to all men, and
may truly be called saving grace; yet
to them that believe not in it, neither
are taught by it, it convinceth and


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44981:111"/>
shews evil, and checks and judges for
it; yet there is no variation nor change
in the gift of God, but as it worketh
upon different objects; for faith and
unbelief are two different things, as
light and darkness are different, and
so the word of his grace is the <hi>savour
of life unto life,</hi> (that is to say) unto
them that believe, and is the <hi>savour of
death unto death,</hi> unto them who are
in the unbelief, who indeed are dead
while they live; yet there is the same
grace, and the same word of grace,
yet here is different operations; so <hi>the
Lord killeth and maketh alive,</hi> yet the
same Lord; The spirit convinceth of
sin, and reproveth for sin, and also
consolates and comforts; Here is <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of operations, yet the same spirit,</hi>
which never alters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But further, some may say, If
that it be saving grace, or at the least a
degree, and a measure of saving grace
that hath appeared to all men, then how
is it that all are not saved by it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Because I would all stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
blocks were removed away, that
the path might be made plain, that all


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44981:111"/>
might come to believe in that which is
Gods gift, in which there is power and
sufficiency; Therefore I am constrained
by the grace of God to declare of it,
and to bear witness to it thus largely,
which I know will be to the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all that hunger after righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
All are not saved by it, because
they believe not in it, neither are
taught by it, yet its validity, power
and vertue is nevertheless in it self,
and though them that are careless, and
heedless, say we feel no power nor
sufficiency in it to save us from sin,
yet this makes not void their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
who have received it, &amp; knows
its power which hath given them
power, and also sufficiency to do the
will of God; what though unbelievers
who are in the alienation, say there is
no beauty in Christ, neither form nor
comliness; this makes not his glory
void, <hi>who is the express Image of the
Father, full of grace and truth;</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
saw it, and bore record of him,
who were in the faith, and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
said he had a Devil, who were
in the unbelief; but in brief, this is


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44981:112"/>
my testimony, that the grace of God,
the perfect gift of God, which shewes
ungodlinesse, and leads from ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse
all that are taught by it, is a
sufficient teacher of it selfe, I mean, as
the power of Christ through it is
made manifest unto all them that
hearken to it; <hi>Paul <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

thrice, and this answer was given unto
him, <hi>my grace is sufficient for thee;</hi> so
this is evident to all understandings,
who are opened by the Lord, that
which shewed him the temptations,
and Satans messengers, and Satans buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings,
was sufficient to preserve him;
and so is it for all who singly are
kept to it and in it, sufficient to shew
ungodlinesse because of its purity, and
to lead from worldly lusts by its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and to teach the will of God, and
to live like unto God in this present
world; and this testimony I beare of


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44981:112"/>
it, and to it, even what I have felt,
and tasted, and handled of its suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
and vertue, and power of its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
for the confirmation of the

brethren, and also for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of them that thirst after
the Lord, &amp; for the opposition of all the
gainsayers and opposers of it; which
testimony I commend to that of God
in every man, which will witnesse me

of that in your selves, which should
give you the knowledge of the living
God, and make you sensible of his
pure presence; I say, if he appear not
in the way you would limit him to,
in those things you would confine
him in, you cannot receive him; the
Lord open your understandings, that
you may see your selves, and how
frothy, vain, light, and wanton you
are; one with the world in all things
in the very ground, pretending liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Christ, and priviledge in him,
when you may see you are servants
to corruptions, and to many noisome
lusts that makes war. Again, what are
all outward appearances any more
but as a Curtain, or as a vail, and as
a shadow, in respect of Christ, Gods
righteousness within; but you are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
too full of your apprehensions of
his righteousness at a distance, that
you have forgotten all at home, and
your own conditions; for his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
will not be a cloak for your
self-righteousness and unrighteousnes,


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44981:115"/>
and if Christ be not formed in you,
Gods righteousness, and live in you,
and act in you, and work his work
in you, you are in the self-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a talk of imputation, will
not save you while you are not
in that capacity, and nature, and
faith, unto whom his righteousness
is imputed. Are you not weary with
tumbling up and down among the
earthly Hills, among which you
have situated your selves? Do you
not see your land grows barren, and
your possessions dry, and your worship
dead, heaven rains not on you, the
bottles are stopped, the dew falls not
on you; you wither dayly as a stick
without sap? what, have you found
that which will last unto perpetuity?
oh! nay its rusted already, it's canc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered
already, its moth-eaten already,
it's fading, the glory is staining, the
renown of all earthly things is fading,
and all terrestrial appearances, though
never so glorious, they are all to
cease; a consumption is coming,
blasting is near, there will be no more
glory in these things, they will flie


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44981:116"/>
away as a shadow when the Sun arises;
your riches are wasting, when will
ye seek after that which endures for
ever? I pity you who have had breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
after God, and hath sate down at
ease in that which is not eternal. Be
warned, return home, consider, see
what corruption thou hast power over
now, which had once power over
thee. Dost thou rest in that faith, that
thou shalt never be cleansed here?
that faith is curst, it's reprobate, its
rather properly unbelief; It's not the
faith of Gods elect, by which they
were sanctified, and overcame the
wicked one in themselves by the
power of Christ, who is able to save,
and manifests his ability in all them
that believe in the light which they
are enlightned withall, through which
he manifests himself to the creature,
and makes known his power in the
creature, to redeem the soul out of
death, and to redeem the creature
from under the bondage of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to serve him in the free spirit of
God, in which the sons are made free
from sin, from the act and guilt, they


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44981:116"/>
become the Temples of the holy
Ghost: How far you are from this,
consider, who are yet temples
of uncleanness, and a habitation
for many noisome lusts; repent and
minde that which empties you of your
thoughts and conceitedness, that you
may know poverty of spirit, that the
kingdom may come unto you, and be
yours in possession, else you are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
miserable; &amp; this is the true
state of many of you, own it &amp; repent,
that if it be possible you may finde a
door of mercy yet opened unto you &amp;
that you may enter in thereat; for it is
not setting up, and conforming to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
practice without, that will justifie
you, while that which is in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and hath transgressed the life,
and hath disobeyed the light in your
consciences is head in you, and above
the pure, that will not recommend
you unto God; neither can you have
any access, or acceptation with God
in that state, till you come out of the
waters upon which the Whore sits,
which is unstable and boisterous, and
reels too and fro, and unsetled; which


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44981:117"/>
is all to be dried up, and all the
springs cut off that nourishes; and you
must come to the Rock, before you
know any thing that will endure, to
build upon, which rock is Christ, who
abides for ever; but you are all gone
from that which should give the
knowledge of him in your selves, and
doth not retain him in your knowledg;
neither that which gives the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him, the light of his Spirit
which shines in your hearts, making
manifest in your hearts, the intention
of your hearts, when motions unto
evil do arise; This must you all come
to, before Gods salvation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
you come to know in your
selves, or have the witness of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, without which there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seal nor evidence, nor assurance
enjoyed or felt of the love of God.
The time of restoring is come, and
many are restored again into Gods
Covenant, and are delivered out of
the jaws of death, and feels him who
is the healer of the Nations, and the
restorer of the desolate places to dwell
in: but first you must come to see


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44981:117"/>
those places made desolate, wherein
the wilde nature lodges, before you
come to have a share in the restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Come off these barren moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
where you are feeding, to Christ
the life of men, who hath lightned you,
and wait in it, that you may feel his
mind in your selves, and the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit of truth, from your
own spirits, or else you will still erre
for lack of knowledge, and perish for
want of understanding, and so lay
down your heads in sorrow.</p>

is light, his dwelling place is so, a

Christ when he taught them that
followed him, exhorted them, that first
of all they might seek the kingdome
of God, even while they were in the
body, <hi>Mat. 6. &amp;</hi> 36. The Pharisees
were gazing abroad in their earthly
knowledge, although they had the
Scripture that declared of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
yet they knew it not; and this
generation is the same who are in the
same nature, and in the same wisdome
which is earthly and litteral, and they
are imagining as the Jewes were, and
are, <hi>loe here, and loe there,</hi> in this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and the other, and look to
see it there. Nay Christ said, <hi>The
Kingdome of God is within you</hi> to the
Pharisees: He bad them and others
seek it first; what strange doctrine
was this, might the Pharisees say; he
saith, <hi>the kingdome of God is within us,</hi>
and yet bids us seek it: Need we seek
that which is in us, may professors
say? Yea, it's like a pearl hid in the
field; its like a grain of mustard-seed
among many great seeds, which is not
easily found; it's like a piece of silver
lost in the house among much rubbish,


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44981:119"/>
till that be swept away, thou wilt not
find it; thou must dig deep, sweep
clean, search narrowly before thou
find it; although he did say to the
Pharisees, <hi>The kingdom of God is within
you,</hi> he did not say they were possessors
of it, or that it was theirs; but to the
Disciples whom he taught to pray in
faith <hi>thy kingdome come,</hi> and they came
to find it; that which they prayed
for, that pearl, that groat, that grain
of mustard-seed which it was like, and
having found it, and believed in it, he
saith unto them, <hi>Mat. 5. 3. Blessed are
the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
of God.</hi> And in <hi>Luke 6. 20. And he
lift up his eyes on his disciples and said,
blessed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom
of God.</hi> They had seen it, and were
possessors of it, it was theirs. And
Christ said unto his disciples, <hi>There
are some of you standing here that shal not
taste of death till ye see the kingdom of God
come in power.</hi> And his words were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;
they declared what they had
felt and seen; and some of them said,
<hi>The Kingdome of God is not in word but
in power.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi>

any other glory but that which stood
in eternal life, and in the immortal
Life, and in the incorruptable life, and
the Country they sought after, was
that which God was the maker and
builder of, and they looked and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to receive of his power in which
the Kingdome standeth, and did in
this life (I do not say the full weight
of glory) and to know and injoy, and
to be made partakers of his eternal
dominion and authority, is that
which all the Saints in measure wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and in due time came to injoy
through faith; for by faith they saw
him who was invisible, and the things
of his kingdome, which is invisible,
spiritual and eternal; but to speak of
the carnal corruptable life in the flesh,
who are dead while they live there,
that life, neither the kingdome, nor


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44981:122"/>
the power, nor the glory of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to them, not till after the death
of that life, and till after the death
of him who hath the power of death,
which is the Devil, which ruleth in
the hearts of the children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
where all the mysteries of Gods
kingdome is hid from their eyes,
and ever shall while in that state;
and so let the Serpent be blind, and
they that have an eare to hear, blessed
is that eare; for the kingdome of God
is come nigh unto many, and the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of God, and the power of
Christ is seen by many, honour and
praise unto him everlastingly, who
is the onely Potentate that puts down
all authority under his feet, that God
may be all, in all, but first every
one must come to feel the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which is as a little grain, in
himselfe, and in it believe, before
any can come to know the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or wherein it consists, and
after it be known in its measure, yet
this is far short of glory in the fulness;
so many may come to be partakers of
the power in some measure, yet this is


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44981:123"/>
far short of the eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<hi>He that believes is entred into the
rest,</hi> and made partakers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
gift, and of the heavenly power,
and of the heavenly grace, which is
glorious, and doth witness a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place in Christ Jesus, and yet many
enemies to be subdued, and much of
the heavenly habitation, which they
see not, which comes to be revealed as
there is an abiding in the faith, which
stands in Gods power, in which the
kingdom stands; the mysteries of God
and of his kingdom comes in due
time to be revealed, through death
they come to be known, (that is to say)
through the death of death; for <hi>Israel</hi>
the true type, after they passed over
<hi>Jordan,</hi> and had taken <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Ai,</hi>
and had made an entrance into the
land, yet there was many enemies to
be subdued, and much land and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
which they were not made
partakers of long after, even so after
there be of the true rest enjoyed and
possessed, &amp; an entrance made into it,
yet there is many enemies to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
and much of the heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44981:123"/>
to be enjoyed by them that
stand in the power which giveth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over sin, the devil, hell and the
grave, and they come to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of God, and so the enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
slain, man comes to enjoy God
who is eternal life, and comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the crown immortal, which God
the eternal power and strength giveth
in due time, to them that wait in
patience and in faith, through which
the immortal inheritance comes to be
revealed to all the children of light.</p>
               <p>And so to conclude in few words,
this I say unto all, who are longing
after God, and waiting to feel his
power, keep in your minds to the
pure measure of Gods holy spirit, and
therein wait to see his kingdom, and
his dominion, and to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of it, which brings the world
to an end; and will let you see to the
end of it too, before it was, and him
who is now glorified with the Father
in the kindom of God, with the same
glory he had with the Father before
the world began, and who so comes
to the end of the world, and to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44981:124"/>
again, comes to see him and
his glory, and the kingdom of glory
which fades not away, which who so
comes to enjoy, are eternally happy.</p>
