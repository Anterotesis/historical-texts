         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

first learne to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this direction,
examining it in euery
poynt, so that thou finde
it true, &amp; agreeing with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Then consider how thou likest and
allowest of it. Both which if thou doest,
thou shalt easily finde and feele the
whole to worke vpon thee, as it is to be
desired. The first part by diligent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
will humble and bring thee low
in thine owne sight, and raise in thee a
true sorrow of heart, by seeing thy dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:6758:3"/>
miserie. The second part, by the
working of Gods Spirit, shall settle thee
in most cleare safety and peace, by seeing
thy selfe deliuered from the same misery.
The third part will shew thee how to
chang thy life, and conforme it vnto
the will of God, and giue thee direction
how to walke with God dayly. If thou
dealest not soundly with thy selfe in the
two former partes, neuer set vpon the
third. And although thou attaine to the
vse of them both, yet shall it be meete for
thee to prooue thy selfe dayly by them,
that thine estate may be found good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and after make the third part instead
of a dayly direction for thee, vntill
thou see thy selfe reformed, and made
like vnto it; which is the true vse of it.

trueth, must make dayly<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> vse of them all

                     <p>1 That we were created happy in

&amp; our owne both originall &amp;
actuall sinnes: and secondly, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
and punishment thereof,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> which is
death temporall of the body, &amp; eternall
both of body &amp; soule; with all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
that appertaine to them both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:6758:4"/>
3 That our sinfulnesse is such,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> as it
continually defileth all our actions, our
thoughts, wordes and deedes; and that
the punishment,<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 27</note> which is Gods curse,
is such, as lieth vpon vs alwayes, and in
all places; so that we are nothing but a
lumpe of sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> and vnder the wrath of
God continually.</p>
                     <p>4 That no man is able to satisfie for
his sinne,<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 26.</note> to appease Gods wrath, and to
come out of this miserie, by any thing
that he can doe,<note place="margin">Psal. 49. 7. 8. 9.</note> or that may be done by
any other man for him. And that none
is able to beare and ouercome the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
waight of that curse of
God,<note place="margin">Psal. 130. 3.</note> which hangeth ouer him for his
sinne.</p>
                     <p>5 That they which know not this,
still goe forwards in it without trouble
of minde, thinking their case good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
They that onely know it, being
full of poyson and rebellion,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 8. 9.</note> for the
most part rage against the doctrine
thereof, &amp; become more greedy to goe
on in all euill, when they see their sinne
forbidden; or at least they abide still in
it.<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> But if any be pricked in conscience,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:4"/>
and humbled by this, he maketh a right
and profitable vse of it; as shall be seene
in the sixt poynt.</p>
                     <p>6 That seeing it is thus with men;
they who haue not mourned, and yet
see they haue cause, must sorrow and
weepe,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> turning their laughter into
wayling,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2. 12. 13.</note> and their ioy into heauinesse,
till they see themselues deliuered from
this woe;<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> for they are not to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,<note place="margin">Ezra. 10. 2.</note>
that there is hope.</p>
                     <p>7 That to attaine this mourning,
(which is hardly wrought in vs) these
meanes, and such like, are to be vsed.
1. That we harden not our heartes in
hearing the Law,<note place="margin">Psal. 95. 7.</note> but suffer it to worke
vpon vs.<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 7.</note> 2. To be willing to examine
our heartes and liues for the finding out
of some speciall sinnes:<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 4.</note> and when wee
see them,<note place="margin">Lament. 3. 40.</note> wee do not lightly passe them
ouer and confesse them,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 30</note> but aggrauate
them to humble vs.<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 3. 5.</note> 3. That wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the greatnesse of the punishment,
with the eternitie thereof. 4. An ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
despaire of any remedie from our
selues, or any other creature. 5. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
of our selues, that many are
<pb facs="tcp:6758:5"/>
damned for those sinnes which we liue
in.<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 26. 6.</note> That wee weigh and consider our
mortalitie in this life, &amp; the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our death;<note place="margin">Psal. 90. 12.</note> and finally, vse all the
afflictions which God layeth vpon vs
vnto this end.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 32.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>8 That this mourning &amp; sorrowing
for sinne,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 16. 27.</note> and the woe it hath brought

towards vs: but is required of all vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
to breake their hearts, and cause
them to lament after God; not to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
them before God,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 7. 1.</note> but to make them
fit to receiue the Ghospell, and prepare

Come vnto mee all yee that trauell,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> and

although men can not make account
of the remedie,<note place="margin">Math. 9. 12.</note> except they feele their
need and miserie; yet if any rest in this
sorrow, and seeke not the remedie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,

and be forgotten in time, leauing no
Fruite behinde,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 21.</note> or driue them to vtter

                     <p>2 That this remedie is not to be
found but onely in Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> who
being both God and Man hath in our
Nature,<note place="margin">Esa. 53. 5.</note> suffered the punishment due
vnto our Sinnes, to deliuer vs from the
same, and fulfilled the righteousnesse
of the Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 18.</note> to iustifie vs before God:
and so deliuering vs from sinne and
death,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30. 31.</note> hath restored vs to righteousnes

the Person,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 12.</note> mentioned in the former
part of this Direction: seeing Christ
hath plainely affirmed, that he is a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to such sicke ones,<note place="margin">Luke. 5. 31.</note> and calleth
them to receiue;<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> that is, to beleeue it.
Which Fayth,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14. 17.</note> is a woonderfull and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
grace of God, whereby we
receiue Christ &amp; all his benefites, and is
ordinarily wrought in mens heartes by
the outward Preaching of the word,
and the inward operation of the Holy
Ghost.<note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> Therefore such as seeke this,
must heare Sermons often &amp; diligently,
they must be much mooued &amp; drawne
by the reports of other Godly;<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 43. 47</note> as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi>
by <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel</hi> by <hi>Philip.</hi>
And they must be encouraged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,<note place="margin">Act. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

by the example of others, who
were as farre off as they:<note place="margin">1. Ti. 1. 16.</note> they must vse
good company,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 26. 27</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> when he was

By these meanes many haue been added
to the Church and beleeued.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 24.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 That by this glad tidinges,<note place="margin">Actes. 2. 47.</note> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in his name, and the other meanes,
God draweth the hearts of such as shall
enioy it,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 37.</note> after they know that there is a
remedy, to hunger after it, and desire it
aboue all other thinges,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 44.</note> not fleetingly
nor houertly, but feruently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
so as nothing can satisfie them
without it; &amp; to prize it aboue all other
things: which grace being a peculiar
gift of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 46.</note> is not without Fayth
in some measure. And though it be not
in full assurance by and by, yet so, as
they neuer cease till they can apply it to
themselues. Which shall be, when they
haue felt the sweetnesse of Christ, when
they see they take the yoke vpon them,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note>
and be willingly subiect to his word
and commaundement: Then they shall
finde rest vnto their Soules.</p>
                     <p>5 That we therefore feeling what
great need wee haue of it, as hauing
<pb facs="tcp:6758:7"/>
been pricked in our hearts for our sinne
and damnable estate, and beene broken
hearted, and hauing this feruent desire
after it, &amp; so highly esteeming it, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, may apply it to our selues,
and doe rest perswaded (for all our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse)
that it is ours, &amp; freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
to vs of God,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 23.</note> because Christ
is giuen of God, and hath giuen himselfe
for such. And for our better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereunto, wee are to know, that
Christ commaundeth, exhorteth, and
beseecheth vs to beleeue in himselfe; so
that wee neede not feare that it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
thus to doe.</p>
                     <p>6 And seeing we are so fearefull at
our first calling, that we dare not thinke
we haue fayth,<note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 17.</note> know that these are sure
tokens of it, if we striue against doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 13.</note>
if we not feeling it, complaine bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
of the want of it;<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 2.</note> if we seeke fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently
to be setled in beleeuing;<note place="margin">Psal. 32. 5.</note> if we
desire to search out the sinne which
may possibly hinder vs, to expell it:
and some one of these, or other graces

                     <p>7 That by all good meanes we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this fayth in vs dayly:<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 38.</note> the meanes
are partly those which are set downe in

now be perswaded of it, and of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

as we did then. But if we grow
not, we began but counterfaitly.</p>
                     <p>8 That if our Fayth be confirmed,
and we perswaded of our saluation and
Gods fauour, it will appeare in vs by
these signes, which may be called inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
companions to it.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 11.</note> First, that we
haue peace with God,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 8.</note> and reioyce for
it sensibly.<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 8.</note> Secondly, that we loue the

were enough barely to thinke of them
euery day; but that we be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the most of them through the
day, and strengthned with the rest; I
meane Prayer and Thanksegiuing. So
that by the helpe of them all, wee may
be made able to passe the day both in

to temptation, commonnesse and
boldnesse in sinne,<note place="margin">Apo. 3. 17.</note> and a thinking that
we are well enough already; wearinesse

God according to his word, as well in
well doing,<note place="margin">2. Chr. 25. 2.</note> as in the deedes themselues.
Fiftly,<note place="margin">Prou 4. 18.</note> if wee still goe forward in this
course without fainting or discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as our knowledge increaseth; and
if we fall asleepe, &amp; offende against our

                     <p>I Haue set before thee (gentle Reader) a frame of
a Christian course, in these three partes. Now
when in knowledge, liuing, and going about
the practise hereof, it is entred vpon, &amp; thus farre
raysed vp; yet it is but an house vntiled, &amp; vndaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
without windowes, doores, implements and
other furniture: and therefore not so to be left.
Some neuer doe so much as enter vpon it<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> some
beginning, doe not finish it. And yet the first sort
may be long beating about it: The last are grose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceiued to let it stand vnperfected, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neuer reape the benefite of it. Such are they,
who hauing begun in all these three partes, leaue
off, as though they had done all. But the true
Christian, hauing laide for himselfe this good
foundation, buildeth therevpon proportionably,
as the Apostle sayth,<note place="margin">Ephse. 4. 16.</note> and so reapeth a sure &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
fruite of his labour: notwithstanding all
the troubles and dangers that may assayle him.
And if thou go about to be directed by this,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 24.</note> take
heed it waxe not loathsome to thee in time; and
so vsed for fashion, and not to gouerne thee, for
then thou loosest the benefite of it, (as one that
eateth meate with a full stomacke, and not for
hunger) and it shall loose her beautie with thee.
And yet through slouth,<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 7.</note> negligence, and loue of
this world, with the pleasures of it<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and manifold
discouragements, this will come to passe.</p>

                  <head>DIRECTIONS HOW
TO DIE WELL.</head>
                  <p>THinke that the greatest worke
thou hast to finish in this world, is
to die well; and to make an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
departure out of this World.
They which die well die not to die, but
to liue eternally.</p>
                  <p>Be euery day readie to leaue this life.
That man doth finish his dayes in best
sort, that euery day esteemeth the last
day of his life, to be present &amp; at hand.</p>
                  <p>Endeauour before death come vpon
thee, to pull out this sting; &amp; take from
him his power &amp; strenght by humbling
thy selfe in the time present, for all thy
sinnes past; &amp; by turning thy selfe vnto
God for the time to come. That man can
neuer die ill, that hath a care to liuewel.</p>
                  <p>Inure thy selfe by litle &amp; litle to die,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:14"/>
before thou come to that poynt that
thou must needes die. He that leaues
the World, before the World leaues
him, giues Death the hand like a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Messenger, and departs in peace.</p>
                  <p>Chiefly when thou art visited with
Sicknesse, or Old-age, thinke either of
these, a Summoner, warning thee ere
long, to appeare before the great Lord,
Iudge of all the World; therefore now,
prepare to set all things in good order,
and make thine accountes ready.</p>
                  <p>Make a new examination of thy life
and conuersation passed. Make a new
confession vnto God of thy new and
particular sinnes, as God sendes new
corrections and chastisementes. Make
new Prayers, and more earnest then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
before, for pardon of thy sinnes, &amp;
reconciliation with God in Christ<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> By
all meanes auoyde those sinnes, which
thou findest and feelest to incense the
wrath of God against thee.</p>
                  <p>Seek reconciliation with thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
by free forgiuenesse of them that
haue offended thee; and earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be forgiuen of all that haue been
<pb facs="tcp:6758:14"/>
offended by thee. Set thine House and
Familie in order, by disposing of thy
worldly goodes in thy Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
thereby shalt thou die not the
more quickly, but the more quietly;
and preuent the brawles and iarres that
otherwise (when thou art gone,) may
arise among thine Heires. Thou partest
from earthly possessions, and art going
to take possession of Heauenly. In the
last agonie of Death, when all things in
and of the World doe fayle and forsake
thee, rest thy selfe by Fayth, on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and mercie of God in Christ, and
comfort thy selfe in the Lord thy God:
What shall separate from the loue of
God in Christ? nor life nor death.</p>
                  <p>Let thine Heart and Tongue be still
imployed in prayer to the Lord: First,
for patience in thy trouble: Second, for
Comfort in thine affliction: Third, for
Strength in his mercy: Fourth, for Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
at his pleasure. Yea, endeauour
euen to die praying. When thou art in
the deapth of Miseries, and at the gates
of Death, there is a deapth of Gods
mercy; which is ready to heare &amp; helpe
<pb facs="tcp:6758:15"/>
thee: Miserie must call vpon Mercie.</p>
                  <p>Be willing and ready to depart out of
this world without murmuring or repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>soeuer, wheresoeuer, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it shall please the Lord to call
thee. For why shouldest thou vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
suffer a short Death, that will
bring thee to the fruition of eternall
Ioyes? Perswade thy selfe, that if thou
liue by the mercie of God, thou shalt do
well: But if thou die, doubt not but
thou shalt doe better. And with a free
heart speake it: <hi>Come Lord Iesu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, when thou feelest Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
commende thy departing
soule into the holy hands of God: Hee
gaue it, to him surrender it againe. So,
laying thy selfe downe to sleepe &amp; rest,

In the first, he and his flesh are all one,
for they are as Man and Wife;<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 5.</note> therfore
one is accessarie to the doinges of the
other: When the flesh sinneth, the man
also sinneth, that is in subiection to the
flesh: yea, when the flesh perisheth the
man likewise perisheth, being in this
estate with the flesh a louing couple,
they liue and die togeather. But in the
estate of <hi>Grace,</hi> though a man haue the
flesh in him, yet he and his flesh are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced
a sunder. This diuorcement is
made, when a man begins to dislike and
hate his flesh, and the euill fruites of it.
This separation being made, they
are no more one, but twaine; and the
one hath nothing to do with the other.
In this case, though the flesh begette
sinne, &amp; perish therefore; yet the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

man shall not endure damnation
for it. To come more neare the matter:

what then? it troubleth you, but feare
not, remember your estate; you are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced

layd at your doore, account them not
as your Children, but renounce them as
Bastardes: Say with <hi>Paul,</hi> I doubt in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed,
but I hate my doubtinges: and I
am no cause of these; but the Flesh in
mee, which shall perish, when I shall be
saued by Christ.</p>

these doubtinges?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Min.</speaker>
                     <p>For the suppressing of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges,
you are to vse three meditations.
The first, That is Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that you should beleeue in Christ.
So <hi>S. John</hi> sayth:<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 3. 23.</note> This is his Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
that we beleeue in the name of
his Sonne Iesus Christ. Thou shalt not
<pb facs="tcp:6758:19"/>
steale, is Gods Commandement; &amp; you
are loath to breake it, least you should
displease God, and pull his cursse vpon
your head. This also is Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement;
Thou shalt beleeue in Christ,
and therefore you must take heed of the
breach of it, least by doubting &amp; waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
you bring the cursse vpon you.
Secondly, you must consider, that the
promises of saluation in Christ, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
or at the least indiffinite, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
no particular man; as in one for al,
may appeare; God so loued the world,
that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne,
that whosoeuer beleeueth in him shoud
not perish, but haue euerlasting life.</p>
                     <p>Now then, so often as you shal doubt
of Gods Mercie, you exclude your
owne selfe from the promise of God,
whereas he excludeth you not. And as
when a prince giues a Pardon to all
Theeues, euery one can apply the same
vnto himselfe, though his name be not
set downe in the Pardon: So the King
of Kings hath giuen a generall Pardon
for free remission of sinnes, to them that
will receiue it. Beleeue therefore that
<pb facs="tcp:6758:20"/>
God is true in his Promise, doubt not
of your owne saluation, challenge the
Pardon to your selfe. Indeed your
name is not set downe or written in the
Promise of Grace; yet let not any illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Sathan, or the consideration of
your owne vnworthinesse, exclude
you from this free Mercie of GOD:
which he hath also offered to you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;
first in Baptisme, then after in
the Lordes Supper; and therefore you
are not to wauer in the applying of it to
your selfe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you are to consider that by
doubting and despayring, you offende
God as much almost, as by any other
sinne:<note place="margin">Rom. 4<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 18.</note> You do not aboue hope, beleeue
vnder hope, as you should do. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
you robbe God of his glorie, in that
you make his infinite Mercie to be lesse
then your sinnes. Thirdly, you make
him a lyer, who hath made such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
vnto you. And to these three me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
adde this practise: When
your heart is toyled with vnbeliefe and
doubtings; then in all haste draw your
selfe into some secret place, humble
<pb facs="tcp:6758:20"/>
your selfe before God, poure out your
heart before him; desire him of his end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
mercie to worke Faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 12.</note> and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
your vnbeliefe; and you shal see,
That the Lord ouer all, is ritch vnto all
that call vpon his name.</p>

                     <speaker>Chr.</speaker>
                     <p>The Lord reward you for your
kindnesse; I will hereafter doe my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
to practise this your counsell.
Now I wil make bold to shew an other,
that makes me to feare, least I haue no
Fayth: And it is, because I doe not feele
the assurance of the forgiuenesse of my
sinnes.</p>

                     <speaker>Min.</speaker>
                     <p>Fayth standeth not in the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Gods mercie, but in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
of it: which apprehending,
may be when there is no f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eling: for
Faith is of inuisible things.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> And when a
man once commeth to enioy the thing
beleeued,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> then he seaseth to beleeue:

                        </note>
when he sayeth: Loe though hee slay
mee, yet will I trust in him, and I will
reproue my wayes in his sight: he shall
be my saluation also: for the hipocrite
shall not come before him; hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:6758:21"/>
his Fayth: Yet when he sayth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
afterward: Wherefore hidest
thou thy face, and takest mee for thine
enimie<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> hee declareth the want of that
feeling which you speake of.</p>

                     <speaker>Chr.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet euery true beleeuer feeles the
assuraunce of Fayth: otherwise <hi>Paul</hi>

whether you be in the fayth or not.</p>

                     <p>Indeed sometimes he doth, but at

                     <p>But doe you desire with all

your heart to feele it?</p>

                     <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
                     <p>Then doubt not, you shal feele it.</p>

                     <speaker>Min.</speaker>
                     <p>Why? It is most true, for the
man that would haue any grace of God
tending to saluation, if he doe truely
desire it, he shall haue it: for so Christ
hath promised: I will giue to him that
is a thirst,<note place="margin">Reue. 2. 6.</note> of the Well of the Water of
life freely. Whereby I gather, that if any
want the Water of life, hauing any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
after it, he shall haue enough of it:
and therefore feare you not; onely vse
the meanes which God hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to attaine Faith by, as earnest Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
reuerent hearing of Gods word, and
receiuing of the Sacramentes; and then
you shall see these thinges verified in

                     <p>All this which you say, I finde
in my selfe, by the mercy of God; my

which I want. I know I doe hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Kingdome of Heauen, and the
righteousnesse thereof: and further,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:22"/>

                     <p>The third thing that troubles
me,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> is this: I haue long prayed for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Graces of God, and yet I haue not
receiued them: whereby it comes oft
to my minde, that God loues mee not,
that I am none of his Child: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that I haue no Fayth.</p>

                     <speaker>Chr.</speaker>

                     <p>Good <hi>Zachary</hi> waighted lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb facs="tcp:6758:22"/>
on the Lord, before he graunted his
request, then euer you did. It is like he
prayed for a Child in his younger
yeares, yet his prayer was not heard,
before he was olde. And further, you
must note<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> that the Lord may heare the
Prayers of his Seruantes, and yet they
be altogeather ignoraunt of them: For
the manner that God vseth in graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their request, is not alwayes kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen;
as may appeare in the example
of our Sauiour Christ:<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> who in the
dayes of his flesh, did offer vp Prayers
and Supplications, with strong crying
and teares vnto him, that was able to
saue him from death, &amp; was also heard
in that which he feared: and yet wee
know that he was not freed from that
cursed death, but must needes suffer it:
How then was he heard? On this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Hee was strengthned to beare the
death: Hee had an Angell to comfort
him: Hee was afterward freed from the
sorrow of death. And so it is with the
rest of Christes bodie, as it was with the
head. Some being in want, pray for
Temporall blessinges: God keepes
<pb facs="tcp:6758:23"/>
them in this want, and yet he heares
their Prayers, in giuing them patience
and strength, to abide that want. Some
being in wealth and aboundance, pray
for the continuing of it, if it be the will
of God: The Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>linges them into a
perpetuall Miserie, and yet he heares
their Prayers, by giuing them blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the life to come. You pray for
the increase of Fayth, and Repentance,
and such like graces: you feele no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
after long prayer; yet the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
God hath (no doubt) heard your
praier, in that by delaying to performe
your request, he hath stirred vp in you
the spirit of Prayer, he hath humbled
you, and made you feele your owne
wantes, the better to depende on his
mercie, for the beginning &amp; increasing
of euery particular Grace.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Chr.</speaker>
                     <p>the fourth thing that troubles
me, is that I can not feele Fayth purifie
my heart, &amp; to worke by loue, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
foorth liuely fruites.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>If this be so continually, that
Fayth bringes foorth no fruite, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
dangerous, &amp; argueth a plaine want
<pb facs="tcp:6758:23"/>
of Fayth: yet for a certaine time it may
be so. Fayth hath not onely a Spring
time, and a Summer season, but also a
Winter, when it beareth no fruite. And
there is many a true Christian, like the
brused Reed, that is ouerturned with
euery blast of Wind: and like the Flaxe
that hath Fire in it, which by reason of
weakenesse, giues no heate nor light,
but onely a smoake.</p>

though he doe it neuer so vntowardly,

                     <p>OH Lord God, and deare Father,
What shall I say, that feele all

as in the wicked; Blinde is my
Minde, crooked is my Will, &amp; peruerse
Concupiscence is in mee as a Spring of
stinking puddle. O how faint is Fayth

How hard is my heart? By reason
whereof, I am mooued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o doubt of thy
goodnesse towardes mee, whether thou
art my mercifull Father, and whether I
be thy Child or no: Indeed, worthily
might I doubt, if that the hauing of
these were the cause, and not the fruite
rather of thy Children: The cause why
thou art my Father, is thy mercifull
goodnesse, grace, &amp; trueth in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;
which can not but remaine for euer.
In respect whereof, thou hast borne me
this good-will, to bring mee into thy
Church by Baptisme, and to accept me
into the number of thy Children, that I
<pb facs="tcp:6758:28"/>
might be holy, faythfull, obedient, and
innocent: and to call mee diuers times
by the ministerie of thy word, into thy
Kingdome: beside the innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
benefites alwaies hitherto powred
vpon me. All which, thou hast done of
this thy good will, which thou of thine
owne mercie bearest to mee in Christ
before the World was made. The
which thing as thou requirest straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that I should beleeue without doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so wouldest thou that I in all my
needes, should come vnto thee as to a
Father, and make my moane without
mistrust of being heard in thy good
time, as most shall make to my comfort.
Loe therefore to thee deare Father, I
come through thy Sonne our Lord,
our Mediatour, and Aduocate, Iesus
Christ, who sitteth on thy right hand,
making intercession for me. I pray thee
of thy great goodnesse and mercie in
Christ, to be mercifull to me a sinner,
that I may in deed feele thy sweete mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
as thy Child. The time (O deare
Father) I appoynt not, but I pray thee
that I may with hope still expect and
<pb facs="tcp:6758:29"/>
looke for thy helpe: I hope that as for a
litle while thou hast left me, so thou wilt
come and visit me, and that in thy great
mercie, whereof I haue great need, by
reason of my great miserie. Thou art
wont for a litle season in thine anger, to
hide thy face from them whom thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest:
but surely (O Redeemer) in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
mercies thou wilt shew thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
For when thou leauest vs, O
Lord, thou dost not leaue vs very long,
neither dost thou leaue vs to our losse,
but to our lucre and aduantage, euen
that thy holy Spirit with bigger porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thy power and vertue, may ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and cheare vs, that the want of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of our sorrow, may be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
plentifully, with the liuely scent of
hauing thee to our eternall ioy: And
therefore thou swearest, that in thine
euerlasting mercie thou wilt haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on vs: Of which thing, to the
end wee might be most assured, thine
Oath is to be marked; for thou sayest:
As I haue sworne, that I wil neuer bring
any more the Waters to drowne the
World; so haue I sworne, that I will
<pb facs="tcp:6758:29"/>
neuer more be angrie with thee, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
thee. The Mountaines shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue,
and the Hilles shall fall downe;
but my louing kindnes shal not mooue,
and the bond of my peace shal not faile
thee: Thus sayest thou the Lord our
mercifull redeemer. Deare father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I pray thee remember, euen for
thine owne trueth and mercies sake, the
promise &amp; euerlasting couenant, which
in thy good time, I pray thee to write
in my heart, that I may know thee to be
the onely true God, and Iesus Christ,
whom thou hast sent, that I may loue
thee with all my heart for euer: that I
may loue thy people for thy sake: that
I may be holy in thy sight through
Christ; that I may alwayes not onely

                  <p>13 Labour for meeknes &amp; patience,
and be readie to kisse the Rodde, and to

sometimes Melancholy, somtimes your
Weakenesse and simplicitie, sometimes
Witcherie, sometimes Sathan: for the
diuers thoughts wil much trouble you:
You may thinke Melancholy to be an

Therfore looke steadfastly to the hand
of God surely trusting on this; that hee
not onely knoweth thereof, but that
whatsoeuer is done directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
by meanes or immediatly, all is
<pb facs="tcp:6758:32"/>
done and gouerned by his Diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
for our good.</p>
                  <p>17 Say not you cannot be helped:
for that may hinder the worke of God.
Say not, If I were in such a place, and
such a place, I should be well; for God
is infinite, and therefore euery where:
aswell where you are, as where you
would be.</p>
                  <p>18 Whereas in consideration of the
falling away of many, excelling you
both in the ages and graces of the new
birth, you feare you shall not perseuere
vnto the end: your meditating and
collection is good, so long as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
you from the carelesnesse of the
flesh: but it is euill when it would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
the assurednesse of your Fayth.
Indeed so long as you looke vpon
your selfe, you haue cause to feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are vnable to prolonge, as
you are to begin new birth: but if you
looke to God, you haue nothing but
matter of Fayth; for that when he once
loueth, he loueth for euer. Againe, as
a man swimming in the deepe of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
is neuer in danger of drowning so
<pb facs="tcp:6758:32"/>
long as his head continueth aboue the
Water: so though you swim in deepe
seas of dangerous temptations, yet are
you sure and secure, because Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
your head, is still aboue all your
troubles; and therefore able to draw
you his Members to the Shoare of
Saluation, without all perill of peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing.</p>
                  <p>19 Beleeue that GOD the Father
doth gouerne your temptation, that the
holy Ghost shall and doth assist you,
that Iesus Christ was tempted to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in you, that the Saintes on earth
doe pray for you; euen those which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
knew you; but doe pray for the
tempted ones.</p>
                  <p>20 None can iudge of the worke of

as none can iudge of the Sunne, but by

                        <hi>Feare and trembling are come vpon
me, and an horrible feare hath couered me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is thy soule distressed? yet is not thy
affliction like those which lie yelling in
Hell in fire inquenchable, weeping and
wayling, and gnashing their teeth; and
haue not so much as a drop of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to coole their tongue.</p>
                     <p>Then thinke thus with thy selfe: Is
one member grieued? GOD could
smite all. Am I heart sicke? God could
inlarge mine heart, and therewith, all
my paine seauen-fold more. Am I
distressed in soule?<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 5.</note> God could giue
me ouer into desperation. Am I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
both in body and soule? God
could throw both body &amp; soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell fire. Thus mayest thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comfort in thy greatest paine,
by considering how much lesse thy
paine is, then God is able to inflict.</p>
                     <p>3 Let the Sicke man consider,<note place="margin">Psal. 14. 3.</note> how
much lesse his paine is,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 3.</note> then he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note>
All are gone out of the way: And
in many things,<note place="margin">Deu. 27. 26.</note> we offend all. Now the
<pb facs="tcp:6758:40"/>
reward of sinne is death: that is, the
curse of God, Hel-fire, vtter confusion
both of body &amp; soule. The damned in
Hell would gladly suffer the panges of
death for euer, that they might be eased
of their tormentes but for a while. Thus
mayst thou gather comfort to thy selfe,
by considering how sparingly the
Lord scourgeth thee, when as for thy
desert, he might vtterly confound thee.</p>
                     <p>4 Let the sicke man consider, that
the best Saintes of God haue been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

                        <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. kin. 20. 1.</note> an holy King, there arose
none like him, either before or after
him: yet was he sicke to the death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jesus</hi> loued <hi>Lazarus;</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:6758:40"/>Of this Meditation, the sicke man may

Patriarkes,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> Prophets, and Saints of
God, beloued of Iesus Christ; for
thus were they visited. Yea, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
that I am of their number: for
God scourgeth euery Sonne that he
receiueth.</p>
                     <p>5 Let the sicke man consider how
great the ioyes of Heauen are,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 9.</note> which
are layd vp in store for him, if he pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
abide the Lordes visitation, euen
such as the eye hath not seene, neither
hath the eare heard, neither is the heart
able to conceiue; so will hee say with
<hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>I count that the afflictions of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time, are not worthy of the glory which
shall be shewed to vs.</hi> Thus will the hope
of the ioy to come, asswage the paine of
the present maladie.</p>
                     <p>6 Let the sicke man consider,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> that
such thinges Christ himselfe suffered,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note>
                        <pb facs="tcp:6758:41"/>
and so entred into his glorie. And now
being in his glorie, he seeth, feeleth, and
pittieth the distresse of his members.
For we haue not an High-priest which
cannot be touched with the feeling of
our infirmities, but was in all thinges
tempted in like sort; &amp; therefore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the better to pittie vs.</p>
                     <p>From this

Almightie, and will not ioyne with mee

to be companion with such, or to receiue
him to be my guest, (for such procure
Gods wrath, as afore is said,) but I will say
with <hi>Dauid, Psalmes</hi> 119. 63. Those shall
be my companions that feare God, and
keepe his commandements: and those
shalbe my guests that be godly, iust, and
feare God. And as for the wicked and
<pb facs="tcp:6758:81"/>
rebellious against the ordinance of God,
seeing they are darknesse, with whom
light hath no communion, and seeing
they are as pitch, very likely to defile a
man, I will say to such, as our Sauiour

or Directions for a Christian life.</head>
                  <p>1 ACcompt not of your selfe better
then you are, for the more base
you are in your owne conceit, the more
glorious are ye in the sight of God; for
God regardeth a lowly minde, as the
poore Publican that did deny himselfe
had more fauour in the sight of GOD,
then the proud Pharisie, that boasted
of himselfe.</p>
                  <p>2 Speake not of God but with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
knowing that wee are not worthy
<pb facs="tcp:6758:81"/>
to take his name in our mouth, much
more we ought not to take it vainely.</p>
                  <p>3 Hold fast to God, aswell in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
as in aduersitie; for in aduersitie we
come to God, but in prosperitie we forget
our selues often: Also, if you be in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
despaire not, but waight vpon God
for deliuerance, and he will send it when
there is no hope of it, to the glory of
his owne name, and for the good of his
children, as <hi>Daniell</hi> from the Lyons.</p>
                  <p>4 Buy and redeeme the time past
with repentance; looke to the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with diligence, and to the time to
come with prouidence.</p>
                  <p>5 Let not malice make you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
that vvhich friendship bound you
once for to conceale.</p>
                  <p>6 In Praysing be discreet: In salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
courteous: and in admonishing bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly,
not hastily and angerly.</p>
                  <p>7 Reade something of Gods word
daily, and doe not onely count it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that you serue God truely your selfe
but also looke that all your charge and
houshold doe the same truely.</p>
                  <p>8 Whatsoeuer blessings yee craue of
<pb facs="tcp:6758:82"/>
God, aske them in the name of Christ.
<hi>For no man commeth to the Father but by
me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>saith Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9 Whatsoeuer you take in hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you doe it aske counsaile of God,
vvhither it be lawfull, and then doe it
with peace of heart, if it be lawfull.</p>
                  <p>10 Looke that Meate, Apparell, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
be needful, lawful, &amp; moderate.</p>
                  <p>11 Take heede of presumptuous sins,
for though many presume that God is a
God of mercy, yet though he be a God
of mercy to the penitent, yet he is a God
of Iustice also.</p>
                  <p>12 Forsake the World, &amp; flye to God;
for it is vnpossible, that a man louing the
World, should haue any comfort from
God, for the loue of the World is enmity
with God; besides keepe not any thing of
the World to you, that may draw you
from God; for God will not haue part of
the Man, but the whole Man.</p>
                  <p>13 Be alwayes armed against tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for those that belong to CHRIST
must looke for temptations alwayes: and
thinke not if that ye haue ouercome any
temptation, once or twice, or often, that
<pb facs="tcp:6758:82"/>
then you are freed: for Christ was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
often, so were the Apostles, they had
one time peace and then persecution;
and then peace and after persecution, so
alwayes an intercourse: and when they
were in peace, they made ready to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for temptation, knowing that they
should haue temptation: therefore this
life is called a Christian warfare.</p>
                  <p>14 Besides, if yee are tempted and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it sheweth manifestly that ye belong
to God: for God scourgeth euery Sonne
that hee receiueth: Besides, those that
haue no temptation or tryall, it sheweth
manifestly they belong to the Diuell:
for what need hath bee to tempt them
whom he hath already in bondage?</p>
                  <p>15 Flye from all sinnes in generall,
indeuour, and then God will accept your
indeuours though weake and imperfect,
through the perfection of Christ; and
sticke to no darling sinnes; for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
can as well hold a man insubiection
by one sinne, as by all sinnes.</p>
                  <p>16 Let the words that you speake
proceede from the good Spirit, and
not from the flesh, for if they doe,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:83"/>
GOD abhorreth them.</p>
                  <p>17 As God doth abound in mercy
and goodnesse towards you, so be you
inlarged to him in obedience.</p>
                  <p>18 When ye are tempted at any time
by the Diuell, or his Ministers, be sure
to haue the word of God to answere
him: for the word is compared to a two-edged
sword, that doth not onely defend
vs, but also offend our enemies.</p>
                  <p>19 Christ, he vsed Scripture to repell
the diuel, he could haue driuen the diuel
away with the breath of his Nostrils,
but hee did answere him with Scripture,
to shew vs example, that if wee were
tempted at any time, wee should with
Scripture repell him And that euery
one may know them the better, they
must reade them often, vse conference,
and marking the true meaning of the
vvords, and conferring one place of
Scripture with another, and praying to
God for to giue them the blessing of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
it truely, and the like.</p>
                  <p>20 Follow your Betters, obserue
and marke the Wise, accompany the
honest, and loue the godly.</p>

which may be numbred foure wayes.</p>
                  <p>1 The account which <hi>Moses</hi> maketh:
<hi>the dayes of our life are threescore yeeres
and ten,</hi> this number euery child can tell.</p>
                  <p>2 By comparison of three times:</p>
                  <p>1 Past, which being once gone and
and past is nothing now it is past, were it
a thousand yeeres it is but a thought.</p>
                  <p>II Future, which being to come, it is
not yet certaine whether it will be to vs
or no.</p>
                  <p>III Present, which is but at the instant.</p>
                  <p>3 Deduction, or Abstraction: thus,
take from 70. yeeres 35. spent in sleepe,
and fifteene yeeres of our child-hoode,
the time of our vanitie; and tenne yeeres
<pb facs="tcp:6758:84"/>
allowed for eating, recreating, idle talke,
iourneyes, &amp;c. then there will be found
but tenne yeeres remaining well spent:
whereof Lord how little is spent in thy
seruice? These three wayes of numbring
may be taught vs by men: the fourth
way God onely can teach.</p>
                  <p>4 By a Christian and heauenly Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke,
that is, so to number as we may

vncertaintie of our life, apply our hearts
vnto wisedome.</p>
                  <p>The Lesson contains an eleauen points
of wisdome, to be learned from the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

perswaded that euery houre may be our
last, it will cause vs:</p>
                  <p>1 To set our house in order, that is, to
haue our last Will alwayes ready, as God
charged <hi>Ezechia, Esay</hi> 38. 1. lest death
preuent vs.</p>

and constant in wel-doing, without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse:
seeing the time is short, and there
will be an end, and the hope shall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and that wee shall finde all our good
workes in life eternall.</p>
                  <p>6 To esteeme wisely of the things of
this life which tarry with vs but a while,
as comforts of our pilgrimage, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Gods loue, and pledges of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things layd vp in heauen for his.</p>
                  <p>7 So to vse the world, as if we did not
vse it, fixing our delight on GOD, and
the things of heauen, which wither not.</p>
                  <p>8 To be more studious of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
seeing the things which we are to
learne are many and weighty, and our
space to learne in so little.</p>
                  <p>9 To busie our selues much in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
education of our children, seeing
we are shortly to leaue them, and religion
<pb facs="tcp:6758:85"/>
is the best inheritance vvee can leaue
them, and wee to leaue them to a wicked
world.</p>
                  <p>10 To be full of good counsell toward
others, and our selues to bee more
capable of counsell.</p>
                  <p>11 To thinke euery word of God to
be sweet and comfortable to our selues,
and to feare God.</p>

<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1. he is as a loathsome carraine,<note place="margin">Mans mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery in the state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>
or a dead corps, lying rotting and stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the graue, hauing in him the seede
of all sinne. From this estate none are
exempted, as <hi>Iob</hi> 15. 14. Which wofull
estate came vpon mankinde by the fall
of <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 5. 1. we being then in
him, and now of him, that is, wee are so
descended out of his loynes, that of him
we haue not onely receiued our naturall
and corrupt bodyes, but also by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb facs="tcp:6758:88"/>
haue inherited his foule corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as it were, by hereditary right.</p>
                  <p>This infection extendeth it selfe vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally
through the whole man, both
soule and body, both reason, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
will, and affections, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1. For,
First,<note place="margin">Sinne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it selfe to the whole man, both soule and body.</note> in the minde there is nothing but
blindnesse and ignorance concerning
heauenly matters. Secondly, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is defiled, being alwayes eyther
benummed with sin, or turmoyled with
inward accusations and terrors. Thirdly,
the will of man onely willeth and lusteth
after euill. Fourthly, the affections of the
heart, as Loue, Ioy, Hope, Desire, &amp;c. are
moued and stirred to that which is euill,
to imbrace it; and they are neuer stirred
to that which is good, vnlesse it be to
eschew it. Lastly, the members of the
body are the Instruments and tooles of
the minde for the execution of sinne.</p>
                  <p>In this estate no man can please God
in whatsoeuer he doth:<note place="margin">Man in the state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not please God.</note> for till we be in
the state of grace, our best actions are
sinnefull, as Preaching, Prayer, Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes,
and the like: as it is written, <hi>Iob
14. 4. Who can bring a cleane thing out
<pb facs="tcp:6758:88"/>
of that which is vncleane?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man in the state of Nature may doe
those things vvhich are of themselues
good,<note place="margin">A naturall man may doe that vvhich is in it selfe good, but not good to him that doth it.</note> but they vtterly fayle in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of doing them, they doe them not
as they should be done, that is, in Faith,
Loue, Zeale, conscience of obedience;
neither yet with cheerefulnes, delight, or
feeling, but euen as it were, forcing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to do the outward action, as <hi>Caine,</hi>
the Pharises, <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So long as men be meerely naturall
they haue no sight of their owne misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
estate,<note place="margin">A meerely naturall man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see his misery.</note> or of the blessed estate of the
godly. For, the naturall man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not the things that be of God: he
being at enmity with God, and so depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of his fauour. Consider his estate.</p>
                  <p>In the soule of man there are but two
faculties,<note place="margin">A naturall man hath a minde that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sees nor can see the things that be of God.</note> the vnderstanding and the will:
the spirit of God so discribes his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that not onely he saith the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man vnderstands not the things
that are of God, and as if it were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to expresse mans miserable estate,
he addeth, neither indeed can he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them, because they are spiritually
<pb facs="tcp:6758:89"/>
discerned:<note place="margin">A will that neither is nor can be subiect to the law of God.</note> and againe, his will hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
it, that it is not subiect to the law
of God, neither in deede can be.</p>
                  <p>Hereby we may perceiue the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
estate of those who are strangers
from God;<note place="margin">This sets forth Gods povver and grace to be the greater because it restores mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being so farre peruerted.</note> what an vnhappy condition
of life it is that a man should liue in such
an estate, wherein doe what hee can hee
cannot please God? Let <hi>Caine</hi> sacrifice
with <hi>Abell;</hi> let <hi>Esau</hi> with teares seeke a
blessing from his father; let the Pharisie
pray in the Temple with the Publican,
yet all nor any of these shall please God,
or goe home iustified: and for worldly
glory let him be neuer so high amongst
men, he is but abhominable vnto God.</p>
                  <p>In this state he is not onely an enemy
to God,<note place="margin">The best affections of vvicked men please not God.</note> but in bondage and a slaue to the
Diuell, hauing him to raigne in his heart
as God, which may be perceiued in that
he giueth obedience to him in his heart,<note place="margin">A naturall man a slaue to the Diuell.</note>
and expresseth it in his conuersation: and
this appeareth if he take delight in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
motions that Sathan puts in his hart,<note place="margin">Hovv, to perceiue our subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Diuell.</note>
and doe fulfill the lusts of the diuell.</p>
                  <p>And in this estate he continueth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seeing nor feeling his misery, nor
<pb facs="tcp:6758:89"/>
desirous to come out of it, neither can he
be perswaded that hee is in such a wofull
case; as appeareth in the example of the
Ruler, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 21. and by the Church
of Laodicia, which being poore, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
miserable, blinde and naked, yet she
thought hir selfe rich, and wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.<note place="margin">None can be saued but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</note>
Thus he remaineth vnder Sathans
dominion till he be regenerate &amp; borne
againe, and so brought into the state of
grace: so that man liuing &amp; dying in the
state of nature, for any thing I see, cannot
be saued: I speake not of infants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
whereof some no doubt are saued
by vertue of the promise and couenant,
through the election of grace.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that the estate of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man is most miserable, and none
growne to yeeres of discretion can be
saued (for any thing vve know) but the
regenerte, and such as are in the state of
grace, I vvill therefore) for the better
tryall of our present estate) shew vvhat
regeneration is, and the properties of
those in whomsoeuer this new birth is
wrought, &amp; such quallities as doe vsually
shew forth themselues in those in whom
<pb facs="tcp:6758:90"/>
soeuer the spirit of Christ dwelleth.</p>
                  <p>Regeneration is renewing &amp; repayring
of the decayed estate of our soules,<note place="margin">What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note> or an
act of the holy Ghost in Gods elect,
whereby they are entred into a constant
and faithfull exercise of a godly life.</p>
                  <p>As there is a Naturall birth of the
whole man, so there is a spirituall birth of
the whole man, which is, where as the
Naturall faculties of the soule, as Reason,
Vnderstanding, Will, Affection, and the
members of the body also, are so sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and purged by grace,<note place="margin">The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> that we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,

can no more desire that which is good,<note place="margin">Till a man be borne againe he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that vvhich is good.</note>
then a dead man can desire the good
things of this life.</p>
                  <p>The signes of regeneration are. First, a
true touch of conscience for our sinnes,
both originall and actuall: Secondly,
a godly sorrow and griefe of heart for
offending GOD by our transgressions:<note place="margin">Signes of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
Thirdly, an earnest desire after Christ

the word, prayer, and Sacraments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:6758:90"/>
GOD giues grace and assurance of
mercy: Fourthly, an vnfained turning to
God from all sinne by new obedience in
life to please God in all things.</p>
                  <p>Further there are eight signes and
tokens whereby all men may certainly
know that they are sanctified, regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Eight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible signes of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
and shall be saued. First, a loue to the

prayer. Fourthly, zeale of Gods glory.
Fiftly, denyall of our selues. Sixtly, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
bearing of the Crosse, with profit and

our callings. Eightly, iust and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
dealings in all our actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men.</p>
                  <p>In whomsoeuer this worke of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is wrought,<note place="margin">Where there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> there is euer found
the action of mortification, for he that is
resolued to endeuour his godly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and laboureth the reformation
of his sinfull life, must labour two things
principally and of necessirie, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Regeneration: hee must first
destroy his sinnefull estate, before hee
can obtaine the estate of grace: for God
<pb facs="tcp:6758:91"/>
and the gifts of God, are so absolutely
holy, as that they cannot admit any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with sinne and wicked actions.</p>
                  <p>Mortification is a decay and perishing
of the deeds of the flesh by the grace and
operation of Gods Spirit,<note place="margin">What Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note> vvhich deeds
of the flesh are not onely our euill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but our desires and carnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
also:<note place="margin">Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in two things.</note> which mortification of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
consists in two things: first, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
by an holy discipline our inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
lusts, which naturally rebell against
the loue of God: Secondly, in a patient
bearing of the crosse of Iesus: except we
make some profit in the first, it is certaine
we shall neuer proceede in the second:
wheresoeuer Mortification is, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that Mortification is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of Sanctification,<note place="margin">A tryall of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> hereby we may
try how farre we haue gone in the same.
Experience teacheth that the nearer a
man drawes to death, the lesse motion is
in him, but being dead, he moues not at
all: so is it with the spirituall man, the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he goes in Mortification the greater
is his progresse in Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:91"/>
By which Sanctification trie thy selfe,<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a true marke of a liuing soule.</note>
and see whether or no thou hast gotten
life, by the righteousnesse of Christ: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
not thy owne hart in the matter of
saluation; assure thy selfe so farre forth
thou dost liue as thou art sanctified. As
health is in the body, so is holines in the
soule: a body without health fals out of
one paine into another, till it dye: and so
a soule without holines is polluted with
one lust after another, till it dye.</p>
                  <p>Our Sanctification must be both in
Soule and Body:<note place="margin">Wee must sanctifie both body and soule to the Lord.</note> it is not enough to
cleanse the hands, feet, eyes, and tongue,
but we must goe yet further, and be peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in heart: for blessed are the pure in
heart, such shall receiue the blessing.</p>
                  <p>We must consider in this worke of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,<note place="margin">What is required to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</note>
from the direction of Gods
word, whether our thoughts, words and
workes be cleansed from their inward
and outward corruptions, and that they
be sequestred, and made impropriate to
God: so that if wee haue set our very
thoughts apart to God, then there is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
begun, and then we are meete for
a sanctified vse: so if we be to serue for a
<pb facs="tcp:6758:92"/>
holy vse, wee must not be for when and
for what we list, but taken vp in thought,
word, and deed, to serue the Lord: wee
are not to bestow our thoughts on all
things, but refer them to the Lord me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
or immediately.</p>
                  <p>If our Sanctification be effectually
wrought in vs,<note place="margin">Our san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification must be constant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall.</note> it will be constant and
continuall: so that we shall not deliuer
an holinesse to GOD for a time, or in
some causes, or for some persons, but
we must throughly fulfill the dayes of
our holinesse,<note place="margin">It must not be maymed.</note> not presenting a maymed
holinesse. As in the Law it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to offer a lame or maymed beast,
though it wanted but the tayle, which
was a small thing; yea, euen for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Lord refused it.</p>
                  <p>There are many professors vvhich
would needes be men sanctified, but they
are loath to be cleansed. Others when
they cannot away with this strictnesse
to continue say on this manner; Let vs
prepare riuers of sinne, for Christ shed
streames of bloud, the more we sinne, the
greater glory will come to Christ. And
thus they stand at a stay, their holinesse
<pb facs="tcp:6758:92"/>
is a standing holinesse, it fils not<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> they
still lye in their pollutions: their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is but from the house to the Church,
and from the Church home againe; and
at the yeeres end they are as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
like a horse in a mill, that makes
many circuits, from Morning till Night,
and then is but where he was at first.</p>
                  <p>From Sanctification ariseth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;<note place="margin">From san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification ariseth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note>
for a man cannot hate his sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be sanctified, &amp; he cannot truely
repent for them before he hate them.</p>
                  <p>Repentance is a constant returning
from all sinne vnto God,<note place="margin">What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is.</note> or an inward
sorrowing and continuall mourning for
sinne, ioyned with faith and humiliation,
and both inward and outward amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
inward, in changing the thoughts
and affections of the heart, and outward,
in changing the words and workes, from
euill to good: I say it is a turning, not
from one sinne vnto another, as from
whoredome to theft, and the like, neither
is Repentance euery sorrow, but sorrow
for sinne: not for some sinne, but for all
sinne: not for an houre but for euer.
Euery sorrow is not repentance, for so
<pb facs="tcp:6758:93"/>
should worldlings repent: euery pant for
sinne is not repentance, so should <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
repent: all weeping and lamenting
is not repentance, so should <hi>Esau, Iudas,</hi>
and <hi>Caine,</hi> repent: euery little humbling
of our soules is not repentance, for so
should <hi>Ahab</hi> repent: all good wordes
and good purposes is not repentance, for
so should euery sicke man repent: euery
cry to God for mercy is not repentance,
for so should euery foole repent.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it may appeare what repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is,<note place="margin">Many are deceiued in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> as also how many are deceiued
in repentance; and therfore that we may
the better try our repentance, let vs
know that repentance is when a man
turnes to GOD,<note place="margin">How to try our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> and brings forth fruits
worthy amendement of life.</p>
                  <p>This turning to God hath two parts;
the first is a purpose of heart and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
neuer to sinne any more, but to
leade a new life: the second is an holy
endeauour and labour in mans life and
conuersation to purifie and cleanse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from sinne: for a man must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
and come to an vtter disliking of
his owne sinne, before he will turne from
<pb facs="tcp:6758:93"/>
them and leaue them.</p>
                  <p>By this it may appeare that there is
one manner of sinning in the godly, and
another in the vngodly, though they
fall both into one sinne.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man when hee sinneth,<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the godly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in one and the same sinne.</note> in
his heart hee giueth full consent to the
sinne, but the godly, though they fall
into the same sinne with the wicked, yet
they neuer giue full consent: for they are
in their vvills, mindes, and affections,
partly regenerate, and partly vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and therefore their wils doe partly
will, and partly abhorre that which is
euill, according to that of <hi>Paul, Rom.
7.</hi> 22. And that the Godly man neuer
giueth full consent to sinne, it is euident
by three tokens.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> before he come to doe the sinne
hee hath no purpose or desire to doe it,
but his purpose and desire is to doe the
will of God, contrary to that sinne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in the act or doing of the sinne,
his hart riseth against it, yet by the force
of temptation, and by the mighty vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the flesh hee is exhaled on, and
pulled to doe wickednesse. Thirdly, after
<pb facs="tcp:6758:94"/>
he hath sinned, he is sore displeased with
himselfe for it and truely repenteth.</p>
                  <p>A manifest example hereof wee haue
in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas: Peter</hi> before the
denying of his Maister had no purpose
so to doe, but rather to dye in his cause:
in the act, he had a striuing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as appeares, by this, that first hee
answered faintly, <hi>I know not what thou
sayest,</hi> and yet after, when the assault of
Sathan more preuayled, he fell to swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
cursing, and banning; after his
fall, he repented and wept bitterly for it:
all was contrary in <hi>Iudas,</hi> who went with
a full intent to betray his Maister, for the
Diuell made him yeeld &amp; fully consent
to doe it, hauing long tempted him vnto
it, and entred into him: afterwards when
Christ was betrayed, <hi>Iudas</hi> was not sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
for his sin with godly sorrow, but
in a dispayre of mercy hung himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Although this which hath beene said
may be sufficient to proue our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">Seauen signes of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note>
whether true or false, good or bad:
yet to make it more apparant, consider
seauen special signes, set downe by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,<note place="margin">The first is Care.</note>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. The first is, care; Euery
<pb facs="tcp:6758:94"/>
one that hath a godly sorrow, and true
repentance, is not sloathfull but diligent;
not carelesse, but carefull to auoid all
sin as well as any one: as also he is most
carefull to doe that which is good, not
for feare, but for loue; not because man
but because God commandeth.</p>
                  <p>The second is,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is a clearing of our selues.</note> a clearing of our selues,
that is to say, when a man hath the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of sinne, and shunneth it, and Sathan
accusing him, he cannot abide and beare
that accusation, but is disquieted till hee
haue gotten pardon of his sinne, with
as much earnestnesse as for the most
waightiest thing in the world, confessing
the action and inditement, and desiring
the pardon of it, by which hee may be
able to answere his accusers.</p>
                  <p>The third is Indignation,<note place="margin">The third is Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> making
men angry against those sinnes which
before they liked: yea, to be out of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
vvith themselues, that they vvere
such wretches, and so carelesse to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-taken
with them, and to take on, as
it were, with themselues, that they haue
slipped into such sins: for true godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
doth euer bring such Indignation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:95"/>
The fourth is Feare,<note place="margin">The fourth is Feare.</note> that is, an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fearing sinne, because it is sinne, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to offend God because of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and goodnesse, and benefits receiued,
not flying or departing from God, but
drawing neerer vnto him when they
haue offended him.</p>
                  <p>The fift is a Desire,<note place="margin">The fift is Desire.</note> which is a feruent
affection to God and his word &amp; to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and heauenly things. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in the example of the Iaylor, who
after he was smitten with sorrow and true
repentance, came with this note to <hi>Paul,</hi>
saying, <hi>What shall I doe to be saued?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sixt is Zeale,<note place="margin">The sixt is Zeale.</note> which maketh men
zealous for God and his worship, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of pietie and good workes, not to
doe them carelesly and negligently, but
it maketh them doe (though with great
labour and cost, yea danger and hazard)
those things which they see they ought
to doe.</p>
                  <p>The seauenth is Reuenge,<note place="margin">The sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth is Reuenge.</note> that is, the
penitent man is so offended with the sin
hee hath committed, that hee will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged
of himselfe for it, as for example,
if hee haue offended in gluttony, he will
<pb facs="tcp:6758:95"/>
reuenge himselfe by fasting two or three
daies after; if he haue offended in whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
hee will be reuenged of his lusts
by bewayling of them euer after: and so
of other sinnes. By these it may appeare
what true repentance is.</p>
                  <p>In whomsoeuer true Repentance is
thus found, it euer proceedeth from a
true and iustifying Faith: for none can
repent or practise this duety of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but those vvho haue Faith and
Grace: without Faith it is impossible to
please God. I will therefore first declare
vvhat Faith is: Secondly, the tryall of
Faith: Thirdly, the fruits of Faith: and
lastly, how Faith is kept.</p>
                  <p>Faith is a wonderfull grace of Gods
Spirit,<note place="margin">What Faith is.</note> whereby the elect doe apprehend
and apply Christ and all his benefits vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselues particularly.</p>
                  <p>To make tryall in our selues whether
our Faith be true and sound or not:<note place="margin">Try it tvvo waies.</note> This
will appeare two wayes: first, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and degrees of the workes of
the Spirit, which goe before a true and
liuely Faith; which be three: first, a true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
sight of our sinne, with an apprehension
<pb facs="tcp:6758:96"/>
of the wrath of GOD for the same. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a true sorrow and griefe of heart
for offending God by these our sinnes:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and lastly, an hungring and thirsting
after the mercy and grace of GOD in
Christ, aboue all worldly things: where
these things are, there is grace; but where
these things are wanting, there is no true
faith, but presumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, faith wil appeare by the work
of loue; for in loue will saith bring forth
all the duties of the Morall Law, both to
God and man: for faith worketh by loue,
and loue is the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Further,<note place="margin">A further tryall.</note> for the tryall of our Faith,
Christ tels vs that the more we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
with worldly cares, the lesse is
our beliefe in God; for distrustfull care
comes from vnbeliefe in Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the lesse we trust in God for
temporall things, the lesse doe wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
eternall mercies, for the same faith
layes hold on both: but if we can truely
depend vpon God for temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
in the sober vse of lawfull meanes,
then wee shall relie vpon his mercy for
the saluation of our soules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:96"/>
This tryall is not made in prosperitie,<note place="margin">The tryall of our faith is not made in the time of prosperity.</note>
for when God sends aboundance, euery
one will trust in him, but vvhen vvant
comes then is tryall of thy faith: if then
thou relie on God, though meanes fayle,
thy faith is strong, but if thy heart be
opprest vvith sorrow and feare, and
thou make no conscience of vnlawfull
meanes, then suspect thy selfe, thy faith is
none at all: for the Iust shall liue by faith.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of faith,<note place="margin">Our vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vvith Christ.</note> and the tryall
thereof: now follow the fruits and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
thereof. By meanes of this speciall
faith the elect are truely ioyned vnto
Christ,<note place="margin">Three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall benefits had by our vnion vvith Christ.</note> and haue a heauenly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
vvith him, and therefore doe in
some measure feele his holy spirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and stirring in them.</p>
                  <p>The elect being thus ioyned to
Christ,<note place="margin">What Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is.</note> there ariseth three wonderfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
from it: Iustification, Adoption,
and Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>Iustificationn is,<note place="margin">From Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification arises di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits both outvvard and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard.</note> when the elect being
in themselues rebellious sinners, and
Gods owne enemies, yet by Christ they
are accepted of the Lord, as perfectly
pure and righteous before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:97"/>
From true Iustification proceedeth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> many other benefits: the first is Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,<note place="margin">Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</note>
by vvhich a man Iustified is
perfectly reconciled to God, because his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sinne is done away, and hee is perfectly
arayed with the righteousnes of Christ:<note place="margin">Afflictions are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments for sinne but father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>
the second is, that afflictions to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
are no punishments for sin, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fatherly and louing chastisements: for
the guilt and punishment of sinne vvas
boren in Christ; now therefore if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
be afflicted it is no punishment: for
then God should punish one fault twice,
once in Christ, and the second time vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Christian, which thing doth not
agree with Gods Iustice: the third is, that
the man Iustified doth merit and deserue
at Gods hands the kingdome of heauen:
for being made perfectly righteous in
CHRIST, and by his righteousnesse, he
must needs merit eternall life, in and by
the merit of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Inward benefits proceeding from
Iustification are those which are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
felt in the heart, and serue for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
assurance of Iustification, and they
are cheifly foure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:97"/>
The first is, peace of conscience, arising <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
from this perswasion,<note place="margin">Peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> that his sinnes are
freely pardoned, &amp; the wrath of God ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeased by the merit and suffering of
Christ Iesus, by a liuely faith applyed.</p>
                  <p>The second is, enterance into Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,<note place="margin">Enterance vvith boldnes into Gods presence.</note>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and a preseuerance in it, vvhich is
indeed a vvonderfull benefit, vvhen a
man, that is freely pardoned and iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in Christ, doth boldly, approch to
Gods presence, and they are ready to
aske and sue and also to obtaine any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that is their good.</p>
                  <p>The third is, a spirituall Ioy in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
hearts,<note place="margin">A spiritual Ioy in the heart.</note> euen then when they are afflicted,
because they looke certainly to obtaine
the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, that the loue of God is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
shed in the hearts of the faithfull by the
holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Feeling of Gods loue.</note> that is, that the holy Ghost
doth make the faithfull very euidently
feele the loue of God towards them, and
doth as it were fill their hearts with it.</p>
                  <p>In whomsoeuer these singular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
are thus to be found,<note place="margin">The graces of God &amp; his spirit are not seuered.</note> there is euer to
be found assuredly that the spirit of God
dwelleth in them, and in that the spirit
<pb facs="tcp:6758:98"/>
of God dwelleth in them, it imports not
onely a familiar presence, but also a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
thereof: hee dwels not for a
month, as a guest for a Night, but for
euer: how euer by temporall distractions
he humble vs, yet shall he neuer depart
from that soule vvhich once hee hath
sanctified to be his owne habitation: and
this comfort is confirmed to vs by three
sure arguments.</p>
                  <p>The first is taken from the Nature of
God:<note place="margin">3 Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to proue that the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are sure of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance.</note> hee is faithfull, saith the Apostle,
by whom we are called to the fellowship
of his sonne, who will conserue vs to the
end, and againe, saith he, I am perswaded
that hee which hath begun his good
worke in you,<note place="margin">First, from the nature of God, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets vs.</note> will performe it, vntill the
day of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The second argument is taken from
the nature of that life which Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth
to his members,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, from the nature of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</note> it is no more
subiect to death: we know that Christ rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from the dead, dyes no more: this life
is communicated to vs, for it is not wee
that liue, but Christ that liues in vs.</p>
                  <p>The third is taken from the nature of
that seed whereof wee are begotten:<note place="margin">The third, from the nature of that seede vvhereof we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</note> for
<pb facs="tcp:6758:98"/>
as the seede is, so is the life that comes of
it: now the seed saith the Apostle is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;
<hi>Wee are borne anew, not of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
seed, but immortall;</hi> our life therefore
is immortall.</p>
                  <p>As the first greatest question in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is concerning the Sauiour of the
world,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond main question in religion is, who are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 3. so the second is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them who are to be saued: if the
iudgement be referred to man, euery
man accompts himselfe a Christian; if
iudgement be sought for from the Lord,
hee giues an Answere to all, <hi>If any man
haue not the Spirit of Christ, the same is
not his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby euery Christian may haue a
notable rule how to try his owne estate:<note place="margin">A soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne rule whereby Christians of all sorts must bee tryed.</note>
for to destroy the pride of all their glory,
(with one word) who esteeme somewhat
better of themselues for the priuiledge
of their estate, when they excell others,
here it is said, <hi>Rom. 8. 9. If any man,</hi> he
speakes without exception, be what thou
wilt beside, neuer so noble, neuer so rich,
neuer so learned, if thou hast not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ, thou art none of his.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we see that Christ and his spirit
<pb facs="tcp:6758:99"/>
cannot be sundred: let no man say hee
hath Christ, except he haue the spirit of
Christ: hee is not a man who hath not a
soule, so hee is not a Christian who hath
not the spirit of Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 13. And
as CHRIST and his spirit cannot be
sundred, so cannot the spirit be sundred
from the fruits of the spirit. Now the
fruits of the spirit, are Loue, Ioy, Peace,
long suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse,
faith, meekenesse, temperance: if the
spirit of Christ dwell in vs, and if we liue
in the spirit, let vs walke in the spirit: and
this may be a conuiction to carnall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
that while they say the spirit of
Christ is in them, they declare none of
his fruits in their liues and conuersations.</p>
                  <p>We are to know that the operations of
the spirit are two-fold;<note place="margin">The ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the spirit are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> the one is general,
and the common operation which hee
hath in the wicked, for hee illuminates
euery one that commeth into the world.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That <hi>Caiaphas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Externall, common to all men.</note> and <hi>Saul</hi> can prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and <hi>Iudas</hi> can Preach, it is from him:
this way hee worketh in the wicked, not
for any good to them, but for aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his owne worke: the other
<pb facs="tcp:6758:99"/>
kind of the holy ghosts operation is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
&amp; proper to the godly, by which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
doth not onely illuminate their mindes,<note place="margin">Internall, proper to the godly.</note>
but proceedes also to their hearts, and
workes this three-fold effect in it, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
Intercession &amp; Consolation.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">3 Effects wrought by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spirit in the godly.</note> he is vnto them a spirit of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
renewing their hearts by his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
grace: he first rebukes them of
sinne, awakes their consciences by the
sight thereof, and giues them a sence of
that wrath which sinne hath deserued;
whereof arises heauines of heart, sadnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in their countenance,<note place="margin">Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> lamentation in
their speech, &amp; such an alteration in their
vvhole behauiour, that their former
pleasure becomes painefull vnto them,
and others who knew them before, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to see such a change in them.</p>
                  <p>From this he leades them to a sight of
Gods mercy in Christ, he inflames their
hearts vvith an hunger and thirst for
that mercy, and workes in their hearts
such a loue of righteousnesse, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of sinne, that now they become
more affrayd of the occasions of sinne,
then they were before of sinne it selfe:
<pb facs="tcp:6758:100"/>
This resistance of sinne, and care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
the occasions of sin, are vndoubted
testimonies that Christ dwels in vs.</p>
                  <p>This is the first operation of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but it is not all, he proceedes further
by degrees: for the kingdome of God is
as if a man should cast seed into the earth,
which growes vp hee cannot tell how:
first, it sends forth the blade; secondly,
the eares, &amp; then the corne: so proceeds
the kingdom of God in man by degrees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the second place, the holy spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a spirit of Intercession:<note place="margin">Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> so long as
we are bound with the cord of our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
we cannot pray, but when hee
looseth vs from our sinnes, hee openeth
our mouth to God, hee teacheth vs to
pray, not onely with sighes and fobs
which cannot bee expressed, but also
puts words in our mouthes, such as wee
our selues who speaks them are not able
to repeate them againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And thirdly, he becomes vnto them
the Spirit of Consolation:<note place="margin">Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> if he be vnto
thee a sanctifier and intercessor, he shall
not faile at last to be thy comforter: if at
first, after thou hast sent vp supplications
<pb facs="tcp:6758:100"/>
thou finde not his consolation descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon thee, be not discouraged, but
be more humbled: for our sin shortens
his arme, and the hardnes of heart holds
out his comforts: wee must fall downe
with <hi>Mary,</hi> and lye still washing the feete
of Christ with our teares, before he takes
vs vp in his armes to kisse vs: and if wee
finde these effects of his grace going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the humiliation of the heart,<note place="margin">That chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian vvho hath Gods spirit knowes he hath him.</note> &amp; the
grace of prayer, we may be out of doubt
that this consolation shall follow after.</p>
                  <p>By this it is euident, that he that hath
the spirit of Iesus knowes that hee hath
him: and herein consisteth the chiefe
glory of a Christian,<note place="margin">It is the glory of a Christian that Christ dwels in him.</note> that he hath such a
guest to abide with him for euer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
vnspeakeable blessings are vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
vnto him.</p>
                  <p>First, where this holy spirit comes to
dwell,<note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that come by Christs dwelling in vs.</note> he repayres the lodging: man by
nature being like to a ruinated pallace,
is restored by the grace of Christ: as to
the soule the Lord stirres vp new lights
in the minde, restores life to the heart,
communicates holinesse to the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so that vvhereas before the soule
<pb facs="tcp:6758:101"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vvas an habitation for vncleane spirits,
that is,<note place="margin">Repayres the lodge.</note> defiled with all sorts of vilde and
vncleane affections, the Lord Iesus hath
sanctified it to be a holy habitation to
himselfe: the body is repayred partly
vvhen the members thereof are made
weapons of righteousnes in this life, and
partly in deliuering them from mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
vvhich shalbe done in the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe by his dwelling in vs we haue
the benefit of prouision: hee vvill neuer
suffer vs to vvant any thing that shalbe
good for vs,<note place="margin">Prouides all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> he is not burthenable, after
the manner of earthly Kings, but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is with him.</p>
                  <p>We may further consider those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
benefits that vvee haue by the spirit
of Christ dwelling in vs:<note place="margin">3 Three speciall comforts by Christs dvvelling in vs.</note> first hee giues
life to the soule, and makes it to liue the
life of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. secondly, when
soule and body are sandred by death, he
leades the soule to liue with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
and thirdly, he casts not off the care of
the body, but preserueth the very dust
and ashes thereof till the day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:
O what a kindnesse is it that
the Lord will honour the dead bodyes
<pb facs="tcp:6758:101"/>
of his children!</p>
                  <p>Surely there was neuer a house so well
paid for in the world: O how happy is he
who hath such a guest to dwell with him:
vvhat recompence hast thou to looke
for? he dwells with thee on earth, thou
shalt dwell with him in heauen; he a few
yeeres with thee, thou with him for euer.</p>
                  <p>The second maine benefit arising from
our vnion with CHRIST,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond maine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</note> is Adoption,
whereby they which are iustified are also
accounted of God as his owne children.</p>
                  <p>From Adoption proceeds many other
benefits:<note place="margin">From A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption proceedes many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</note> first, the elect childe of God is
hereby made a brother of Christ: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he is a King, &amp; the kingdome of
heauen is his inheritance: thirdly, hee is
LORD ouer all creatures saue Angels:
fourthly, the holy Angels minister vnto
him for his good: fiftly, all things, yea,
grieuous afflictions, &amp; sin it selfe, turne to
his good, though in it owne nature it be
neuer so hurtfull: and lastly, being thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted,
hee may looke for comfort at
Gods hands answerable to the measure
of his afflictions, as God hath promised.</p>
                  <p>The inward assurance of Adoption
<pb facs="tcp:6758:102"/>
is by two witnesses:<note place="margin">The assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption by two notes.</note> the first, is our spirit,
which being often feeble and faint, God
hath giuen vs of his owne spirit to be a
fellow-witnesse with our spirit: this testi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony
of the holy Ghost is best discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the time of tryal, &amp; at the houre of
death, which a reprobate cannot haue at
all, though indeed a man flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and the diuell imitating the spirit of
God, doth vsually perswade carnall men
and hipocrits that they shalbe saued. But
that Diuellish illusion, and the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the spirit, may be discerned by
two notes.</p>
                  <p>The first is,<note place="margin">The first is, feruent prayer.</note> feruent and hearty prayer
to God, in the name of Christ: for the
same spirit that testifieth vnto vs that we
are the adopted children of God, doth
also make vs cry, that is, feruently, with
sighes and groanes, pray to God: now
this feruent praying, can the Diuell giue
to no Hipocrite, for it is the speciall
worke of the spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>The second is,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, a Filliall loue.</note> they which haue this
speciall testimony, haue also in their
hearts the same affections to God which
children haue to their father: namely,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:102"/>
Loue, Feare, Reuerence, Obedience,
Thankefulnesse, and the like: for they
call not vpon God as vpon a terrible
Iudge, but they cry <hi>Abba,</hi> that is, father:
and these affections they haue not
whom Sathan deludeth with a fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
imagination of their saluation.</p>
                  <p>The third maine benefit is,<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the third maine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</note> inward san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
by vvhich a Christian in his
minde, in his will, and in his affections, is
freed from the bondage of sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and is by little and little inabled by
the spirit of Christ to discerne &amp; approue
that which is good, and to walke in it.</p>
                  <p>Now this Sanctification is through
the whole man, in the spirit, soule, and
mind.<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde.</note> The sanctification of the mind is
the inlightning of it with the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods word: it is of two sorts,
eyther spirituall vnderstanding, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
wisedome.</p>
                  <p>Spirituall vnderstanding is a generall
conceiuing of euery thing that is to be
done,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveene spirituall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> or not done, out of Gods word.</p>
                  <p>Spirituall wisedome is a speciall grace
of Gods spirit, peculiar only to the elect,
whereby a man is able to vnderstand out
<pb facs="tcp:6758:103"/>
of Gods word, what is to be done, or not
to be done in any particular things or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to the circumstances of
the person, time, and place: the principall
point of this wisedome is to determine
of true happinesse, whereunto the whole
life of man ought to be directed: which
happinesse is the loue and fauour of God
in Christ.</p>
                  <p>To obtaine this heauenly wisedome
we must be carefull of these two things:<note place="margin">How to get true wisedome.</note>
first, to get the Feare of God into our
hearts: which is a reuerent awe of the
heart towards GOD,<note place="margin">What the Feare of God is.</note> whereby a man is
fearefull to offend, and carefull to please
God in all things: &amp; this we shall get if we
receiue the word of God with reuerence,<note place="margin">How to obtaine it.</note>
and apply it to our owne soules when we
heare it, trembling thereat vvhen it
toucheth our consciences, and humbly
submitting our selues vnto it, vvithout
raging or repining: secondly, wee must
close vp the eyes of our mindes, that is,
we must deny our owne wisedome, and
suffer our selues in all things to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
and ordered by the written word
of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:103"/>
To walke in the course of our liues by
this heauenly vvisedome,<note place="margin">How to walke wisely.</note> wee must in
euery good action obserue these foure
Rules: first, the thing wee doe must be
iust: secondly, the meanes of effecting it
must also be iust: thirdly, we must keepe
our selues therein within the lymits and
compas of our calling: fourthly, we must
doe the thing with an honest and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
heart, and for this purpose we must
alwayes heare the word of God, to tell
vs what is iust.</p>
                  <p>The sanctification of the Memory is,<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Memory.</note>
when it can both keepe and remember
that which is good &amp; agreeable to Gods
will, where as naturally it best remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
lewdnesse, wickednesse, and vanity.</p>
                  <p>Sanctification of the Conscience may
be discerned by this,<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> that it checkes for
the least sins, before actuall repentance
be performed, and likewise approues our
vpright walking in the whole course of
our life: it procures peace with God and
with man, so farre as it is profitable &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
and breedes contentment in the
life, in all occasions it procures cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the countenance, and readinesse
<pb facs="tcp:6758:104"/>
in all our businesse it makes vs couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the truth, and willing to defend
the same, it makes vs victorious in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and ready to yeeld vp our liues into
the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>Sanctification of the Will is descerned
hereby,<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Will.</note> that it is so far forth freed from
sin, that it can will and chuse that which
is good and acceptable to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
that which is euill: it is further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by our cheerefulnesse in well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not by compulsion, but of a willing
minde, by resisting as well the occasions,
as sinne it selfe, and by yeelding to sinne
with griefe, rising by repentance out of
the same.</p>
                  <p>Sanctification of the affections are
knowne by this,<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Affections.</note> that they are moued and
inclined to that which is good to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, and in that wee can more ioy or
grieue for spirituall causes then carnall;
that they tend to the crucifying of the
flesh, and building forward of the new
man, and are not commonly affected
and stirred with that which is euill, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be to eschew it.</p>
                  <p>Amongst these sanctified affections,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:104"/>
foure especially are to be marked:<note place="margin">Of our sanctified affections especially foure to be marked.</note> first,
Zeale of Gods glory, by which a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is thus affected, that rather then God
should lose his glory, hee could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to haue his owne soule damned,
as it was with <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 32. 12. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zeale of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is, the feare of God: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it a man cannot be vvise: it is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
first step to vvisedome. In this feare of
God their be two parts:<note place="margin">Feare of God.</note> the first is, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of heart that we are in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
the second is, that being in Gods
presence, we stand in awe of him, which
is when a man takes heed to his wayes,
lest he offend God.</p>
                  <p>The third is, the hatred of sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
it is sinne,<note place="margin">Hatred of sinne.</note> and especially of a mans
owne corruptions, wherewith a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is so turmoyled, that in regard of
them, and for no other cause, he desireth
to be out of this most miserable world,
that he may leaue to displease God.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, Ioy of heart, in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of the neerenesse of the terrible
day of Iudgement and second comming
of Christ:<note place="margin">Reioycing at the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in regard whereof they shall lift
<pb facs="tcp:6758:105"/>
vp their heads, because the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of their redemption is at hand</p>
                  <p>The sanctification of the body is,<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body.</note> when
all the members of it are carefully kept
and preserued from being meanes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
any sinne<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and are made the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of righteousnesse: for euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is to be kept pure and holy.</p>
                  <p>To maintaine and keepe a true and
iustifying faith (by vvhich wee are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Christ,<note place="margin">How to keepe faith.</note> and thereby inioy all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings)
is to maintaine true religion, both
in life and death, and for this end these
rules must be remembred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, we must haue in our hearts sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
loue to God in Christ, to his Church
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and true religion: secondly, we must not
onely know and beleeue that Christ died
for our sinnes, and rose againe for our
iustification, but we must labour to feele
the power and efficacie of his death kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
sin in vs, and the vertue of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
raising vs vp to newnesse of life:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thirdly, wee must not content our selues
to know and professe that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but withall we must take obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his louing fauour towards vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:105"/>
adding one obseruation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so our hearts may be grounded in
the loue of God.</p>
                  <p>Because there is nothing that doth
more euidently distinguish between the
regenerate and vnregenerate man, then
such fruits as each of them doe vsually
bring forth in their liues and conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I will therefore shew the vertues of
the one, and the vices of the other, with
their seuerall discriptions: whereby eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man may perceiue in what estate hee
stands, whether the childe of God, or the
childe of the Diuell, whether in the state
of grace, or in the state of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The graces of GODS spirit euer in
some measure appearing in the childe of
God effectually called, iustified, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
are: Loue, Mercy, Meekenesse, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Humilitie, long-suffering, Peace.</p>
                  <p>Loue,<note place="margin">What loue is.</note> is properly an affection of the
heart, which bindes vs to loue God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee hath loued vs, and to doe vnto
men as we would be done vnto, or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
one man is well pleased with another.
Now our loue to God must appeare by
the effects thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:106"/>
First,<note place="margin">The first property of loue, it longs to obtaine that which is beloued.</note> it is the nature of loue, that it
earnestly desires and seekes to obtaine
that vvhich is beloued: hereby thou
shalt know whether thy affection of loue
be ordered by Christ, or remaine as yet
disordered by Sathan.</p>
                  <p>The affection which Christ hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
vvill follow vpward, seeking to be
there where he is: so carnall loue will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
miserable man captiued to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles
pit of hell: but holy loue being as
a sparkle of heauenly fire kindled in our
harts by the holy Ghost, ascends conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
towards God from whom it came
not suffering vs to rest till we inioy it.</p>
                  <p>The second tryall of our loue is Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond effect is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>
and an holy care in all our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to serue and honour the Lord.</p>

experience proues that euery louer
bestoweth bountifully on that which he
loueth.</p>
                  <p>The fourth tryall of loue is readinesse
to suffer affliction for the cause of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the farther tryall of our loue, let
vs consider vvhat our Sauiour Christ
saith,</hi> Math. 5. 44. I say vnto you, loue your
<pb facs="tcp:6758:106"/>
enemies; blesse them that curse you; doe
good to them that hate you, and pray for
them that hurt and persecute you.</p>
                  <p>The loue here commanded,<note place="margin">How to loue our enemies.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
these two things: first, to be
louingly affected in heart towards an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie:
secondly, to be louingly affected
in speach &amp; action. For the first: loue in
heart comprehendeth all good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that one man beareth to another,
as mercy, compassion, meekenesse, and
desire to doe him good: for the second,
it is set out vnto vs in three branches:
first, <hi>blesse them that curse you:</hi> vvhere is
commended all good speach, both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and of our enemies: secondly, <hi>doe
good to them that hate you:</hi> where is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
all louing vsage in action, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
all the helpe and comfort vvee
can: thirdly, <hi>pray for them that persecute
you:</hi> that is, for their good estate in this
life, so farre forth as it serueth for Gods
glory, and for their conuersion, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>For the affection of the heart,<note place="margin">Examples of loue.</note> take
Christs example, who so loued his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that he shed his owne heart bloud
<pb facs="tcp:6758:107"/>
for their saluation. For loue in courteous

and when the King of <hi>Israell</hi> would

                     </note>
the Prophets, and <hi>Steuen,</hi> vvho
prayed for them that put him to death.</p>
                  <p>Mercy,<note place="margin">What Mercy is.</note> is an holy compassion of the
hart, whereby one man is moued to help
another in his misery: first, I call it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of heart, because it makes one
man to put on the person of another, &amp;
to be grieued for the miserie of another,<note place="margin">The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note>
as if it were his owne: secondly, it is called
<pb facs="tcp:6758:107"/>
the bowels of compassion, because when
a mans heart is touched therewith, his
very Lyuer and intrailes doe stirre in his
body, and are troubled in him: thirdly,
this vertue of mercy moueth the heart
to helpe another that is in miserie: for
helpe in misery is a notable fruit of true
compassion, neither can they be seuered,
for in the compassion of the heart, and
in the act of reliefe stands true Mercy.</p>
                  <p>The duties of Mercy are answerable
to mans misery:<note place="margin">The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mercy.</note> now mans miserie is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in soule or body: the greatest mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of man are in his soule as ignorance,
impenitency, and trouble of conscience.
Mans bodily miseries are sicknes, thirst,
nakednesse, and the like: and to these
the workes of Mercy are answerable:
Mercy towards the Soule is when a man
is carefull for the saluation of another,
vsing meanes to bring a man from spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
darkenesse vnto light, from the
power of Sathan to God; from the estate
of sinne and danger of Hell-fire, to the
state of grace, in true faith &amp; repentance,
and so eternall life: and looke how far the
soule is more excellent then the body,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:108"/>
so farre doth this vvorke exceede any
vvorke of Mercy that concernes the
body: Mercy towards the body is called
almes, or releefe, whereby a mans out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard
necessity, for foode, rayment, or
such like, is supplied.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it may appeare who is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
man:<note place="margin">Who is a mercifull man.</note> namely, such a one as hath
his heart touched vvith compassion
towards the misery of another &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is moued to help and releeue him in
soule and body, according to his estate:
and such a man is blessed by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Christ himselfe, howsoeuer in the
vvorld he may be dispised.</p>
                  <p>To moue vs to this duty,<note place="margin">Motiues to mercie.</note> let vs marke
these things: first, the state of the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is here pronounced blessed of Christ:
secondly, mercy is a gift of the spirit,
and the grace of Gods elect, vvhich al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
accompanyeth the happy estate
of those that be in Christ: thirdly, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
vve become like vnto God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father: fourthly, hereby wee are
made Instruments of GODS mercy to
them that be in misery.</p>
                  <p>For the furtherance of vs in this so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:6758:108"/>
a duty,<note place="margin">Rules for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Mercy.</note> we must obserue certaine
Rules. First, wee must exercise three of
our Senses: Seeing, Hearing, and Feeling,
in other mens miseries. For seeing, <hi>Deut.
15.</hi> 9. we must be very wary it grieue vs
not to looke vpon our poore brother,<note place="margin">1 Rule.</note>
but wee must see and behold his misery
&amp; distres, whether it be in soule or body:
this is the Lords practise, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7. 9. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
if we cannot come to see a mans
misery, then we must be content to here
of it, and giue heed and credit to the true
reports that others make thereof to vs:
this was the practise of <hi>Nehemiah: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.
1.</hi> 3. 4. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. 5. Thirdly, for Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
if the Lord shall afflict our bodies
with sicknes, or our soules with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wee must be willing to suffer the
same patiently, that thereby wee may be
fitted to take more compassion vpon
others in like case, and to comfort them
the better, this did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Rule.</note> we must make our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
callings wherein we liue, the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of mercy, and in doing the duties
thereof shew forth compassion towards
others: first, the Maiestrate must rule and
<pb facs="tcp:6758:109"/>
gouerne in mercy: secondly, the Minister
must Preach in mercy: thirdly, euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
man must make the duties of his
calling, workes of mercy; the rich man
must know himselfe to be, not a Lord,
but a steward of GODS blessings, and
therefore must imploy the same in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
by giuing &amp; lending vnto the poore
freely, as God shall minister vnto him
iust occasion. The Trades man must buy
and sell in mercy, dealing iustly with the
rich, and shewing liberality to the poore.
The Maister must thus in mercy vse the
labour of his Seruant; and the Seruant
thus in mercy doe seruice to his Maister,
for conscience towards God: and happy
were it with all estates if this rule of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
were obserued, the want whereof is
the bane of all societies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Rule.</note> for the more chearefull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of mercy, wee must lay aside some
part of our goods, for the releefe of them
that be in misery: many are giuen to
great excesse in fare, and attyre, but they
may doe well to abate somewhat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to bestow it on the poore: for hereby
will the rest be sanctified to their more
<pb facs="tcp:6758:109"/>
free and comfortable vse. Nay in case of
necessity wee ought to sequester some
part of our necessaries, for the refreshing
of the poore; so did the Church of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
giue aboue their power to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of the afflicted brethren. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2.</p>
                  <p>Meekenesse is a gift of Gods spirit,<note place="margin">What Meeknesse is.</note>
whereby a man doth moderate his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of anger, and bridle in himselfe
impatience,<note place="margin">The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> hatred, &amp; desire of reuenge:
it is a vertue, whereby a man is gentle in
behauiour towards all persons, both
good and bad, it makes a man with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and a quiet heart to beare GODS
Iudgements, and to put vp iniuries, and
to beare wrongs, when occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
is giuen him.</p>
                  <p>Meekenesse is not to be shewed in the
matters of God,<note place="margin">Wherein meeknesse must not be shewed.</note> when his glory is impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
for therein we must haue Zeale as
hote as fire: but in the wrongs and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that concerne our selues. <hi>Moses</hi> was
the meekest man on earth in his time,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 5. 3. and yet when the Israelits
had made a golden Calfe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19.
in Zeale of Gods glory, hee brake the
two tables of stone, and put to sword the
<pb facs="tcp:6758:110"/>
same day two thousand men that had so
dishonoured God: the like we see in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Psal.</hi> 119. 139. and in our Sauiour
Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 12.</p>
                  <p>The ground or cause of meekenesse
is affliction and pouerty of spirit:<note place="margin">The cause of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> for,
hardly can hee be meeke and patient in
spirit, that hath not beene acquainted
with the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>To induce vs vnto this vertue,<note place="margin">Motiues to meeknesse.</note> let vs
first consider Christs precept and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
bidding vs to learne of him, for he is
meeke and lowly: againe, consider Gods
own dealing with vs, we daily wrong him
with our offences, and yet he beares with
vs: lastly, the fruition and practise of this
grace hath the promise of blessednes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it, and therefore as we vvould
be happy, so we must get into our hearts
the spirit of meekenesse, and expresse the
vertue and power thereof in our liues.</p>
                  <p>Patience,<note place="margin">What Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is.</note> is a voluntary and continuall
suffering for the loue of vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
and therefore whatsoeuer hapneth
a wise man, by this vertue he is prepared
to digest &amp; turne it to the best. Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise
it is a grace of the spirit, flowing
<pb facs="tcp:6758:110"/>
from grace and hope: whereby we so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

man doth beare with other mens wants,
as morositie and hastines, and in bearing

<pb facs="tcp:6758:111"/>

                  <p>First peace betweene man and God,<note place="margin">True peace hath sixe heads.</note>
which is properly called reconcilation,
whereby GOD, in Ghrist, is at one with
man, and man, through Christ, is at one
with God: of which when a man is once
perswaded in his heart, then comes this
peace: secondly, peace vvith the good
Angels, for men being at peace vvith
God, then Angels become Seruants and
ministring Spirits vnto them: thirdly,
peace with a mans selfe, consisting of
two things: first, when the conscience
sanctified ceaseth to accuse, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Gods fauour beginneth to take
his part, to excuse and speake for him
before God: secondly, when the Will,
Affection, &amp; Inclinations subiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the enlightened minde: of
which if eyther be wanting, man is at
<pb facs="tcp:6758:112"/>
warre with himselfe, &amp; the peace of God
ruleth not in his heart: fourthly, peace
of true beleeuers amongst themselues,
who before they beleeue, vvere as Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Cockatrises: but now in the
kingdome of Christ haue put off that
sauage nature, and become peaceable:

to haue peace with all men: sixtly,
concord of the enemies themselues with

                  <p>The way to get and keepe true peace
for euer is this:<note place="margin">How to get and keepe true Peace of conscience</note> first, vvee must call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

grow: for when we are at one with
God and man, vve haue a blessed peace,
and hence will follow peace in our owne

world cannot giue, which while wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
we need not feare any euill, no not

                  <p>There are many other vertues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in the Scriptures, which might
here be discribed: but these may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to declare in whom the spirit of
Christ dwelleth: for where Christ dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
by his spirit, there are euer the fruits
of the spirit perceiued; for the spirit and
the effects thereof cannot be sundred: for
euery thing bringeth forth that vvhich
is of his owne nature: fire sendeth forth
nothing but heate, the fountaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but cleere water, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Now that these vertues may the more
apparently shew themselues to bee the
fruits and effects of the spirit in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man: I will therefore set downe
and discribe such vices as commonly
shew forth themselues in the wicked, and
are the fruits and effects of the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate:
for hereby the childe of GOD
renewed by grace, and the vnregenerate
remayning in the state of nature, may as
easily be distinguished, as white from

                  <p>I will first begin with Pride, because,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
as one saith, it may well stand in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:113"/>
sith it is a Maister Diuell, and the
very bane of the soule.</p>
                  <p>Pride is said to be the timpany of the
soule,<note place="margin">What Pride is.</note> because it is a puffing vp of the
heart and minde, proceeding from the
opinion of some good thing in vs more
then in others.</p>
                  <p>His companions are Enuie,<note place="margin">Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pride, fiue.</note> Anger, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
Indignation, Selfe-will, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy.
Pride is full of Enuy, because the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> proud man thinketh himselfe onely the
worthiest, and that euery mans greatnes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is a hinderance to his: it is full of Anger,
supposing himselfe neuer so wel thought
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of as he deserues: full of Impatience, in
that he will not suffer himselfe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,
but will haue his vices accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vertues, &amp; lookes to be commended
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for them: full of Indignation, esteeming
euery man vnworthy of any good that
befalles him, in comparison of himselfe:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> full of Obstinacie, by stifly holding his
owne opinion, notwithstanding any
proofe alledged to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>This sinne of Pride of all other is
the most dangerous,<note place="margin">Pride of all other sins most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> because other
sinnes proceede from euill deedes, but
<pb facs="tcp:6758:113"/>
Pride is to be feared euen in good and
vertuous actions.</p>
                  <p>Of Pride their are nine branches:<note place="margin">Nine branches of Pride.</note>
Presumption, Obstinacy, Hipocrisie,

                  <p>Pride,<note place="margin">How to detest Pride.</note> if we consider the cause thereof,
is momentary and very vncertaine: for if
it proceede from Riches, who knowes
not, that they may be lost in a moment?
If from Nobility or great birth, it may be
stayned: If from knowledge, it is full of
error: If from strength, it may soone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay:
If from Honour, it is but a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
If from Beauty, Age may wrinckle
it: If from good successe, time may alter
it: If from dainty foode, it may breed
surfetting, vvhich commonly bringeth
death: If from clothing, what is it but
skinnes, and wooll, nay the very excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of bruit beasts and stones of the
earth? If from health, sicknesse may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it: If from multitude of friends, are
they not like to vvater brookes that in

frozen? If from sharpnesse of wit, there
is no man liuing but is guilty of folly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:114"/>
The onely and chiefe remedy against
Pride is Humilitie:<note place="margin">How to auoyd Pride.</note> for as by Pride
vve are banished from the presence of
God, so by Humilitie we are recalled to
him againe; because without Humility
no other vertue vvhatsoeuer, is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in his sight.</p>
                  <p>The second maine and capitall sinne
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is Couetousnesse, which we may call the
dropsie of the soule,<note place="margin">What co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes is.</note> because the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man, the more he hath, the more
still he desireth: it is also a kinde of bad

to withholde our owne goods,

                  </p>
                  <p>Of this sinne there are foure sorts: the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first is, to desire that vvhich is another
mans, not caring how we get it, by right
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or wrong: the second is, when vve study
to get mony, wealth or fauour by wicked
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> means: the third is, vvhen vve will not
restore that which vve know to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> mans: the fourth is, when we trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vp much vvealth and neither vse it
our selues, nor imploy it to the benefit
and reliefe of others.</p>
                  <p>This viper hath nine heads, by which
<pb facs="tcp:6758:114"/>
it snatcheth at the trash of the vvorld:
Fraud, Vnquietnes, Periury, Bribes, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Theft, Vsury, Rapine, and Simony.</p>
                  <p>Consider that the matter thereof
(which is riches) is most vild and abiect,<note place="margin">How to detest co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes.</note>
or else our Sauiour would neuer haue
committed the purse to <hi>Iudas:</hi> Christ
chose not his Apostles and best beloued
from amongst Princes, but poore fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
that no man can serue two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
GOD and the World, no more
then hee can at one time behold heauen
and earth: that riches for the most part
are gotten with paine, preserued vvith
feare, and lost with sorrow: that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
or most wealthiest man, is but as
the Mill-wheele, which though it turne
all day about, yet at night is found where
it vvas in the morning: so howsoeuer
we runne about this world for wealth, yet
at our death we shal be found as poore as
wee were at our birth: that the couetous
men are but as Camels, that all day carry
the Kings treasure, and at night are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a filthy stable, being able to
shew no signe or appearance thereof but
their galde backes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6758:115"/>
The onely remedy against couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">How to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse.</note>
is liberalitie, which is a distribution
of those good things that are in our pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
to the benefit of others: for we
haue nothing which wee haue not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from God, who hath giuen them for
the good of others, and will require an
accompt thereof at our hands.</p>
                  <p>The third Capitall sinne is Luxurie,<note place="margin">What Luxury is.</note>
which may be called the Leprosie of the
soule, and is an inordinate appetite of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciuious
and fleshly pleasures.</p>
                  <p>There are sixe kindes of this sinne:<note place="margin">Sorts and kindes of Luxury.</note> the
first is Fornication, which is an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> societie of one single person with an
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> other: the second is Rape or rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when a Virgin is deflowred, either
with her consent or against her will; for
although it be with her consent, yet it is
counted Rauishment, in respect of the
haynousnesse thereof, by reason it vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
breakes the lists of Chastitie, and
opens a gap many times to further vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a third is Adultery, when
the maried body is defiled: and this is of
two sorts, either simple, as when the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
sinnes with the vnmaried, or double
<pb facs="tcp:6758:115"/>
when the maryed sinnes with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
the fourth is Incest, when the abuse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of fleshly lust is committed by such as
are of one kindred, bloud, or affinitie,
which sinne makes men of the nature of
bruit beasts: the fift is Sodomie, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
is of two sorts, when man iusteth after
man, or man after beast: this is a crying
sinne, calling for vengeance vpon the
offenders: the sixt is Excesse of carnall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
action, euen amongst the maried, which
although it seeme lawfull, yet it offends
God, if it exceed measure or modesty.</p>
                  <p>There are nine fore-runners of this sin:<note place="margin">Nine fore-runners of Luxury.</note>
voluptuous eating, scurrulous talke, a
discouered dug, a naked breast, frizled
hayre, artificiall paynting, costly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
a rowling eye, an vnchaste foote.</p>
                  <p>Consider that the obiect whereto it
tendeth,<note place="margin">How to detest Luxurie.</note> (which is the corporall fruition
of vnchaste persons) is though candyed
with a faire out-side, inwardly the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
of vilde and corruptible basenesse:
that lust is neuer satisfied, but alwayes
poore, euen in plenty.</p>
                  <p>That the pleasure thereof is momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the punishment eternall, that it defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:6758:116"/>
the temple of the holy ghost, which
is mans body, consecrated vnto Christ
by his precious bloud: that it is no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
inioyed, but it breeds annoy: that it
weakens the powers of the soule, and fils
the body vvith many diseases: that it
shorteneth the life; and shadoweth good
report: that it is a fire whose substance
is Gluttony, whose flame is Pride, whose
sparkles are corrupt speeches, vvhose
ashes filthines, and whose end is Hell.</p>
                  <p>The best remedy against Luxury is
chastity,<note place="margin">How to auoid Luxurie.</note> which is of foure sorts; either of
nature, as of such as are borne chast; or
by art, as such as are made chast by men;
or by prayer and industry, as of such as
haue made themselues chast for the
kingdome of heauen; or by marriage, as
of such as liue chastly in wedlocke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Enuy, the fourth capitall sinne, may
be said to be the canker of the soule,<note place="margin">What En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie is.</note> for
that it eates and frets into the inward
man, no otherwise then rust doth into
iron; it is a reioycing at another mans
hurt, and sorrowing at his good.</p>
                  <p>It is of two sorts,<note place="margin">It is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> good and bad:
good Enuy is that when beholding the
<pb facs="tcp:6758:116"/>
perfections of another we are angry with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
our owne imperfections, and labour seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to be equall,<note place="margin">Good enuie.</note> or at least to imitate
the good qualities which we see to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
more in others then in our selues:
this is called emulation.</p>
                  <p>Bad Enuy is, when we grieue that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
like good qualities are not in vs,<note place="margin">Bad enuie, which hath fiue branches.</note> or not
as vvell in vs as in another, and of this
there are fiue branches, Detraction, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
Murmuring, Hatred, Hurt.</p>
                  <p>Consider that Enuy is the bagge and
cognisance of the Diuell,<note place="margin">How to detest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie.</note> for the Diuell
is not better knowne then by his enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
disposition, and therefore such as
giue place in their harts to this vice, are
said to be the seruants of the Diuell, if
seruants of the diuell they are enemies to
God, if enemies to God, they become
subiect to eternall damnation.</p>
                  <p>Of all other sinnes it is accounted the
iustest, for that it taketh vengeance vpon
it selfe, for although it euer leuels the
dart of mischiefe against others, yet it
vvounds it selfe, and is to the heart of
man as the vvorme bred in the tree, to
the wood thereof, by whom at last it is
<pb facs="tcp:6758:117"/>
deuoured: but say it were pleasing and
plausible in it selfe, yet consider God will
be reuenged vpon it, as by the example

it is to be loathed and abhorred, but
being so that it consumeth the heart,
dryeth vp the body, vexeth the minde,
and indangereth the soule, what can be
thought more detestable?</p>
                  <p>The remedy against Enuie is Charity,<note place="margin">How to auoyde Enuie.</note>

                  <p>Gluttony,<note place="margin">What gluttony is.</note> the fift capitall sinne, may be

First, the example of bruite Beastes,
though neuer so fierce, will alwayes shew
themselues meeke and gentle to them of
the same kinde: the Lyon will not hurt
the Lyon; nor the Dragon, the Dragon.
Secondly, in that wee are brought forth
naked and vnarmed, signifies we ought
to loath crueltie. Thirdly, to remember
what Christ hath done for vs, &amp; to think
that if we expect mercy at his hands, wee
ought to shew mercy to others. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so long as wee continue in wrath all
our actions are abhominable to God.
Fiftly, the wrathfull man liues in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
Purgatory and Hell of conscience.
Lastly, wee must not let the Sunne goe
downe vpon our wrath.</p>
                  <p>Anger, or wrath, is to be auoyded two

his fury, or staying by him, vse milde
and gentle speeches.</p>
                  <p>The best way to auoid Anger in our
selues, is patience, in suffering of euill
with a quiet minde: thinking whatsoeuer
is laid vpon vs in this life, whether affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
persecution, or the like, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can touch our Soule, and therefore
not to be regarded of vs. Besides, to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
anger, consider the party with whom
we are displeased: if it be a stranger im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it to his ignorance: if a childe, to his
folly: if a Master or Father, to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
if a Wife, to her loue: if a

of vertue: for that in a manner hee

                  <p>Remember that Sloth is a vice which

captiuates, and brings vs vnder the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish

of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who no sooner gaue himselfe

                  <p>Consider that we enter into this world,

                     <note place="margin">How to resist sin in generall.</note> Chap. 4. vers. 7. saith, <hi>resist
the diuell, and hee will flye from thee:</hi> in
vvhich wordes is both a precept and a
promise: in the precept is two things to
be considered, the action and the obiect:
the action is, to <hi>resist:</hi> the obiect is, the
<hi>Diuell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the performance of this action,

before the combat:<note place="margin">What we are to doe before the combat with the Diuell.</note> secondly,
how vve are to demeane our selues in
the combat: thirdly how to carry our
selues after the combat.</p>
                  <p>First, for the preparation, obserue
these rules set downe in the sixt Chapter
of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">7. weapons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to fight with the Diuell.</note> from the 14. to the 19.

<pb facs="tcp:6758:121"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> defensiue are fiue. First, for this combat
wee must stand fast, hauing our loynes
girt about with veritie, which is, to be
grounded in the setled truth of GODS
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Word without vnconstancy. Secondly,
vve must put on the Brest-plate of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse;
which is a setled purpose not
to displease God in any thing, though
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> neuer so seeming good in it selfe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wee must haue our feet shod with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Gospell of peace, which
is a constant resolution to professe the
truth, euen vnto death: yea, if it should
procure the losse of life, goods, vvife,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> children, and all. Fourthly, aboue all
to take the shield of Faith, which is such
a Faith as vvholy relieth on GOD in
Christ, with particular application, which
will quench the fiery darts of the wicked.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, to take the Helmet of saluation;
which is, to stand assured that our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is sealed vp vnto vs: which assurance
vvill cause vs, with confidence, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all Sathans assaults vvhatsoeuer.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, we must get the sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
(which is an offensiue weapon) which
is the word of God, wherewith our Head
<pb facs="tcp:6758:121"/>
and Captaine Christ repeld the Diuell.
Seuenthly, and lastly, that we pray with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
all maner prayer and Supplication in the
Spirit and watch thereunto,<note place="margin">What to doe in the combat.</note> with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance:
which two vveapons being
added to the rest, are of force to strike
through the very heart of the Diuell.</p>
                  <p>The second thing to be obserued, is
the manner how vve must behaue our
selues in this combat;<note place="margin">First, we must kill sin in the very con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ception.</note> and herein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
these rules. First, kill sinne in the
very conception (for it is like a Canker
which groweth not to ripenesse but by
degrees) otherwise it vvill grow from
motion to liking,<note place="margin">Sinne like to a canker.</note> from liking to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
from consent to action, from acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to custom, from custom to hardnesse
of heart, and from hardnesse of heart to
the height of all sinnes. If the Serpent
once get in his head, he will afterwards
wring in all his body. <hi>Timothy</hi> giueth
warning to take heed of couetousnesse
vvhich being once entertayned, giueth
vvay to many noysome temptations.
<hi>Ahab</hi> desiring <hi>Nabaoths</hi> Vineyard, no
sooner imbraced that euill motion, but
presenting it vvith a further desire,
<pb facs="tcp:6758:122"/>
brought forth fearefull and euill effects.
That man that vvill first vvalke in the
counsell of the vngodly, will next stand
in the way of sinners; and lastly will sit
in the seate of the scornefull. <hi>Iudas</hi> was
first a cunning dissembler: secondly, a
secret theefe: thirdly, an impundent lyer:
fourthly, a bloody traytor, and lastly, a
desperate reprobate. <hi>Peter,</hi> first denied
Christ faintly: secondly, with an Oath:
thirdly,<note place="margin">We must deny our owne strength.</note> vvith cursing and swearing;
wherefore, kill sinne in the conception.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, be sure to put no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in thy owne strength, for thereby
<hi>Peter</hi> fell grieuously.<note place="margin">We must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Diuell though he speake truth.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, beleeue not the Diuell, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee bring truth in his mouth:
our Sauiour Christ could not abide the
Diuell to speake the truth in the mayd,
hauing a spirit of diuination.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">We must make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, which is two waies.</note> be carefull euer to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
vnto it; and this is performed
either by weakening the abilitie of sin, or
els by opposing his contrary vnto sinne.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">First, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening the ability of sinne.</note> to weaken the ability of sinne,
is by taking away all occasions to sinne,
and by remouing all the sustainements
<pb facs="tcp:6758:122"/>
thereof, and also making a holy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
with euery member of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and soules, euer to repell it, neuer to
admit it, by vvhich meanes sinne may
come to be as a lake, into which the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of no streame runneth, which must
needes be dryed vp.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly opposing his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> it is done by opposing his
contraries vnto sinnes, as Charity to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice:
Temperance and Sobriety to Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
and Drunkennesse: Liberalitie to
Niggardice: Vigilance to Security: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to Distrust: Faith to Infidelity:
Truth to Lying: Chastity to Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">That we compare not the paine of resistance with the pleasure of sinne.</note>
and so of the rest: the practise of
one particular was in <hi>Ioseph</hi> with <hi>Potifars</hi>
wife, <hi>How</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall I commit this
euill and sinne against God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that thou be carefull neuer to
compare the paine of resistance with the
pleasure of the sin, for sin is sweet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting;<note place="margin">If the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell once be foyled, he is much quailed, &amp; thou more strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
but rather compare the horror
and gripings of the conscience, with the
paine of resistance, which will be a good
meanes to keepe thee from sinne.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, be assured, that if once thou
giue the Diuell the foyle, he will be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb facs="tcp:6758:123"/>
lesse able to assault thee, &amp; thou
more able to resist him, and that with
more courage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenthly, &amp; lastly, thou must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diligent to finde out the subtiltie,<note place="margin">To marke the Diuels subtilties and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises.</note>
deuices, and sleights of the Diuell, by
which he doth assault thee very cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for he hath a neare coniecture vnto
what sins thou art most inclined by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">The Diuel fitteth his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
and accordingly he fits his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
If thou be inclined to couetousnes,
he will offer thee <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, and
rather then faile, he will plot meanes to
slay him, so thou may effect thy desire:
If vaine glorious, he will make thee thirst
after the life of poore <hi>Mordecay:</hi> If am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
he will stirre vp meanes to driue
<hi>Dauid</hi> out of his kingdome, that <hi>Absolon</hi>
may enioy it: &amp; thus he fitteth his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to mens naturall inclinations: &amp;
thus much of the second place, namely,
how we should behaue our selues in the
combate, when we are grappling hand to
hand with the Diuell.</p>
                  <p>The third and last thing to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,<note place="margin">What to doe after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</note>
is what wee are to doe after the
combate, and that is, presently to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

our selues for a new combat:<note place="margin">To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our selues for a nevv com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</note> For,
if wee shall consider the malice of the
Diuell, how he euer seeketh our subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and ouer-throw, and hauing once
taken the foile, yet is not at rest, but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes seeketh againe to assault vs,
(for so he did with our head and captaine
Christ Iesus three seueral times one after
another) it should in this case teach vs
to take heed of carelesse securitie,<note place="margin">Sathans subtiltie should make vs to shun care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> as not
to thinke our selues safe when wee haue
giuen the Diuell the foyle, but euer to
stand vpon our guard, (for if hee dealt
thus with Christ our Head, vvhat vvill
hee doe with the members?) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conscionably and carefully regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
we may then expect an happy issue,
which is, that the diuell will flye from vs:
whereby we may obserue and note Gods
especiall care ouer vs, who euer giues a
happy issue with the temptation, to those
that vvalke in holy Obedience before
him:<note place="margin">A speciall meditation in the time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and if we would alwayes in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
call to minde Gods goodnesse,
his mercy, and kindnesse, formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vpon vs, it would be as a bulwark
of defence against the temptations of
<pb facs="tcp:6758:124"/>
the Diuell. This did <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he was
tempted to filthinesse by his Mistresse,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 39. hee instantly considered how
God had exalted him to great honour,
making him chiefe of his Masters house,
and ruler ouer all. <hi>How</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall I

                  </p>
                  <p>By this that hath beene said we may
learne how to auoid sinne; as also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the Diuell, which if (through the
blessing of God vpon our carefull ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
through the vse of the meanes) we
shall in some measure attaine vnto; yet
wee are not to thinke vvee haue done
enough, and there to rest, but wee must
labour and endeuour to doe good, and
to bring forth fruits vvorthy amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>Now, because vvee may bring forth
<pb facs="tcp:6758:124"/>
such fruit as in themselues may seeme
to be good, yet for want of knowledge
fayling in the manner of doing of them,
they are displeasing and dishonourable
to the Lord: know, that in euery action
pleasing and acceptable to the Lord, in
the doing thereof these fiue rules are to
be obserued:<note place="margin">Fiue rules specially to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action that shalbe pleasing to the Lord.</note> First, the person of him
must be pleasing to the Lord who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
any action to him. Before <hi>Abels</hi>
sacrifice vvas accepted, his person vvas
accepted: It may be demaunded, how
we shall know when our persons are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vnto God. Consider by nature we
are enemies vnto him, and so long our
persons cannot please him, as we be not
of Christ, therefore finde thy selfe to be
in Christ, and then thou art acceptable
vnto God: for God sayth, <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
Looke how CHRIST is vnto God, so is
euery one being in Christ: If then thou
would know whether thou be in Christ,
looke to thy Faith, whether it be a iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
faith. Secondly, thou must haue
the word of God for thy warrant, being
sure that the action thou doest be such
<pb facs="tcp:6758:125"/>
as his word alloweth. Thirdly, the end of
the action must be intended to the glory
of God. Fourthly, it must be done in
loue, which respecteth the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
&amp; lastly, it must be done within the
compasse of our callings. It is not lawfull
for one to doe that which another may;
euery man may not preach, nor euery
man may not gouerne: therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
thy selfe with thy calling, and know
what the duties are that God requireth of
thee within the limits and bounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
if these be wanting, either Faith, the
Word, the end, or Loue, or out of our
calling, the action, though neuer so see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
good, cannot please God.</p>
                  <p>If any shall looke backe to that which
hath beene sayd (and considereth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of the regenerate, and vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

that hee can power forth teares more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly

seeth in himselfe but small delight, and
doubteth of his own saluation: therefore
yet know this for thy comfort,<note place="margin">Comforts to the weake Christians.</note> and be

                     <hi>Herod</hi> made much of <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist:</hi>

alone betwixt God &amp; himselfe, which

him, if he goe no further he is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate:
for the Pharises went alone to
the Temple to pray:<note place="margin">1 King. 21. 29.</note> also God heard <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab,

into the kingdome of Heauen.</p>
                  <p>12 After all this godly life led, lying
on his death-bed, he may often remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God &amp; call vpon him: he may talke
of the ioyes of Heauen, and thinke them
happy that be there, and wish himselfe
there: yea, he may dye like a lambe, and
yet for all this be a damned creature: for
many shall say, Lord, Lord, and yet not
enter into the Kingdome of Heauen,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note>
And assuredly, they neuer sayd it oftner
then when they were sicke: and the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
VIRGINS desired to enter in vvith
Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 12</note> and yet were shut out: feare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and tremble till you stride the
thirteenth step.</p>
                  <p>13 The thirteenth step, without the
vvhich no man can enter into Heauen,
and be saued, is true repentance, which
whosoeuer hath not is yet no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
And that is a true and vnfained tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
