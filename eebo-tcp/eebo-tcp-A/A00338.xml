            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13778:7"/>
that there was neuer man, which did humily receaue it, that would mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ageynſt his Prince.

Now let euery blind ſtiffe hearted, and obſtinate creature compare his abhomination with the goſpell, and if he be not ſhameles, he will abaſhe to ſmell of his papiſtrie, and to walow ſtill in ignoraunce, vn leſt he bee priuely confederate and in heart conſent with the deteſtable fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of al wicked papiſtes.

Ageyn his ſubiectes dyd obey his commaundement feynedly with Ypocriſie, but in their heartes they abhorred gods woord. O the miſerie that dyd afterwarde ſodeinly enſue vpon them, O the wonderfull wrath of God that was poured vpon them, O their great and obſtinate blindnes whiche cauſed them moſt greuouſly too be ſcourged: Their plage was no leſſe then too bee vtterly ſpoyled of their enemies, Their plage was no leſſe then to eate one an other: Yea, their plage was no leſſe then to eate their owne ſonues and doughters.</p>
            <p>This calamitie and ſorow (moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prynce) happened them becauſe they dyd not regarde the lawes of God, but tourned too their olde ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable Ydolatrie, and lightelye eſtemed gods holy woord. Wherfore euen now whoſoeuer is an enemie

to the holy Bible, that is, neither ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diyng it himſelfe, nor willyng that other men ſhulde knowe it, he can in no wyſe be a right chriſtian man: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he faſt, pray, doo almes, &amp; all the good workes vnder heauen. And he that hath ſuche a mynde, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt curſed and cruel enemie too god, a playne ſower of ſedition, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueliſhe diſquieter of all godly men.
