            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HOW very truly that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſom walk, which with ſo much art and charge, you have forced out of that neglected piece of ground adjoining to your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens may be compared to the ancient <hi>Peripatum,</hi> thoſe very many that you are pleaſed to oblige there with the better Hoſpitallity of <hi>ingenious</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, can abundantly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And truly, Sir, as I have been happy in being one of the frequenteſt Gueſts there; ſo I could not but think my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, ſhould I not make this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick acknowledgment of it,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62453:3"/>
though I be ſufficiently aſſured, that ſince you honour me with a real Friendſhip, you expect no ſuch empty and troubleſom recognitions. Now Sir, the method that you have been pleaſed to fix your friends, that attend you in ſuch converſes, you know to be this, to agree before-hand upon what ſhall be the ſubject of the next Eſſay, and the reaſon you gave for it, I remember was this, that thereby we might with a little more care furniſh our minds, and be more advantaged by communicating (not any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den raſh or raw) but the beſt and moſt maturely digeſted ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of our Souls, each to other. For as the <hi>Spartan</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians (ſay you) were (not without good reaſon) never permitted to make any quick
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62453:3"/>
and ſudden reſponſes to any queſtion propoſed to them. So though perhaps ſome things pertinent may fall from men on the ſudden, yet doubtleſs thoſe that conſider well before-hand have much the advantage.. Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure eaſily mends what haſte did well, and always corrects what precipitancy did amiſs.</p>
            <p>My preſent infelicity, Sir, is to be prevented by an envious diſtemper of giving you my promiſed attendance. Yet that I might go as far as my utmoſt poſſibilities would permit, in paying my due reſpects to you, I have ſent this to ſupply my place, and if you will pleaſe to permit <hi>K.</hi> to be my Official, he ſhall read what I ſhould have ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Sir, I will be bold to tell the World that there is no Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62453:4"/>
(placed in the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) that can be more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially ſollicitous for the intereſt of true Religion, and the flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing Eſtate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than your ſelf. No man hath more deeply and heartily bewailed her late wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſecution, nor can any have more ſolaced himſelf in the hopes of her riſing to her ancient ſplendor, ſince the late bleſſed and miraculous revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But providence lets us be witneſſes, that even rational hopes ſometimes (as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Event) are vain, and that Clouds many times obſcure the new-riſen Sun. That moſt fecundant heat which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that moſt deliciouſly enamel'd Carpet, that we ſee ſpread upon the Earth, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth alſo Frogs and Serpents,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62453:4"/>
that diſturb or make dangerous that repoſe that men deſigned or promiſed themſelves upon it. And that moſt wiſe, and always juſt providence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, oftentimes allays the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt felicities here below, with ſome ungrateful and vexatious appanages. And thus that great delight that ſo much longed for comfort, that we may now take in worſhipping our <hi>God,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive Rules, in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is now much impaired and imbitter'd by the contemplation of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violent Oppoſitions yet againſt her, maintained by a multitude of men, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greateſt kindneſs upon Earth can oblige, nor indeed miracles from Heaven prevail upon to lay aſide their Un-Chriſtian
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62453:5"/>
and cauſeleſs animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
            <p>The ſearching into the cauſes of this ſad reflection hath been the taſk that you have now for a conſiderable time impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelf, and your Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Friends. And I ſhould be injurious to the merits of ſo good a Perſon, ſhould I forget one account that you have reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly given of this Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon, and that hath been fetched from Gods tendereſt reſpects unto this Church; which though appearing perhaps a ſeeming Paradox to ſome ſlight Conſiderors, yet you have moſt intelligibly and plainly explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For a full proſperity doubtleſs is the moſt perillous temptation, and a ſtate moſt dangerous to the deſign of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the great intereſts
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62453:5"/>
of Souls. And had we not a full account of this in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Chriſtianity while under its Primitive troubles and perſecutions, from what it was when (by the providence of Heaven) it emergeth from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe, and flouriſhed in the triumphal Banners of Kings and Emperours; yet you have told us, if we wanted theſe, we were able to give too great aſſurance of this to our ſelves, within the little compaſs of our own time, having ſeen thoſe, who, whilſt they were under the late per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, were exact and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in all Chriſtian duties, even to the ſhaming as well as fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the malice of thoſe who ſought induſtriouſly for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereof to accuſe them, yet ſince the changing of their conditions, have ſtrangely and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62453:6"/>
ſadly miſcarried, ſwerved from their former rules, and grown to harbour and commit prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous immorallities.</p>
            <p>Now the wiſe and great goodneſs of God knowing this, may well exerciſe us ſtill with theſe afflictions (and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diminution of its own tenderneſs) that thereby, that filth and ruſt may be effectually prevented, which ſhould we lye long in an idle proſperity, we ſhould certainly contract. And the inference from it (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) was religious and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that we ſhould not too much repine and murmure a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> theſe diſappointments of our hopes; but be ſo far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any ill thoughts of God, as to caſt the whole blame upon our own wretched infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and bleſs his goodneſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62453:6"/>
that hath ſo mercifully provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt them.</p>
            <p>In the purſuit of this ſubject, and progreſs our diſcourſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cauſes of it, we could not chuſe but glance often at the oppoſite parties, which are indeed the great occaſioners of our preſent diſturbances, nor ſhall they ever be able to free themſelves from the guilt of them, what excuſes and palia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſoever they may hope to frame. Now amongſt theſe our thoughts firſt fixed themſelves upon the <hi>Antiſignani,</hi> the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this great diſſenting mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and after ſeveral things remarkable in them (which I need not now repeat) it came into our purpoſes to ſearch for the cauſes of that very great eſteem they are in, and that great Veneration they have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62453:7"/>
from their deluded Proſelytes, to whom as very many of thoſe prophetick marks by which the Hereticks of old are ſignalized by St. <hi>Jude,</hi> are as pertinently applicable, as if thoſe very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had already antedated the great reſurrection; ſo this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that now we mention, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, having the perſons of their Leaders in a wonderful admiration.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, before I enter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon this taſk I have thought it might not be wholly impertinent, to vindicate this enquiry from thoſe Cenſures, which it will be moſt ſure to meet with from others, when it is once diſcovered. And two there are that perhaps it may be aſſaulted withal. Either firſt, that ſuch an enquiry is uſeleſs, and the expence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62453:7"/>
time (though I'll aſſure you this hath not taken up much) will lye heavy on him that purſues it. Or elſe ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is allready obvious and plain, and he will but hold a Candle to the Sun that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to account for it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal (I am apt to fancy) of any that we need fear; as for any other little petty objections or cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that (its like) theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned perſons would raiſe againſt it, we will wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and relinquiſh our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy if we be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at them.</p>
            <p>Now for the aſſoiling the firſt of theſe, I will take liberty to aſſert, that certainly he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a deeply intereſted perſon, or a very ſuperficial Speculator, that can have the confidence to owne it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62453:8"/>
For firſt a man without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending any great ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy may eaſily foretel, that while they poſſeſs this great eſteem, they will moſt eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence their people how they pleaſe. Sir, it is a great truth, <hi>That the people generally judge by their affections rather than their judgments,</hi> and thoſe whom they admire and reverence, they commonly pay an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Faith to all their placits; they will ſeldom be at the pains or leiſure of examining things in their naked garbs, but uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally go ſome nearer and eaſier way, and paſs ſentence upon them as they comply with, or diſſent from their paſſions, and humours, and inclinations, or ſome external intereſts. And nothing is more eaſie to obſerve than this, <hi>viz.</hi> what a mighty
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62453:8"/>
influence the reputation of a ſpeaker hath, in raiſing a ready admittance for what he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, into the minds of men; whilſt he that labours under prejudices, and encounters with a prepoſſeſſing diſreſpect, ſhall be little or not at all regarded in what he ſpeaks, though he were as Eloquent as <hi>Tully.</hi> The ſame things delivered by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently reſented; Nay, many times a jejune and flat diſcourſe from one, men love, ſhall be mightily cryed up, before the moſt excellent compoſitions of one whom they value not.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Sir, it requires no mean ſtock of Philoſophy, for a man to free himſelf from ſuch prepoſſeſſions, and to be able to receive a truth equally from all men. Even the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>

Lords, as wiſe and as grave as they were, yet if an uſeful truth were delivered by any of an ill repute, would have it repeated by one of a better eſteem; as if truth were not equally ſo from any men, but owed it's acceptableneſs to the reputation and credit of him that ſpake it.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſecondly, one of the ſureſt ways and methods to reclaim their followers, will be by taking of them off from this high eſteem of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and while that remains fixed, there will be little hopes of ſucceſs by any other endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: In vain ſhall you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade men to diſbelieve or abandon thoſe, whom they have ſo dear an eſteem and reſpect for; it will be too difficult a taſk to bring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62453:9"/>
them to believe, that thoſe they ſo highly reverence, will ever be ſo baſely unworthy, as to teach them untruths, or lead them into perdition. No, No, their love expects and hopes for other returns, and better uſage from them.</p>
            <p>And this (I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) will be ſufficient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this undertaking from this imputation, at leaſt in all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and unprejudiced perſons eſteem. I doubt not but theſe men will cry out, we might have been better employed, and have exerciſed our deep reaſonings (for in ſuch terms I expect their Sarcaſms) in more profitable and uſeful Theories. But ſo have I heard malefactors condemn and rail at the active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their purſuers, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert they might have been more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62453:10"/>
profitably employed than in their diſcovery and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; while others have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded and commended it as hugely conducive to the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. And certainly thoſe that conſider this to be one great cauſe and Origine of our preſent diſtempers, will think the endeavouring to obſtruct it a very charitable deſign, and hugely contributive to the Peace of the Church. And I can ſincerely witneſs that a ſenſe of this was the only reaſon of this enquiry.</p>
            <p>Nor Secondly, Is it any ſo very obvious and palpable a thing, as ſome would perhaps be apt to perſwade us, but may very well require the pains of a cloſe Enquiror, rightly to ſtate the reaſons of it. And truly among the Ordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62453:10"/>
of things that we commonly converſe withal, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few ſeem more odd and ſtrange: For let us a little while, if you pleaſe, ſtay to examine the reaſons, that in ſuch caſes are commonly obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and which the Patrons of this ſecond objection, doubtleſs would readily fix upon, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign as the reaſons of what we enquire now about.</p>
            <p>I will examine ſome of the principal ones, and endeavour to let you ſee, how wide they are in aſſigning any of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt ſhall be the great learning of theſe diſſenting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, theſe great men. This you know, Sir, is naturally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a very great adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any perſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently renders him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſome great one,</hi> in the eſteem
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62453:11"/>
and thoughts of others. If we ſhould narrowly ſearch into the artifices and methods by which men have attain'd to honour and renown in the World, we ſhould quickly be able to aſſert, that Valour and Learning have been the chief: theſe have been the two great Engines by which men of briſker mettle have lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up themſelves above the reſt of their brethren, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſhine in higher Orbs than they.</p>
            <p>I am not concerned either to diſcourſe of the firſt of theſe (though perhaps ſome would ſay that they approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good at the Sword) or to arbitrate on which ſide the degree of merit ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; whether the <hi>Cedant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma togae,</hi> may be a Text authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. Or whether the Sword be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62453:11"/>
not of ſolid and laſting metal, while the Pen is but the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence of a rude Soul. It will be more pertinent to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you, how ſucceſsful a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for the latter, hath been to the Heathen Prieſts of old in conciliating a reverence for them, from their poor blind ignorant Proſelytes, and how very ſenſible thoſe men were that this alone was the ſecure way to confirm them in this gainful veneration. Therefore were the Heathen <hi>abdyta</hi> ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly concealed from vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar notice, and not a man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their myſteries till after ſeveral years probation and ſtudy: As if no mean ſtock of Learning were needful for a Prieſt. And thoſe few that we read of admitted into theſe <hi>arcana</hi> in any other method,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62453:12"/>
were yet all of them perſons whom common fame reported for great Scholars. And truly if I ſhould remark to you how well the Gentlemen in Black beyond the Seas (I mean the Prieſts of the Romiſh party) underſtand this and how the great and only ground of their eſteem and veneration among the admiring multitude, is their induſtrious endeavour by all means to preſerve them ſenſible of their own great Ignorance, and their Leaders great Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: I ſhould add another conſideration to let you ſee how mightily powerful, a repute for learning is to obtain a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the multitude.</p>
            <p>If this therefore were ſo eminent in theſe leading per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if they alone were the Maſters in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62453:12"/>
the wonder were leſs, and the evidence of this might ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeed all further enquiry, and demonſtrate it to be but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently buſie. But, Sir, I am willing to have ſo much charity for theſe men, as to believe they are not ſo much Phariſees (in this reſpect alſo) as to ſtile all men but themſelves, the <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus terrae, qui neſcit legem.</hi> And truly they would go near to exceed the Phariſaick haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they quite deny their brethren of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> any ſhare with them in this Jewel, nay would be much prouder than I dare judge them to be, if they grant not theſe the right hand of fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>I am far from aſperſing them al as Fools and Idiots, I know ſome not unworthy to be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the learned; but I think
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62453:13"/>
I know ſome others, that have very little, but either a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent garb, or a greater ſtock of boldneſs and confidence (ſome would give it a worſe name) to difference them from the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Woman among the croud of all their Proſelytes. And I am prone to think, that I could make ſome men bluſh (but that they have abandon'd modeſty) if I ſhould tell you, that deſpair of ever attaining any conſiderable preferment in the Church, ariſing from the conſciouſneſs of their own mean parts, hath been the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellent with ſome men to ſet up in Conventicles, and offer themſelves Leaders of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. But I content my ſelf to obſerve, that learning cannot be the cauſe of this veneration, for others both truly are, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62453:13"/>
are acknowledged generally to be as learned as (or more than) they are. And indeed it might moſt juſtly afflict us with great ſorrow, if there were either no Saints but amongſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, or no Seers but thoſe that dwelt at <hi>Ekron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another amongſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ordinary attractives of reſpect and love, is a charming benignity of converſation. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more evident than this ſame; the Courtier commonly outgoes the Scholar here, and you ſhall ſee men that have but ſtudied, and are exact in the little modes and arts of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and obliging converſe with men, charm their affections, and endear their Reſpects; whilſt others, though never ſo well accompliſhed and meriting otherwiſe, ſhall yet for want of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62453:14"/>
this, be caſt off, and paſſed by as rude or deſerving at leaſt but a common eſteem.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I imagine, you gheſs very little pains will be required to ſhew that theſe men are none of them Maſters of the Ceremonies, nor the only endeavourers of men by a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing converſe; that they are Maſters exactly ſkill'd in all the cunning Arts of cloſe inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, will be eaſily granted them by any; but thoſe of the Jeſuitical Faction, who may very reaſonably pretend to be their equals, if not Maſters in this, as well as in ſome other procedures. But as for their outward converſe, generally no men are more ſupercillious and Stoical than they, nor more regardleſs of civilly giving reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to others. And indeed it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62453:14"/>
were ſomething ſtrange if they ſhould, for mens Opinions and Principles in Religion do mightily influence their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in converſation, and it will be rarely ſeenthat a man who is engaged upon a rigid cenſuring and condemning of others, is over-affable, and courteous, and obliging to his own: But theſe things ferment and ſour his common carriage and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for the moſt part render it auſtere, proud, and harſh. I could eaſily give light to this obſervation from the Platoniſts and Stoicks in the Heathen World, or (to come ſomething cloſer) in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tempers of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, and the Diſciples of the Idolized man of <hi>Geneva.</hi> What <hi>Calvin's</hi> temper was, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward common civility, poor
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62453:15"/>
               <hi>Caſtellio</hi> can tell you from ſad Experience; and truly I wiſh I could not alſo tell you, that he hath a great many Diſciples, the chief of theſe perſons that we are diſcourſing of. Now truly it will be no great wonder to ſee thoſe men not very affable and endearing in their common carriage, who have infected their heads, by entertaining ſo harſh a notion of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, as to imagine him to be the Author of the horrible <hi>decretum.</hi> They may very well be auſtere and unpleaſant in their carriage to men, who think they herein but imitate the God they adore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing that might gain them a repute, would be the ſucceſsful managing and maintaining of the beloved cauſe; if they were victorious
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62453:15"/>
here, then 'twere no wonder if they obtained Ovation, or any more ſplendid triumph among their people: If they had Captivated the Ark of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or brought it's God as a ſpoil to offer unto their <hi>Dagon,</hi> then we could not wonder to ſee the ſtreets of <hi>Gath</hi> doing them honour, nor to hear the Daughters of <hi>Askalon</hi> ſinging their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>For this (all men know) is indeed a very great endearing of a perſon to his party; he that brings men victory ſhall be mightily honoured by them, let him be what he will in other reſpects. Conſonantly to which, we ſhall find that all victorious Captains in the World have been entertained at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with joy and honour, and that not only among the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62453:16"/>
Nations, but the refined Grecians, and grave Romans; nay if <hi>David</hi> be victorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the Virgins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will ſing his triumph.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, I dare truſt you or any impartial perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to umpire the conteſt, and tell who hath the better of the Battel. Any intelligent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſs'd judge will eaſily and readily give ſentence againſt them. Who ſeeth not how often, and how ſhamefully they have been non-pluſt and bafled? who cannot tell you the miſerable ſad ſhifts they have been put upon, to give but any tollerable kind of colour to their cauſe, that every Idiot may not perceive it ruin'd and undone? Let me ſee the man that ever yet found <hi>Hooker</hi> to any purpoſe anſwered. And how vain and fruitleſs have the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62453:16"/>
late attempts of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> been againſt (that wonder of his Age) Dr. <hi>Parker.</hi> Who ſeeth not the main cauſe wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as invincible, while all the aſſaults are only made againſt the miſtaken and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented title of the Book, or ſome other little things that are but accidental and beſide the main matter? And yet this (we have heard) hath been cryed up as a full anſwer by ſome of the party. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis by the ſame figure, that he that thinks he hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed a few Scouts, may be ſaid to have Conquered the whole Army; or in the ſame ſenſe as the late King was reported overcome, and routed, when he diſarm'd the Forces of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in the Weſt. Certainly if this be all the Champions that they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62453:17"/>
have, or all the force of that Champion (and I'll do him the right to think they have not a better) the Dr. needs not much fear his being overcome, unleſs perhaps they have ſome other way of contending, which they hope may be more likely to prevail, as now we ſee the Scene is changed, he that could not be diſputed and argued out of his aſſertion, muſt now be laughed and jeſted out of it; what the grave Doctor could not do, the Jeſter is ſet on to Eſſay, the Jack-Pudding is ſet up in the Room of his Maſter, and the Monkey 'tis hoped may once again prove the abler Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. From ſober words it's come to downright raillery, and him whom they could not fairly conquer, yet at leaſt they'l curſe and ſcould at. But if this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62453:17"/>
be a victory let the Cock clap his Wings and crow as loud as he pleaſeth. Who that's wiſe ſeeth not in this the deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſinking cauſe, and an acknowledged inabillity of ever fairly maintaining it? this is the plain tell-tale of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and enraged paſſion. If they have no ſpears now, but bitter words, they'l not much (I hope) wound their Enemy; if theſe be all the Arrows they have, let them ſhoot and ſpare not, they'l do the adverſary lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle injury, but like the Parthian Darts ſhot in anger againſt the ſun, fall with the greater force &amp; virulency upon their own heads.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I am freed from theſe preliminary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and at leiſure to come to a more cloſe purſuit of our theam. I find nothing more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62453:18"/>
in the way to hinder me from proceeding to a direct ſearch into the cauſes of this affair. I ſhall aſſign four or five things, which (when a little fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) may be ſuppoſed to have an influence on this matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt great cauſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap> I ſhall venture to aſſign hereof ſhall be this. <hi>A preaching up of an empty, formal, Notional kind of Religion, and cauſing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging men to build their hopes of Heaven upon very eaſie and pleaſing conditions.</hi> If I can demonſtrate theſe Leaders to be guilty of this, I ſhall need be at very little pains to ſhew you, that even naturally they will be admired and honoured by their followers.</p>
            <p>For firſt, all men greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Heaven and its happineſs,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62453:18"/>
eſpecially all men that have any tincture of Religion. For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion being founded upon theſe two prime <hi>Poſtulata's, the Being of a God</hi> and <hi>the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> the very deſign of it is to inſtruct us how we may acceptably ſerve the one, and ſecure (not only the preſent but chiefly) the future felicity of the other. So that mens ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a profeſſion of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is an evident Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their deſires of a future happineſs, which all men call the felicity of Heaven, though they differ very much in the deſcription, and character, and account that they give of it, and of the nature of its enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And for thoſe that have taken upon themſelves the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that only excellent Religion, which from its great
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62453:19"/>
Founder and Author is called Chriſtian, and are but in any tollerable meaſure inſtructed in the Principles of the ſame, for theſe to covet Heaven, and the future glory thereof will not appear very ſtrange to any that conſiders the endearing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and deſcription that therein is given us of it. Indeed the nature of it is ſo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſo adapted to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of a rational Soul; the degrees and meaſures of it are ſo very large, ſo fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to all the vaſteſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, the moſt enlarged and craving deſires of that Soul, that he muſt needs forgo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, caſt off all natural affection to his own being, turn ſavage and barbarous to his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and be guilty of the groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Miſanthropy imaginable,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62453:19"/>
that doth not ambition, and covet, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as the Apoſtle moſt Rhetorically terms it) that weight of glory, that tranſcendant felicity, that no <hi>Hyperbole</hi> can poſſibly reach the meaſure of. Indeed we may with all ſafety aſſert, that the only bare naming of ſuch a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, is ſufficient to excite the deſires and longings of the Soul after it. When the will hath any excellent thing made known unto it, there will need very little more complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or perſwading it into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of it, than you would need to uſe to a preſſing hunger, or an hydropick thirſt, when thoſe things were before them that they ſo gaſped after. In ſhort, that man muſt needs be brutiſh, more ſottiſhly ſenſual than that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62453:20"/>
great inſtance of ſenſuality <hi>Eſau,</hi> who doth not deſire this great bleſſing of his Heavenly Father; and he comes much ſhort of the ſelf-love even of the Aramitiſh Sorcerer that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not to dye the death of the righteous, and that his latter end may be like unto his.—But ſure there needs no great queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioning this truth.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, it is as certain and evident, that as all men deſire Heaven, ſo moſt men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it upon the eaſieſt terms, and leaſt offenſive conditions that may be: As it is with the Merchants of Earth, ſo 'tis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally with thoſe that pretend to traffick for Heaven, they would all gladly have very good pennyworths, buy as cheap as is poſſible, be at as little pains and labour for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62453:20"/>
as may be. And truly the humour of moſt men is ſuch, that if God will not <hi>give them</hi> Heaven, if he will not freely beſtow it upon them for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he may keep it himſelf, for their parts, they'l never buy ſo dear a purchaſe. And as for the reſt that ſeem ſomething better than theſe, that perhaps may be induced to grant a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of doing ſomething on our parts, yet the leſs that is, the better they are pleaſed; if they muſt bear any Yoak, by all means it muſt be light and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; if it chance to grate or preſs ruggedly, if it excoriate and cauſe pain, if it croſs any luſt, if it retrench any ſenſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, if it fairly conſiſt not with the projected intereſt, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain any wanton exorbitancy; alas! it's not at all fit for theſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62453:21"/>
mens ſhoulders, it comports not with their Complexions, and is much too harſh for theſe mens tender conſtitutions. If it call for the amputation of a beloved Member, if it require the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding of an Eſpouſed <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> it appears ſavage and cruel in theſe mens eſteem, and they have a Text againſt it, which ſhall be ſuborned to patronize their refuſal to obey it. Maſter ſpare thy ſelf, theſe things ſhall not happen unto thee. And for the man that deals honeſtly with them, and roundly tells them, that without holineſs they but in vain expect to ſee God, that he only is our great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters true Diſciple, that doth whatſoever he commands him: alas! this man ſhall be looked upon under the ſame notion that our bleſſed Saviour was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62453:21"/>
by the Demoniacks in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, one that comes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, unſeaſonably to trouble, and diſturb their thoughts, and ſhall be as ungrateful to them as a Tormentor.</p>
            <p>But he that can reconcile <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and Paradiſe, and render their ſenſual lives and great hopes conſiſtent; he that can ſing one of the Songs of <hi>Sion</hi> to a wicked Babylonian, that can preach up a poſſibility of leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a <hi>Dalilah</hi>'s lap into the Boſom of <hi>Abraham;</hi> Oh no man hits their humour like this man. <hi>Omne tulit punctum qui miſcuit utile dulci.</hi> Saith the ancient Adage and be confident 'tis ſo in this inſtance. He that will undertake to find out a way how the pleaſant and good things here, may be ſecure of the better that ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62453:22"/>
How the merriments of the fleſh ſhall hereafter conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and commence raptural exultations and joys of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. He that can take the bunch off the unjuſt rich Camels back, and ſmooth it ſo, as eaſily to paſs through the Eye of the Heavenly Needle. He that can cut the Gordian knot of duty, and ſolve the <hi>Aenigm</hi> how a man may be glorious hereafter, without being vertuous here; this man ſhall be the honoured <hi>Oedipus,</hi> this ſhall be the <hi>Apollo</hi> whoſe Altars ſhall never be without incenſe; this man ſhall be the <hi>Alexander</hi> whoſe Troops of adoring followers ſhall all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be full.</p>
            <p>We may without any great fear of cenſure, take upon us to tell thoſe that deny theſe things, that they are unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62453:22"/>
with the humours of men, have lived like ſo many Reclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Caves or Rocks, where they have come into no famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with things like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yea that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtrangers perhaps to their own tempers.</p>
            <p>And perhaps it may not be impertinent to the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to remark to you, how plainly this humour ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and diſcover'd it ſelf in Gods choſen people of old; according to thoſe Memoirs that the Holy Ghoſt hath given us of them in thoſe ſacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You may (with a very little conſidering of them) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that the great buſineſs of the holy Prophets, was ſtill to beat down this fancy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of a neceſſity of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62453:23"/>
moral righteouſneſs, in order to true happineſs; to aſſure them that a few eaſie ritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances was not all they were to regard; and that the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial ſanctity was nothing worth in Gods eſteem, without the moral purity. And a very little converſing with thoſe holy Hiſtories will let you ſee, what entertainment theſe good men commonly found for this truth and plainneſs. They were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Enemies, and purſued as diſturbers of their peace, a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or worſe was ſure to be the fate of him, that cryed not ſtill go up and proſper. Alas theſe things hit not their humours, theſe were not ſtories comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their tempers, and therefore the Preachers of them were ſure to find no very good entertainment amongſt them.

This the Royal Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (we ſhall find) takes the liberty freely to tell them, <hi>Cap.</hi> 30. 10. 11. <hi>Which ſay to the Seers ſee not, and to the Prophets, Propheſie not unto us right things; ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, Propheſie deceits, go ye out of the way, turn aſide out of the path: cauſe the holy one of Iſrael to ceaſe from before us.</hi> Which words (without the aſſiſtance of any Comment) diſcover to us how little theſe people loved duty, how much they deſired to be indulged and ſoothed up in their immoralities; to have Peace, Peace cryed to them, notwithſtanding all their vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and how the only way to be reſpected by them was to comply with their humours and beloved carnallities. And if you'l pleaſe to conſult the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62453:24"/>
               <hi>Micah, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 11. You'll find him charging them plainly with the ſame thing alſo. <hi>If a man walking in the ſpirit and falſhood, do lye, ſaying I will propheſie unto thee of Wine and ſtrong drink. He ſhall even be the Prophet of this people.</hi> No mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all how true or falſe the Prophets words were, if they were but oily and ſmooth, if they did but favour or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the beloved ſenſuality; there was no man like him: this ſhould be their beloved Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. And conſonantly to this you will find, that the falſe Prophets eaſily perceived this humour, by all means comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and hereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an eſteem and venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on above any of the Prophets of the Lord. One <hi>Zedekiah</hi> with theſe turns ſhould puſh a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62453:24"/>
thouſand <hi>Micajah's</hi> out of all eſteem with <hi>Ahab</hi> and his people. And that this was the gainful practice of theſe deceivers, we are aſſured; therefore are they repreſented to us, as men that cryed, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> when their was <hi>no Peace.</hi> Thus they ſoothed and flattered the people, and the people largely rewarded them again, and there was no Trade in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſure to bring in more profit, than the ſowing Pillows to mens Elbows, and preaching up Doctrines that brought them eaſe, and yet promiſed them happineſs.</p>
            <p>And if we a little further continue our courſe with theſe holy Writings, and come to the New Teſtament, we ſhall ſoon diſcover, that this alſo was the method by which the Phariſees, thoſe great Doctors in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62453:25"/>
obtained ſuch a veneration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the multitude: For though it muſt not be denied them, that they were extreamly ſtrict and even critically auſtere in their carriage, yet this may ſafely be added, that all this ſtrictneſs which they preached up, or practiſed, was only in very little, and very eaſie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſuch as were far enough ſhort of any painful auſterities, and might well enough conſiſt with, and be performed by the moſt carnal and ſenſual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions. For what great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was offer'd to the adored <hi>Mammon</hi> by tything a ſprig of Mint, or a Pint of Cummin-ſeed? little loſs could reſult from hence to the eſtate; and who would not readily be juſt in theſe minute things that he might neglect it in greater?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62453:25"/>
What great auſterity in faſting twice a week, ſo that a Feaſt might be allowed to their luſts all the days beſide? What great difficulty in a long Prayer, while that would preſently be recompenſed with the Widows Houſe? What great hardſhip in waſhing before meat, while the Soul was freely left to it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs? What great unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs in always waſhing when they had been in the Market, all the while they brought thence ſuch good pennyworths? What courſe could be leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or afflicting to a ſcornful Pride, than to take care never to eat with Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? And certainly the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broad Philacteries, was no ſuch mighty act of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but could well enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with caſting Gods Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62453:26"/>
their backs. Now no men were ever ſurer of eſteem and honour from the multitude than theſe were; no men ever hit upon a more certain way to be admired than they. For as ſtrictneſs doth well, ſo if it be but in eaſie ſmall things, it pleaſeth too. This exactly ſuits with a man's humour; for while the one <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſtrictneſs) may a little quiet his Conſcience, ſo it being but in the other <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſmall trifling things) ſecures his other intereſts alſo. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knack both aſſures him a kind of Peace, and yet offers no violence at all to his moſt vicious propenſities.</p>
            <p>And now if after all theſe evidences, you'll give me leave to add one conjecture I will tell you, that if all the cauſes why St. <hi>James</hi> his Epiſtle was ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62453:26"/>
long diſputed, and with ſo much difficulty at laſt acknowledged for Canonical, were cloſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, I have often thought that ſomething reliſhing of this humour, would be found among them. The Solifidian Errour had taken deep rooting, and made a large ſpread (you know) allready, in the followers of <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician and others, and poſſibly ſome dregs of it, might be in ſome others that wore the viſor of true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Now, Sir, theſe perſons very well knew that they had ſome little ſhew and appearance of ground for this ſo pleaſing and bewitching a Doctrine, from the acknowledged Epiſtles of the great Doctor and Apoſtle of the Gentiles, or at leaſt there was ſomething in them, that might eaſily be ſuborned to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62453:27"/>
countenance the ſame: whereas now they muſt for ever quit, and have no tollerable <hi>Salvo</hi> or Argument for it: it being moſt clearly and irrefragably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by this moſt excellent and needful Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, if theſe perſons (we have been diſcourſing about) be not guilty of this fraud, if they have not trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in this path; I will dare to tell you, that none ever were or did. No men have more fearfully corrupted Chriſtianity, nor debauched it to the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of wickedneſs and vice; No perſons ever preached up a poſſibility of Salvation upon eaſier terms; No men have ever given people ground to hope for the Salvation of the Spirit, with leſs pain and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the fleſh than theſe men have done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:62453:27"/>
I do not intend to ſtay only upon the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and thoſe various Mad-Sects that have ſprung from them; for here plain evidence of the fact renders needleſs any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. Never did Hell vent an errour more pleaſing to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallity, than this, which at once evacuates the whole law of God, and declaims againſt any neceſſity of obedience to it: Enervates all exhortations and motives to virtue, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a ſpiritual freedom; and deliverance from any bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage at all.</p>
            <p>And with the like brevity I purpoſe to paſs over the late ſprung up and doting Sect among us, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Leaders; men who have calculated a Doctrine much what to the ſame Meridian,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62453:28"/>
that have taught people to caſt off all reſpect to the Law of God, as being but the Law of a carnal Commandment, (ſay they) and wholly to give up themſelves to the conduct and guidance of a light within; than which, there was never a fairer inlet offer'd to the ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, nor an opportunity gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to carnallity to conſult it's own eaſe and ſafety, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching the natural Light of Conſcience, and putting the reins into the hands and power of Intereſt and Paſſion, to corrupt and over-rule the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reaſon as themſelves pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Neither do I intend to ſtay you any longer, with the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> and his crew. When I ſhall but only have mention'd that doctrine of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62453:28"/>
theirs, that <hi>Dominion is ſounded in Grace;</hi> that the wicked of the World have no right nor title to any thing they poſſeſs or enjoy, but may very juſtly be diſpoſſeſſed thereof by the Saints, who alone are the Heirs of this World, as well as of that to come; you will eaſily perceive what a pleaſant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine this is; how ſubſervient to their own intereſts (for they alone are theſe Saints) and worldly deſigns, and how whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtructive of all Equity, and Juſtice, and Charity in the World.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall ſtay you a little longer with the two more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and formidable ſorts of diſſenters amongſt us, who though more ſound and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in many things, yet (I doubt) will ſcarcely cruſh this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62453:29"/>
guilt off their hands, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves innocent in this matter.</p>
            <p>I will not here inlarge in ſhewing you, how they have diſhonour'd the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and brought a ſcorn upon it, in the ſight of the World, by making it a ſtalking Horſe to the moſt unjuſt deſigns, and a Cloak to cover the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid impieties and immoralities that the Sun ever beheld acted upon the Stage of any Chriſtian Kingdom; nay, that a modeſt Heathen would have bluſhed at and deteſted. Nor will I here take notice what a wretched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence this carriage of theirs hath had upon the Opinions and practices of too many among us; how Atheiſm hath enter'd in at this door, men naturally caſting off all honourable
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62453:29"/>
thoughts of Religion, when they have obſerved theſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pretenders to it, uſe it only as <hi>a Cloak of maliciouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs all theſe ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only with this wiſh, That the thoughts of theſe things may ſet cloſe upon theſe mens Souls and Conſciences. That which I am more directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in, is to demonſtrate my Aſſertion, That theſe men have introduced into the World a Notional Religion, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a poſſibility of Salvation, upon very eaſie and pleaſing Conditions. And this I ſhall endeavour to do by two <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> and Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could eaſily refer you to many of their printed Books and Sermons, in which it would be a very eaſie taſk to remark to you ſeveral things,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62453:30"/>
which would clearly convince them to be men that regard not ſo much to preach the truth in ſincerity, as to gull their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors into an high eſteem and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of them, by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Notions that they treat them withal. But, Sir, our late reading the Excellent Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate</hi> will ſpare me (I think) that pains, ſince the memory of thoſe inſtances is yet I ſuppoſe freſh with you. I ſhall therefore only propoſe this to you or any other that will but read thoſe things: Whether ever any things were more plainly contrived to pleaſe the fleſh; to bolſter up mens hopes of Heaven upon ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier terms, to decry and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the narrow way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſts commands, and indeed to ſupercede wholly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62453:30"/>
any neceſſity of regarding any Evangelical Precepts? He that but conſiders the inferences that the Preacher there makes from that Text, <hi>Iſah.</hi> 40. 11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a Sheepherd, he ſhall gather the Lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young;</hi> which Text yet he is not affraid to ſay the ſpirit of Chriſt brought to his hands, and that his Soul had taſted much ſweetneſs by what Chriſt gave in upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>I ſay, he that but reads that ſtuff, I know not preſently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould fay, it will more tempt his Gravity to ſmile, or excite his Paſſion to bewail the miſery of thoſe, that ſhall ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſuch an Impoſtor, and the infelicity of the times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62453:31"/>
ſuch ſhall be permitted to infect and poiſon peoples Souls. Would ever any but a Madman, or worſe, have given encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to people to come full of ſin and wickedneſs unto Chriſt? and proclaimed his readineſs of accepting all that can but cry <hi>Meih,</hi> though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch great Whores or ſwell'd with wickedneſs? What excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent interpretations the fleſh will make of ſuch illation, is too too eaſie to predict. And indeed the effects have anſwer'd the probabilities; men have learned an art of believing they ſhall be ſaved and accepted by Chriſt, if they can but hope luſtily, though they be never ſo notorious workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; nay the bigger they are with ſin, the more acceptable they ſhall be to him. And lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62453:31"/>
better Inferences can be made from that other ſo famed a perſon, that the ſame Author inſtanceth in: For Gods ſake tell me, what ſenſe can be made of all that canting, of running to the Promiſe, and ſucking of the Promiſe, and lying flat upon the Promiſe, when there's not one word of attending to the condition of it, ſo much as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Or what inference (I pray) can be drawn from it, but this? that if a perſon can have but the courage, to venture boldly upon a promiſe without more ado, he ſhall be accepted by Chriſt Jeſus?</p>
            <p>There is no doubt, Sir, but theſe precious promiſes are the Chriſtian's great Treaſure, his ſtay and his Comfort. But ſurely he that honeſtly directs people to affiance in them, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62453:32"/>
them that theſe are but conditionals, and 'tis folly to expect the performance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the terms upon which that is made: that it will be found at laſt a damning Adultery, to hug and careſs the promiſes, while men regard not at all the Precepts, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly paſs them by, and leave them to neglect and oblivion.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, that theſe things are truly and juſtly charged upon theſe perſons, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes ſure and evident, by referring to the very Book, and page wherein ſuch things and words are found. And if any man require more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this fact, I could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily quote him, men of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among them at this day, who either are yet alive, or whoſe memory is held pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62453:32"/>
by them. But becauſe I intend but a Letter to you and not a Treatiſe, an hours diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement upon this ſubject and no more. I ſhall paſs the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at large in ſo many printed Sermons and licenſed Books of theirs, as I eaſily could. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly propoſe to your thoughts, and your Companies notice, the conſideration of ſome remarkable Doctrines that lye ſparſedly up and down in theſe Books.</p>
            <p>And firſt what think you of the great pains ſome have taken in perſwading people to look to their election? and endeavour by all means to ſecure that in the firſt place? and of the great motive added to enforce this perſwaſion? <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Becauſe then their greateſt work is done in a manner, their great fear is over,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62453:33"/>
for then they are ſafe; they need never doubt any danger of falling away; they need not be further troubled, for their ſins ſhall not, nay cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice them, and however it is at preſent, yet the event at laſt will be certainly joyful.</p>
            <p>I condemn not all preaching about this matter, but I would have it done in the Apoſtolical method: firſt, mind people of their calling, perſwade them to adorn that, to walk anſwerable to the rules and purpoſes of that, and then tell them if you pleaſe, that by this means they ſhall aſſure their election. Let them not trouble themſelves ſo much to pry into Gods ſecrets, as betake themſelves to their own duty. He that walketh humbly with his God, and through his Grace continueth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62453:33"/>
in the paths of Mercy, and Righteouſneſs, let him not doubt, but he ſhall be ſafe, and his name found written in the Book of Life.</p>
            <p>This procedure were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and honeſt, when the other is directly conducive; firſt to nouriſh a needles curioſity, and bold groundleſs preſumption, and afterwards to cauſe a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs remiſsneſs about any thing further.</p>
            <p>But I wiſh this were the worſt, they were chargable withal. What think you of the accounts we have from theſe men of the buſineſs of juſtification, by a bare empty Faith? a Faith that is to do no more but barely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, and boldly lay hold on his Salvation, and ſtrongly believe it ſelf juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? How often have you heard
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62453:34"/>
that abuſed Text of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4. 5. Suborned to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize and defend this looſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? <hi>He that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi> What wild and horrible inferences have we known made from theſe words? How often have we heard the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that particular act of it, the believing againſt Hope, made a pattern and preſident of the Faith that juſtifieth? and this inference made from it, that a man muſt believe to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd even againſt Hope, <hi>i. e.</hi> He muſt firmly believe he ſhall enjoy all the bleſſed priviledges of Chriſts Incarnation, Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Interceſſion againſt all imaginable probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; contrary to all rational
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62453:34"/>
grounds of Hope, and indeed wholly contrary to all the fixed Orders and Laws of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: As if that Faith that could believe impoſſibilities were the the only ſaving one. If this be true, what can the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Sinner deſire more? who is he that will breathe after an active Faith, ſuch an one as is to work by Love? which the ſame Apoſtle calls keeping Chriſts Commands, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he counts all Faith vain and damning. And indeed he is told by theſe men, that ſuch a Faith is needleſs, all the work of Faith is only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt hath done all for him. You know the Book in which theſe things are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> aſſerted, and if any require it, I ſhall quote the place of it, and yet this Book is printed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62453:35"/>
with the particular commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams of Mr. <hi>Caryll,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stronge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sprigge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prittie,</hi> all of them conſiderable perſons in their Party; and I cannot omit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding of you, what an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Title it hath uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: no worſe I aſſure you than the <hi>Marrow of modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Conſonant to this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, you will find ſome other pieces of theſe Mens Divinity, as that, (for Example) That good Works, Holineſs of Life, the Vow of Obedience, &amp;c. are not at all neceſſary as to the buſineſs of procuring Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But yet indeed (for meer ſhame will force them to ſay ſomething here) they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the juſtified perſon by way of gratitude, and upon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62453:35"/>
that account the man is obliged to them; but otherwiſe the great benefit depends not at all upon them, but is allready, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of theſe things can be thought on, done for him. Juſt as the ten Lepers (you know) were equally cured, though but one returned to give thanks to his Phyſitian. And truly, Sir, if this Doctrine be allowed; if all the obligation to holineſs be only ingenuity, Let men be but aſſured that this cure ſhall be wrought for them, Leave but the return unto their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, and I dare ſecure you, the odds ſhall ſtill continue, and for one civil and grateful Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane, there ſhall allways be (at leaſt) nine unthankful Jews.</p>
            <p>And no very great matter if there be ſo, for in theſe mens Opinions even this ingratitude
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62453:36"/>
ſhall fix no great guilt upon the man, nor at all hazard his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And what do you think the reaſon is? why a goodly one truly; God ſeeth no fins in his people, and this is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the words of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Conjurer, <hi>he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Iniquity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs in</hi> Iſrael. And upon this account it cometh to paſs, that the groſſeſt acts of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſuch as in another man deſerves no favourabler a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter than damning impieties; yet, when committed by thoſe that can by this Faith believe themſelves Saints, ſhall paſs under the fine name, of the Saints infirmities, unavoidable ſlips, and ſuch as the lap of Chriſts merciful Mantle will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily cover, and conceal from the eyes of his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62453:36"/>
And here I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear tranſcribing to you one paſſage out of the lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Book. You ſhall find the good <hi>Evangeliſta</hi> inſtructing his <hi>Neophytus</hi> in theſe words. <q>In caſe you be at any time by reaſon of the weakneſs of your Faith, and ſtrength of your temptations, drawn aſide, and prevailed with to tranſgreſs any of Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, beware you do not thereupon take occaſion to call Chriſts love to you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion, but believe as firmly, that he loveth you as dearly as he did before you thus tranſgreſſed: for this is a certain Truth: As no good in you, or done by you, did, or can move Chriſt to love you the more, ſo no evil in you, or done by you, can
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62453:37"/>
move him to love you the leſs.</q> I pray, Sir, tell me, is not here an excellent Evangeliſt? I dare aſſure you none of all the four in our Bibles are like him: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe words need no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will puzle the Devil to invent plainer, or thoſe that ſhall more ſtrongly nouriſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs and preſumption. Theſe will eaſily reconcile Saintſhip and the groſſeſt impieties, and render men prone to believe, that the moſt deteſtable Crimes cannot blot their evidences for Heaven; ſeeing theſe may be but the ſtains of beloved Sons. And, Sir, if you conſult the 39<hi>th.</hi> page of the <hi>Evangelium Armatum,</hi> you'll find the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor quoting the words of a greater perſon among theſe men, than ever the Author of that Book was, whoſe aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62453:37"/>
there, can by no art what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be conſtrued to any better ſenſe, than the former. Where, Drunkenneſs, nay this often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, Lying, raſh Unchriſtian Rayling, Diſobedience to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, Schiſm, Sacriledge <hi>(i. e.</hi> wronging the Church) are aſſerted to be conſiſtent with true grace, and competent to a truly godly perſon. Nay a man muſt exceed <hi>Peter's</hi> Perjury, <hi>Lot</hi>'s Drunkenneſs and repeated Inceſt, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s groſs Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and ſtrange uncleanneſs with 700. Wives and 300. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, or elſe not merit the name of a notorious ungodly perſon. And now, Sir, if theſe things be true the Daughters of <hi>Gath</hi> may well dance, no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine needs fear the divine vengeance. Theſe things are evidences too clear of what I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62453:38"/>
contend for; and yet (if you'll promiſe to have patience) I'll caſt in ſome others more. And what ſay you to this Doctrine in the firſt place. That a man may ſafely follow Providence contrary to ſome known Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts? and that God many times calls his people, by ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts of his Providence to follow him in untrodden ways, nay prohibited paths? No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence was ever ſafelier drawn from any poſition, than this may from this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is lawful and juſt to venture upon a forbidden action, when Providence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a fair and ſafe opportunity, and a promiſing ſucceſs. What is this but even the old Pagan Maxim, that even <hi>Tully</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deteſts. <hi>Proſperum ſcelus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur virtus?</hi> and God muſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62453:38"/>
needs be thought to approve that, which in his wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he is pleaſed to permit to attain ſucceſs. How often have we been told (in ſome ſolemn Sermons of Thankſgiving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late long Parliament) by thoſe great Maſters in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (for none elſe ever preached before them at ſuch times) that now God had plainly decided the controverſie, and all might ſee (but the obſtinately blind) who had the juſter part of the quarrel. You will find the Learned <hi>Hammond</hi> purpoſely writing a Treatiſe againſt this fancy, and all men might ſee that there was a cauſe, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor did not feign an Antagoniſt to combat withal; for this <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> had challenged all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now certainly, Sir, it muſt needs appear very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62453:39"/>
ſtrange, that thoſe men who had not only renounced Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, but undertook to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the very beſt reformation of Chriſtian Religion, ſhould yet ſo plainly diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Turks and Pagans, as they did in this inſtance. Who, by vertue of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, may not warrantably undertake any thing, that he hath any tollerable hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to perform? this will ſecure and juſtifie the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Law, all Juſtice, all Equity, where a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſeems to encourage. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need any of theſe mens Proſelytes doubt whether he may make this illation or no; for even theſe his Leaders have made it for him, and warranted his Logick in it. You have heard of one of them encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62453:39"/>
the Parliament and City to thoſe facinorious barbarities, in theſe words. <q>Let no Law hinder you, <hi>ſi jus violandum,</hi> if Law be broken, it is for a Crown, and therefore for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</q> As if ſucceſs in that would hallow any immoralities done for it, and that it was but weakly ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> that men might not lye and ſpeak wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly for God. And again, <q>That which is beſt, though Evil, will be counted good after Reformation as he is counted innocent who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes at tryal.</q> No matter though the action be never ſo evil now, yet when it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it's deſigned end, it will be allowed and praiſed.</p>
            <p>Give me leave, Sir, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with another pretty invention of theſe Caſuiſts, than
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62453:40"/>
which the myſtery of Jeſuitiſm never invented a neater, to warrant any vice; it's a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the great <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe of Peers. The queſtion propoſed is about the legality of taking up Arms, <hi>i. e.</hi> againſt the King, for that's the intent of it. He had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs of the Churches Weapons of old, Prayers and Tears, &amp;c. from which he brings in the doubting Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an as taking advantage, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt the lawfulneſs of uſing any other Weapons now. To which he very gravely with a profound dexterity anſwers, That Chriſtian men might be conſidered in a double capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as Chriſtians, or as Men. Now as Chriſtians (he grants) it unlawful to uſe any other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62453:40"/>
arms; but as men they might ſafely do ſo. <q>We uſe no other Weapons than theſe we have told you of, as we are Chriſtians. Theſe only are proper and peculiar to us as meer Chriſtians; but the Weapons that we enjoy as we are Chriſtians, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of thoſe we enjoy in the capacity of men. And we challenge in this no more, than we might lawfully uſe, if we were Papiſts or Turks, if we were Pagans, Jews, or Indians.</q> And truly, let me tell you, in this he ſpeaks a great Truth, let men be Turks, Pagans, or Infidels, nay Devils, they can do no worſe, in this truly they quite put off the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Chriſtians, and ſhew clearly 'twas the Devil that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Mantle of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62453:41"/>
Prophet. How happy were all profligate Chriſtians if this Plea or Salvo would hold! what a Fool were he that could not tell God Almighty, that his debaucheries and villanies were not committed by him as a Chriſtian, but as a man? and therefore though the man were culpable, yet the Chriſtian was innocent and might be ſaved. Tell me ſoberly, did you ever in all your reading, meet with a Quirk of more miſchievous conſequence to all the purpoſes of goodneſs and vertue? or which might with more eaſe be extended to the excuſing and defending of any or all the groſſeſt anomies, that ever were or could be committed by any that can but call himſelf a Chriſtian? Well fare thee <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall,</hi> ſay I, thy Diſciples may well
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62453:41"/>
thank thee, and celebrate thy memory; never man ſmooth'd the way to Heaven more than thou haſt done; never might a Conſcience be quieted upon eaſier terms. Thou ſhalt never be called more the <hi>Geneva Bull</hi> (by my conſent) that only leads the herd to water; but the <hi>Monoceros</hi> rather; dip but this Horn into any water; and all may confidently drink of it without fear of poyſon; this will make any thing wholeſom.</p>
            <p>And yet, Sir, as excellent a Salvo as this is for a troubled Conſcience, I think I can tell you of another that cometh very little ſhort of it. It is that which the moſt excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the decay of Chriſtian Piety among us, hath taken notice of for us. And that it may looſe nothing of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62453:42"/>
elegancy and weight by my imperfect reporting of it, I ſhall borrow his own words to expreſs it in. <q>I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that method that hath been uſed to quiet ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, be not apt to ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie more, when I ſee one who from his preſent Reigning Sins, regularly infers the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his State, that is yet by his Caſuiſt diverted from that proſpect, and bid look back to ſee whether no part of his life afforded any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of true Grace, and if he can but remember any ſuch time, is warranted to make that his <hi>Epocha</hi> from whence to date his infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; is told that that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Seed though it may be covered, yet cannot be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62453:42"/>
choaked, but will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſpring up into eternal life. When I ſay, I ſee this eaſie remedy preſcribed to his fears, 'twill be obvious for me to compound my ſelf a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy from the ſame ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, to fix my eye upon ſome mark of Regeneration, which at ſome time or other I either have, or phancied to have had upon me, and with the ſtedfaſt beholding of that, as of the Brazen Serpent, be fortified againſt all the venom of my fiery luſts. Caſt in this one ſtick, and with it ſweeten all the Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> ſecure me againſt all the bitter ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of my preſent guilts.</q> I need make no addition to this good mans complaint, we ſhall not need to call in the help of any <hi>Augur</hi> to tell us, what a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62453:43"/>
influence this is probable, nay certain to have upon mens practice. For who is he whoſe Conſcience hath been always ſo callous, as not ſometimes to awake him, and put him upon ſorrow and holy reſolves? where's the Sinner to be found, whoſe Paroxiſms have been ſo conſtant, as never to afford him any lucid intervals? it will be a difficult taſk to aſſign any ſuch an one eſpecially when we call to mind, that even a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> though the ſignal inſtance for hardneſs of heart (by reaſon both of his own natural reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute wilfulneſs, and of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree, ſuper-induced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that by a juſt punitive act of God) yet at ſome times appears as a real Convert, confeſſeth his Sin, deprecates the juſtly deſerved wrath, promiſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62453:43"/>
for the future, and begs the holy mans Prayers for the obtaining of a bleſſing. It is ſcarcely to be imagined, but that the moſt prodigiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Chriſtian, can call to mind ſometimes, in which ſome better things have forced way into his thoughts. And if he can do this (in theſe mens Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity) he is ſafe, the Seed of God remains in him, this may ſuppreſs all fears of his preſent guilt, or future danger, if he can but ſit ſtill, and be content, God will in time work his own work, and he may reſt aſſured that he ſhall at laſt become an accepted Saint.</p>
            <p>But yet this is not ſo eaſie a way to conclude a man in the poſſibility of Saintſhip, but yet I can repreſent to you another as eaſie that will clearly evince
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62453:44"/>
the actuality, and prove a man really to be a Saint allready; and that is a ſtout oppoſing of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſeperating from the Communion of <hi>Sodom.</hi> I will not ſtay to obſerve to you that the great Charity of theſe men could afford no better names than theſe, not only to <hi>Rome,</hi> but to their Mother the Church of <hi>England.</hi> She was ſpiritual <hi>Sodom,</hi> the <hi>Babylon</hi> out of which the Saints were to flee; her Liturgy as bad as the Maſs; her Prieſts, Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> and dumb Dogs; all her Ceremonies plain rags of Anti-Chriſt: and the whole Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution a limb of the Beaſt, and the myſtery of iniquity. That which I am more concerned in, is to let you underſtand not only what a neceſſity hath been preached up of oppoſing this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62453:44"/>
Whore, and flying all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her, leſt men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of her ſins; but what great weight hath been laid upon ſo doing: this hath been ſufficient to aſſure Saintſhip, and to evince a man an undoubted Child of God. He that could have given but ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence of this, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of his having been any way inſtrumental in pulling down the Walls of this <hi>Babylon,</hi> of aſſiſting and promoting the Cauſe, of helping the Lord againſt the mighty. I ſay, he that could but produce any evidence of this, in the late Times, needed plead no more for his Canonization. One ſuch Heroick act of piety as this was as effectual to obtain his being cryed up for a holy Saint, amongſt theſe men heretofore,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62453:45"/>
as two or three counterfeit Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and a large ſum beſide could be to obtain a mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Canonized in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was eſteemed ſo meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious an act as would (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt) attone and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate all other crimes. This ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zeal would not only bring a bleſſing upon the <hi>Phinehas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but entail it alſo upon his whole Houſe, and obtain it the name of a very godly Family. One ſignal expreſſion of this love to their poor Sion, would certainly cover a multitude of the greateſt Sins. It will be needleſs and troubleſom to you, to refer you to all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which this is laid down as a ſure mark of a Saint, I will only tell you, time was, when no leſs perſons than the great
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62453:45"/>
Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it as marks, the one of his integrity, at his Tryal, and the other of his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in his Apology againſt Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> And the Author of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, you know, offers to make it evident, (and if he did not, another eaſily might) that the taking the ſolemn League and Covenant was made generally a ſign of holineſs, and thoſe looked upon as the Dogs of the World, not worthy of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Crums (the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Law) that refuſed to ſwear to it. I am apt to imagine you will look upon this as an extra-canonical rule to judge Saintſhip by, and ſuch as our great Maſter no where gives the leaſt warrant for, or intimation of. And indeed 'twere very ſtrange if he ſhould;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62453:46"/>
Pride and Covetouſneſs, and a greedy Revenge might as ſafely be put into the Saints evidences for Heaven, as this. For I dare aſſert it no impoſſible thing to demonſtrate that ſome one, or all of thoſe, have been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſes and Parents of this. Some men were too proud to brook ſuperiority, and ſome were covetous, and the Church was thought too rich; and ſome had miſſed preferment (as 'twas once told the great <hi>Calamy)</hi> or received (as they thought) ſome other injury, from the Church, and to revenge theſe (as <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Novatus</hi> of old) reſolved to work (to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) her final ruin. And truly the temptation was fair, ſince that was the Charecteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick note of a Saint and true Son of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and the way to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62453:46"/>
ſecure a better name, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son or Daughter of the Church could enjoy. Certainly if this evidence were real and infallible, they had a mighty multitude of Saints, and more than any ſober man can poſſibly grant them. And (to conclude this reflexion) if this be to be a Saint, <hi>Sit anima mea cum Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtay you longer in inſtancing in other pretty Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of theirs, as the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of the promiſes, than which, never was a fairer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let for a bold inert preſumption. The Recumbency and rowling upon a naked Chriſt, than which (as the people underſtood it) never was a Doctrine better fitted to cry down (or diſpenſe with the neglect of) any great care of real holineſs. I am
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62453:47"/>
afraid, I have tyred you with theſe inſtances already, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you too much cauſe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that ever they ſhould find Patrons among thoſe that called themſelves of the Reformed Religion. I ſhall therefore add no more, but only two ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations <hi>ex abundanti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt of all I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently dare to tell you, that for one Sermon of Obedience, I will ſhew you twenty of Faith; for one Sermon that you can ſhew me preached by theſe men upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. I will ſhew you ten upon that <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. for one Sermon of Juſtice (unleſs in that horrid Notion, in which 'twas cryed for, and preached up againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and at laſt againſt the beſt of Kings) of mercy, of walking
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62453:47"/>
humbly with God, of abiding in our own Calling, and doing our own work; of meekneſs and ſtudying to be quiet, &amp;c. I will undertake to ſhew you forty againſt curſed Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, againſt Laodicean Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, about the marks of Saints, about the excellency of Faith, about getting into Chriſt, &amp;c. Some of which ſeem to eſtabliſh wickedneſs by a Law, and none of which teach men a neceſſity of practical holineſs; but prompt them to a new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal kind of Religion, and an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier and nearer way to Heaven and its bliſs, than ever the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages knew of. I know theſe perſons (if any ſhould ever chance to ſee theſe Papers) will be forward to juſtifie ſome of theſe ſubjects, that I ſeem to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their Sermons for treating
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62453:48"/>
ſo commonly of; And ſo will I alſo, but it is with this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, provided that they dwell not thus in generals, but proceed plainly to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ways and methods in which ſuch duties are to be done. God forbid, that either you or I ſhould be thought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that condemn all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Faith, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to people to endeavour to get an intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus. No, Sir, I know theſe are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wholſom theams; but what I condemn is mens roving in general about theſe things; which indeed may work upon mens Paſſions, heat their heads, but not at all rightly inform the judgment, nor benefit the life of action. What benefit gain I by hearing a loud Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue about the excellency of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62453:48"/>
Faith? the happineſs of being intereſted in Chriſt? while I neither am told the true nature of the one, nor directed to the right and proper means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the other? And here, Sir, there comes into my head, an Advice which the late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> gave his Clergy at a publick Viſitation (it is printed with many others, which I heartily wiſh all our Spiritual men would diligently peruſe and Regard) very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to our preſent buſineſs. <q>Do not ſpend your Sermons in general and indefinite things, as in Exhortations to the people to get Chriſt, to be united unto Chriſt, and things of the like unlimited ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But tell them in every duty what are the meaſures, what circumſtances, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62453:49"/>
and what is the particular minute meaning of every advice. For generals not explicated, do but fill the peoples heads with empty No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their mouths with perpetual unintelligible talk; but their hearts remain emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and themſelves are not edified.</q> There's a great deal of ſpiritual prudence in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and truly as much truth in the reaſon to enforce it. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals affect very little, and to talk of getting into Chriſt, and rowling upon Chriſt, &amp;c. is but like ſhooting at Rovers, which indeed may exerciſe peoples eyes, divert them a little while, find them ſomething to talk high of, and contend about, but very rarely or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hits the true mark. Let them but treat of theſe things,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62453:49"/>
according to the precedent advice, and they ſhall never find me in the number of their accuſers. But otherwiſe I ſhall take liberty to tell them, that theſe being handled in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſual method, ſerve but to entoxicate peoples heads, and divert them from the main and great buſineſs of Religion, which is keeping the commands of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>I can ſcarce forbear here to acquaint you with another pretty practice of theſe men, and that is, the judging mens ſanctity, the truth of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, by a certain mode and form of ſpeaking. I do not mean the Dramatiſt's twang of Noſe (though you cannot but have obſerved how modiſh that was once among the Saints, and you know the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62453:50"/>
Doctor at <hi>Oxford</hi> we once counted perfect in it) but a peculiar way of wording things: by which men ſhould be judged by them, as the <hi>Gileadites</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Children of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> of old by <hi>Shiboleth</hi> at the paſſages of <hi>Jordan.</hi> I know the man (and could bring him to atteſt what I am going to tell you) that having before the late pack of Fryars, given a handſom and rational account of his converſion, was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs diſmiſſed without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or any hopes thereof; 'till he was inſtructed by one more ingenuous than the reſt (and afterwards by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune made his friend) what the reaſon was; which was this. What he had delivered to his Brethren was fair and plauſible, but it took not, for want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62453:50"/>
worded in the ſanctified language; for whereas he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of Chriſt Jeſus, and his Saviour, &amp;c. he ſhould have ſaid the Lord Chriſt, the Lord Chriſt, &amp;c. which when he readily uſed the ſecond time of audience, he preſently paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and was accepted as a Saint of the right faſhion. Sir, what conſequences may be drawn from theſe things, will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the meaneſt Logician, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe men ſtrangely debauched Chriſtianity, and had other meaſures to judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others by, than thoſe in the Goſpel. But this is not</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to advert, but this, upon this account you ſhall find thoſe men openly traduced, publickly defamed and oppoſed; who
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62453:51"/>
honeſtly purſuing and deſigning the intereſts of mens Souls, and keeping cloſe to the great Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and deſign of Chriſtianity, have bent all their endeavours to plant a real holineſs in men, and taught them, that all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of a future happineſs without it, were groundleſs and vain. I will give you two inſtances of this, which I know you will remember. One is Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the writing of his excellent Practical Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm. If you conſult the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Papers between him, and Mr. <hi>Cheynell,</hi> you will eaſily find what the chief matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie were. The Learned Catechiſt is for exalting the Evangelical Precepts, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts our Saviours ſetting the former commands at a higher pitch, as requiring a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62453:51"/>
degree and meaſure of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, than ever was called for under the Judaical Oeconomy. And in this he ſhews himſelf not to be ſingular, but conſonant to the whole ſtream of Antiquity, as his many Quotations make clear and evident. Now what good Chriſtian will gainſay this? or quarrel with the good man for aſſerting of it? Yet this doth Mr. <hi>Cheynell,</hi> for fear (forſooth) leſt the Law of God ſhould be diſparag'd hereby; which <hi>David</hi> voucheth to have been pure and perfect. And ſo doubtleſs it was for that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, till the fulneſs of time for a further and clearer mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation was come. Another conteſt is about the buſineſs of Juſtification, and whether the Catechiſts Doctrine in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62453:52"/>
or Mr. <hi>Cheynell</hi>'s, be moſt conducive to the real pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of holy living, or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating the neceſſity of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Sanctity, I ſhall readily truſt you or any conſidering perſon to judge. But I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I ſhould be railed at as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to Mr. <hi>Cheynel</hi> and the party, ſhould I not tell you, that beſides theſe, there was another matter controverted in thoſe Papers, which was about the prime Notion of the third Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Where the Doctor ſeems to allow a greater liberty of ſwearing and profaning Gods name, than Mr. <hi>Cheynell.</hi> But as to this, it is eaſie to obſerve that malice only framed the accuſation, of which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſufficiently clears himſelf, and his whole Doctrine in all other inſtances, may aſſure and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62453:52"/>
warrant any mans ſafety, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his Compurgator in it. I will not here add, what might be too juſtly charged upon Mr. <hi>Cheynel</hi> and that party, that their great care of that Precept, and the two others, between which it is placed in the Decalogue, will advantage them very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, towards being eſteemed great preſſors of Holineſs, while they appear ſo very regardleſs of the other commands of the ſecond Table. I will readily confeſs indeed, never any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men cryed out low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt Idoll-worſhip. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were there men that ſeemed more to fear an Oath in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary converſe (though perjury were a ſmall thing). Never men appeared more ſollicitous leſt the Sabbath ſhould be profaned. But if you'l not be ſatisfied with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62453:53"/>
their reſpect to theſe three Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, if you'll not count them holy perſons upon theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts only, you ſhall ſcarcely have more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor any juſter cauſe to give them that title, than you would have to call that Jew an holy perſon, whoſe hands were full of bribery and blood, yet thought it piacular to pronounce the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Alas! Sir, its an old trick, and very few have been more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the true deſign and purport of Religion; to ſeem zealous towards God, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of men, to be mighty exact as to Matters of Piety, but quite neglective of honeſty. And the reaſon may eaſily be gheſſed at; there's little of difficulty, little of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, little oppoſition of a mans dear intereſts in theſe things, in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62453:53"/>
compariſon of what there is in being righteous, and juſt, and chaſt, and merciful, and charitable, &amp;c. and therefore as of old, thoſe engroſſed the whole, the all of the Jews care, as things that would expiate and attone (they thought) theſe ſmaller guilts; ſo we have ſeen it of late amongſt theſe people, no men have been more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to appear ſplendid and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their piety towards God, whilſt Juſtice and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Integrity and Uprightneſs, have been neglected as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute things, and no way becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new Saints.</p>
            <p>Another parallel inſtance I ſhall give you, is of Mr. <hi>Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> in his late excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the deſign of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. How very ill this Book hath comported with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62453:54"/>
of theſe men, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the clamours raiſed againſt it: that it would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the merits of Chriſt Jeſus, injurious to Gods free Grace, and would teach men to take off their eyes from Chriſt, and to build their hopes of Salvation upon their own endeavours; and upon theſe accounts, and for theſe great Reaſons, a Book muſt preſently be written againſt it, to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote the infection and poyſon, that otherwiſe the people might ſuck from it. I am not concerned to ſhew you, how utterly cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unjuſt theſe ſurmiſes were, the Gentleman is able enough to vindicate himſelf, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially from ſuch accuſors; that which is more pertinent for me, is by this to let you ſee, which way the humour of theſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62453:54"/>
people leads. They had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a more eaſie way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but this Book would diſcover and betray the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, ſhew the people, how they had been gull'd and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and perhaps in time open their eyes and make them wiſe; turn their preſent great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe their Leaders into a juſt indignation, and cauſe them in a little time to deteſt thoſe as men not worthy to live, whom at preſent they can eſteem little leſs than Gods; to whom they can readily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice even all their goods. And (to add a little more ſtrength to this inſtance) you know, we have been informed how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſped among them, for daring to juſtifie the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Book. Though (methinks this may be ſaid for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62453:55"/>
him to his Brethren, that he hath done it with as great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as many diſtinctions, as ſtudious a wearineſs of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Palladium,</hi> as wit can poſſibly contrive. Yet for all this even he cannot eſcape a ſuſpitious cenſure. From whence 'tis obvious to collect, that this is the <hi>noli me tangere,</hi> this is the Taliſman that ſecures the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples affection to them. And therefore muſt with all poſſible care and ſecreſie be preſerved; this is that great <hi>Diana</hi> againſt whom not a word ſhall be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but there ſhall preſently be a tumult amongſt theſe Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Smiths, who live by making and ſelling ſhrines of this great Goddeſs. For, Sir, I dare be confident and peremptory in this belief, that it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any perſon of true
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62453:55"/>
Chriſtian Principles to quarrel or be offended with the great Aſſertion of that Book; but that other conſiderations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage men into an oppoſition of it, and particularly that which I have been all this while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to prove theſe men guilty of, <hi>i. e.</hi> the love of a dry empty Notional eaſie way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Religion. And this I aſſign as the firſt (and indeed main) Cauſe of what we are enquiring after. In which if I have been too prolix, forgive me, and your trouble ſhall be ſhorter in the reſt that follow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Reaſon of this may poſſibly be a mighty ſhew of Zeal in all religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Of this you will find theſe men always moſt careful; and truly but for this there were nothing extraordinary in their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62453:56"/>
Religion; nothing to tempt men into an admiration of it. And therefore by this they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to conceal, or ſupply the defects and imperfections of it; that what is wanting in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and reallity, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by appearance and page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry. How ſucceſsful a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod this is to captivate the minds of the people, he is of no obſervation that cannot tell you. Pompous ſhews and fair appearances do mightily affect and work upon the multitude; and more ſtrongly enchant their admiration and charm their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, than the moſt ſolid and excellent things, when not attended with theſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious repreſentations. It was not without good reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved long ſince by <hi>Tully;</hi> and others before him,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62453:56"/>
that Geſture is the thing moſt principally to be regarded by an Orator; ſince a man that is lucky in that, and by it hits the humour of his Auditory, ſhall prevail more thereby, than by ten of the moſt rational Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that he can fortifie his deſigned perſwaſion withal. The people generally judge with their eyes; and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median too truly repreſents many as beholding with their mouths: and therefore cunning men uſe to intrap them by complying with this humour, by treating them with things gorgeous and fair; and inſtead of dealing rationally with their judgments, entertain them only with ſuch things, as may cauſe them to ſtare and admire, and by this means commonly are ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:62453:57"/>
You cannot but oftentimes (as you have walked out into the Fields about <hi>Oxford)</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one pretty ſleight that the Fowlers have to catch Larks withal; which is, by fixing a red Croſs, ſet thick with little pieces of a Looking-Glaſs, near their Nets, in a bright Sun-ſhine Morning: this mightily gliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and caſting abroad a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appearance, draws the poor Lark into its admiration; which while the poor Bird ſtays to gaze upon, himſelf is eaſily Captiv'd and made a prey. I know you'l pardon the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Emblem; for ſo have I ſeen the Hunters for Souls uſe a method not much unlike to this: which is, by all means to make a fair ſhew, a very great amazing appearance, which while ſilly people have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62453:57"/>
ſtared at, they have ſoon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and by that means been eaſily enſnared, not only to eſpouſe the errours, but revere and honour the perſons of the ſubtil Impoſtors. And that I may bring this diſcourſe cloſe to the preſent inſtance; it is obvious to obſerve, that among all the inſtances of pageantry in Religion, there is none that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers have been more careful of, and ſucceſsful in; than a mighty loud Zeal, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fervency of Spirit, in all their religious performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In this (you will find) they have always endeavour'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the true ſervants of God, and thereby hoped to diſparage them. Let me preſent you with one inſtance of this, recorded in the Old Teſtament, it is the carriage of the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:62453:58"/>
in that famous Sacrifice of theirs, wherein they contended for honour and reſpect with the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> before King <hi>Ahab</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If you read the ſtory ('tis recorded 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.) you will ſoon find, how for all the marks and ſigns of a great fervent Zeal, they far exceeded even <hi>Elijah</hi> himſelf; who yet (you know) is looked upon as the great and chief inſtance of the Zealotick Spirit. They addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Sacrifice with all poſſible ſigns of a great and grave ſeriouſneſs, performed it with all the marks of a raptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tranſported Zeal, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their ſupplications ſeveral hours, even with the moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate fervency, nay ſeem ſo far beſides themſelves by the vehemency of their Zeal, as to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62453:58"/>
cut and gaſh themſelves, and turn cruel unto, and regardleſs of their own fleſh: While on the other ſide, the Prophet calmly betakes himſelf to the repairing of Gods Altar, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and without noiſe orders his Sacrifice, and offers up his devotion evenly, in a Prayer more conciſe and ſhort than that of our Saviour. Tell me, Sir, which of theſe the people were moſt likely to ſlave at and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire? Sure its no difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conjecture. How could they miſtruſt the Religion of ſuch zealous devoters? how could they chuſe almoſt but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the zeal and fervour of ſuch worſhippers? prefer theſe Idolatrous Prieſts, before the Lords Prophet? and the gliſtering and amazing ſervice and worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> before the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62453:59"/>
leſs pompous ſervice of the God of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> If the ſucceeding mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle had not umpired the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, I can eaſily foreſee on which ſide the votes would have fallen.</p>
            <p>How well the ignominious name of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts (which with ſo much virulency they have caſt upon the Orthodox Clergy heretofore) may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come theſe Preachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in other reſpects, I ſhall not contend; but in this (I fear) you may truly ſay, <hi>Ovo prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati eodem,</hi> they ſeem very near of Kin, and both to have the ſame art and method of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. What have you thought of theſe men, when you have beheld the ſtrange antick ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, the ludicrous poſtures of ſome addreſſing themſelves to Prayer? the ſtrange amazing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62453:59"/>
violencies that ſome have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelves into, in that performance? So as even to hale and gaſp for breath at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry period, while the poor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring people below, have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theſe for mighty agitations of the Spirit, and been as ready to adore when the men came down, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were <hi>Moſes,</hi> after his glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God in the Mount.</p>
            <p>How often have you ſeen a Preacher heat himſelf, beyond the need of any veſtments? throwing off his Cloak, nay and his Gloves too, as great impediments to the holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, ſqueeking, and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the example of any Lunatick. Sometimes ſpeaking in a tolerable tone, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently again crying out as if under ſome immediate diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62453:60"/>
While the people with great amazement have gaped upon him, and when he hath finiſhed, given him this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Encomium,</hi> well, hee's a rare man, a man mighty zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the Lord, a powerful Preacher, and one that hath taken abundance of pains that day; to the cheriſhing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of whoſe wearied Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the female Proſelytes are commonly very actively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributive.</p>
            <p>If any man be ſo uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards me, as to imagine me an Enemy to Zeal in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious performances, upon the account of this period, or that this diſcourſe intends the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging a fervency of Spirit in ſerving the Lord; I ſhall take the freedom to tell him, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably miſtakes both. No
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62453:60"/>
man more heartily wiſheth, that all the Clergy would be grave, and ſerious, and zealous in all their publick ſervices, and you can witneſs for me how much I have lamented, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times freely blamed ſome mens remiſsneſs and coldneſs herein: but this I will readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to all ſuch perſons, that as I have an Apoſtolick War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for commending of Zeal only in a good matter; ſo I think I have the ſame, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the expreſſions of it, in a due manner alſo, with which (I am apt to believe) the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical ludicrous poſtures of ſome men, do no way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be influential on this buſineſs, is a very great ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeeming Sanctity in carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62453:61"/>
and common deportment. Sir, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Sheeps-Cloathing hath always been worn by all the Wolves that have broke into the Church, and the Spirit of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Schiſm, hath ever been careful to appear in the garb of an Angel of Light. If you ſhould ſearch all the Eccleſiaſtical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, you would conſtantly find, that allmoſt all the Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaerks that have diſturbed the Church and its peace, have ever been extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Sanctity; ſometimes in their Doctrines, but allways in their carriage; and under this vizard and diſguiſe have done moſt miſchief. For though all novelties are ſtrangely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the inconſiderate multitude (who are even natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally new-fangled and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62453:61"/>
yet when they appear thus dreſſed and habited, then they quite faſcinate, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charm their high opinions and admiration; they are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn to wonder at and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol them. And truly when they are once brought into theſe circumſtances, they are then as heated wax, ready to receive any impreſſion, that their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Leaders ſhall pleaſe to ſtamp them with. This our great Enemy knowing very well, hath taken great care all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſend forth his Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this garb: and therefore, you know, the great Apoſtle in his characteriſing of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, omits not, to put this into the deſcription, that they have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a very great and glorious form and ſhew of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62453:62"/>
I ſhall not bring my Charity in queſtion, by diſputing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe perſons <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may not well admit the diminutive attendant <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or no. I am certain then (if ever this came to the notice of any of them) I ſhould be exclaimed againſt, as a condemnor of the Saints, and one that ſpoke againſt the Generation of Gods Children. But this I will tell you, that if it be but a Form, yet 'tis well trimmed; if all be only perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, the Actors are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Comicks; if it be not <hi>caſtè,</hi> yet <hi>cautè</hi> it is; if it be only a paint, 'tis very lively: It would go near the puzling of you (I think) to inſtance in any pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaick nicety in outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which I ſhould not be able to match in theſe men. No men ever were better ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62453:62"/>
in all the little things that make a fair ſhew, in the ſight of the vulgar, and carry with them any appearance of piety: no men ever were exacter at Oral or geſtural Sanctity than they are. What their hearts are, God and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences know; we will not judge them.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I need not tell you, of what mighty advantage this is to them, in this inſtance of gaining reſpect from their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. I wiſh that ſome of our own Clergy, would conſider how poſſible it is that ſome of them, may be contributive here, and how by their careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they become foils the more to ſet off their Adverſaries glory. It is a wounding ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to ſee the careleſsneſs of ſome of theſe; they little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62453:63"/>
(beſides their own heavy guilt) what cauſe they give theſe Enemies to blaſpheme their holy Religion; and what advantage thoſe gain hereby towards the aſſuring their own dear reputation; they greedily gape for theſe falls, and they know how there out to ſuck no ſmall advantage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another Method by which theſe Perſons attract a great veneration from their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is, the ſuffering a ſeeming Perſecution, and that (as they endeavour to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) for Conſcience and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake. Among all the Saints, whoſe names are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and famous in the Dyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichs of the Church, there are none that have more juſtly been honoured with the higheſt <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiums,</hi> than the holy Martyrs,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62453:63"/>
who have atteſted the truth of their holy Faith by their own blood. He that can have the valour to ſuffer for his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is in the ſure way to Fame and Renown amongſt his Party.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, theſe perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evidently on the ſuffering ſide, and providence hath caſt them upon acting the ſadder Scene; the Laws are ſomething ſmart againſt them, and they may thank themſelves for it. I wiſh they would thank the goodneſs of a merciful Prince, who hath been pleaſed to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Execution of theſe Laws againſt them, and keep off the penalties which they threaten to them. However this act of Grace hath now rob'd them of this Plea; they cannot now ſure call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62453:64"/>
the perſecuted Saints. But I muſt tell you, Sir, you are deceived, if you think ſo. Alas they are ſufferers and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted party ſtill. Are they not branded with the odious name of Phanaticks? of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks? and is it not as good allmoſt to take away their lives, as their reputation? have they not, many of them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with good Livings to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Conſciences pure and untainted? Yes, and more of them than would (we know) had they not been trapan'd by the rich Cabal at <hi>London,</hi> that could live without theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; and call you not this a ſuffering now? yes and a great one too, here's ſilence in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon it, or at leaſt they hoped there would have been. Alas! the Ark is gone, and do
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62453:64"/>
not they ſuffer in its Captivity? This is a ſore Perſecution, ſuch as the Revelation tells you was to befal the Witneſſes, and all that adored and followed not the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, if we grant them to be ſufferers in earneſt, yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt count them but in jeſt, when they pretend it to be for Righteouſneſs ſake. And yet ſo (we know) they do, and by all means endeavour to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh this Opinion in their Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. They very well know, they have not a more plauſible way, by which to aſſure the people of their integrity and conſcientiouſneſs, than this is; for who can doubt him ſerious and in earneſt for his Religion, that will ſuffer for it? What mad men were we (I have heard ſome ſay) to undergo
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62453:65"/>
theſe things, but that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences oblige us thereto? ſo that you muſt needs believe them good men upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for they'll forego any thing of Worldly concern, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than violate their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and who muſt not praiſe and honour ſuch Devoto's?</p>
            <p>Alas! Sir, a conſidering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon knows this to be a very fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible mark of Integrity; and it may ſafely be aſſerted, that it is poſſible, and common to ſome men to take a pride in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We know that great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Stoiciſm, <hi>Poſſidonius,</hi> under the violent ſurpriſes of the Gout (and they ſay there are not many things more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting) could cry out, <hi>quàm ſuave, quàm dulce hoc!</hi> only out of pride that he might boaſt himſelf able to aſſert and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62453:65"/>
his own Principles: and ſurely 'tis as poſſible now for ſome men equally poſſeſſed with the ſame vice, to improve that vice to the ſame end, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the ſufferings are much eaſiler tolerable, and the gratifications of the vice much more conſiderable. For none of the afflictions pretended to by theſe men, can be near ſo tormenting as his; the Perſons are untouched, and there's no fire nor fagot to torment: and while the Stoick had but the content only to praiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol himſelf, theſe have had mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to applaud and glorifie them for their great conſtancy; yea and beſides that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make up, by their large charitable contributions, all their loſſes. So that even their loſſes turned to their advantage, and <hi>Calamy</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62453:66"/>
found three days in <hi>Newgate</hi> (as the <hi>Ano-Droll</hi> told him in effect) more gainful, than half a years Preaching at <hi>Aldermanbury.</hi> So that now we have found out another Vice, that may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be in this matter; Pride and Covetouſneſs too may have an influence upon ſome mens ſufferings: and marvail not that I add this latter, for even Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs ſometimes may be contributive to a ſeeming la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, and no man needs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee a man expend a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, when the Intereſt is ſure to be double to the Principal.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, I needed not to have taken any pains to demonſtrate the fallibillity of this Plea; no matter to the multitude, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for Conſcience or not, all the while 'tis ſuffering, they examine not the juſtice or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62453:66"/>
injuſtice; they only ſlave at the ſufferers (though perhaps ſome might ſuffer as murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or evil ſpeakers, &amp;c.) and as long as this is for the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Cauſe, they ſhall be no leſs than holy Martyrs; ſay you what you can even the late bloody Regicides have been extolled by ſome, as Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Cauſe, and <hi>Ravilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi>'s name ſhall be rubrick in the Jeſuits Calendar.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another thing that we gheſs to have a cauſality here, is their continual applauding, and commending of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and crying them up ſtill for Saints. Sir, men naturally love to be commended, and have good things ſpoken of them. And of all the noxious things that vain men are fond of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Flattery is one of the moſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62453:67"/>
acceptable. And truly it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a greater ſtock and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſobriety and prudence, than the multitude can be thought to be poſſeſſed of, to ſuppreſs all tumours of Pride, that are ſo mighty prone to ariſe upon a man hearing his own praiſe, and not to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pleaſed, and tickled with the words of a Paraſite. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Epictetus</hi> long ſince, hath laid it down as a mark of a great proficient in vertue: <gap reason="foreign">

Let a man praiſe and commend his vertue, he rather pitieth his ignorance, than proudly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to his Opinion; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes advantage thence to heighten his humility, for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch a man to miſtake, than gratifie his Pride, as if he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62453:67"/>
any ſuch commendation. And truly, Sir, He really is a very good man, who can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his being praiſed to the advantage of his humility, and exciting of his induſtry, and avoid its blowing him up into a proud conceit of over priſing his own Excellency.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, it ſeldom fares worſe with flatterers than with their meſſage; he is counted a good and acceptable man, who brings ſuch good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant tidings, and men do not more delight to hear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but they have always as much kindneſs for him that tells it. It hath long ſince filled the hearts of good men with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and their Writings are every where full of complaints, that dextrous Paraſites are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the moſt acceptable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62453:68"/>
to Princes, and indeed to all men; and therefore 'twill be the leſſer wonder, if they be ſo to the vulgar, who, as to the exerciſes of Reaſon or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are but one degree only removed from Children, to whom nothing is ſo grateful as fine words and fair commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And ſince we ſee great men ſo prone to be mightily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the praiſes given them by thoſe below them (whoſe praiſes are rarely or never ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, but ruled moſtly by Paſſion, or ſome fortuitous emergences) it will be the leſs ſtrange, to ſee theſe mightily tickled with the praiſes of their Superiours. And indeed expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience lets us clearly ſee, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaſeth the multitude like Flattery: a cunning man
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62453:68"/>
by this ſhall perſwade them to more, than by twenty good Arguments taken from Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Duty. We have ſeen the ſucceſsfulneſs of this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in our late inteſtine Wars; how cunningly did thoſe Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries Complement, and ſeek by all means to pleaſe and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the people: <hi>Vox Populi</hi> was by them aſſerted to be <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> and the popular vogue was the determination and dictate of Heaven. By this means you will find thoſe Primitive Rebels in the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> eaſily draw the people to ſide with them, all the Congregation was holy they were all Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen people, and therefore what had <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to do, to exerciſe Dominion and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over them? and all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Rebells have ever gone
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62453:69"/>
the ſame way, and the Church-Mutineers have always found the method as ſucceſsful as thoſe in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, it is notorious to all men, how mighty civil theſe perſons are to their people, how careful to careſs all their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers with the glorious names of Gods Saints; the Lords holy ones, the dear people of God, the little Flock, the Lambs of Chriſt Jeſus, the Redeemed ones of <hi>Sion,</hi> the true Remnant of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the precious elect Seed. The Notoriety of this, will ſave me the labour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring you to any Books or Sermons in which you may find theſe endearing compellations. And therefore I further tell you, that the only ſure way for any man to obtain theſe honourable Titles, is to join
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62453:69"/>
himſelf to their Aſſemblies, for alas all out of theſe are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkneſs, the wicked of the earth, the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and the Seed of the Serpent. We know their Charity can afford us no better names: Juſt ſo did the Phariſees of old, mightily extol and honour their own Diſciples, whilſt all men elſe in groſs were but <hi>populus terrae,</hi> or the beſt man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular but <hi>iſle publicanus;</hi> but theſe men are Saints as ſoon as ever they are but of the godly Party, I could tell you a ſtory of a grave Doctor, that for ſome months together, every <hi>Sunday</hi> conſtantly prayed for his ſick Maid under no worſer a title, than <hi>thy dear Servant E.</hi> 'till at length the good Saint was deliver'd of a fine Boy, which ſome unlucky Women
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62453:70"/>
ſwore was very like the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, How mightily (do you think) muſt this Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip endear them to their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? oh! theſe fine names made a great noiſe in their heads, they could not but dance to ſuch melodious ayrs; and the men that would treat them ſo kindly, need never fear any Oſtraciſm, but ſhould be ſure to charm their greateſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nay, all they have ſhall be readily at ſuch mens ſervice, how can they grudge ſuch civil Gentlemen any thing? He that can creep into the good Ladies Chamber, and there affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately pray for her, as Gods Elect Lady, his holy Servant, his dear Handmaid, and her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and hopeful Iſſue thoſe tender Plants of the holy Seed,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62453:70"/>
and poliſhed Corners of the Temple, may riſe up with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of her hearty thanks; nay, may find he hath melted her heart into ſome yellow pieces; as one of theſe once told a Confident of his, who yet had not the Grace to conceal it, but publiſh'd the ſaying to the uncircumciſed.</p>
            <p>This is a civility and honour to their people, that you'll ſcarce be able to parallel any where beſides; it far exceeds that of the Papiſts to their moſt religious Votaries: thoſe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Canonize any till after death, and they do wiſely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can ſafelier fix on them Miracles, &amp;c. which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps themſelves would have bluſhed at the forgery of, had they been living. But theſe men Canonize all preſently,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62453:71"/>
they are all precious Saints, as ſoon as ever they become their Diſciples; and tell me then, doth not one good turn deſerve another? you might count them ruder than the Boors of <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> if they ſhould not migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily honour ſuch obliging and courteous Maſters.</p>
            <p>And now by this time, Sir, I ſuppoſe I may have hired you, as well as my ſelf in this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, in which I do not intend to give you any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, only let me for a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion add, that if theſe Cauſes be rightly gheſſed at and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, there will theſe two or three obſervables be eaſily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible from them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the people have no ſuch extraordinary great Reaſon to honour theſe men, as perhaps they may imagine, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62453:71"/>
that they act very little beyond the weakneſs, and indiſcretion of Children in adoring of them. If their eyes ever chance to be truly opened, to ſee what true Religion means, and what the real Terms and Conditions of Salvation are; they will find (I doubt not) that their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have abuſed them, and their Teachers cauſed them to err. And then (perhaps) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they had no more true reaſon to honour theſe men, than Children have to do the like to thoſe Spirits (as we call them) who entertain their eyes and phancies with ſome pleaſant toys, 'till they have ſtollen them from their Parents, and betrayed them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſlavery. Indeed if men love to be cheated, and can take a delight in being ſhamefully abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62453:72"/>
then I confeſs they may have cauſe enough to honour theſe Perſons, for they can fit that humour well; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if they be wiſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt impoſture, they'l have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more cauſe to honour theſe as benefactors, and diſpenſors of true Heavenly food, than they would have to do ſo to thoſe, who, when they called for Bread ſhould give them Stones, or when they expected Fiſh, ſhould treat them with Scorpions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That theſe men themſelves have no very great cauſe to glory in the acquiſt; the applauſe of the multitude is in it ſelf very inconſiderable, and no wiſe man ever made much account of it: but it is much leſs valuable, when tis fraudulently obtain'd; the guilt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62453:72"/>
in the acquiſition, will quite damp and ſpoil the pleaſure of the fruition. And certainly the joy in ſeeing the people very much pleas'd, will very poorly compenſate the horrour, that muſt needs ariſe upon the thought, that God is moſt grievouſly provoked and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. There's a Scripture, Sir, that we have heard frequently in the mouths of theſe perſons to patronize and defend ſome of their actions, I only wiſh 'twere as much in their hearts to allay their Pride in being thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. <hi>Whether it be juſt in the ſight of God to obey men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God judge ye;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Reaſon would that men ſhould ambition rather the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that cometh from God, though the multitude were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed; than to gratifie the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62453:73"/>
vain humour, and thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the as vain applauſe thereof, by offending of God. We find the Apoſtle of the Gentiles telling his Galatians, that <hi>if he ſought to pleaſe men, he ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> I doubt ſome men might read their fate out of theſe words, and moſt certainly all may do ſo, who purchaſe mans applauſe by ways that Chriſt hath not warranted. Even in the midſt of ſuch laughter the heart may be juſtly ſad, when it reflects upon the reproach, and ignominy, the confuſion and ſhame, that will ſtrike the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to all theſe Comick ſports, and turn the peoples preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring acclamations, into the moſt virulent curſes and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations for ever.</p>
            <p>Were it not much better to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62453:73"/>
be ſerious in preventing this direful <hi>Exit,</hi> now in time? by every man laying aſide theſe poor low mean deſigns, and quitting that peeviſhneſs, and that Pride that neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage men upon them? Were it not much ſafer to ceaſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and diſputing againſt things (acknowledged by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) indifferent? the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vents, and Schiſms, and parties in the Church, which muſt be acknowledg'd extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous? and reſolve to join cordially with their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in doing God and the Church ſervice, and bringing mens Souls into a love and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of true Godlineſs, all which are alſo acknowledg'd abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely needful? this (I ſhould think) were a laudable method to Glory, a way to aſſure the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62453:74"/>
honour that cometh from God, and only deſerves that name: if they can out-ſtrip their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in this procedure, let them (ſay I) have a <hi>Benjamins</hi> Meſs and welcom. No good man (I am ſure) would grudge them this honour, but rejoice to ſee them all have the reward due to true Prophets. Nay I dare be publick ſecurity, that hereby they ſhould find ten times the comfort, that they can poſſibly in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary method. One Soul thus ſaved, ſhall gain them more true joy, than a thouſand gain'd to their own party; one man brought by them thus accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to honour and praiſe God, ſhall turn more to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, than to hear a multitude canting their glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither thirdly, need any
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62453:74"/>
of the other Clergy envy them this painted glory, nor have much reaſon to grudge them this imaginary felicity. 'Tis what a wiſe man would not grudge his worſt Enemy living. It was a ſad word which our Saviour ſpake of the proud am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Phariſies, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, they have their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reward.</hi> And 'tis all that men of the like ſpirit muſt hope for. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis yet ſo very little that even Envy it ſelf cannot faſten one tooth on. Let them pleaſe themſelves therefore in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, be thou quiet and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they will one day wiſh they had never known it: let the multitude of their followers ſing their <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> be ſtill, a day will come when their note will ſadly change: let them triumph over thee as one much
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62453:75"/>
inferiour to them, do thou thy duty ſincerely, they may chance one day to wiſh they were equal with thee.</p>
            <p>But of all things, I hope none of theſe will make ſo very ill uſe of this Enquiry, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour gaining glory by the ſame methods, or purſue honour by making the ſame experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. God forbid, this were the greateſt injury poſſible to the deſign of theſe Papers, and themſelves too: if they ſhould be inferiour to theſe in honour from their party (as it often falls out) yet they may have the peace and joy, of faithfully diſcharging their great truſt, and enjoy the honour that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God, which he will moſt certainly confer upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Servant of his; which the other may in vain wiſh for,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62453:75"/>
when ſhame and deſpair ſhall period all their glory.</p>
            <p>But Sir, my Zeal here tempts me to be impertinent, as I ſhould certainly be, ſhould I preſume to teach ſuch grave perſons.

            <p>IF there were nothing elſe to ſecure me, from being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted impertinent, in addreſſing to you at preſent from theſe words; this were abundantly ſufficient, that the great Apoſtle thinks it proper to be one of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62453:77"/>
the principal Directions to his beloved <hi>Timothy,</hi> among thoſe many that he giveth him in this Epiſtle, by which he fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs him how to deport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, both in his private Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as a Chriſtian, and alſo in his more publick, both as a Prieſt and Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And as it relates to him in this latter Capacity, I have determin'd to conſider it at this time. But before I enter immediately upon it, there's one word which will require me to ſtay a little upon it, in order to the acquainting you with the full deſign and import of this Apoſtolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and that is the <hi>[rather]</hi> here in our own tranſlation. It is apparent to any one, it is not expreſly in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſo the words
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62453:77"/>

               </gap> will well enough bear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the force of it; for when it cometh to be a Comparative Exceptive, as here it is, there is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difference whether we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our ſelves, not this but that, or <hi>rather</hi> this <hi>than</hi> that.</p>
            <p>In the proceeding part of the Verſe the Apoſtle is cautioning <hi>Timothy</hi> againſt the <gap reason="foreign">

by reaſon of their dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and readineſs in mixing a great many of the Heathen ſtories, with the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, accommodating the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the one to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the other; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuperinducing a neceſſity of believing thoſe Schemes or Syſtems that they extracted out of this ſtrange Miſcellany.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2.

               </gap>, whereas the advantage of other things is but ſmall, and that ſmall portion but

            <p>And truly, Brethren, were I minded to ſtay here, this would caſt a very ſevere eye upon many in theſe days. Not only upon the modiſh prophane Atheiſts, the men that abhor the very ſhew of Piety, have not ſo much as the Hypocriſie of it.</p>
            <p>But alſo upon the <hi>Laodicean</hi> indifference, and tepidneſs of moſt after it; to whom S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>'s Rule, <hi>Immenſitas eſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura,</hi> ſounds like Hereſie: and truly Godlineſs hath the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the minuteſt of the care of almoſt all men.

            <p>And I heartily could wiſh, there lay not a charge too juſtly againſt <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo here, whoſe zeal and fervency in Religious Service ſhould be that great flame, at which the leſſer Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the people ſhould take fire. I will not anticipate what would come in more properly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62453:82"/>
hereafter. That I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly touch at, is indeed a great defect in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our Zeal in Gods Worſhip, and religious Service (Not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you) 'tis plainly this, That careleſs poſting over the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Prayers of the Church. And give me leave freely to tell you my thoughts, the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (that hath ſo often trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over the oppoſitions of all her gainſayers) hath not worſe Enemies in the World, than theſe that carry the ſemblance of Friends; there cannot a more effectual courſe be taken to render it common and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eſteem of men, than what theſe men purſue. It will never be more wounded (I mean as to loſing its due ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration) by the aſſaults of its
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62453:82"/>
open Enemies, than it is in the Houſe and by the carriage of theſe its profeſſed Friends.—But I paſs on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exerciſe thy ſelf.</hi> And truly when we have ſaid all, this is the right method, if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf may be thought able to preſcribe it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Firſt love thy ſelf, then extend thy charity to thy Neighbour: Do what good thou canſt to others in Gods name, but remember that unleſs thou doſt good to thy ſelf alſo, neither God nor man will count thee wiſe; and ſure no man can expect to be counted other than ſilly in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62453:83"/>
extremity, who lays out his care (with the imprudent ſpouſe) to keep other mens Vineyards, while his own is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and expoſed to Ruine.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>unto Godlineſs,</hi> of which though (we know) all men can talk faſt enough, and all ſorts uſurp it as the proper ſignature of their own party; yet too plain experience let us ſee how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably men miſtake in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have of it, and how ſad and fatal the conſequences of thoſe miſtakes are.</p>
            <p>Some take it only to denote a little care about Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Service and Worſhip; and the conſequence of this errour is, to ſee men Saints on the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and Devils all the week after.</p>
            <p>Others take it to import on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62453:83"/>
a zealous obſervance of the Precepts of the firſt Table; and from hence it comes to paſs that Piety is cryed up by thoſe men who are wholly regardleſs of Honeſty, and men fall into the old jewiſh damning Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that although they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſteal, commit adultery, and ſwear falſly, yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Gods Houſe, obſerving his Sabbaths, and carefully worſhipping of him, will eaſily attone and expiate the guilt of thoſe Immoralities.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of men take it only for a Scheme of Faith, and judge of their own and other mens Godlineſs, by the mode and faſhion of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. One man thinks he is preſently holy, if he be of this way, and another thinks he is ſo, if he be of the contrary;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62453:84"/>
and the conſequence of this is, to ſee men wear their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Phariſees did their Phylacteries, and the Gnoſticks their Gems, as Amulets and Charms to ſecure them againſt the obligation of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. From whence it comes to paſs, that Saintſhip and the moſt prodigious acts of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs are eaſily reconcileable and conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>And truly thoſe that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe, and grant godlineſs to include obedience to Gods Commands, yet are apt to halt and liſp here, and fall into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old Jewiſh errour, that if a man do any one thing well, it is enough; in complyance with which, men chuſe out a few of the eaſieſt things to perform, ſuch as leaſt thwart their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or croſs their intereſts,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62453:84"/>
and the performance of theſe (they doubt not) will hallow all their other neglects. And from hence proceeds the ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Gnats, and ſwallowing Camels, the Tithing-Mint and Cummin-Seed, but neglecting the great important things of the Law, becauſe more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and difficult.</p>
            <p>It will highly concern us therefore, to ſettle ſuch a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Godlineſs, as may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure men againſt all theſe fatal miſtakes; and that we may do by expounding it ſo as to take in the whole matter of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Obedience, the whole Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane of Duties, the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe Vertues, which our great Maſter hath enjoined all his Votaries; and which the ſacred Idiom expreſſeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Holineſs, ſometimes by righteouſneſs, &amp; ſometimes by both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:62453:85"/>
And I underſtand nothing to hinder, why we may not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and expound it here. For though I know <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is many times taken to import the true and right manner of Gods Worſhip according to his Word, in oppoſition to all Idolatrous Superſtitions, and falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips among the Heathens; yet I know as well, that 'tis often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times underſtood in a fuller la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as comprehending the whole duty of a Chriſtian man. And therefore the Syriack In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretor tranſlates it here <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it to denote <hi>vitam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam,</hi> as well as <hi>ſidem puram.</hi> Therefore may it well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Godlikeneſs, endeavouring to be pure as God is pure, to tranſcribe the divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Vertues, Truth, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62453:85"/>
Mercy, and Charity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the utmoſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane poſſibilities. Upon which account I ſuppoſe it is, that holy men are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>And yet if we underſtood it here in the firſt and ſtricter ſence, without much ſtraining, it would draw in alſo this later, for certainly that man worſhips God beſt who obeys him moſt, and in vain do we the firſt if we neglect the latter. It is the Sacrifice of the juſt that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, whilſt that of the wicked is abomination. Even Nature hath taught the Heathen that the Sacrifice of the guilty perſon is but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>ſuel</hi> only <hi>to the flame,</hi> but not at all acceptable to the Gods; and it is known to have been a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech among the Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans,

            </p>
            <p>And now I will ſuppoſe you have the full import of this Apoſtolical direction, which though given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> may yet by a juſt and warrantable Analogy, be extended to all Clergy-men after him, enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>There are two Inſtances in which the exerciſe of this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us; and when I have acquainted you with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of its being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in both thoſe, I have finiſhed the trouble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> intend your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at preſent.</p>
            <p>The two Inſtances I mean are theſe. Our publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, and our own life
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62453:86"/>
and converſation with others: endeavour by thy Doctrine to plant and promote it in others, and be ſure to practiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it thy ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhould earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to plant Godlineſs in others by our Doctrines, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this the great end of all our Preaching, deſigning all ſuch our publick diſcourſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the implanting of true holineſs in our hearers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For firſt of all; this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to do them the moſt real good. That the great intereſt of Souls doth depend on holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and, that the happineſs of them is not attainable without it, is a Truth ſo clearly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo frequently atteſted in the ſacred Canon of our Faith, that I dare take the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to tell any that doubts
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62453:87"/>
of it, either that he's wholly a ſtranger thereto, hath very little converſed therewith; or elſe hath taken a great deal of pains to miſunderſtand it. And doubtleſs it requires ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable induſtry, for a man ſo far to debauch his Conſcience, as to be able to withſtand clear Convictions, and to ſuſpend its aſſent to ſuch clear and evident aſſertions of the Almighty. And truly though a man came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the divine Revelations, with ſome conſiderable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and prepoſſeſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this truth; yet a ſober perſon would think, he would meet with ſo many, and thoſe ſo plain and expreſs aſſertions of it, as were abundantly able to chaſe away all thoſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and irreſiſtably impreſs a ſenſe of it upon his Soul. And
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62453:87"/>
certainly he that but reads over <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>James</hi> 2. latter part of that Chapter, 1 Epiſtle of St. <hi>John,</hi> part of 1 and 2. Chapters, or ſeveral ſayings of our great Maſter Chriſt Jeſus. as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17. and 20. and many others, the time would fail me to recount all, in which this truth is ſo plainly and beyond all poſſibility of any rational doubting aſſerted. I ſay he that reads over all theſe, muſt needs labour under ſome ſtrange faſcination, if yet he be able to doubt of, or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it.</p>
            <p>Nor is this only the way to ſecure them an eternal and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo to enſtate them in the greateſt preſent bliſs. Give me a man that dare ſet up any one thing whatever to vye with the preſent felicity of being
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62453:88"/>
holy; I will dare to tell him, that it is ſo far from yielding a man any true happineſs, that it is not able ſo much as to ſecure him from being miſerable; it cannot yield him ſo much as the privative and meaner part of bliſs. And indeed we need not conſult the <hi>Ephod</hi> for this truth; even the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as bad Maſters as they are) yet will clearly teach us this Notion. I will not ſuppoſe any of you ſo unacquainted with them, as to waſte time in ſummoning their ſayings to atteſt this, only let me hint this to you, that theſe ſayings, are not only ſome <hi>Rhodomontades</hi> of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> but even of the ſobereſt among them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent vicious men, as placed upon a reſtleſs rowler,
<q>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:62453:88"/>
                  <l>—<gap reason="foreign">

                  </l>
               </q>
are the very expreſſions in the golden Sayings.</p>
            <p>And indeed it were a very eaſie taſk rationally to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this, in any of the gay Phantaſms, and admired Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the World, that take them ſeparate from Godlineſs, and they have not that leſſer part of felicity in them, <hi>viz.</hi> the making their poſſeſſors not miſerable: while on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Godlineſs hath the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And beſides the certainty of its future glory, is retinued at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with that joy and peace, and ſerenity of Soul, that he only knows that is the happy poſſeſſor of.</p>
            <p>And certainly then it will
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62453:89"/>
by a very eaſie conſequence follow, that he leaſt purſueth the intendment and deſign of his holy Calling, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be ſerviceable to his people in their greateſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and levels all his aim at this great mark, the bringing them to underſtand and comply with the great end of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the tranſcribing and imitating the divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that God, whom it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to adore. And while others have other Rules to judge the excellency of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by, their meaſures certainly are very falſe and precarious. <hi>Socrates</hi> (we know) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly judged the wiſeſt of the Athenian Philoſophers, for this very reaſon, becauſe whilſt others imployed themſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in aery Speculations; he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62453:89"/>
bended his ſtudy to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering mens lives, and healing the Immoralities of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And doubtleſs that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deſerves the greateſt praiſe, who moſt cloſely purſueth that great deſign, while a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others (its eaſie to ſignalize too many) muſt ſit down in much lower rooms.</p>
            <p>And truly what that good man ſaid of the great diſputers, may too truly be ſpoken of ſome great Preachers amongſt us. <q>It is juſt cauſe of ſorrow to ſee men ſo ſerious and yet ſo trifling, a very wounding ſpectacle to ſee theſe great <hi>Heroes</hi> (like <hi>Hercules</hi> at the diſtaff) ſo degenerouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and to find thoſe that were deſigned by Chriſt for Fiſhers of men, entertain themſelves and others too
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62453:90"/>
only with picking up ſhells and pebbles on the ſhore. Nor is it much wonder if theſe men take up the Diſciples complaint, we have laboured all night, and taken nothing.</q> The great <hi>Eulogium</hi> is to the faithful Servant, and ſhall in vain be expected by him, that's treacherous to his truſt; and the ſhining as Stars in the Orbs of Celeſtial Glory, will only be the happy lot of thoſe, who do (or at leaſt cordially indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to) bring Souls to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is one of the moſt probable expedients, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the true and ancient Chriſtian Religion. He that but ſoberly conſiders what Chriſtianity was in its Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive State, will (like that good man of old reading over our
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62453:90"/>
Saviours great Sermon <hi>(Aut hoc non eſt Evangelium, aut nos non ſumus Chriſtiani)</hi> be forced upon this concluſion, either that was not true Chriſtianity, or this which now bears that name, is not: and becauſe he is aſſured that the firſt was true, therefore infers that is ſpurious and counterfeit.</p>
            <p>Time was [B] when <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, were the characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick notes of the true and degenerate Members of the Church; that of the firſt and this of the latter, and holineſs of life was the true ſignature of a Chriſtian. <hi>Non magna lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur ſed vivimus,</hi> was then the Chriſtian Motto. And that priſtine honour that She was ſo happy in, even to the envy and ſilence of all oppoſition, was acquired by the Piety and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62453:91"/>
of her Votaries. A Chriſtian was but another name for a vertuous good man, and the lives of Chriſtians verified theſe to be <hi>Synonoma's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas whoſo views the Religion now on foot, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcover its great degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. That lay in the Heart, from whence it imparted life and vigour into all the active members; while this reſides only in the Brain, and ſeldom deſcends lower than the Tongue: from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a kind of a ſpiritual rickats, the head ſwells, and grows large and tuberous, while the active members are void of ſtrength, and dwindle away into an unactive leanneſs. There is none that makes it his buſineſs to <hi>do good</hi> now; yea we may with the Pſalmiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62453:91"/>
it, and ſay <hi>ſcarce one.</hi> An empty formal Notional Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that, men content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withal. And while a few Ceremonies and Appanages of Religion, are ſo eagerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, you ſee very few conteſts about the life of it; we can ſee men with great Zeal and little Charity mannage contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about the little things, but can diſcover no liſts for the agoniſtick Conteſts in Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or if there be any, can diſcover no Contenders in them.</p>
            <p>It is too obvious to need much inſiſting upon, that men conſult their Paſſions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Inclinations in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Religion; and let theſe alone to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; be ſure, while theſe are the Electors, the choice will not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62453:92"/>
be very uneaſie. Never fear, there will be nothing of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, nothing of painfulneſs, no auſterity in theſe mens Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The mortification of a beloved luſt, the amputation of a dear Member, the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſenſual Propenſity, are leſſons which their Religion will never go about to teach. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall be their Apoſtle, but 'tis in the worſt advice that ever he gave, <hi>Maſter ſpare thy ſelf,</hi> conſult thine own eaſe, God is a better Maſter than ſo. Hee's the Prophet for theſe people, that <hi>ſpeaks ſmooth things</hi> unto them. And I need not tell you how many ſecure the peoples favour, by indulging and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with this humour. Tell them fine ſtories of Chriſt, of the Freeneſs of Grace, &amp;c. and ſo become adored by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62453:92"/>
as ſo many Apoſtles, while the degeneracy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is theſe mens great Guilt, and in a great meaſure owes it ſelf to their Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are very few means more likely to ſtiflle and quench thoſe various Sects and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that there are amongſt us.</p>
            <p>And that not only upon this account, becauſe Godlineſs is ſo contrary to, and deſtructive of all thoſe humours that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and feed theſe diſtempers. Though it hath been ſeen that this hath been pleaded to juſtifie moſt Schiſms, and Holineſs hath been the Banner under which each Faction hath pretended to march; which lets us ſee what groſs fallacies men put upon themſelves, ſo as to be able to imagine, that Piety can be the true Enſign of a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62453:93"/>
Faction, and the holy Bible and Sword in the ſame field true Heraldry (the Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, not long ago, of the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Reformers). And yet every man that can but conſider, can tell you that nothing can be more contrary to Godlineſs, than giddy Factiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And that upon other ſcores beſides what I have hinted. It's true, if men ſtudy to bring the people to Godlineſs, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring them to that which is contrary to Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and Convictedneſs, which are the three great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Origines of Schiſm and Hereſie; and ſo go a direct way to deſtroy theſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, the conduciveneſs of Godlineſs to the deſtruction of theſe is apparent upon other accounts alſo.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:62453:93"/>
1. For firſt, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that mens intermitting of ſober and regular Actions (ſuch as Godlineſs engageth unto) is the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>readieſt way poſſible to fall into wild, extravagant, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant ones. And that Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is one great Cauſe of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, hath been ſo fully and clearly demonſtrated by one (whoſe goodneſs or humility I know not which moſt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire) that I ſhould but go about to correct <hi>Apelles,</hi> ſhould I add any thing to fortifie the Demonſtration: It is while men ſleep that the envious man ſows theſe tares, and (as a learned Prelate of our own hath long ſince obſerved) The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Bees paſs ſafely by thoſe tempting Bottles, into which the idle Waſps are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſeduced. Let men but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62453:94"/>
upon Holineſs, I'll ſecure them, they ſhall find enough to employ themſelves about, be they as active as they will, or can be; they ſhall have no time for Idleneſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no leiſure to admit thoſe peſts that follow it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides ſecondly let us do this, and by Gods bleſſing upon our endeavours, we may rob theſe diſſenters of their moſt popular and plauſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt us. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know the ſtir that hath been made, about communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with wicked men, and the danger of joining with mix'd Aſſemblies. Men have hunted for Purity 'till they have loſt all Piety, and the ſight of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs in ſome profeſſed Members of the Church, hath made the readier way for the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62453:94"/>
admiſſion of that Apoſtolical Precept (though in a miſtaken ſenſe) <hi>Come out from among them my people, and be ſeperate from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now this courſe is the ready way to beat the Enemy out of this Hold: For while by Holineſs appearing in us, all men ſhould be forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that God is indeed among us, we ſhould let thoſe all ſee the vanity and wickedneſs of thoſe, that cry out of a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſeperating from us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let me add one induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more; this will be the moſt effectual courſe we can take, to perpetuate our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and procure the divine protection of that Church, whoſe hedges ſeem now broken down, and her ſelf expoſed too like an Orphan.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:62453:95"/>
It is a Maxim of <hi>Solomon,</hi> That <hi>length of days is in the right hand of holineſs, and in her left hand riches and honour,</hi> and 'tis as applicable to Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as to ſingle men: As the Pillars of a Nation ſo of a Church too are ſupported by Righteouſneſs, and without that commonly in a little time crumble to nothing. The Jews tell us, that in the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which laſted 420. Years, there were near 300. High Prieſts, while in the former, that laſted within 10. Years as long, there was a Succeſſion but of eighteen; and the difference they aſſign to ariſe from the Piety of theſe, and Impiety of thoſe. You have an excellent Diſcourſe to this purpoſe in the late famous Biſhop of <hi>Down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I caſt in this enforcement
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62453:95"/>
now [B] a little the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the time; there ſeems to be ſilence and amazement in this our Heaven now, I pray God it may be but for half an hour. Who knows but we may be within the proſpect of that time, in which that Church which hath been bleſſed with ſo many miraculous reſurrections, may draw near a final expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? God Almighty avert the Fate, and change the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; but certainly there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was more cauſe, to take up the Pſalmiſts Prayer (and there is no means likely to cauſe its ſpeed, but Holineſs) <hi>Ariſe O Lord maintain thine own cauſe, remember how the fooliſh man blaſphemes thee daily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to conclude my <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> much what as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth his. <hi>Fear God and</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:62453:96"/>
               <hi>keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man,</hi> and the endeavouring to bring men to do this, is the whole duty of the ſpiritual Man. And when that great day of Revelation ſhall commence, in which every ſecret thing ſhall be brought into judgment, he that hath moſt ſtudiouſly purſued this deſign, will certainly be acknowledged by our great Maſter for the moſt faithful Servant.</p>
            <p>In this firſt ſence therefore, <hi>Exerciſe thy ſelf unto godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But that's not enough; therefore ſecondly be ſure alſo to exerciſe <hi>thy ſelf</hi> unto God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; ſhew it forth in thine own life and actions; think not thy duty done, when thou haſt commended it unto, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it upon others, but be ſure endeavour it to thine own Soul:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62453:96"/>
let it be ſeen in thy living, as well as heard in thy Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>This is the ſecond Reference (you may remember) I made of this Precept to <hi>Timothy;</hi> and give me leave to urge a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or two to enforce it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt, Let us (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) conſider that we have Souls as well as other men, whoſe Salvation ought to be as dear, and whoſe damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion certainly will be as terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto us, as other mens can be to them, or us either. And certainly it is a very wild Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that prompts us to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour other mens Salvation, and wholly neglect in the mean time our own. Certainly [B] it would be but a poor relief to a man in Hell, to think that he hath been inſtrumental in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62453:97"/>
others, but rather be the greater aggravation of, and cauſe him more virulently to curſe his own Folly, in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own welfare. What's that Sheep profited by Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, while it ſelf goeth naked? or what comfort finds that filly Worm in its death, who hath extracted its bowels to make others fine and gay? Who but a madman would ſeek to build a fortune unto others upon the ruins of his own Houſe? and I am ſure he is far enough from the temper of an Apoſtle, who when he hath preached unto others, will not take care that himſelf may not <hi>become a caſtaway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Either therefore ſay thou haſt no Soul, or the Salvation of it is nothing unto thee, or elſe that it is attainable upon
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62453:97"/>
other Terms and Conditions than that of other men, or elſe <hi>exerciſe thy ſelf unto godlineſs;</hi> and do this, becauſe thou canſt not ſay the firſt, and art unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral if thou ſay the ſecond, and haſt no reaſon to think the third.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For ſecondly, Know that thou art obliged to Holineſs as well as other men, nay by ſtricter Rules too than they are. Thy Salvation is not only not attainable without Holineſs, any more than another mans is, but requires a greater meaſure of it, in order thereto; and thy negligence may caſt a greater grief upon thee, than another mans upon him.</p>
            <p>I will not urge this from the greater meaſure of knowledge, that thou art ſuppoſed to have above them; though that alone
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62453:98"/>
will fix the guilt faſter, and make the ſtain deeper, than it will on another, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Chriſt himſelf hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us will be ſuch a mans ſad portion.</p>
            <p>But I would rather argue this from the Conſideration of that ſacred Function, we are honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal. Our very Orders (you know) are called holy; the very Bells of <hi>Aaron</hi> alone will ring him this note. I have choſen you out of the World (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples) and ſurely then ſuch are to be ſeperate in their Lives as well as Office, and a horrid guilt it will be for theſe, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to it. Certainly, thoſe that are Stars in Chriſts right hand, muſt either ſhine bright, or elſe they will ſully their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Glory, and be caſt thence
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62453:98"/>
with indignation and ſcorn. While other men that are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do yet retain the name of men (though Fools or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) it is worth our obſerving, that ſin in theſe is a perfect Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthropie, and cauſeth them preſently to commence Devils. You may ſee this in two Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of our Saviour himſelf, <hi>have not I choſen you twelve, yet one is a Devil?</hi> meaning <hi>Judas.</hi> Nay when St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf becomes ſcandalous, and tempts to evil, he is rebuked in no milder terms than, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi> The Corruption of the beſt is always the worſt, ſaith our old Maxim, and 'tis as true in Morality as Nature. It was therefore excellent Advice, which the lately mentioned Biſhop gave his Clergy. <q>That every Miniſter ſhould judge
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62453:99"/>
of his own duty, by ſtricter Meaſures, and ſeverer Rules, than he doth that of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q> And truly it were a very eaſie taſk to inſtance in many things, that in the Laity are tollerable, which would carry a very dangerous appearance in the Clergy, and be too liable to miſconſtruction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will be the likelieſt way to render thy Preaching Holineſs unto others, effectual unto its bleſſed end, and thy failing here, will be ſure to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate thy endeavours there. It is even a common-place Truth, That man is Minical, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards Examples a great deal more than Precepts; there are enow have told you, that a Preachers good Example is his beſt Homily, and his good Life his moſt prevailing Sermon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:62453:99"/>
And if that Maxim of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> be true, that good Works convince more than Miracles, than certainly that Preacher that deſires any fruit of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, muſt acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the ſtrongeſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions imaginable, to be criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally careful how he liveth. As Religion hath no more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful argument for it ſelf than the piety of its Votaries, (for that Fountain muſt needs be clear, whoſe ſtreams are ſo) ſo truly no mans exhortations work ſo powerfully upon us, as his, who is himſelf (we ſee) affected with them. <hi>Quae agenda doce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ipſe priùs agendo premonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi> was the commendation of one of our Engliſh Saints, and ought to be ambition'd by every Preacher. Alas! as the command of that Captain wakes
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62453:100"/>
coldly, who only cryeth go; in compariſon of his, that ſaith Come <hi>(ignave venire te Caeſar non ire jubet;)</hi> ſo men little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to thoſe Preachers, that bid them go in the paths of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in compariſon of them, who go before them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It's the language of an Egyptian <hi>Pharaoh, Go ye and ſerve the Lord,</hi> the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is <hi>O come and let us,</hi> and which of theſe is more likely to prevail on man, leſs than a Prophet may eaſily foretel, and that upon very rational grounds alſo.</p>
            <p>For why ſhould any man think that his exhortation ſhould prevail more with me, than himſelf? or hope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to practiſe that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which I ſee him wholly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs? What more compendious
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62453:100"/>
courſe can he take, to cauſe me to miſtruſt the truth of all his Arguments, and ſuſpect them for Fallacies, be they never ſo ſpecious, only becauſe I ſee they have no Faith with him? Who regards a drunken mans Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Temperance? or believe that himſelf thinks that neceſſary, with which he makes bold ſo conſtantly to diſpenſe? In vain ſhall you endeavour to perſwade men, you are ſerious in preſſing thoſe Duties on them, which you make no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of performing your ſelves; nor will men ever think thoſe Duties practicable, that are wholly diſregarded by thoſe that preach them. It was therefore an advice worthy of an Apoſtle, which is given to <hi>Timothy</hi> in this Epiſtle, <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf, and to thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> and certainly the former
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62453:101"/>
is of as great neceſſity as the latter, nay neceſſary in order to it; that thy Doctrine may not miſcarry, be ſure take care of thy ſelf: for thy looſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of thy ſelf, will be ſure to fruſtrate the deſign of thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe accounts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſure to exerciſe <hi>thy ſelf</hi> unto godlineſs.</p>
            <p>What Cenſures then can be too ſevere for theſe men, when prophane and profligate? I hope there are not many, but thoſe that are, are ſo many too many. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is all the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I make for them. And I hope we are not yet in ſuch ſad circumſtances, but that it may be granted, if the Church may not judge them without, yet ſhe may be permitted (I hope) to govern and correct (when need is) her own Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:62453:101"/>
Give me leave once more to ſpeak my thoughts before you; the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Honour will never throughly be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, nor her Clergy's Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation cleared and aſſerted, 'till this courſe be effectually follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And (I doubt not but) every good man is ſenſible of this, and will add his ſuffrage to the conjecture.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching you [my B.] to ſuffer the word of Exhortation. Let us all combine together in this pious reſolution, of <hi>exerciſing</hi> our ſelves <hi>unto godlineſs,</hi> and contending each man to exceed his Brother in it. Our Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here will (I am ſure) be warrantable, and our neglect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſably culpable Providence hath caſt us upon afflicting times, wherein many eagerly hunt and gape for our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62453:102"/>
and who knows but God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it as an eſſay of our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs? That vindicating our Religion, the aſſerting our own Innocence are only to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this method. Our failure will put a Sword into our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, and make us acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to our own ruin; while our care will ſhame the malice of our detractors, and put to ſilence all gainſayers.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak to wiſe and good men, that are able to judge what I ſay. And therefore I ſpeak ſo little to theſe things, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a taſk, not to enlarge upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I conclude with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Prayer;</hi> Let all thy Prieſts, O Lord, be cloathed with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then ſhall all thy Saints ſhout for joyfulneſs, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
