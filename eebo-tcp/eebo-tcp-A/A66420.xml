            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SERMON
Preach'd before the

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOSHUA XXII. 31.</bibl>
               <q>Phineas the son of Eleazar the Priest, said unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and
to the children of Manasseh, <q>This day we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Lord is among us, because ye have
not committed this Trespass against the Lord:</q>
Now ye have delivered the Children of Israel out of the
hand of the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Words are the Close of
a solemn Debate between the
Ten Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> that had their
Lot in <hi>Canaan,</hi> on the <hi>West</hi> of the
River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and the Two Tribes
and a Half that were scituated on the <hi>East</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62712:4"/>
The Occasion of which was this: After the
Conquest of <hi>Canaan</hi> by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and an End
in all appearance put to that War, the Two Tribes
and an Half,<note place="margin">Numb. 32. 17, &amp;c.</note> who till that time by the Command
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and their own Promise, stood obliged to
attend it, were dismiss'd by <hi>Joshua,</hi> and were upon
return to their own Inheritance.</p>
            <p>When they landed on the other side, and before
their dispersion to their several Homes, they
agreed to build an Altar at the Place where the
Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had first passed over, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.
after the Pattern of that at <hi>Shiloh, ver.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>This, to those that knew not their reason, nor
their Motives leading to it, seemed an intolerable
Presumption; since there was to be but one Altar
for Sacrifice, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and that at <hi>the place which God
should chuse to put his name there,</hi> Deut. 12. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>And then to set up another Altar in opposition
to that, and to break off from the Communion of
the Church established by God's Appointment
among them, was in effect to set up another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to be guilty of Rebellion against the
Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. 19.</p>
            <p>Upon Tidings therefore of this, the Ten Tribes
gathered themselves together to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the Place
at that time where the Tabernacle was pitched,
where God was worshipped, and whose Cause
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62712:4"/>
they were bound to defend; and according to the
Precept of the Law they were resolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
against them as Idolaters, if the Fact proved
according to their Information, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 15.</p>
            <p>But here they proceeded like a wise and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
People; for in matters of such Importance,
and attended with such fatal Consequences as a
Civil War, and the Destruction of Two of their
Tribes, there needed great Deliberation, and a
careful attendance to the Method in such cases pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the same Law, <hi>(Deut. 13. 12, &amp;c.)</hi>
viz. <hi>If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities which the
Lord thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city,
saying, Let us go and serve other Gods (which we have
not known) then thou shalt enquire, and make search,
and ask diligently;</hi> that is, they were to use the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Care to obtain a true Information of the
Fact.</p>
            <p>After this manner did the <hi>Western</hi> Tribes act in
this case, and sent <hi>Phineas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the
Priest, and Ten Princes, one out of each Tribe,
to expostulate the matter with their Brethren, and
to seek by fair means to reduce them.</p>
            <p>These Commissioners, as well as the whole
Congregation, took the Case, as represented to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62712:5"/>
them, for granted; and when they came to the
place were Eye-Witnesses of the Fact: They saw
the Altar, and that it was a Pattern of the Altar
of the Lord; and like Persons zealous for the
Good and Peace of their Countrey, and for the
Purity and Honour of their Religion, they no
sooner came, but they delivered their Errand, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Name of the whole Congregation,
<hi>What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God
of Israel, to turn away this day from following the Lord,
in that ye have built you an altar, that ye might rebel this
day against the Lord?</hi> v. 16, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But after a patient and full hearing of the
Charge, the Two Tribes utterly disclaim it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to God, the Witness and Judge of all,
That they were so far from erecting this Altar in
opposition to that appointed by God as the only
Altar for Sacrifice, that, on the contrary, it was
built for asserting and maintaining their Right to
it; and for fear lest <hi>(Jordan</hi> being their Border,
and by which they were separated from the other
Tribes) that in time to come they might have their
Propriety and Interest in the True Altar question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and therefore they agreed to make an Altar
after the Pattern of it, that might be a <hi>Witness</hi> and
Memorial to Future Generations, That they on
their side <hi>Jordan</hi> had as much a Right in that at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62712:5"/>
               <hi>Shiloh,</hi> as those that lived <hi>in the possession wherein the
tabernacle of the Lord dwelt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Phineas</hi> and the other Delegates heard
this, they were pleased and fully satisfied in this
Relation; and he concluded all in the Words of
the Text, <hi>This day we perceive that the Lord is among
us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In treating upon which Words, I design not to
confine my self wholly unto them, but shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them as the Close of this Narrative; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
I shall take the liberty to make some
Observations from the whole.</p>
            <p>As, I observe,</p>
            <p>1. That Prepossessions and Misunderstandings
are too often the occasion of great Divisions in the
World, and of such as, if not prevented, draw
after them very pernicious and fatal Consequences.
Thus it was in the Case before us; it was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
a Hear-say, <hi>ver. 11. The children of Israel
heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben, Gad, and of
the half tribe of Manasseh, have built an altar over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against
the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at
the passage of the children of Israel.</hi> And upon this
Report, the whole Congregation of the Ten
Tribes assembled at <hi>Shiloh, to go up to war against
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62712:6"/>
2. There ought to be the speediest and most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Care taken for preventing the Ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of such Misunderstandings, and to take
up the Case before it comes to the utmost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
It was so here. The exasperated Tribes,
like Persons resolved to vindicate the Common
Cause of Religion, came with the Sword in their
hand; that if the supposed Delinquents should
have acted according as it was represented, and
should prove obstinate and incorrigible, they
might proceed to the utmost severity. But they
acted with all the Precaution necessary; they sent
such Delegates as were in all points accomplish'd
for such a Service, whether for Quality and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for Prudence and Experience, who argued
the Case with all the Arts of Respect and Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They in the first place expostulate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with them; <hi>What trespass is this?</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Is the
iniquity of Peor too little for us?—but that ye must turn
this day from following the Lord?</hi> &amp;c. And then with
great Tenderness they offer any Terms in their
power, and are freely willing, that if the Two
Tribes like not their Habitation on the other side
<hi>Jordan,</hi> and think their Possession <hi>unclean,</hi> that
they might chuse where they would among the
other, rather than rebel against God by such a
Separation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62712:6"/>
3. That the most proper Met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such Misunderstandings, and for composing
Differences arising from such Misunderstandings,
is Examination and Enquiry into the Cause, with
Deliberation and Meekness, that they may see
where the difference lies, and take the best course
for the composing of it. It was so here, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
were prepossess'd, and came with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
upon a false Information, or rather their
Mistake grounded upon the Information; and
withal, were zealously bent to punish the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors.
But their Zeal was governed by Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
it did not make them precipitate and rash,
nor transport them beyond the bounds of Decency
and Respect. They delivered the Sense of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
as became Representatives of so Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Body as the Congregation of the Lord.
They expostulate, and they argue; but it is with
Softness and Candor: The Expostulation was
affecting, and the Arguing strong, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
was equal to both. There were no
Reproaches, no Hard Words, no bitter Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They had to deal with Brethren, (though, as
they supposed, notorious Offenders) and they used
them as such. Let us view the Words again;
<hi>What trespass is this?—Is the iniquity of Peor too little?
—Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62712:7"/>
unclean</hi> (as perhaps you imagine) <hi>then pass ye
over,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but rebel not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same way is to be taken for removing
Prejudices and Misunderstandings, even by those
that suffer, or are likely to suffer by them. And
of this the Two Tribes are an admirable Example,
in the Defence they make for themselves, and the
Reply they give to this unexpected and hard Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
They were wrongfully charged with a
Crime of a heinous nature, no less than Rebellion
against God, and such as might have involved
them in utter Ruin. They found how their
Brethren of the other Tribes, upon a Misreport,
were disposed to War upon them: And what
Warmth might be expected upon such a Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to find them so credulous, and forward, and
exasperated for nothing? But see how on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
they behave themselves in their Resentments
and Reply, which is as clam and modest, as it was
grave and serious. They begin with a solemn and
most pathetical Appeal to God, as a Witness of
their Innocency, <hi>ver. 22. The Lord God of gods, the
Lord God of gods, he knoweth,</hi> &amp;c. and conclude with as
solemn a Protestation, <hi>ver. 29. God forbid that we
should rebel against the Lord, and turn this day from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Lord, to build an altar for burnt-offerings,
—besides the altar of the Lord our God that is before his
tabernacle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62712:7"/>
Here were no Invectives, no Recriminations,
no Revilings, no Charges of Slander and Calumny;
but all was carried on with a becoming Modesty
and Meekness.</p>
            <p>4. It is a comfortable Evidence of God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
with a People to bless, defend, and prosper
them, when Mistakes are removed, Differences
happily composed, and they are at Union and
Peace among themselves. It was so here, when
the Case was understood, and that after the fear
of so dangerous and threatning a Rupture, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
that there was no sufficient ground for such
a Surmise as the Ten Tribes had entertained, and
all was quietly ended. So the Text; <hi>This day,</hi> said
<hi>Phineas, we perceive that the Lord is among us, because
ye have not committed this trespass against the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall treat of these in their Order.</p>
            <p>1. I observe that Prepossessions and Misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
are too often the Occasion of great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
in the World; and os such, as if not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevented, draw after them very pernicious and
fatal Consequences.</p>
            <p>We ought to have more Charity for Mankind
than to think any of such Rancorous and Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Tempers, as to do Evil for Evil's sake, and to
divide the World, and break the Frame of Order
and Government in pieces, solely for the sake of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62712:8"/>
the Mischief consequent upon it, without any
Provocation or Cause whatever.</p>
            <p>And yet if we come to look narrowly into the
contentions among mankind, if it were not for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that inclines us to better thoughts, we should
often be under a violent temptation to think there
are some that quarrel for quarrelling's sake, when
the matters in debate, and so hotly agitated on
either side, are in their own nature, and are seen
to be so by wise and discerning men, next to
nothing, and not fit and worth the while to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into, much less to be contended about; were
it not to disabuse well-meaning persons, that are
hurried along in the crowd, and carried away by
the precipitance of those whom they follow, and
whose Judgment they rely upon; or for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such mischief as sometimes ensues upon a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, That <hi>the beginning of strife is as
when one letteth out Water,</hi> Prov. 17. 14. which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
begins in a few drops, but by degrees makes
its own way, and at last becomes a Torrent, and
bears down all before it. Now we can as little
suppose that the Contentions which afterwards
swell to so prodigious a height as by their force to
carry away such Numbers along with them, should
at first spring from contemptible causes and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62712:8"/>
were it not that at length the Passions of
men gradually inflame the Quarrel, or that those
that usher'd them into the world, and afterward
kept up the Ball of Contention, did through mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
think them to be of great importance, when
in reality they were of none. For if they had but
the patience to trace them up to their original,
they would see that they are in their nature or their
reasons very weak and impertinent; and proceed
from such principles and occasions as they would
be ashamed to own, and which could never have
got such a footing and ground, were it not that
they rose, have grown and been hatch'd up under
the favour of Mistakes and Prejudices.</p>
            <p>And yet these are occasions that the wisest of
men are not above; and no more is it to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that ever they should be altogether free from
such like Misunderstandings, than that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
should see every thing with their own eyes,
hear all with their own ears, and need no infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
No more is it to be expected, than they
should be freed from all Passion and Resentments,
from all Precipitancy and Error in Judgment. We
have an Instance of this in the Case before us,
when the whole Congregation was so far imposed
upon by a mistaken Relation on one hand, and
their own Imagination on the other (when they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62712:9"/>
heard that the Two Tribes had built an Altar like
that of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and conceived it was an Altar for
Sacrifice) that it had like to have engaged them in a
Destructive War. It was so with <hi>Moses</hi> himself, in
the case of the same people, when the Two Tribes
and a Half applied themselves to him for a Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
on the other side <hi>Jordan,</hi> which he on the
sudden misinterpreted, as if they consulted their
own Ease and Safety, and so discouraged their
Brethren; whereas their design was concurrent
with his, and consistent with the aid he required,
and they were willing to give to the other Tribes
in the Wars of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we go from single Persons to a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
the Case will admit of farther Exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as it was with those at <hi>Epbesus,</hi> when <hi>some
cried one thing, and some another; for the assembly was
confused, and the more part knew not wherefore they were
come together;</hi> but the Word was given, and those
that were strangers to the first Rise of the Tumult,
yet joined in the common Voice of <hi>Great is Diana
of the Ephesians,</hi> Acts 19. 32, 33.</p>
            <p>It is upon such Misunderstandings that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Feuds in Church and State are for the most part
graffed. We find very often that the Passions and
Mistakes of men keep them more at a distance
than the matters about which they contend; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62712:9"/>
if we can but bring them together to discourse
the Point calmly, the Controversy is soon brought
to an issue; and they readily own, that had they
known so much before, and that the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
had been so disposed to a Reconciliation,
and the Matter so capable of it, the Breach might
have been long before made up, to their mutual
quiet and satisfaction. And thus it is often in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
whether about Religious or Civil Affairs.
That which makes the Point in dispute considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the Breach seemingly irreconcilable, is a
Multitude of Words, a Troop of Exaggerations
and Aggravations, much Passion and Vehemence,
a Stiffness of Temper, and a Strangeness in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
and when thus dress'd up, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that though the Controversy be without life,
and the Trumpet give an uncertain sound, yet all
prepare themselves to the Battel.</p>
            <p>But if the matter were to be separated from
these, and to stand alone, without all these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and pretended Expositions, it would appear
to be quite another thing, and to afford little or no
ground for such Contention.</p>
            <p>And this is evident to the By-standers that are
unconcerned, if not to the Litigants and Contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
themselves, when the Cloud of their Passion is
removed, and the Heat of the Controversy is
worn off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62712:10"/>
For what do we now think of the tedious and
mischievous Controversy aforetime about Leaven
in the Sacrament, that almost rent in pieces the
<hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Churches, and made way for
the Irruption of the <hi>Saracens?</hi> What of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
in the last Age, concerning the Decrees
and Five Points, which so divided our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nation, and drew so many others into the
quarrel? Not to mention the most impertinent of
all, those many Feuds in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and in
particular that of the Immaculate Conception of
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which Popes and Councils, after
300 years dispute have been afraid to determine.</p>
            <p>And God knows what those that shall live in
the Age or Ages after us will think of some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
that now disturb the Christian World,
and which even in this Nation keep a foot Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
and uphold Separations?</p>
            <p>But to come nearer to our purpose, the Case is
the same in Secular Matters, where Misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
frequently begin, and keep up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
Men quarrel about nothing, or what is
extremely frivolous. 'Tis for the most part a Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
that begins the Quarrel; Characters of Persons
they don't know, and Affairs they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, and know little more of than they
do of the other World, or the most Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62712:10"/>
in this; nay, perhaps they lose the first Scent
and Point in debate; but the Heat continues, and
brings new Matter upon the stage, and then they
are to begin the world again.</p>
            <p>If indeed the Event in such Cases was of no
greater concernment than the things they mistake
in, it would not be much material whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were in the right or in the wrong. But it often
happens the Mischief is not the less for the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding;
for when the Passions are once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
they make every little thing to be great,
and Presumption shall pass for Right, and Shew
for Certainty; and then it shall be establish'd as an
infallible Maxim, That Right and Truth must
upon no account be parted with; <hi>Fiat Justitia, &amp;
ruat Coelum.</hi> And then come in Contempt of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
Defamations, Reproaches, and Invectives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Factions and Parties. And whilst, like the exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<hi>Jews (Acts 22. 23.)</hi> they throw dust into
the Air, they see not one another; Friendship
and Enmity are confounded; and at last, if they
lose not the Cause they first appeared in, they lose
that which is greater, Unity, Moderation, and
Charity, and true Care for the Publick Good. So
that in the issue it proves like the Scaling of a Fort,
when under the Covert of the Smoke the Enemy
securely advances and surprizes them; they betray
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62712:11"/>
the Publick Peace, Order, and Constitution; and
if there were an Enemy to seize it, (which God
forbid) he would easily espy and make use of
such an advantage.</p>
            <p>And therefore this is a Case not to be neglected.
Which brings the next Head under Consideration,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There ought to be the speediest and most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Care taken for preventing the ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of such Misunderstandings; and to take
up the Case before it comes to the utmost Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>The first thing here to be done, is, if it might be,
the preventing Mistakes and Misunderstandings;
but since <hi>it is impossible but that offences</hi> in that kind
<hi>will come;</hi> the next is to rectify them, and by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
things in their proper light, and by giving
all occasions and advantages for Enquiry and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
to let them see they are mistaken either in
the Truth or the Importance of the matters in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute;
and that if they should be in the right, it
is but a <hi>strife of words, tending to no profit, but to the
subversion</hi> of the Publick Peace.</p>
            <p>For which reason there cannot be too much care
taken, as <hi>Solomon</hi> advises in the place before quoted,
<hi>The beginning of strife is as one letteth out water; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leave off,</hi> and so suppress <hi>contention before it be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62712:11"/>
meddled with;</hi> before it gets footing and strength,
and that it comes to distinguish a Party.</p>
            <p>And tho here it's the part of every one, of what
Capacity soever, to <hi>study to be quiet,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Tranquillity and good Order of the
Place, Nation, and City where he is; yet herein
above all doth the Conduct of a Good Magistrate
appear. In quiet and regular Times, when all
things are easy and clam, an ordinary Care will
be sufficient to guard the Community, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it from danger. But as the Skill of a Pilot
is best seen and tried in a Storm, or Perilous Coast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
So is the Prudence and Courage of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
when there are high Discontents and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
that he may know when to Act, and
when to Forbear; when to Hold, and when to
Yield; and to keep a Steady Hand between the
Preserving his own Authority, and the Publick
Peace: That he may not betray his Authority,
and expose the Honour of his Station to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
by a too hasty desire for Peace, and by too
easy Compliances and Condescensions; nor on
the other hand break the Peace, and endanger the
Publick, by being too tenacious of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
It is then a difficult Task to temper the
Minds of the Froward, to remove Prejudices, to
bear with the Weak, and even the Impertinent;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62712:12"/>
to convince the Mistaken, and like another
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>become all things to all:</hi> And above all,
to prevent the ill Consequences of the Misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
of such as mean well, but err dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously;
that are persons of Conscience, but yet
whose Conscience through Mistake is set the
wrong way; that think they do the Publick (as
others <hi>think they do God) Service, John</hi> 16. 2. when
they take the ready way to bring all into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Such Persons are to be pitied, and used with
Tenderness and Respect; and it may be worth
the while to seek and endeavour their Satisfaction
and Recovery, to lay open and convince them of
their Mistakes: For if convinced, they will be
made Hearty, Zealous, and Trusty Friends; and
like St. <hi>Paul</hi> when reduc'd to the Belief of the
Christian Doctrine, his Zeal and his Conscience
went along with him, and he <hi>laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
than all</hi> the rest of <hi>the Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The most proper way for preventing the
Mischiefs too often consequent upon such Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understandings,
is to enquire into the Merits of
the Cause; and patiently and deliberately to
weigh what belongs to it.</p>
            <p>The Congregation in this Chapter went not
headily on; but sent (as has been before said)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62712:12"/>
proper Delegates to enquire into the Reasons upon
which the Two Tribes proceeded: As to what
was to follow, in case they found them perverse
and obstinate, the Law was to be their Guide and
Warrant; and that being a matter of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
they were very solicitous in. Now what Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact was to them, that Matter of Right is to
us; and a person needs to be well advised, and has
good reason to question his own Understanding,
when he is sure that the Event of his present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and Enterprise may, and in all probability
will be very pernicious. He has need to deliberate,
when he is not nor can be so sure he is in the
right, as he is sure of the ill consequence of it,
and of a consequence as mischievous as if he was
in the wrong. He may justly then question the
Truth, Lawfulness, and Necessity of it; Whether,
for example, that is lawful, which will produce,
or is likely to produce, the worst of effects, that
is, Confusion: Or, Whether what he contends for
is as necessary or more necessary than the Peace he
must part with for it.</p>
            <p>I grant, that as a Necessary War is more eligible
than a Shameful or Dangerous Peace; so there
are those Rights and Privileges that are to be held
faster than Peace: But when Peace and Order are
such choice and valuable Blessings, that nothing is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62712:13"/>
ordinarily more necessary than them to the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of Mankind, and the Well-being of the World;
I have sufficient cause to enquire into and to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the Truth and Importance of those things
which I must purchase at so dear a rate as the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with my own Quiet, and the Publick Peace
and Order for.</p>
            <p>There are some cases where it is worth my
while to venture my Life for preserving what I
have, or obtaining what I desire, but when my
Life is brought into imminent Hazard by an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
I have a warrantable reason to be well
satisfied in the Truth and Certainty, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and Necessity of the things I venture it
for.</p>
            <p>Therefore I take it for a certain Rule, That
where the Advantage and Excellency of what I
gain is not more than sufficient to counterbalance
what I lose or part with for the sake of it, I may
justly suspect, at least suspend and deliberate.</p>
            <p>And when the loss of such excellent things as
Publick Order and Peace are likely to be the Event
of my present proceedings, and of the course that
Affairs will be thereby put into, I have reason to
consider, and to think I may be mistaken, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
to weigh all over again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62712:13"/>
For I cannot be mistaken about Peace and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
they are beyond all exception to be valued
and respected; but I may be mistaken in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
I pursue, or the Method in which I pursue
them; and which I cannot pursue without putting
those inestimable things into hazard.</p>
            <p>This is a matter that, if carefully attended,
would go a great way toward the removing
many Mistakes that trouble the Peace of the
World, and break in upon the Establish'd Order
of a Nation or City.</p>
            <p>It is none of my design to intermeddle in those
Affairs which belong to Persons of another Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but I may, and it is our business to lay
down Rules for the guiding of mens Consciences
in points of Difficulty. And I think we may safely
rely upon that as such, that there is nothing can
bind against Peace and Order; and what always
tends to Confusion, and breaks Order in pieces,
whereever it comes, is deservedly to be suspected,
and I may safely say must needs be false; that is,
that which tends to bring things into the same
state as they were in before, would have been
without, and were brought out of by the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of Government.</p>
            <p>Here we must stick; and wherever this is,
there a person must stop, as he would if upon the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62712:14"/>
top of a Precipice, till he has searched to the
utmost, and has received unquestionable satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>The loss of Peace and Order, Unity and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
are the utmost extremity that a state of things
can be brought into; and which are like the Life
of another, that a person is not to take away, till
he can no longer defend and preserve his own,
and can run no farther: And are therefore to be
kept always in our eye, and are the Polar Star by
which we must judge of our Way, and guide
our selves in the Course we are to observe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the right hand or to the left.</p>
            <p>For Mistakes in these things are extremely
dangerous; and when matters of such Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
depend upon the Principles we espouse,
and the Course we take, we cannot be too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or inquisitive, before we proceed or engage
too far in a design. We ought then to be as wary
as we would be if our Life were therein nearly
concerned.</p>
            <p>For Peace and Order are to the Publick what
Life is to our selves, and are not to be parted with
upon terms less urgent and necessary. And if as
often as persons venture upon the doing of what
has an apparent tendency to the Disturbance or
Dissolution of Government, they would put their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62712:14"/>
own Life into the Scale with it, the Balance
would incline another way; and they would no
more do what has a tendency to the one, without
previous Consideration, than they would do what
has a tendency to the other. And I should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
no better Security for the one than the other;
for the Peace of the Government, than the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of mens Lives. All would then be
quiet, <hi>the Swords</hi> that are drawn, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
that fetch Blood of the Publick, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
its safety, <hi>would be turned into ploughshares;</hi>
and <hi>peace be within our walls, and prosperity within our
palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we cannot prevent Misunderstandings,
yet the mischievous Consequences may in great
part be prevented; for there may be Charity
where there are Mistakes; and Charity will
teach us to be favourable in our opinions of
others; and incline us to <hi>think,</hi> as it will teach us
to do, <hi>no ill.</hi> Charity here begins at home, and
will teach us to condemn the Faults we find there,
in our Selves, Families, and Parties, before we
adventure to pry into, publish and censure those
of others. Charity will teach us to put our
selves into the circumstances of others, to bear
with their infirmities, <hi>considering our selves,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Apostle's Advice, <hi>Gal. 6. 1. lest
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62712:15"/>
we also be tempted;</hi> and to make the same allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
which, if in their condition and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
we would desire others to make to us.
If this were put into practice, though we may
mistake, and there will be Misunderstandings,
yet Mistakes would then do no great hurt; but
would be like the Wild Beasts in the <hi>Holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
(Isa. 11. 9.) that would lose their ravenous
and venomous nature, and become cicurated, tame
and innocent.</p>
            <p>And above all, there is a farther Blessing.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>4. Such a State and Temper is a comfortable
Evidence of God's Presence with a People; as it
is in the Text; <hi>This day we perceive the Lord is
among us, because ye have not committed this trespass
against the Lord;</hi> and that they had made evident
they were all of one mind, and alike stedfast in
the profession of the same Religion.</p>
            <p>This, I say, is an evidence of God's Presence,
where there is an union of Hearts and Affections,
and a joint concurrence in the same Practice; for
<hi>God is not the author of confusion,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Broils and Contentions might with allowance
be continued among the Heathens, when their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62712:15"/>
gods themselves were divided into Sides and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but are not to be defended under the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

charity,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 5. and that we worship but one

outdo and excel each other in?</p>
            <p>How excellent a state of things would it be, if
the Inferior would not revile the Superior, nor the
Superior set at nought the Inferior? That the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
would as much study to obey with Humility
and Modesty, as the Superior to rule with Lenity
and Moderation? And that among all, the Cause
of a Friend might be examined with the same
Exactness and Justice as that of an Enemy; and
an Enemy's with the same Caution, Respect, and
Indifference, as that of a Friend?</p>
            <p>What an excellent state of things would it be,
if all the Tribes came hither this day, as they
were wont to go up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with one consent,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 4. and were one Body in Affection, as
they are one by Constitution?</p>
            <p>It were to be wished, That there were but

mind and one mouth we did glorify God, even the father of

            <p>It were to be wished, That this Populous and

            <p>How might we then hope to have God among
us, and that might be our Song as it was theirs, <hi>We
have a strong city, salvation will God appoint for walls
and bulwarks,</hi> Isa. 26. 1.</p>
            <p>But next to that, is to be soft and gentle, calm
and easy in our Differences. We cannot expect to
be all of a mind, (that, if ever it be, must be
the work of time, and a peculiar Act of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence) but we may be peaceable and
quiet, studious of the Common Good, and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Promoters of it. We need not be fierce and
bitter; we need not <hi>bite,</hi> worry, <hi>and devour one
another,</hi> Gal. 5. 15. We need not backbite and
calumniate, vilify and reproach; and search for
matter to asperse, disparage, and load our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
with, and be glad when we find it.
We need not go out of this world, disquiet the
Ashes, and blacken the Memories of the dead,
and deal as barbarously with them, as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62712:16"/>
did with <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 31. 9. when they
cut off his Head, stripp'd off his Armour, and
sent it round about to publish it among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
as if there were not matter enough among
the Living, to find those hateful Vices of Envy
and Malice an Employment. We need not,
lastly, be froward and sullen, and rather give
up the whole, than not in all points have our
own way; and expose all to inevitable ruin, than
not have our own Humour, nay, our own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sometimes gratified: <hi>For then must we needs go
out of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How becoming rather is it our Profession;
how worthy of our common Religion; how
much for the Safety and Honour of this Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
City; and which is more, for the Honour
of Almighty God, whose Favour and Blessing
we at this time come to seek, and whose Presence
we trust is now among us, to depart hence with
a stedfast Resolution of observing the excellent
Rules of our Holy Religion, and of making
good in Practice the Character given of Charity
by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, &amp;c. <hi>Charity suffereth
long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth
not it self, is not puffed up</hi> with Self conceit, nor
prone to despise others; <hi>doth not behave it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly</hi>
in Words or Behaviour; <hi>seeketh not her own,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62712:17"/>
to the prejudice of others; <hi>is not easily provoked;
thinks</hi> and suspects <hi>no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity,</hi>
in the Slips, Miscarriages, and Faults of others,
<hi>but rejoiceth in the truth,</hi> in whatever is praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
wherever it is: <hi>Beareth</hi> and concealeth
<hi>all things</hi> that are fit to be concealed; <hi>believeth all
things,</hi> so as to put the best construction upon them
that they are capable of; and <hi>hopeth all things,</hi> where
it cannot and has no sufficient reason to believe;
<hi>endureth all things,</hi> so as not to revenge any evil
done to our selves, and to do all we can for the
good of others.</p>
            <p>If this be, we may have reason to say with
<hi>Phineas</hi> in the Text, <hi>This day we perceive that the
Lord is among us, because ye have not committed this tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass</hi>
of Division and Strife <hi>against the Lord.</hi> That
this may be the Event of our Preaching, our
Prayers, and present Assembling together, God
of his Infinite Goodness and Mercy grant, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
