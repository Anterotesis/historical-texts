            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THe Deſign of this following Tryal is, To ſhew the wickedneſs of the</hi> Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>Spirit, and the Chief Prieſts and Rulers among them: That it's an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> Porphyrian Spirit, <hi>appears by their bantering all who confeſs themſelves Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: For</hi> T. C. <hi>having ſaid,</hi> I deſire my Imperfections, nor theſe Quakers Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, may not prejudice againſt reading this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they cannot repreſent me a greater Sinner than (<hi>I thank God</hi>) I think my ſelf to be; but by their villifying me they ſhew the weakneſs of their Cauſe, and the wickedneſs of their Spirits: For the Controverſie between us is not what <hi>T. C.</hi> is, but whether or no <hi>G. Fox,</hi> &amp;c. has ſo printed as I charge, them, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Expreſſions be not Unchriſtian, &amp;c. <hi>For this, theſe</hi> Quakers <hi>thus banter me,</hi> A large Confeſſion, I promiſe you!
<pb facs="tcp:41409:3"/>
               <hi>ſay they</hi>: Why in good earneſt he hath cut off all opportunities of being told of his Faults for the future, by confeſſing the Indictment, and pleading Guilty to this and all others that may be brought againſt him now henceforth for ever: Then we may take it for granted, that whatever I have charged him with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious—he is guilty of, conſequently I have not wronged him in ſo repreſenting him—nay, nor is it poſſible for me to wrong him, <hi>&amp;c.—Little need be ſaid to ſhew the Injuſtice of the</hi> Foxonians, <hi>beſides their</hi> Scoff <hi>and</hi> Banter: <hi>But for that they ſay,</hi> How can he (<hi>i. e. T. C.</hi>) expect any other but to be banter'd? <hi>&amp;c. And not only</hi> T. C. <hi>but all who confeſs themſelves Sinners, are ſo dealt with by them. But to take a little notice of theſe Quakers Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice (for as to their</hi> Bantring, T. C. <hi>muſt</hi> expect no other <hi>from them) They ſay of</hi> T. C. He hath pleaded Guilty to this and all others that may be brought againſt him, <hi>which is falſe; for</hi> T. C. <hi>does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs (nor have they proved) he is guilty of what they charge him with, but they have wronged him: For altho' the Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
<pb facs="tcp:41409:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c. that their iniquities were great; and St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid of himſelf,</hi> I am the chiefeſt of Sinners, <hi>yet they were falſly charged and wronged by your Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they</hi> laid to <hi>David</hi>'s Charge things that he knew not; <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>was not guilty of them Sins your Forefathers accuſed him of,</hi> Acts 24. <hi>But they wronged him, as you have</hi> T. C. <hi>Nor do I find that any of the cruel Jews (ſince</hi> Paul's <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf</hi> the chiefeſt of Sinners) <hi>ever made ſo wicked and</hi> Porphyrian <hi>a</hi> Banter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>uſe of his words as you have done, as to ſay, They</hi> cannot wrong him, nor is it poſſible to wrong him, (<hi>Paul</hi>) for let me repreſent him how I will, I cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him a chiefer Sinner than he ſays, he is: <hi>Nay, ſay theſe Quakers his</hi> (i. e. <hi>T. C.'s</hi>) Conceſſion includes not only all this, <hi>i. e.</hi> Whoremonger, Swearer, Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all other Sins whatſoever: <hi>But if they pretend they ſay,</hi> Theſe Sins we hope he is not guilty of; <hi>what then? Altho' they hope ſo, yet by their own Doctrine they may charge him with them, and puniſh him accordingly,</hi> its not poſſible [<hi>for them</hi>] to wrong him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now in caſe that Paſſage were not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:41409:4"/>
properly worded as it ought, I ſee not ſo much difference between a</hi> greater Sinner, <hi>and the</hi> chief of Sinners, <hi>as to be ſo Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly dealt by: But humble Chriſtian Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments are ſo contrary to their proud Phariſaical bragging Prayers (as</hi> G. W.'<hi>s, at the end of his</hi> Judgment fixt, <hi>&amp;c.) that cauſes them to gnaſh their Teeth ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; but their own Doctrine in their Book</hi> Rabſhekah, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 70. <hi>is a proper An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them herein, and to moſt of their Books; ſay they,</hi> I defie the Father of Lies himſelf to out-do this; <hi>and</hi> I having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome part of their Book <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> &amp;c. was writ or given forth by a wicked Spirit, <hi>I ſuppoſe you will confeſs it was all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth by</hi> one Spirit; <hi>therefore let the Reader judge what the reſt of it can be,</hi> E. B.<hi>'s Work's, p.</hi> 148.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There's ſome Faults in this</hi> Tryal, <hi>&amp;c. which I deſire the Readers Charity in paſſing them by, as the ſmallneſs of the Letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was deſirous to bring it into as few Sheets as poſſible; and indeed, I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it would have taken up ſo many; but while it was in Printing, I Inſerted ſeveral more Proofs (of my Charges) into ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:41409:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
places, as I thought moſt ſuitable; which I find, cauſes it in ſome places not to Read ſo ſmooth as it ought. Alſo I have ſhortened it in ſome partiat the latter end, becauſe I find the ſame Matters, are fuller and better Treated on in the Second Edition</hi> of the Snake in the Graſs, <hi>&amp;c. And I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Worthy Author intends a full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Quakers pretended</hi> Antidote, <hi>&amp;c. Whereby, I queſtion not, but he will diſcover the Poiſon of Aſps from under the Tongue of</hi> G. Whitehead, <hi>in that pretended</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, <hi>&amp;c. as well as he has Diſcovered the Flames of</hi> the Pit of Damnation <hi>(their own Terms) which came forth out of the Mouth of</hi> W. Penn, <hi>in p.</hi> 171. <hi>and</hi> 172. <hi>in the</hi> Snake in the Graſs, <hi>&amp;c. Whereas, is their ſaid he,</hi> W. Penn, <hi>is ſo Blaſphemous, and Envious, as to confirm all theſe Quakers Blaſphemous Fury againſt the Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as being from the Holy Spirit; and alſo encourages them to pour forth</hi> ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>times more ſuch helliſh Fury; for he Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that (in his Judgment all I have here, following in this Tryal produced, and twenty times as much more (I think) I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of their</hi> Ancient Teſtimonies, <hi>is
<pb facs="tcp:41409:5"/>
too little; for he is ſo Blaſphemous, as to make the Holy Spirit the Author thereof; which is a full Proof, that their</hi> Foxonian Spirit <hi>(which they term God's, Chriſt's, and the Holy Spirit) is a wicked Spirit; for ſays he,</hi> we (<hi>i. e.</hi> Foxonian <hi>Quakers</hi>) have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them (<hi>i. e. Miniſters</hi>) but Woes, and Plagues, <hi>but the Holy Spirit comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to</hi> Pray for all Men, <hi>although the</hi> Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Spirit, <hi>contrariwiſe hath no Prayers, but</hi> Woes and Plagues <hi>for the Proteſtant Miniſters. This is a plain Demonſtration of the Pride and Envy of the</hi> Foxonian <hi>High Prieſts, or Pope</hi> W. Penn <hi>&amp;c. And altho' he formerly by ſuch Endeavours (to Defame, in order to deſtroy the Proteſtant Miniſters) got great Favour and Reward too formerly, ſo I know not but that by his Hypocriſie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he may get as much Intereſt and Power now, and effect the ſame againſt me, as his Predeceſſor,</hi> Haman <hi>intended againſt</hi> Mordicai; <hi>yet I bleſs God, I fear him no more than</hi> David <hi>did</hi> Goliah; <hi>but ſhall, I hope, have Opportunity further to diſcover them: For ſurely all true Engliſh Proteſtants, when they have ſeen all here following, of their Envy againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and what is alſo in the</hi> Snake in the
<pb facs="tcp:41409:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Graſs, <hi>&amp;c. will conclude that he,</hi> W. Penn, <hi>hath ſhewed ſo little of an Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant <hi>or Gentleman, that he ſcarcely deſerves ſuch a Character. Yet as he and</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>have done for their</hi> Idol of Jealouſie, Fox, <hi>exalt and commend him &amp; his wicked works, ſo there is</hi> J. Field, <hi>and</hi> W. Bingley, <hi>&amp;c. to do the ſame for them; and ſo Canonize each other as Saints of the higheſt Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to</hi> C. Wade <hi>in</hi> Great Myſt. <hi>p.</hi> 250. The Devil was in thee, <hi>ſays</hi> Fox; Thou ſay'ſt thou waſt ſaved by Chriſt without thee: <hi>This ſo diſturbed the envious</hi> Fox, <hi>that he ſaid to him,</hi> And ſo haſt recorded thy ſelf a Reprobate; <hi>nay, to be by</hi> Fox <hi>record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Reprobate, was not puniſhment bad enough for him, but he adjoyns to it,</hi> And ſo ignorant of Chriſt within; <hi>as if to confeſs Salvation by our Lord Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>without us, were an infallible mark of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt within; yet they ſay Chriſt is not divided: But notwithſtanding they print this</hi> C. W. <hi>as ſuch an ignorant Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, yet he has made ſound Confeſſions to Chriſt within: But thereby they not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate</hi> C. W. <hi>but all Chriſtians beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; only the Gentiles, becauſe they do not

pretend to Salvation by him, they have a great deal of Charity for them, and allow them to have faith. Alſo in a Book, intituled,</hi> The Doctrine of Perfection, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 19. <hi>ſay they,</hi> When you come to this [<hi>their Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> &amp;c.] you will ceaſe remembring his death at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and will come to ſee how he has been crucified in you, <hi>&amp;c. But this their Light or Star, which leads to forget his</hi> [i. e. <hi>Chriſt's] death at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>cannot be his. Alſo</hi> G.

<q>Chriſt is to be conſidered two ways—he is not at a diſtance from ſuch as truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but—dwells in their hearts by faith;</q>
but ſays he,
<q>Reſpecting his Perſon, or bodily preſence, his glorious or glorified Body, ſo he is conſidered as being without, not within the Soul.</q>
Notwithſtanding theſe Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments and Chriſtian Diſtinctions, yet</hi> Fox <hi>oppoſes this; and altho' they do not in plain expreſs words, yet they do implicitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Aſcenſion and now being of our Lord Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>as he was a viſible or ſeen Man or Perſon, by their not allowing him to be Aſcended into any Heaven above and without Men; for the Miniſters ſaying,</hi> Chriſt is True God, and True Man; <hi>they
<pb facs="tcp:41409:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blaſphemouſly ſay,</hi>
               <q>Here ſottiſh Minds, your imagined God beyond the Stars, and your carnal Chriſt—is utterly teſtified againſt, by the Light which comes from Chriſt.</q>
And further ſay, <hi>
                  <q>That this Chriſt—is God and Man in one Perſon, is a Lye. </q>And the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters further ſay,</hi>
               <q>Chriſt the only God and Man in one Perſon, remains for ever a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Perſon from all Saints—notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their union with him.</q>
The Quakers Anſwer is, <hi>
                  <q>Your words are utterly deny'd, and your diſtinctions are abominable.</q> But theſe Quakers Contempts are much more abominable to all Chriſtians, altho' not to G.</hi> Whitehead, <hi>&amp;c.

            <head>A Juſt and Lawful Tryal of the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quaker's Chief Prieſts, by a perfect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt them, and they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of their own Ancient Teſtimonies; and being brought to the Bar of Juſtice, their own Ancient Teſtimonies and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices have judged them Guilty, and to be no Chriſtians of Chriſt's making, and therefore to be teſtified againſt by all true Chriſtians; by a Friend to <hi>England</hi>'s Government, Governors, and Laws (which have been contemn'd and deſpiſed by them) is this ſent abroad.</head>
            <p>PRoteſtant Readers, more eſpecially you who take on you the care and cure of Souls, I deſire you would not refuſe to read this ſmall Tract, becauſe of its relation to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm, although the Chief Prieſts and Maſters of them have attained to that degree of Perfection, in that art of writing ſo ſeditiouſly ſcandalous, falſe, and arrogantly againſt the Proteſtant Religion, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Miniſters thereof in general) the Government and Governours (eſpecially Monarchy and Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy) and our two late Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> I. and II. in theſe and other ſuch envious and deſtructive Works
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41409:8"/>
they have printed ſo much, and ſo many Volumes that it beſpeaks them, who ſuppoſe them (<hi>i. e.</hi> theſe Quakers) to be Men of any good Conſciences, or ſound Judgment, to have little ſenſe themſelves: Theſe Quakers in the numerouſneſs and ſeditious Printed Pamphlets, having ſo out-run the bounds of Morality in theſe things, whereby their ſeditious Libels are ſpread over this and other Nations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due oppoſition, as being by Men of Learning and Senſe, thought to carry in themſelves their own Confutation.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Ancient Teſtimony</hi> (now revived and injoy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned their Subjects by their <hi>White-hart-court</hi> Conclave in their Act made 1696.) was as <hi>Haman</hi>'s Pride and Envy lead him to endeavour the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to effect it, he maliciouſly and falſly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt them to inſence the King, as in <hi>Eſther</hi> 3. So theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers being influenced by the ſame Spirit of Pride and Envy againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters in general, <hi>their Thirſt</hi> after <hi>their Deſtruction</hi> being ſo <hi>inſatiable,</hi> that they were ſo wicked, as to endeavour to incenſe all the ſeveral Governments, from 1642. to 1660. againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters as being for the King, <hi>i. e.</hi> both the <hi>Charles</hi>'s I. and II. eſpecially for endeavouring the Reſtoration, as in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Love, &amp;c.</hi> how did theſe Quakers, improve that opportunity to incenſe the then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and People againſt them, and aſſoon as King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was reſtored in 1660. they renewed their Proſecution againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters for their Deſtruction, and then, whereas they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>informed</hi> againſt them as being for him the ſame King <hi>Charles</hi> II. they now 1660. change their Charge, and inform againſt them to him, as being againſt him, and <hi>dangerous</hi> to his Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I ſay, ſuch was their Bloody Envy againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, that they the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers did accuſe them for being for the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when times turned, they turn alſo, and accuſe them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41409:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for being againſt him, this their unuſual Envy and Wickedneſs is ſo ſcandalous to the Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in general, as they go for ſuch, that it deſerves to be teſtified againſt by all true Proteſtants; but inſtead thereof, the now Chief <hi>Foxonians W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead, &amp;c.</hi> do reprint their Seditious and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Pamphlets in great Volumes in Folio, with high commendations of the wicked Authors <hi>Fox</hi> their Idol of Jealouſie, <hi>many have done well, but thou dear George</hi> (ſays <hi>W. Penn.) hath excelled them all,</hi> excuſe, and vindicate their blaſphemous Titles, as <hi>the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> and theſe Men and their wicked Works are, by long Epiſtles of high commendations, from <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> recommended to the younger Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as <hi>Prophets of God,</hi> and <hi>more than a Prophet,</hi> and ſo by their own Doctrine to have equal or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority than the Scripture, their Idol of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie <hi>Foxes</hi> wicked Works preſented to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> alſo is as a Monument ſet up in their Quakers publick Meeting at the <hi>Savoy</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and although they pretend they were given forth by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial command from the Lord, yet theſe wicked now <hi>Foxonians</hi> have altered ſuch, and left out and put in and changed words as they pleaſe, as may be proved in a diſtinct Tract; but its their treaſonable and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious ancient Teſtimony that they have thus new forged, but for their Contempts and Defamations, Lyes and Scandals they have caſt on the Proteſtant Miniſters, them they have to the full reprinted and added, more eſpecially <hi>W. Penn,</hi> who being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Court more than others, and an intelligible Perſon, he quickly found the Papiſt Intereſt great there; and there were not wanting in Court Men of judgment, who as quickly eſpied him as a fit Engine to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, by defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their Miniſters, and in order thereto, he had favour and encouragement in that wicked Work, as his many Printed <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> ſince the Reſtoration, where he vents his malice and rage againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

Miniſters, as by <hi>F. B.</hi> and <hi>G.

Bs.</hi> Works, they ſay he died a Priſoner and Martyr, now in common acceptation, its as if he dyed in Priſon, and by ſome ill uſage there; nay a Dutch Hiſtorian Prints it he dyed in Priſon; hereby the Government of <hi>England</hi> is reflected on all over Chriſtendom as cruel, whereas it appears as in <hi>Satan diſrob'd, &amp;c.</hi> that although he was a Priſoner, yet he was not in Priſon when he dyed, but in caſe he had dyed in Priſon, it had not been becauſe of ill uſage or ill accommodation, for he had a convenient apartment to himſelf, and was better provided for and fed, than ever he was in his life before he became a Quaker, by the judgment of them that knew him formerly; but thus they abuſe Authority and exalt themſelves, by ſuch fallacious ways untaken notice of, and while ſome ſleep, or mind not, the Enemies takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers are now a very great number, or body of rich politick People, and ſo purſe proud and ſtrong, no one People (<hi>i. e.</hi> diſſenting Society) is able to deal with them.</p>
            <p>They are by their Jeſuitical Politick way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment united as one intire Body, unto one Head or Conclave of Cardinals, of Chief Prieſts in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Whitehead, &amp;c.</hi> from, and by whoſe Authority a vaſt number of their ſeditious Libels are ſpread all over <hi>England</hi>'s Dominions and elſewhere; and they are ſo formidable, that ſcarce any eminent Magiſtrate but they can (by ſome intereſt or other they have or can

make) influence, for if any juſt complaint be againſt any of their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> they can by their Meetings know who of them have moſt influence on ſuch in Power moſt concerned, and ſo can by their quibbles, ſmooth and fawning pretences perſwade thar they are <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> and their Adverſaries <hi>Malicious,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>F.

B. G. K.</hi> and <hi>W. B.</hi> and is it not as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſuppreſs Error and Sedition, as for them to ſuppreſs Truth, alſo as much care ought to be taken for ſpreading ſuch Books that are printed in defence of the Proteſtants againſt them, as they do to ſpread theirs; for although there have been ſome ſuch wrot, yet ſo few will buy them, that the Bookſellers are not willing to undertake to Print them, which if they were encouraged by a common vend for ſuch Books, it might be ſome check to their Inſolency, and help to open the Underſtandings of People; for how can it be expected, but that the vulgar People and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41409:10"/>
abroad ſhould believe all their Contempts of the Proteſtant Miniſters be true, becauſe ſo publick all over the Nation and other Parts without oppoſition, not only in their ſmall Pamphlets, but alſo in great Volumes (when them fierce Deſpiſers <hi>Fox, &amp;c.</hi> be dead,) with ſuch long Epiſtles or high Commendations of them and their wicked Works, by <hi>W.

for being for the King, the Book <hi>Guilty covered Clergy man,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 48. ſays of the Miniſters, <q>mind reader what theſe Men hunt after, even blood, blood;</q> this is becauſe the Miniſters ſay, their Doctrine againſt Swearing <hi>was a fragment of the Germain Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi>; but judge Reader, whether this afore of their incenſing the King againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters is not a fuller proof of <hi>their hunting after Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Blood,</hi> then that ſaying of the Miniſters they ſo term for in their Book aforementioned pag. 48.
Say they, <q>but ſtay Sirs, was it a Quaker, or was it a Prieſt that loſt his Head on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> by the Sword of Juſtice (mind that) were both your Hands (<hi>i. e.</hi> two Miniſters) clear of the wickedneſs of that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Deſign (that Deſign was as they word it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in bringing him <hi>i. e.

<hi>W. Penn</hi> to incenſe the King againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, cites one of them ſaying to former Powers <q>do not I beſeech you conſent to a toleration of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Worſhip,</q> and for fear it would not inrage them, he adds his aggravating explanation, ſays he,
<q>as much as to ſay away with the Biſhop's, whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England</hi>;</q>
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain this ſame <hi>W. Penn</hi> quotes a Miniſter ſaying,
<q>thus, ſo many Delinquents, that is to ſay, Royaliſts (ſays the Quaker, fearing it would not effect his Bloody Deſign without his aggravatings) are in Priſon and few brought to Tryal, did he mean to releaſe them?

thus Malicious were they when the King came in, although as is afore ſhewn they uſed the ſame Terms; much more I have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of their Seditious and Malicious Printed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, again the Proteſtant Miniſters as being for the King to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and to the King in 1660. for being againſt him; I am ſure, if theſe Quakers be not <hi>the beſt to be ſpared,</hi> this wicked envious <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit is; and Reader judge, whether theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers be not more Malicious Informers, than. <hi>F.

hereby have they confirmed all their former Seditious Doctrines in Print, as well againſt the King as againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters; nay, all their contempts of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi>'s Perſon, Blood and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; therefore whatever ſeeming fair Confeſſions they may (for to deceive the Government) now make, of owning the preſent Government, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of King, Houſe of Lords, and Biſhops, and Church of <hi>England</hi> as now Eſtabliſhed, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and Chriſt, yet they have hereby (<hi>i. e.</hi> their Meetings Injunction) not only owned, but alſo in as plain Terms, as they durſt, commanded their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to hold them up, and in order thereto it is, that they do ſo defend their old Blaſphemies and Seditious Printed <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> of their Idol of Jealouſie <hi>Fox, &amp;c.</hi> whilſt they pretend to believe and own the contrary: And although this Tryal hath been long wrot, yet had not been now publiſhed, but that they inſtead of diſowning theſe erronious <hi>Ancient Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> as they ought, if they were True Proteſtants, they cover and excuſe them, and pretend they are ſuch <hi>quiet</hi> innocent ones <hi>in the Land,</hi> and therefore that People may not be deceived by their good words, but may ſee them as they are envious Slanderers and Perſecutors of the Proteſtant Miniſters, is this now publiſhed, alſo, becauſe theſe <hi>Foxonian Rabſhakes</hi> are ſo ſhameleſs, as to <hi>challenge it as out-doing the Devil</hi> (their own <hi>Foxonian Spirit</hi>) becauſe after it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is ſaid in <hi>diſcovery inlarged, &amp;c.</hi>
               <q>I find their Books ſtuft with ſuch baſe Inſinuations and Defamations

Now, I ſay, <hi>he the Devil hath out-done it in,</hi> and by themſelves, as in pages 10.11.31.32.34. to 38. of that Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and alſo more fully proved in <hi>the Sn. in the Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. and Satan diſrobed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by <hi>George Keith,</hi> in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books printed by him. Alſo in one Sheet, titled, <hi>an Eſſay to allay G.

I ſay, <q>if you think theſe things too hard, with the Light of Chriſt ſearch your ſelves, and ſee if it be not the reward of your own hands, and if you ſay wherefore am I made publick, (its your own anſwer) thou (<hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit) haſt committed thy lewdneſs before the Sun, therefore openly art thou reproved, who haſt ſinned openly; alſo again you ſay in Print, muſt not Jealouſie be ſtirr'd up in the Powers of the Earth againſt them (<hi>i. e.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors) as they have again others:</q>
And although I am ſenſible your influence and intereſt is ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that I know not how ſoon I may feel the tender love of your Spirit as <hi>W.

<q>this hath cauſed thee to ſpew out on a Paper— for the Dogs to lick up— they take ſo much of thy filthy ſpewing it cauſes them to vomit— thou purges upward and downward— thou needs one to wipe thee— thou mak'ſt a pitiful ſtink— through thy vomiting and purging thou beſmears every one that comes nigh thee— one may follow thee by the ſmell, wilt not give over vomiting— thou ſtinks all the Country over— like a Man with a ſcall'd Head, and Horſe with a gall'd Back— making People Vomit and Spew— that they make ſuch a ſtink— thou may'ſt be aſham'd with thy filthy ſpewing, if thou wert not Impudent; alſo <hi>Margaret (Foxes</hi> Wife) wrot thus to him, thou haſt committed Sacrilege which will never be forgiven thee— thou art accurſed and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Portion canſt thou have— thou Infidel— Child of Darkneſs— the Curſe Chriſt hath pronounced on thee, thou art the Man thou Impudent Lyar— night Owl, wicked Lyar;</q>
and as I can find the cauſe of

all this naſty and <hi>rabſhake</hi> Language from them, was, becauſe he diſputed againſt them about the <hi>Light in every Man,</hi> and publiſhed ſomething about it; now if you can ſhew me ſuch naſty Words from <hi>J.

S.</hi> then all you <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers are chargeable, as guilty of them and your pretended counterfeit new Confeſſions ought no more to be believed, or clear you, than a Thief when he is convict of Theft, his ſaying he really believes the Ten Commandments may clear him; but the <hi>Foxonians</hi> falſly accuſing the Proteſtant Miniſters

and endeavouring to render them odious, prove its true as they themſelves ſay, that

here you may ſee what their Spirit, which they term Truth, counted <hi>evil and reproved</hi> in the beginning 1657. and what it owned and juſtified; alſo even the worſt of their Actions 1648. and ſo as their Spirit changes not in <hi>what it condemns as evil,</hi> nor doth it change in what it owned, vindicated, and juſtified then, but what it then juſtified it doth the ſame ſtill, <hi>for it changes</hi> not, if they the <hi>Foxonians</hi> ſay true, but finding theſe <hi>Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Quakers ſo commend and eſpouſe <hi>the Plea for the Commonwealth, &amp;c.</hi> I bought that becauſe I would be fully inform'd what their <hi>Ancient Teſtimony</hi> in the beginning was, and find it much agreeable to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>E.

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41409:23"/>
and them Governments, when as themſelves (that is <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers) were ſo highly guilty in the ſame Caſe; and here I have proved their <hi>being out of Chriſt's Doctrine,</hi> and ſo by their own Doctrine <hi>to be of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> for here afore you ſee how heinous a ſin they make it, even <hi>as Crucifying our Lord,</hi> for ſaying,
<q>the Proteſtant Religion was in danger to be rooted out by the Quakers;</q>
here its plain they did not do as they would be done by, for in the ſame Libel they inform againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters as dangerous to the King; theſe <hi>Foxonians G. Whitehead, &amp;c.</hi> reflect on, and endeavour to incenſe the King againſt the Men, the <hi>Creatures, they ſtrike at them,</hi> therefore their Spirit or Light, which they blaſphemouſly <hi>term Truth, and the Spirit of God, &amp;c.</hi> cannot be the ſame Spirit as Chriſt and the Apoſtles had by their own judgment; now ſeeing its not Chriſt's Spirit, and they ſay there are but Two Spirits <hi>Gods</hi> and the <hi>Devils,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have judged it; I have now proved them (the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts) ſo Wicked and Malicious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, that they have infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt them to <hi>Oliver, &amp;c.</hi> for being for the King, and aſſoon as ever the King was reſtored, they were ſo abominable ſhameleſs as to inform againſt them, for being againſt him, when themſelves were guilty of the ſame in a higher degree, and were not content, although they had <hi>Chr. Love</hi>'s (a Miniſters) Life; but they accuſe the Miniſters in General, as in pag. 12. its ſaid,
<q>for the Parties this Caſe reſpects, it runs through generally the whole Miniſtry of the Nation, and in their Book <hi>Information to the Army,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 7. ſay they, when a company of greedy Prieſts came to tell you they had not engaged with <hi>G. Booth</hi> in the Rebellion, but your real Friends Quakers, who gave you and the Army intelligence about the Inſurrection in <hi>Cheſhire (i. e.</hi> Sir <hi>G.

               </q>and in their Book the Weſt to North pag. 102. ſay they, theſe Innocent Servants of the Lord (<hi>G. Fox

               <q>Many of them have drawn the Sword and fought in the Field from firſt to laſt; </q>alſo p. 16. ſay they, <q>the Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The defence of them we have in the late Wars vindicated in the Field with our Blood.</q>
But this and many others they have left out, in reprinting the Letter in <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Journal, as may hereafter be more fully ſhown. But, in the mean time take this caution, not to truſt nor believe theſe now <hi>Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts, <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> &amp;c. in what they print or recommend to you, as the works of their Fellows, <hi>Fox, &amp;c.</hi> or as other mens words; they have ſo altered them in many places, by leaving out and adding, to forge them to their purpoſe: Therefore you may judge what abominable falſhoods they will impoſe on the World hereafter; when thoſe few now living, who are able to detect them, be dead; but there is a Collection (of as many as are found) to be publiſhed, that by that you may judge of the reſt of their Works, what groſe Forgers they are, and will be. And ſeeing they ſay <hi>they are contrary in Principle and Doctrine</hi> (to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſters,) and <q>we cannot (as they ſay) own both, but muſt deny one:</q> Therefore, either all the Generations of Proteſtants in all Ages, to the end of Time, not only Miniſters, but Princes, and all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Degrees muſt be condemned as <hi>Antichriſts</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates</hi> (as theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers have, and do record them to poſterity,) except one <hi>Thorpe, &amp;c.</hi> or elſe theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers Blaſphemous, <hi>Seditious Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> which their <hi>Truth</hi> at firſt taught them, muſt be condemned and diſowned. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is moſt reaſonable, that theſe few <hi>Foxonian</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers (moſt of them being dead, except <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>) come under the deſerved blame of falſe Accuſers, and men influenc'd by a wrong Spirit; and their Blaſphemous and Seditious Teſtimonies publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned; or their infamous Contempts and Slanders be recommended to after Ages for Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations; and the wicked Authors, as the only <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41409:24"/>
of God</hi> in this Age. What can be their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but that their Blaſphemous, Seditious <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> may be of as great or greater Authority than the Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>But as a further proof, that they, theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quaker's Spirit is not Chriſt's, the Apoſtles and all Proteſtants, but an avowed Enemy to the Proteſtant Religion, and Miniſters in general. They are not content with their own volumnious defamatious Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they have filled the World with by their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Libels; but to gratifie the Papiſt's intereſt (which then was great, and able to defend and reward them,) therefore they joyn with their elder Siſter <hi>Rome,</hi> and print in 1671<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with their own in <hi>J. C.</hi>'s Works (highly extolled by <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead, Fox</hi> and his Wife) A Papiſt ſcandalous Libel; wherein they term the Proteſtant Bible <hi>Brazen-fac'd Book,</hi> and villifie the beginning of the Reformation; and give the Proteſtant Miniſters the ſame Helliſh Names as their own Books do; and ſay,
<q>to ſee ſuch ſtand in a Pulpit with ſuch a Brazen-fac'd Book, as is their unjuſt Bible; and term it corrupt, and a perverſe Book.</q>
Such <hi>Brazen Faces</hi> had theſe <hi>Foxonians,</hi> when the Papiſts intereſt was great. <hi>Haman</hi> like, improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their intereſt, to deſtroy the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters becauſe they would not bow to their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Spirit. This ſhews what kind of Proteſtants they would have proved, if what they then expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted had taken effect; even ſerving the Proteſtants as they had done all the former Governments from 1648. to 1660. own; and encourage them while they proſper; but when like to fall or gone, then exclaim againſt them; and would do by the Proteſtants as they have by the Diſſenters, Inform againſt them, when it's for their intereſt; and tell the Papiſt their elder Siſter, <q>how ſhall ſhe ever, without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to her ſelf, put confidence in ſuch Hereticks as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants be.</q> And it's not unlikely, but that they printed at large this ſeditious Libel
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41409:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Papiſts againſt the Proteſtants; and put it into their Works, in ſuch a remarkable Character, as an earneſt-penny, that they may come in with their elder Siſter <hi>Rome</hi> for a ſhare, when they ſee it for their intereſt to pull off their Masks.</p>
            <p>Another proof I ſhall give, that their Light or Spirit is not from Heaven above, but more likely from the Pit of <hi>Damnation</hi> below; for to Defame the Proteſtant Miniſters, in a Book Entituled, <hi>A Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Warning,</hi> &amp;c. they ſay,
<q>could people hear the cry of Thouſands out of the Pit of Damnation, they would here others thus lament; Presbyterians and Independants, under the Notion of Goſpel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, were the Men that ſeduced us hither: This is (ſay they) the cry of Thouſands of our dear Countrymen.</q>
This was in 1675. for the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy; they had Damned them years before. But this ſhews you are well acquainted in Hell: but, altho' I dare not pretend to be ſo converſant with Hell as you; yet, have cauſe to ſuſpect that you forge falſe intelligence from thence; for you who are ſo accuſtomed to abuſe both living and dead, may be thought to do the ſame here alſo; and I rather think, there is, and will be more there ſo <hi>crying</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Idols of Jealouſie, <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. and that it's <hi>Fox</hi>'s blaſphemous lying Spirit as was in your brother <hi>Foxonian</hi> Prieſt, <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> (that lying Prophet of yours) that hath <hi>influenc'd</hi> you to invent and print this envious Slander againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, to gratify your elder Siſter <hi>Rome</hi>; and this ſhews that you are hers (if not, the Devils as you charge Mr. <hi>Pennyman) Factors, Porters,</hi> and <hi>Agents</hi> to promote ſpread and vend her Wares; and that you agree and like well her contempt of the Proteſtant <hi>Bible,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters</hi>; and if all <hi>Rome</hi> and your own helliſh Names be not enough, you will to help out, forge news from <hi>the Pit of Damnation</hi> alſo to help; and altho' you ſeem to envy againſt your elder Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Rome,</hi> it's for Preheminence, becauſe you muſt be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41409:25"/>
exalted above all. But you like well, and take her part in defaming the Proteſtant Religion; <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Miniſter</hi>; nay, you are ſo <hi>Brazen-fac'd</hi> as to inform againſt a Proteſtant Miniſter G. G. for as you ſay, praying for <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Army (ſent to high <hi>Spaniola</hi>) thus,
<q>Lord bleſs the Army of the Lamb againſt the Beaſt, and give them ſucceſs; and you term him notorious lying Prophet, poſſeſs'd with a Legion of lying Spirits; and in the concluſion, warn People againſt the Presbyterian and Independant Miniſters in general, as the Plague.</q>
But why are you ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry? I find it's becauſe they had ſubſcribed to an Epiſtle wrote in recommendation of a Book of <hi>J. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

C.</hi>'s Book wherein is this contempt on the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and <hi>Bible, &amp;c. as a Brazen-fac'd, falſe and perverſe, corrupt and unjuſt Book,</hi> and the whole Generation of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants. For, after many of your helliſh characters of <hi>Witches,</hi> &amp;c. given them there; then ſay you, <q>if the Teachers be ſuch, what muſt the Proteſtants themſelves be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Your eſpouſing and recommending this and your own Defamations are of much worſe conſequence to the Proteſtant Religion, than theirs was to Quakeriſm; or than <hi>W. Bradford</hi>'s printing for <hi>G. K.</hi> whom you impriſoned, and took away his Goods; but in theſe afore inſtances you have proved your ſelves no Friends, but Enemies to the Proteſtant Bible and Miniſters: And ſurely it's high time for all Proteſtants to have a care of <hi>Rome at home (i. e.</hi> the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers); for, an Enemy within is much more dangerous than at a diſtance: But let's examine whether you <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers are not guilty of owning <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Army as well as <hi>G.

ſhould they do there, if, as you ſay, you
<q>deny all outward Fightings, with outward weapons for any end or pretence whatſoever;</q>
compare this and others of yours before 1660. and your fallacious pretence to the King; but you have a reſerve in your laſt year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>White-hart-court</hi> Conclave; you may by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that <hi>reaſſume</hi> theſe, or the contrary, which you pleaſe of your <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> again: For indeed, moſt of your flattering Addreſſes and pretended own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are as fallacious and ſquinting as your confeſſions of Faith; for any one may make ſuch a ſubmiſſion to a company of Houſe-breakers, when they have bound him and his Family; or to any Pirates, when by them at Sea overcome and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>there is ſomething of God in it,</hi> and in ſuch fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous general terms as they would have put of the Parliament with, when their act about Swearing was in hand; but the weakneſs of it was ſhewed them, and they adviſed how to amend it, which was done when they ſee their ſquinting one would not do. And I find little in all their ownings of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. but if ever the 1648 cauſe ſhould come in faſhion, but that they might reaſſume all their <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent holy Teſtimonies</hi> againſt King, Lords and Biſhops, <hi>in the beginning</hi>; their terms are ſo looſe and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, they will ſerve for the <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Pope, &amp;c.</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their uſing their ſquinting term (<hi>Ceſar</hi> in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> Life:) but to ſhew the Quakers owning <hi>Ol.C</hi>'s power (for which they, inform againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters) ſay they to him, <hi>He</hi> (God)

a true gipſy Prophet, (and whether he deſerved a Prophet or a Gipſy's reward judge.)</p>
            <p>But, how this agrees with their novel fallacious pretence 1660. aforementioned, which <hi>Fox</hi>'s Name is to, and 11 more; and yet this <hi>Fox</hi> encourag'd <hi>Oliver,</hi> ſaying to him,
<q>Friend, thou ſhould'ſt have invited all Chriſtians — that are againſt Popery to thee.— Again, invite all that profeſs againſt the Pope in all Nations to joyn with thee againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Now, what great deceit is it in them, after all their complaints, becauſe they were turn'd out of the Army; and boaſting how <hi>they had fought from firſt to laſt,</hi> and encouraging <hi>Oliver</hi> to go on; yet when that intereſt againſt the King, which they had ſo encourag'd and eſpous'd was defeated, then to be ſo ſhameleſs as to pretend they were againſt <hi>all Fighting,</hi> &amp;c. Surely if a Pirate that has taken and robbed a Merchant Man at Sea, and afterwards the Merchant and Seamen again overcome the Pirates, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Ship and Goods, would it excuſe the Pirates then to ſay, <q>they are againſt, and utterly deny all outward Wars and Fightings with outward Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, for any end, or under any pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:</q> Surely ſuch a ſham would not excuſe them, no more ſhould theſe Quakers he excuſed.
But yet, again for a ſloop in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> where the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in their own hands, they could Fight; nay becauſe <hi>G. K.</hi> reminded them of their pretended <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Teſtimony</hi> againſt Fighting, they preſented him as in p. 6. But it's worthy of conſideration whether or no, that if <hi>G. K.</hi>'s reminding them of their <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſtimony</hi> were ſuch a high crime, whether or no the Aſſertors, Promotors, and Holders up of that principle and <hi>Ancient Teſtimony</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> be not as dangerous and puniſhable as well as by them in <hi>Penſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> and that to be looked on as a ſham, for here afore it's proved they could Fight and can Fight, and have a reſerve for it, when their Spirit command them, for in their Declaration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 10<hi>th.</hi> Month 1659. a little before the Reſtoration ſay they, <hi>He (i. e.</hi> God)
<q>might command thouſands of his Saints at this day to Fight in his cauſe,— and give them Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over all their Enemies; but again ſay they, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we yet believe (mark that <hi>yet</hi>) he will make uſe of us in that way, tho it be his right to Rule in Nations, and our heirſhip (mark that) to poſſeſs the utmoſt parts of the Earth; but for the preſent (mind the preſent) we are given up to ſuffer; but,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41409:27"/>
how long that preſent will continue, it were worth knowing. Again ſay they, as Righteouſneſs appears in any we are ready to joyn with it in our Prayers, —yea and otherwiſe (mark this otherwiſe, if it may not be made to mean what they pleaſe,) and further ſay they, when ever it (Righteouſneſs) ſhall appear, we ſhall rejoyce—and add our help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that it may proſper, (mark help) for the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of Righteouſneſs in the Earth; our all is not dear unto us, tho hitherto we have been ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>&amp;c..</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But moſt of this and much more I find they have left out in the reprint of <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, altho' they ſay the ſubſtance <hi>of it was given forth by</hi> E. B. <hi>being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord,</hi> and ſigned by 15 of them, in reſpect to ſome, I forbear their Names. But it's worth mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in what ſquinting 2 Fac'd words they expreſs themſelves here; juſt as they do in their confeſſions of Faith, and their intended ſham owning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: (This is a digreſſion,) but to return.</p>
            <p>I have here afore prov'd their owning <hi>O. C.</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt <hi>Spain</hi>; but it may be objected that I have not proved they term <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Army the <hi>Lamb</hi>'s; but <hi>Fox</hi> terms <hi>Oliver</hi> his <hi>Dear Friend,</hi> (yet in 1660. theſe Quakers inform againſt the Miniſters for ſaying they were his real Friends) and bid him ſtand up in <hi>the Lambs Authority</hi>; and for their owning of <hi>Rich. Crom.</hi> to him, they ſay of themſelves, they <hi>wiſh well to thee,</hi> —
<q>and be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs and Peace in thy Government. Again, if thou walk with the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and preſerve his People (<hi>Quakers</hi>) then ſhalt thou proſper, and thy Name be greater than thy Fathers; and the numberleſs number of this People (<hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>) will ſtand by thee, and defend thee and thy juſt Government, </q>(obſerve how ſtrong and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous they thought themſelves then in <hi>Rich. C.</hi>'s time,) <q>and (ſay they) their Hearts ſhall cleave unto thee, and thou ſhalt proſper for their ſakes; and none of thy Enemies ſhall have power over thee to deſtroy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41409:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thee, tho' many may ſeek thy Life. — Live (ſay they) in God's Wiſdom, then none ſhall touch thee, and all that fear God (<hi>Quakers</hi>) will be on thy ſide and take thy part.</q>
Here the Father of lyes in <hi>G. F.</hi> could promiſe altho' not perform. Again ſay they to him <hi>R. C.</hi>
               <q>thou art now ſet up in his (<hi>i. e. Olivers</hi>) ſtead;—the hand of the Lord is in the matter, if but to try thee (O profound Prophet or elſe a Gip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,) and (ſay they) it's he (the Lord) hath brought it to paſs:</q>
This ſhews they owned <hi>R. C.</hi> in their ſquinting way, as they did the King.</p>
            <p>Next, to prove their owning the Army in turning out <hi>R. C.</hi> and the Parliament, ſay they to the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in their <hi>Information,</hi> &amp;c. to the Army;
<q>if they (<hi>i. e. the Parliament</hi>) cry up their priviledge to do what they liſt, then it's no Rebellion — to call them away. —Again, if they will not harken to the cry of their Maſters (the People) but it may be call them Rebels if they ſhould be turn'd out (mark them words Maſters the People) when they are gone from that in which their power ſtood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, to encourage the Army they ſay,
<q>the long Parliament counted it no Treaſon to oppoſe him (<hi>the King</hi>) ſeeing the end was not anſwered, he ſhould have ſatisfied; and God decided the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, by overthrowing one, and eſtabliſhing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a ſeaſon. Again ſay they, the Army in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtop to that which did retard from the end aforeſaid (<hi>the good old Cauſe</hi>) in God's ſight is no Rebellion:</q>
Much of this is left out in their reprint, but theſe prove the Quakers owning the former Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers againſt the King; and ſay they to the Soldiers, <hi>put no Cavaleers in place,</hi> in 1659. and of them Cavaleers ſay they,
<q>thus ſaith the Lord, you are become curſed in all your hatchings; — the purpoſe of your Hearts hath been known to be always againſt my powerful Truth: But in 1660. to the ſame People ſay they, You are now juſtly raiſed up to correct them (<hi>i. e.</hi> the former Uſurpers)</q> as I afore ſay, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41409:28"/>
all Powers in being; but, like <hi>Rats, fly from a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſe</hi>; and exclaim and inform againſt them, when gone.
Their Hypocriſie is great, and to be abhorred, as well as is their Envy againſt the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding they had ſo highly owned and encouraged <hi>O. C.</hi> and <hi>R. C. &amp;c.</hi> yet they inform againſt the Miniſters for ſo doing, not only in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, but in other Pamphlets, as <hi>Peaceable Advice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Truth's Character,</hi> &amp;c. There they inform againſt them, for (as they, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Quakers, ſay) comparing him to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> and for owning him as their <hi>Supream Governour,</hi> and becauſe they ſaid they were <hi>his real Friends,</hi> &amp;c. And ſay theſe envious Quakers, <hi>If you mean</hi> O. C. <hi>he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like</hi> Ahab, <hi>who killed and took poſſeſſion</hi>: And (ſay they)
<q>Did not O. C. the like? And you (<hi>i. e. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>) (who flattered him) have been like <hi>Ahab</hi>'s four hundred Prophets, that with one accord declared good to that wicked Man (i. e. O. C.)</q>
Yet you ſee here before, how the Quakers alſo owned and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him, even in his 1648 Action; and were far from blaming him then for <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>taking poſſeſſion</hi>: And although I have ſhewn <hi>Fox</hi> termed him <hi>his Dear Friend,</hi> yet they inform againſt the Miniſters for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were <hi>his Real Friends</hi>: From whence it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the <hi>Foxonian Quakers</hi> were more like the four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prophets than <hi>Elijah,</hi> for they did not then blame O. C. for <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>taking poſſeſſion,</hi> but like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>'s Prophets, with a lying <hi>Spirit in their Mouths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared good to him with one Mouth. G Fox</hi> and <hi>E. B.</hi> &amp;c. as is before, and more fully in the <hi>Snake in the Graſs, &amp;c.</hi> ſhewn.</p>
            <p>And their own Printed Defamation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Miniſters to the King, may juſtly be returned to themſelves:
<q>Alas for the King! Shall he find any among them (if they be <hi>all of one Mind and Judgment,</hi> as they pretend) or any at all of that Fraternity (<hi>Foxonian</hi> Prieſts) that have not been diſloyal, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unconſtant in their way—And the very
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41409:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſelf-ſame Men (<hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>E.B. &amp;c.</hi>) ſometimes have been for one Man, and in a little time for another; and ſo proved themſelves abſolute time-ſerving Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians—to ſerve their own ſordid Intereſts—May not the King eaſily know it, when he conſiders who it was that encouraged and approved, and actually <hi>fought from firſt to laſt,</hi> and juſtified them in their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, 1648, (even the <hi>Foxonians</hi>) and who it was (i. e. <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>E. B.</hi> &amp;c.) that writ ſo many flattering Letters to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and then to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and then <hi>changed from that,</hi> and cry'd up a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> again, and then the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Committee of Safety</hi>; and preſently after the Reſtoration pretend to <hi>own Him</hi> (i. e. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second) by all which it appears that no one ſort of Men in <hi>England</hi> are ſo diſloyal and inconſtant as that Generation of <hi>Foxonian Prieſts</hi>: And who can put Truſt in Such, that have thus ſerved Time, and <hi>Diſſembled,</hi> for their own Ends? And how ſhall the King ever, without great danger to himſelf, put Truſt in ſuch as the <hi>Foxonian Chief Prieſts?</hi>
               </q>
And how can they beg the Kings, Lords, and Biſhops eſpecially (whom they have ſo defamed and reviled) to exempt them from the Laws which other Subjects are liable to, without ſhame to themſelves?
<q>And its <hi>but reaſonable,</hi> that the King and Parliament ſhould be truly informed what they (<hi>i. e.</hi> theſe <hi>Foxoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Chief Prieſts</hi>) are, and what their Practices have been, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For peradventure they may think them by their fair Words to be that they are not, and its pity but that ſuch ſhould be better informed; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Paper is writ, to tell them that know you not ſo well as your Neighbours do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is your own Printed Doctrine, and is thus tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, home to your ſelves, you ſhameleſs and envious Quakers, againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters in general. And in their Book, <hi>Truth's Character,</hi> p. 19. ſay they, <hi>Many joyned with them (i. e.</hi> the Miniſters) <hi>in their Plots, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and Conſpiracies,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe few Inſtances I have here given, are but Samples of the Quakers Envy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41409:29"/>
againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters (as the Grapes the Spies brought) in compariſon of what there is in their Printed Books.</p>
            <p>And what I have here done is not out of prejudice to the Quakers Perſons, but as in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 38. the <hi>Blackmore</hi>; in conſideration of the great Evil <hi>theſe Men</hi> (the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers) have done to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Miniſters (and Religion) by condemning (not only one Man) but the whole Generations and Ages paſt, preſent and to come, into, not only a <hi>Dungeon</hi> and <hi>Mire,</hi> but into the Dungeon of Hell it ſelf, there <hi>to ſtick faſt,</hi> as is here ſhewn, I do hereby endeavour to my poor Ability, to draw or help them out.</p>
            <p>Here your Spirit is proved more like <hi>Haman</hi>'s than Chriſt's; and in your own words in the ſame Libel, I ſay, Your <hi>intent</hi> of thus <hi>accuſing</hi> them, <hi>muſt needs be out of Malice,</hi> for to incenſe the King againſt them to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> them.
Alſo in the ſame Pamphlet, ſay you, <hi>I muſt deſire the King and Nation, that ſuch Men be taken notice of</hi>; <q>attempting ſo high to be the Kings Informer againſt as good Subjects of the Nation (<hi>and better too</hi>) as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: O how abominable is this both to God, the King, and Kingdom—that theſe things (<hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> accuſing the Proteſtant Miniſters) ſhould paſs unreproved?</q>
No, by no means, ſeeing its your own (<hi>i. e.</hi> Quakers,) Doctrine; and you will not endure to be termed <hi>Quakers,</hi> but ſay in Print,
<q>Such an one is an Evil Doer in a high degree, on whom the Sword of the Magiſtrate is to paſs.</q>
And this <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in this afore Trial, is proved to be like that 23d. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and 21th. who have bound themſelves (as they had to deſtroy <hi>Paul</hi>) to deſtroy the Proteſtant Miniſters: So altho' them Quakers immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, may not be above forty Men; yet conſider how many of them there be, that have or will, like their <hi>Barbadoes</hi> Church, <hi>give up their whole Concern, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal, to</hi> (this wicked Spirit of <hi>Fox</hi>'s, which they term) <hi>the Spirit of God in their Womens Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41409:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>It's themſelves, (or their own <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> in <hi>the Beginning</hi>) that condemn them; and I only mete to them their own meaſure.</p>
            <p>And that the Deſign of the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame the Proteſtant Religion and Miniſters, appears in their Printing this Popiſh ſcandalous Libel ſo large and eminent, contrary to their uſual manner; for in this Anſwer to the Papiſts, they cite but a few Lines toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and take it into pieces; but this that particularly defamed the Proteſtant Miniſters, in which (as they ſay,) <hi>they are not concerned,</hi> they Print whole at large, in four Pages: And had they not thought and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to ſcandalize the Proteſtant Miniſters, they might have anſwered to that Chapter, as in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, p. 148.
<q>As to the reſt of thy Book, I ſuppoſe you will confeſs it was all by one Spirit; and it's proved ſome of it's given forth by a Lying Spirit, then judge what the reſt is.</q>
I ſay they might have waved it by ſome ſuch Anſwer; and not have ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably, and at large; printed that, if they had not thought it advantagious to them, to defame the Proteſtant Miniſters, and to get in favour with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Intereſt. And to this, and other their wicked envious Works and Books, their own Words are a fitting and ſufficient enough Anſwer, <q>I dare defie the Father of Lyes himſelf, to out-do this, (<hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> pag. 70.)</q>
            </p>
            <p>It concerns all Proteſtants, Miniſters and People, to pray to God, and uſe all lawful means, that they, theſe <hi>fierce Deſpiſers (Foxonian</hi> Quakers,) get not into Power here, as they have done in <hi>Penſilvania</hi>; and as they in Print ſay, <hi>Curſed be every one that riſeth not up to help the Lord againſt the mighty</hi> Foxonians: But as they ſay, <q>Give the Whore double; as ſhe hath done, ſo let it be done unto her.</q> And whereas, they ſay, they <hi>differ in the Root from all People</hi>; nay, you agree with your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Rome,</hi> to defame and deſtroy the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>And if (as you ſay in Print) <q>The Parliament have Recognized you for Proteſtants;</q> they have not, as it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41409:30"/>
were, Unproteſtanted the Proteſtant Miniſters: But I believe the Parliament knew not (but were deceived by your falſe Pretences, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were by the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>) of your Printed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of our Lord Jeſus, and the Scriptures, Laws, Kings, Lords, and Proteſtant Miniſters eſpecially.</p>
            <p>And it's worthy Conſideration, whether or no, if that they have ſo Recognized theſe <hi>Foxonians</hi> as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, whether then all their Errors and Wickedneſſes may not be charged on the Engliſh Proteſtants in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and they anſwerable to any Foreign Adverſary, <hi>Papiſt, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> for them; and alſo induce Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to believe all their Defamations of the Proteſtant Miniſters to be true, and they the Miniſters to be ſuch <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> and <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> &amp;c. as theſe Quakers have in Print publiſhed them to the World; more eſpecially when Acts of ſingular Kindneſs are paſſed in their Favour (without their diſowning theſe their <hi>Ancient Seditious Teſtimonies</hi>) as to exempt them from the Law, that all other the Commons of <hi>England</hi> are bound to, and a kind of Peerage granted them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others; and either theſe Quakers contemptuous and defaming Doctrines muſt be condemned, or all the Proteſtant Miniſters and People ſtand on Record, as ſuch Devils, Sorcerers, and Antichriſts, as they have Printed them, not only in Thouſands of Seditious ſmall Libels, but in great Volumes, with high Commendations on them and the Authors, affixed to them by <hi>G. Whitehead, &amp;c.</hi> who is the Common Voucher for them:
<q>More than a Prophet, endued with the Almighty Power of God, which reigned in him; Worthy Prophet of God.</q>
See more of theſe blaſphemous Expreſſions of, and to <hi>Fox,</hi> in the <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. and a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Letter written to <hi>Fox,</hi> by a <hi>Foxonian</hi> Preacher, as in <hi>T.

of Laſciviouſneſs.</q>
Now judge, you Proteſtants, whether it were not better, that <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> and ſome few more of the Chief of the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts, come under the blame or ſhame of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſlead by <hi>Fox,</hi> and they condemn or diſown thoſe Printed Errors of theirs; or elſe to gratifie the Pride and Malice of Ten of them, (for I think there is not more of them fierce Deſpiſers now living) to have all this Infamy and Contempt of theirs in Print, of the Proteſtant Religion and Miniſters, ſo convey'd to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity as Divine Oracles; for there can no dammage come to the People Quakers in general, or to theſe Perſons; nor no more deſired of them, than that they publiſh ſomething to clear the Proteſtants in general (as they required of <hi>G. K.</hi> and Excommunicated him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did it not) from their Calumnies; and as them Twenty-four afore-mentioned, did againſt the Chriſtian Quakers Anſwer to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>; and elſe theſe <hi>Foxonians</hi> more juſtly deſerve to be Excommunicated from the Proteſtants, than <hi>G. K.</hi> did from them. What! Shall they have ſuch Power and Zeal for Errors, and is there none in Power that have as much Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion and Miniſters?</p>
            <p>And theſe <hi>Foxonians,</hi> of all People, ought not to refuſe to condemn their Errors, becauſe they exact the ſame from others for faults much leſs criminal. But let them but obſerve their own Doctrine to 21 Divines, it's I fear true on themſelves; ſay they,
<q>Your credit is a temptation to you; ſacrifice it for the ſake of your own and others Souls upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of ſelf-denial;—think not repentance a Work too mean for you, becauſe you have been ſo long Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to others, a juſt rebuke p. 32.</q>
Mind this I pray you <hi>Foxonians,</hi> eſpecially <hi>W. P.</hi> the Author; and it will be an aggravation of your guilt, in caſe you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice not what <hi>you Preach to others,</hi> and a farther proof of the truth of my charge againſt you.</p>
            <p>Therefore be not <hi>high minded,</hi> but take your own adviſe <hi>G. W. be ingenious and confeſs thy Error.</hi>— I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41409:31"/>
adviſe thee not <hi>to out-face thy own Conſcience.</hi> And this Spirit of <hi>Fox's</hi> which now influences <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> &amp;c. is the ſame as was in <hi>Corah,</hi> &amp;c. For, as then they oppos'd and reſiſted <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo doth this <hi>Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Spirit in theſe Quakers condemn our Spiritual <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi>:
But this proud <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit, thro' his Inſtrument <hi>Fox,</hi> ſays he, is <q>Chriſt the Eternal Judge of the World; the Son of God; and as a Father in Chriſt (ſay they of <hi>Fox</hi>) he took care of the whole Houſhold of Faith, over which the Lord made him Overſeer, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with an excellent Spirit of Wiſdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; one of the Lords Worthies:</q>
And many more ſuch Blaſphemous Titles have theſe <hi>Foxoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Quakers given to their <hi>Idol of Jealouſie, Fox,</hi> in their Journal, Printed in <hi>Folio,</hi> and preſerved in the Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to ſpread his Fame, to the Defamation and great Scandal of the many Generations of Proteſtants, Martyrs and <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And notwiſtanding they ſo Blaſphemouſly exalt him, he was either very wicked, or elſe ſuch a Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head that he underſtood not common Senſe; for five Miniſters wrot a Book detecting theſe Quakers Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Intituled, <hi>The Perfect Phariſee</hi>; charging them with 17 Errors; this was anſwer'd by <hi>Fox</hi> in his great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, p. 74. but he, as was uſual with him, ſlips the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things, and quarrels with ſome expreſſions more inſignificant.</p>
            <p>They publiſhed another Book Titled, <hi>A farther Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. in vindication of the truth of their Charge on the Quakers. Now of the 17 Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors they charge theſe Quakers with, the third is in both their Books, that the Quakers hold that the <hi>Soul is a part of the Divine Eſſence</hi>; this is rehearſed in their 5<hi>th.</hi> p. where they begin to recite all the 17 Errors of the Quakers; afterwards they ſtate theſe 17 Errors and prove (and then confute) them.

Book of the 5 Miniſters in his 227. page; and in his beginning ſays of them and their Book thus: <hi>In it are their Principles as follows</hi>; and next begins, and for Principle puts generally Pr. and ſays thus Pr. <hi>Firſt that the Soul is a part of the Divine Eſſence,</hi> giving it as the 5 Miniſters Words and Principle, and ſo make a long ſquinting Anſwer; and out of all the 30 pages pickt out about ſix lines of the whole, and quarrels with; but when he comes to p. 31. where the five Miniſters again recite the ſame former Error of the Quakers, then in his page 229. he gives it as their Principle, <hi>It is Blaſphemy to ſay the Soul is a part of the Divine Eſſence</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here he truly ſtates their Principle, altho' not their Words; but in his long ſide-long ſquinting Anſwer, ſays to them,
<q>You five have judged your ſelves to be Blaſphemers, who ſaid the Soul was part of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, and yet 'tis Blaſphemy to ſay ſo.</q>
Thus you ſee this ſilly Gooſe of a Fox, here confirms his afore Chargeing the five Miniſters, that they ſaid, <hi>The Soul was a part of the Divine Eſſence</hi>; whenas they never ſo ſaid, only recited the Quakers Words and Error: Juſt as if one hearing a Perſon ſpeak Treaſon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to witneſs it, and rehearſing the Words, the Witneſs, who only rehearſes what he heard, ſhould therefore be charged with the Treaſon; for this Gooſe <hi>Fox,</hi> doth not only in p. 227. give it as their Principle, but in his 229 page, where he owns they term it <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi> he alſo confirms it, that they ſaid, <hi>The Soul was a part of the Divine Eſſence,</hi> whenas they only recite it. But it's to be feared, <hi>Fox</hi> was not ſo much ignorant as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, becauſe he makes his Advantage to render the five Miniſters as contradicting themſelves: But take it in the beſt ſence, that <hi>Fox</hi> was ſo ſilly a Gooſe, as to underſtand no better, but to take what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite as to be their own Principle, as he here did at beſt.</p>
            <p>Another Inſtance of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Weakneſs or Wickedneſs is in their Books <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> page 247. <hi>Fox</hi> falſly ſays of <hi>C. W.</hi>
               <q>He ſaith God limits the Supream holy One
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41409:32"/>
by the inſpired Writings of the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
And in Anſwer, <hi>Fox</hi> ſays, <q>And the holy One is not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Words of the Apoſtles, who fulfils them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Now by <hi>Fox</hi>'s Anſwer, and his ſaying, <hi>He ſaith,</hi> &amp;c. it's evident he gives this his Forgery as his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents Words, and any one who reads it would ſo think, but they are not, but are one of <hi>Fox</hi>'s many Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: For <hi>C. W.</hi>'s Words be thus, pag. 13.
<q>Your Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Diabolical Spirit in you—he over-powers you Quakers—to deny the Scriptures to be any help in ſaving Teachings; and as he <hi>(i. e. the Diabolical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)</hi> thereby <hi>(i. e. by perſwading them to ſlight Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture)</hi> limits the Supream holy One, ſo he over-rules you to acknowledge but one Diſpenſation of Gods Mind to Men</q>
—Here it is evident that <hi>C. W.</hi>'s Word is <hi>HE, (and relates to the Diabolical Spirit)</hi> which this wicked <hi>Fox</hi> forges into <hi>GOD</hi>; and what <hi>W. C.</hi> ſays <hi>the Diabolical Spirit does, Fox</hi> ſays <hi>he (C. W.)</hi> ſays <hi>God does</hi>; beſides the Forgery, hereby it's proved that it's the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> Spirit, which <hi>Fox</hi> takes for <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſts Spirit,</hi> as alſo his Forgery proves: This is mention'd in my <hi>Eſſay to allay G. Fox's Spirit,</hi> p. 7, 8. with about Twenty more Inſtances of <hi>Fox</hi>'s wicked Forgeries and Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But they have a Cover for <hi>Fox</hi>'s Wickedneſs and Ignorance (in <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Epiſtle in recommendation of him and his Journal) that it proceeds from one <hi>ſide of his Underſtanding, which was towards the World,</hi> &amp;c. which they there acknowledge was ſomewhat <hi>dark</hi> or <hi>weak</hi>; but ſuch Quibbles ſhew that the Inventers were not ſo weak as wicked; and that his (i.e. <hi>Fox</hi>'s) Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not <hi>quite round</hi> Infallible, but had a Fallible <hi>Side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſay, This proves theſe now <hi>Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts, <hi>W. Penn,</hi> &amp;c. very falſe Witneſſes, ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to exalt ſuch a wicked Man or Spirit as <hi>Fox</hi> and his were; and they, <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. are Maſters of ſo much Sence, that it may juſtly be feared they have (in this exalting and vindicating this wicked <hi>Fox</hi>) ſinned againſt their own knowledge; and they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41409:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may be reminded of their own Counſel,
<q>Do not go about to out-face thy own Conſcience, but confeſs thy Fault; for you have too highly exalted him; and he hath exalted himſelf, and muſt be abaſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All this proves their now <hi>Foxonian</hi> Cardinals, <hi>Penn, Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. to be as bad as he; I do not mean as ſilly, but as wicked and falſe, to ſay, as they have in Print, <q>God hath endued him with ſuch an Excellent Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding:</q> (But be it known, <hi>W. Penn</hi> underſtands his own Worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt better than <hi>Fox</hi> did Divinity.)</p>
            <p>But ſay the <hi>Foxonians,</hi> of this miſerable blaſphemous vagrant cobling Wretch, <hi>Fox,</hi>
               <q>This holy Man was raiſed up by God in an extraordinary manner, for an extraordinary Work:</q>
So was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and other wicked Inſtruments. But I have here proved them falſe Witneſſes, therefore ſhall not go unpuniſhed; but <q>who ſay unto the Wicked <hi>(Fox)</hi> thou art Righteous,</q> are to be Curſed.</p>
            <p>But altho' theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers ſo deifie and exalt this wicked Spirit of <hi>Haman,</hi> in their <hi>Idol of Jealouſie, Fox,</hi> yet they can contemn and undervalue the Perſon of our Lord JESUS,.(and his Blood) as <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible</hi>; and ſay,
<q>Doth not the Name <hi>(Chriſt)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to every Member, as well as to the Head? Your imagined God beyond the Stars, and your carnal Chriſt, is utterly denied by the Light: To ſay this Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon, is a Lye; and the Blood let out of his Side by the Spear on the Croſs, after he was dead, was no more than the Blood of another Saint; They are falſe (<hi>Ministers</hi>) that preach Chriſt without, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Hereby they make St. <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>falſe Miniſter.</hi> And of our Lords Perſon, ſay they, It was <hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>Contemptible.</hi> And hundreds more ſuch horrid Contempts have they Printed, which are excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and juſtified by the now <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, and the wicked Authors not only vindicated, but their wicked Works highly magnified by <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And altho' theſe now <hi>Foxonians,</hi> to gratifie ſome then
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41409:33"/>
in great Power at Court, left out and altered their Treaſonable <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> yet their Contempts of the Proteſtants, eſpecially the Miniſters, they have not abated, but rather aggravated, eſpecially <hi>W. Penn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for further proof that this <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit is not Chriſt's, I ſhall give you one inſtance of the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy thereof in <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in a brief Treatiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſays he <hi>Magiſtrates that uphold ſuch blind Guides as this (R. Baxter</hi> a Proteſtant Miniſter)
<q>who is in ſuch Errors and Confuſion; they groſly abuſe their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſhall give an account for it one day.</q>
But, theſe may quibble it off, that this was againſt them in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s times, and it's againſt ſuch as be in <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> &amp;c. I Anſwer, that they accounted the Church of <hi>England</hi> Miniſters worſe than them, and for Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They count them all ſuch, as at large may be ſeen in the Epiſtle before <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works.</p>
            <p>Another proof of the Arrogancy of this <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit, is in their Book <hi>Counterfeit Convert,</hi> &amp;c. p. 72. They ſay,
<q>That their Teſtimony againſt Tythes ſhould be maintained, is not a Law of their own making, but of Chriſts.</q>
This is in Anſwer to ſomething ſaid to them in <hi>T. C.</hi>'s Animadverſions, p. 39. where <hi>T. C.</hi> objects againſt their Arrogant and Unchriſtian Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have paſſed on all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> (Kings, Lords, Martyrs, and all People <hi>who pay Tythes, altho' freely</hi>) as is Chriſtianly held in <hi>W. R.</hi>'s <hi>Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in theirs, intituled, <hi>An Antidote,</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>W. R.</hi> But it's this, the Quakers Impoſition and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over others Conſciences, that they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to be Chriſtians, but <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> and mark them as ſuch, and <hi>Deniers of Chriſt:</hi> It was this their Unchriſtianing all who can <hi>freely pay Tythes without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,</hi> that <hi>T. C.</hi> objects againſt; and this they make a <hi>Law of Chriſt's making,</hi> thereby poſitively Judging the Laws of <hi>England</hi> for Tythes to be oppoſite to Chriſt's Laws; and ſo the Upholders of ſuch Laws, of all Degrees, <hi>Deniers of Chriſt, and Antichriſts</hi>; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41409:33"/>
the Law-Makers and Maintainers, but thoſe who pay them freely: For, THAT Unchriſtian <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of theirs it was, <hi>T. C.</hi> termed a <hi>Law of their making,</hi> &amp;c. In Anſwer hereto, they do not deny its a <hi>Law</hi>; but deny it's of <hi>Their</hi> making, but of <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> ſay they. This Book was by them delivered to the Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here Sentence is paſt (on all Degrees, paſt, preſent, and to the Worlds End) when the Court of our Judges, the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Cardinals of their Second Days Meeting, will pleaſe to order Execution, I know not.</p>
            <p>But further, To prove theſe their <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> as they term them, be <hi>Laws,</hi> obſerve alſo in their Book intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> &amp;c. page 90. they ſay,
<q>Formerly he (<hi>i. e. T. C.</hi>) having tranſgreſſed in ſome matters—Again ſay they, And by his ſaid Tranſgreſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Now <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion</hi>; but here they charge and puniſh for <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> for not obeying their Laws, contrary to the Law of the Nation, and ſay, <hi>It's not of their making but of Chriſt's</hi>: This is of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high rnd general Concernment, for it affects, as well as reflects on Laws and Law-Makers, as well as Law-Obeyers; and which is of moſt force, or which muſt have preference, either the Law of the Nation, or of the Quakers? Why, if as they ſay, that theirs againſt them who can freely pay Tythes, is of Chriſts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, then the Quakers <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony</hi> is of greateſt force, becauſe <hi>it's of Chriſt's (i. e.</hi> Fox's) <hi>making.</hi> This is larger and better treated on, in <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. the Second Edition, with Additions.</p>
            <p>I only ſay, Either the Quakers are very Arrogant, or elſe (by their Doctrine) the Law-Makers and Laws of <hi>England,</hi> are contrary to Chriſt's: And I think theſe Quakers Reflections and Scandal they have laid on the Laws, and Religion, and Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> much more deſerve to be taken notice of by them in Power, than <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s Book with the Picture of a Pillory did, which on the Quakers Complaint againſt him, as Seditious, was ſeized by a Meſſenger, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Secretary of State; and he (<hi>F. B.</hi>) Indicted for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41409:34"/>
three Crimes, <hi>Defaming</hi> or <hi>Scandalizing G. W.</hi> &amp;c: Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. But the Quakers ſcandalizes the Laws and Law-Makers, and Obſervers, in all Ages ſince the Apoſtles, until the End of Time, who pay (or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold) Tythes, altho' freely; and therefore is very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, as well as Unchriſtian.</p>
            <p>And this proves it is not Liberty of Conſcience, but Power over others Conſciences, they aim at; and alſo proves their Deceit, in pretending theirs are but <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Tender Advice</hi>; for altho' to deceive, they uſe ſuch gentle Words as <hi>Recommend,</hi> or <hi>Tender Advice,</hi> yet you ſee they expect exact Obedience, and puniſh as <hi>Tranſgreſſors,</hi> for not obeying their Orders as the Laws of Chriſt, or of his <hi>making.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now are not theſe Quakers very Wicked and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, in doing as they have? Not only to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but defamed the Memories of Kings and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, ever ſince Chriſt, that paid or ſhall pay Tythes.
<q>And they have been ſo drunk with furious Malice as to violate Sepulchers, and trample on the Graves of the Dead; nay, they have been ſo ignoble, baſe, and meanly ſcurrilous, as to beſtow their <hi>Billingſgate</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, not only on other Men, (but Kings, more eſpecially <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt) that cannot anſwer for themſelves, becauſe in their Graves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not fit they (i. e. <hi>theſe Arrogant Quakers</hi>) ſhould paſs without Rebuke; therefore to expoſe the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (<hi>and wickedneſs</hi>) of <hi>their</hi> Spirit,</q>
(<hi>which they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly term Chriſt's</hi>)
<q>to the view of thoſe of a more Generous (<hi>and Chriſtian</hi>) Temper, and to manifeſt what a kind of Antagoniſts (<hi>the Miniſters</hi>) have, I have here collected a part of their Abuſes of thoſe good Men, (<hi>ſome of them</hi>) now at reſt, who never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at theſe (<hi>Quakers</hi>) hands, I am perſwaded, theſe Demonſtrations of Rancor againſt them—Theſe (<hi>Quakers</hi>) Malice is ſo great <hi>(againſt the Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters)</hi> that I have not offered a third part of the Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Expreſſions they have uſed againſt them, both here afore and following.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:41409:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>All this and more is their own, in their Book <hi>Rabſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah,</hi> &amp;c. page 68. becauſe <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s and their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was diſcover'd; which theſe now Quakers are ſo far from diſowning, as they ought, that they contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vindicate them, and exalt the Authors, <hi>Fox,</hi> &amp;c. with high Commendations: A mighty Prophet, and <q>more than a Prophet, endued with the Almighty power of God which lived and reigned in him;</q> and this Epiſtle aforementioned wrot by him, is ſuch a choice Revelation with them, that it's twice prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and put before 2 Books, one of <hi>Fox</hi>'s in 1659. and another ſince printed by them <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, 1672. of above 900 pages in Folio, ſtuft with bitter Revilings and Defamations of the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to the great ſcandal of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as following is ſhown: And it's the Proteſtant Miniſters in general, that fot upholding them he <hi>G.

            <p>And for further proof that the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit is not Chriſt's, but that which influenced <hi>Haman</hi> to ſeek the Deſtruction of the Jews, appears by the Fruits of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Defamation following, that they have v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>You ſee it's the whole and every Part that they are againſt of the Proteſtant Miniſters and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in theſe three Nations; and in page 1. they ſay, <hi>It's from the Lord</hi>; and they term the Miniſters, <hi>A curſed deceitful Miniſtry</hi>: And in page 88. to prove the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſters falſe Prophets, charge them that they ſpeak <hi>what they have ſtudied for</hi> (then ſurely they would have condemned <hi>Timothy</hi> for obeying <hi>Paul, who bid him ſtudy,</hi> &amp;c.) <q>Even (ſay they) a Divination of their own Brain—Take other Mens Words—</q>(<hi>See the</hi> Snake in the Graſs, firſt Part, p. 316. <hi>where the Quakers are proved to have done the ſame</hi>) <q>Nor have heard the Voice of God, but—take Chapter and Verſe.</q> But ſurely then <hi>Fox</hi> was a very falſe Prophet, for he took others words, altho' durſt not, or could not tell Chapter and Verſe, becauſe he uſually corrupted it by adding or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing, as he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>And in obedience to their Law or Act made by their Conclave of Cardinals, to <q>hold up their (<hi>Holy and Ancient</hi>) Teſtimony of Truth—in the beginning, —and that in all the parts of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Again, Pag. 10. Say they,
<q>All thy Teachers, O <hi>England,</hi> are denied by them who are taught of God. O People, your Teachers have beguiled you: Your Reward will be Vengeance, and your Charge will be Murthering Souls—The moſt innocent among you will be found guilty of Innocent Blood.</q>
               <hi>G. W.</hi> can you be ſo <hi>ingenuous</hi> as to exempt Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> from theſe your Scandals.
And page 101. which they ſay <q>was ſealed by the Spirit of the Eternal God to the Prieſts and Teachers, Thus ſaith the Lord, (<hi>Fox</hi>) My Controverſie is againſt you of all others, and my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be on you to the uttermoſt, for you in Hypocriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have exceeded all others—Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly loathſome is your filthineſs, in preaching for hire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They go on againſt the Miniſters, ſaying, They had made Merchandiſe of their (<hi>Peoples</hi>) Souls. —Prophaneneſs is gone forth from you into all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, You have ſhut the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men, to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Thouſands and Ten Thouſands—And your Prayers have been to your Idol God for all ſorts from whom you could receive a Reward—<hi>Original the Womb of Witchcraft.</hi> —You pray to your dead Gods—Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thouſands—Whoſe Blood you are abſolutely guilty of.—Your Rebellion is the Crime of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> —which cannot ceaſe to do Evil, for you have bound

your ſelves in the Covenant with Hell.—My Cup of Indignation is the aſſured Portion of your Lot, and Blood ſhall you have to drink, as your Reward from me: My Plagues (i. e. <hi>theſe Quakers</hi>) ſhall remain with you on Earth, and ſhall follow you to the Lake. My Fire of Indignation is kindled on you, which ſhall burn for ever more.</q>
All theſe Six Lines of their Fury is in the compaſs of one page of their 900; and of this their Reviling the Proteſtant Religion and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, his Vouchers, <hi>Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. could not afford to abate any thing, but, as they ſay, pour out full Cups of their Malice againſt the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>But out of the ſame Book, which they ſay was writ <q>by Command of the Lord, the 31 day of the 10th Month, 1655. unto all ſorts of People;</q> yet theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Foxonians</hi> have left out one whole Meſſage to one ſort of People, called <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> the Kings Friends, p. 9. And in ſeveral places left out and altered, and added Words and Sentences.</p>
            <p>They proceed and ſay of the Miniſters, p. 190.
<q>Their Doctrines (<hi>it's not Doctrine</hi>) are of the Devil—They have filled the World with Damnable Hereſies— That Sprinkling Infants with Water is Baptiſm into the Faith of Chriſt, and that the Steeple-houſe is the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Theſe are Damnable Hereſies, even to denying the Lord that bought them. —And (<hi>ſay they</hi>) this is the Doctrine of Devils—And Lyes they ſpeak in great numbers. Page 195. Theſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this Generation are of them, (i. e. <hi>the Beaſt, Whore, and falſe Prophet</hi>) of their Root and Off-ſpring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conſider what God did to the Biſhops, and their Crew of Perſecutors—How the Lord overthew them. P 261.
 You have been the Fountain of all this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (i. e. <hi>the Quakers Sufferings</hi>) acted againſt the Juſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> P. 162. Have been curſed Precedents to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and People who have followed your cruel ſteps of Envy—And they have drunk in your Poyſonous Doctrines (<hi>not Doctrine</hi>) —Mens hearts have been filled with your Damnable Doctrine of Devils. P. 269.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41409:37"/>
The Time of your Overthrow draws near upon you all, and deſpiſable ſhall you be to all that fear the Lord.</q>
The Quakers Throats are open Sepulchres, and not covered ones. For ſay they,</p>
            <p>Page 348.
<q>Their Worſhip and Miniſtry which ſtands not in exerciſe of pure Conſcience, but in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Idolatry. His <hi>(the Miniſters)</hi> Labour is abomination and deceiving of Souls. And page 626. The Controverſie hath been held forth between the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> on Antichriſts part, and the People called Quakers, of the other part.</q>
Here you ſee their Envy and Charge is againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters in general.</p>
            <p>Page 674. They ſay, <q>It's not lawful for the Saints to joyn to your Ordinances, nor own your Miniſtry.</q> No wonder they ſay their Teſtimony againſt Tythes is a Law of Chriſt's making, for here they ſay, It's not lawful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And page 672. To clear the Quakers from the guilt of the King's Sufferings, and to incenſe the King and Nation againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, ſay they, <q>If it be conſidered who they are that firſt raiſed the War againſt the King and Nation, and who it was that firſt preached and prayed up the War, and proſecuted it againſt his Father, and who it was that caſt out the Biſhops, and took their Revenues.</q>
And yet none owned and encouraged <hi>Oliver,</hi> and juſtified their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, 1648, more than the Quakers; nay, <hi>Fox,</hi> and this very ſhameleſs <hi>E. B.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the King and his Friends, and hath caſt Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on his Name and Family, as is before ſhewn; and yet here have the face to ſay,
<q>Their <hi>(i. e. the Quakers)</hi> Sufferings, have been more cruel and unjuſt, than towards them <hi>(the King.)</hi>
               </q>
But they that can ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn our Lords Sufferings and Blood, and exalt their own as <hi>more Cruel and Unjuſt</hi> than His, it's no wonder that they alſo advance their own Sufferings above the Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they go on againſt the Miniſters, p. 687,
<q>Such
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41409:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as have been your (i. e. <hi>the King's</hi>) Enemies, and and preach'd, and pray'd, and fought againſt you— and now pray for you—Can you truſt that theſe will be faithful to you?—And whether thus to deny their former Oaths and Engagements, is commendable?</q>
Here theſe Quakers blame them for not keeping the Scotch Covenant or Solemn League, which was againſt the King and Houſe of Lords, and to utterly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate <hi>Epiſcopacy, that dead loathſome Form,</hi> as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers elſewhere upbraid the Presbyterians for, as is mentioned in <hi>T. C's Animadverſions on</hi> G.W.<hi>'s Book.</hi>
But all theſe ſufficiently prove the Maliciouſneſs of theſe Quakers Spirits againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, they accuſe for not <q>performing their Engagements againſt the King, Lords, and Biſhops; and yet alſo accuſe them for what they did in performance.</q>
Now were theſe Quakers, as they falſely pretend they ſtand to their Principles, and are the Kings Friends, then they ſhould not blame others for not performing, but for engaging; but its plainly ſhewed they did not blame but encourage <hi>Oliver, &amp;c.</hi> in what they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both the Kings, and boaſted and bragged that they <q>fought from firſt to laſt; and accuſed <hi>Oliver, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> for putting them out of the Army, and it was becauſe they maintained the Proteſtant Miniſters, and ſuffered <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Ed. Piot,</hi> &amp;c. to be impriſoned, that they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and threatened <hi>Oliver</hi> for, and not for any thing done againſt the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But have in this very Book, in their ſquinting way, juſtified it; for here you ſee they ſay they ſtand to their Principles of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh two-fac'd envious Hypocrites!</p>
            <p>Again, p. 766. ſay they, <q>Antichriſts falſe Miniſtry and Worſhip, and Doctrines, God will confound.</q> Now if any ſay this is true, it is ſo; but it's all the Worſhip and Miniſtry of the Engliſh Proteſtants they ſo term and defame.</p>
            <p>And page 730.
<q>Ye all have deceived the World, and the Blood of Souls reſts on you—ye have been as Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-Worms, and that have corrupted the whole World;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41409:38"/>
whom have you not deceived by your Lyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— God is weary of you, and the time is at hand he will pluck you up by the Roots, and viſit you with great deſtruction, and your Names ſhall be a reproach among Men—the Lord will bring unreſiſtable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon you.—The Earth is weary of you, which you have corrupted with your falſe ways; and the Kingdom groans under your Oppreſſions, and the Earth will ſpue you out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, In p. 521. theſe Quakers are charged to joyn with the Cavalieriſh Party (i. e. <hi>the Kings</hi>) In denial of it, ſay they,
<q>That Generation of Prieſts are joyned with the Prelatical Cavalieriſh Party; this is known in the Nation, in the North eſpecially.</q>
Here you ſee they were then againſt the Kings Intereſt, as well as the Miniſters, whom they maliciouſly inform againſt therefore for.</p>
            <p>And p. 523. ſay the Quakers,
<q>They (i. e. <hi>Honeſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>) ſee that wicked Intereſt of the Clergy proſper more than the Freedom of the People; and this I ſay from the Lord, That while that Intereſt (of this falſe Prieſthood) is ſo much favoured, you can never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, nor the Nations be happy under you.—It is high time to lay aſide (<hi>ſay they</hi>) that Intereſt of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Clergy.—You know the Spirit of the Romiſh Clergy was in the late Biſhops, whom you caſt out for their Wickedneſs, and the very Spirit of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops is entered into theſe Prieſts—And there is the remainder of her Murders in theſe Mens (i. e. <hi>the Miniſters</hi>) Breaſts, and at every opportunity it breaks forth, as of late in this Rebellion you have full Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony </q>(<hi>it was Sir</hi> Geo. Booth<hi>'s appearing for King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second in the North,</hi> 1659.)
And theſe <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> they go on, and ſay to the long Parliament,
<q>If you do not curb it (i. e. <hi>the Spirit of the Biſhops</hi>) ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, it will grow over you to your undoing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in page 524. Says to the Parliament,
<q>Caſt them <hi>(the Miniſters)</hi> off, and let them not lurk under your Wings <hi>(but leave them to be worried by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers)</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41409:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for one day they will rebel againſt you, and another day flatter you, and ſhew love in hypocriſie, even while they are hatching Miſchief againſt you, even to bring the Nation into Blood.—It appears to many of you a thing hard to forſake your Godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,—Was it not the ſame concerning the King and Biſhops?—Was it not as terrible to him and his Lords, to think of the Overthrow of the then called Godly Fathers and Biſhops? But better had he caſt them off, and ſaved himſelf, than to have periſhed with them: And better were it for you to lay them aſide, and ſave your ſelves, than to periſh with them; and one of theſe will come to paſs.—It's decreed of the Lord, if you uphold them (<hi>Miniſters</hi>) and oppreſs Peoples Perſons, and Eſtates, and Conſciences, on their behalf, and in their evil Cauſe, for Tythes and Wages, ye ſhall fall with them; and none ſhall be able to deliver you nor them.—For the Spirit of the old Idolatrous Biſhops, is entered into the hearts of theſe Men; and there is a great meaſure of Tyranny, Injuſtice, and Abomination on theſe, as was on the Biſhops; and theſe are as nigh ripe for Vengeance, as the other (i. e. <hi>Biſhops</hi>) were, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe, and what follows, the Church of <hi>England</hi> may ſee that theſe Quakers <hi>Ancient Teſtimony</hi> of their Truth, was as much againſt them, as againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and more: however they may, to deceive, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to treat them now with ſuch hell-fetch'd Names, in expreſs words, as formerly.</p>
            <p>But the Quakers go on, ſaying, in page 477.
<q>The Lord is riſen to confound this Church and this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which is Idolatry.</q>
And P. 477.
<q>For you who worſhip God in Steeple-houſes,—God will confound this Church and Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> P. 499. We are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for bearing witneſs againſt the falſe Prophets and Hirelings of theſe days—And we ſee and know that they, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—ſhall periſh—Their downfall haſtens greatly—and all the Powers of the Earth ſhall not be able to ſupport them; and with them ſhall fall their Tythes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:41409:39"/>Now this their Rage and Envy is from <hi>the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> or elſe theſe <hi>Foxonians, G. Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. were <hi>Conjurers</hi> by their own Sentence. And altho' I have afore proved they do expect Obedience to their Laws, (as the Laws of Chriſt) altho' they (to deceive) pretend they be but <hi>Advice</hi> or <hi>Counſel</hi>; yet for further proof thereof, obſerve that for diſobeying their <hi>Advice</hi> againſt carrying Guns in Ships, they ſay, <hi>It's injurious to their own Souls</hi>; and therefore it muſt be a Law of high Concernment, that the not obeying, or breaking of it, is of ſuch ill conſequence to their Souls: And theſe <hi>Foxonians</hi> will not <hi>ſuffer</hi> nor <hi>permit</hi> their Papers to be called <hi>Mens Edicts,</hi> nor <hi>Sinful,</hi> no, not the very <hi>Papers</hi>; how ſacred then do they think their <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> therein written be? Surely, as aforeſaid, they deem them <hi>Laws of Chriſts making</hi>; eſpecially that wherein they Unchriſtian <hi>all who pay Tythes</hi> (altho' <hi>freely</hi>) and record and mark rhem for <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> and <hi>Deniers of Chriſt</hi> come in the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>Now hear alſo their own Doctrine: Say they,
<q>Any Party of Men under a Government, to make Laws, not lawfully Authorized, for binding others, and thereto requiring obedience, be the ſetting up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above the Law, and treading it under their feet, and rendring them whom they ſo bind their Slaves— and ſo is TREASON.</q>
This is worthy of Notice by all, Rulers and People.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>O. Cromwel,</hi> page 557. ſay they,
<q>This is the Word of the Lord to thee—The Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> for which thou ſeem'ſt to ſtand, generally it's not of God, but of Antichriſt, and the Lord is againſt it; and it's the ground of the greateſt Oppreſſion of the Poor, in its Maintenance, as any one particular Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination this day in the Nation; and if thou ſetteſt thy ſelf to uphold them—thou ſhalt fall into Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to <hi>R. Cromwel,</hi> p. 578. Say they of the Publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<q>As it is now, we teſtifie from the Lord,—it is wholly degenerated in all things from what the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41409:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Chriſt was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
And much more againſt the Miniſters, which they have Re-Printed at large: But in this ſame Letter, page 574. where they put the words <hi>Grievous Cruelty,</hi> it was by him <hi>Grievous Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Alſo in the ſame Letter, p. 580. juſt before the four laſt Lines, they leave out this following Sentence,
<q>As concerning the Armies abroad, let faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men (i. e. <hi>Quakers</hi>) be put in truſt—for the Army is of great Concernment to thee, to ſtand or fall through them, as to Mans Account, and the War againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> be faithful to God in it,—the Lord may accompliſh ſomething by it, to his honour and thine. — There is ſomething in it known to the Lord, (<hi>a cunning Gypſie Prophet!</hi>)</q>
And altho' they ſay this was from the Lord, yet they thus alter, and leave out, to hide their hypocritical Pretence after the Reſtoration, that they <q>were againſt fighting with outward Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons for any end whatſoever:</q> But this ſhews their Hypocriſie as well as their Malice, which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue foaming out againſt the Proteſtants, in their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, as they ſay, by eſpecial Authority from the Lord, by his Embaſſador <hi>E. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Works, p. 591, Say they,
<q>Tho' he (i. e. <hi>the Lord</hi>) did in ſome meaſure free this Nation from much Tyranny, in caſting out Popiſh Authority, yet the Nation in a few years was near as much violated by Injuſtice, <hi>Tyranny</hi> and Cruelty, under the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Power, as ever it was once under the Papal Power.</q>
But altho theſe forging Wretches, the <hi>Foxonians,</hi> give this as a Meſſage from God, by his Embaſſador <hi>E. B.</hi> yet they leave out this word <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and change <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical</hi> into <hi>Succeeding:</hi> Either they are ſelf-condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Blaſphemers, or elſe deſerve the Plagues of adding and diminiſhing from and to the Word of the Lord. But altho' they leave out their Treaſonable Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet their Sedition againſt the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters they have to the full put in; well knowing there was them great in Court they thereby pleaſed, and would and could defend and reward them. Therefore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41409:40"/>
theſe <hi>Foxonian Humans, G. W. &amp;c.</hi> revived all that: For page 595. ſay they,
<q>Them called Miniſters, the way of their ſetting up, ſending forth, Maintenance, Standing and Defence, and in every particular of their being ſuch, they are the greateſt and woful Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Nation; the moſt abominable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Cruelties and Tyrannies are acted through them, as any other thing in the Nation; and they are (as ſuch aforeſaid) the woful Cauſe of the Nations groaning under mercileſs Dealing; and there is on their account the guilt of Blood, Injuſtice, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, on this Nation; their Iniquities cries for Vengeance on their own heads, for they are full, and —near finiſhed; God's Eternal Vengeance is their next Reward from the Eternal God.—The Earth is oppreſſed by them, the Inhabitants groan under them, and the Righteous God is vexed through them, and they are the Men of high Indignation and fierce Wrath, and all their Practices (as ſuch) are the Eewel of his Anger.—The Nation is weary— and the Lord is weary becauſe of theſe Men.—If this be the Miniſtry muſt be encourag'd by you, you ſhall never proſper, but bring a Curſe on all your doings becauſe hereof.—The hand of my Lord is againſt them.</q>
(I believe you <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> for its him mentioned 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. and from <hi>E. B.</hi> your Father in Envy againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, hadſt thou thy ſuch malicious Doctrine: For you go on in your bloody Fury and Malice, ſaying) <q>And whomſoever ſhall ſeek to defend them, ſhall not proſper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in p. 618. their rage is ſo inveterate againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, that they fall out with the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, becauſe they, Chriſtian-like ſay, <hi>It's their Duty to preſerve them (i. e.</hi> the Miniſters) <hi>from all violence,</hi> &amp;c. In Anſwer, ſay theſe <hi>Foxonians,</hi>
               <q>What are you about to make a League with Antichriſt? —Will you now bind your ſelves to preſerve them from all Injury— as they are Miniſters too?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:41409:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>And in <hi>R. Huberthorn</hi>'s Works, theſe <hi>Foxonians</hi> have reaked out the ſame Fury againſt the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and ſay, <q>Can you ſtand by them, and preſerve them <hi>(while Baptizing Infants)</hi> and not tell them its Antichriſtian?</q> —And ſay,
<q>Do you not ſay, You will not tolerate Miſcarriages in things Religious? — Is not this a Miſcarriage in thing Religious, to baptize Infants? And do you not tolerate this Miſcarriage, while you ſtand by to preſerve them in it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here you may ſee the Quakers Envy to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and that their Deſign is not Liberty of Conſcience, as they falſly pretend; for here they do not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the Nation againſt them, but revile the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> becauſe they do not run with them into the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Blood-thirſtineſs: For theſe Quakers, <hi>G.

<q>They are not againſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating <hi>Epiſcopaoy</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> &amp;c. yet againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; why will you not tolerate Popery, as well as Epiſcopacy?</q>
               <hi>(ſay they:)</hi>
               <q>Have not the Profeſſors of Epiſcopacy murthered and ſlain, and do labour to murther and ſlay, as well as the Papiſts? And why will you tolerate the Common-Prayer among the Epiſcopalians, and not the Maſs-Book among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts?</q>See their reſpect to the Church of <hi>England!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was in 1659. when they did not believe the Reſtoration was ſo near, for all their pretended Gypſie Prophecies; as is apparent by their encouraging the Army as long as there was any hopes, and informing and exclaiming againſt Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> and quarrelling with <hi>Monk</hi>'s Party.</p>
            <p>But to return, and give Audience to this Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor <hi>E. B.</hi> and his Attendants, <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> They ſay, p. 621.
<q>There is the Guilt of Blood—lying on this Nation in the Caſe of Tythes, and the hand of the Lord [<hi>Fox</hi>] is gone out againſt it, and againſt all Contenders for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But all this their Rage is general: Now hear their

               <hi>Loving</hi> Anſwer (as they term it) to one Miniſter who ſent them ſome Queries to Anſwer; and behold their Wrath and Bitterneſs, altho' p. 565. they pretend that what any can object againſt their Doctrine, let it be ſtated in plain words, in Queries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a ſufficient Anſwer ſhall they receive. Again, They make the ſame Offer in their Epiſtle,
<q>Let the Prieſts,—or any of them, object what they can againſt us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—they ſhall have Liberty for what they alledge—. And by the ſtrength of Chriſt—we ſhall confute their Proofs.</q>
And now hear how they confute this Man, whether by the ſtrength of Chriſt, or Antichriſt, the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Miniſter, <hi>P. Bennet</hi>'s Queries, ſent to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to Anſwer, and to clear themſelves from the guilt of denying Chriſt that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I abridge. But know that they can confeſs and own <hi>the ſame Chriſt that dyed, ſuffered, and was crucified on the Croſs at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and yet not mean Him, that Man or Perſon, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> ſaw, who was Nailed to the Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Spirit in him, and ſo the ſame; or the Light in all Men; for they ſay, <q>He is crucified and ſuffers now, and ſo did ever ſince the Fall, and ſo he did in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>:</q> And that they do not mean the Perſon or Man JESUS, but the Light in them and all Men, when they confeſs to Chriſt, is evident; for they are charged to deny the Aſcending of his Body; and in Anſwer, ſay they, p. 42.
<q>We witneſs the ſame Chriſt made manifeſt in us, and his Reſurrection; not becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid ſo, but we have ſeen it, and are Witneſſes of it:</q>
Alſo in <hi>W. Baily</hi>'s Works, pag. 173. they ſay the ſame. Now for a ſeeing by Faith, it is own'd by all Chriſtians, and that is not the difference between the Quakers and others, but whether that material ſeen and handled Perſon by <hi>Herod,</hi> and them who Nail'd him to the Croſs, be the Son of God, and Saviour? This they do in effect, altho' not in plain terms, deny; for they maintain the <hi>Jews</hi> never ſee the Saviour: Now <hi>Herod</hi> ſee our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi>; then he was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41409:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not the Saviour, muſt be the conſequence of their Doctrine, or <hi>Herod</hi> ſaw him not. But as to their Anſwer to the afore Charge in <hi>E.B.</hi>'s Works, p. 42. If ſuch a ſeeing as they can pretend to, would ſerve, then <hi>Peter</hi> was by their Doctrine, and as they in Print render him, a falſe Miniſter; for he told the Saints <hi>they had not ſeen, nor did not ſee him</hi>; but they ſaw him as theſe Quakers do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.21. It's ſaid, <hi>Of theſe Men which have accompanied with us, all the time the Lord Jeſus went in and out among us, from John's Baptiſm unto the ſame Day he was taken from us, muſt one be ordained to be a Witneſs of his Reſurrection.</hi> Now if ſuch Witneſſes as theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers pretend to be, would have ſerved, then there was no need of ſuch a one as theſe mentioned, for all the true Believers were Witneſſes, as well as the Apoſtles: Therefore it is plain it was a material perſonal ſeeing and handling that the Scripture intends, and not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, as the Quakers. For they in their <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> ſay, <hi>T. C. hath crucified him, (i. e.</hi> their Chriſt.) It's this blaſphemous falſe-accuſing Spirit of <hi>Fox</hi>'s, which <hi>T. C.</hi> oppoſed, and terms their <hi>Chriſt</hi>; therefore their fallacious ſquinting Confeſſions; are but deceit, while they will not diſown but juſtifie their <hi>Ancient</hi> Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> and enjoyn their Subjects to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them: But if they meant truly, as the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, then there needs nothing but Yea or Nay, to moſt of theſe Queries, where they make reviling long ſquinting Anſwers.</p>
            <p>The firſt Query is, <q>Was the Son of God, or Word, made Fleſh, or made of a Woman, more than once?</q> I ſay, Nay. But they ſay,
<q>The Word made Fleſh we witneſs, which dwells among us, and we behold his glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
(But the Saints ſaid <hi>dwelt,</hi> and <hi>beheld,</hi> as paſt. Further ſay they,
<q>VVhen thou canſt witneſs the VVord made Fleſh once, then thou wilt know whether the Son of God was made of a Woman any more than once.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Query,
<q>Did the Man Chriſt Jeſus— really ſuffer Death—as on the Croſs at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:41409:42"/>
oftener then once?</q>
I ſay, Nay. They ſay,
<q>The Man Chriſt Jeſus we own, and witneſs the Lamb's Book of Life, which was ſlain from the Foundation of the World, the Lamb of God which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Sins of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The third Query,
<q>Did the Man Chriſt ſuffer in his own Perſon, for that end, and after that manner, which he did once upon the Croſs, before or ſince the time?</q>
(i. e. <hi>his Crucifixion on the Croſs.</hi>) I ſay, Nay. They ſay,
<q>Chriſt Jeſus in his own Perſon doth ſuffer by thee,—and by thy Generation he ſuffered at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and doth ſuffer where he is manifeſt by you after the ſame manner.—<hi>(And ſay they)</hi> Wouldſt thou have Chriſt have more ends in ſuffering than one?</q>
This Anſwer plainly proves what I before ſaid, that by owning Chriſts <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Crucifying</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they mean not his Perſonal Bodily Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but inward, as in <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo in them now; for they ſay, <q>he doth ſuffer after the ſame manner (i. e. <hi>as he did at Jeruſalem.</hi>)</q> Now this cannot reſpect his Bodily Sufferings on the Croſs outward, for ſo he doth not now ſuffer; but they ſay, he doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <q>after the ſame manner.</q> Now mind the terms of the Query, and their Anſwer, and it's plain they do not mean as all other Chriſtians do, but in another ſenſe. This Query and their Anſwer ſufficiently prove their contempt.</p>
            <p>Fourth Query,
<q>Was not that Death the Man Chriſt ſuffered once, and but once, on the Croſs, ſo ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,—that God doth not require any Suffering on that account?</q>
I ſay, Yea, it was; and God requires no other. They ſay,
<q>The Death of the Man Chriſt Jeſus, which ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we own and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>(mind that, Witneſs)</hi> the ſame Chriſt <hi>(ſay they)</hi> that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we witneſs made manifeſt.</q>
Now this they give as ſo full and plain a Confeſſion, that they ſay of it to <hi>P. B.</hi> the Queriſt,
<q>Here thou Lyar art made manifeſt, who ſaid that we denied that Chriſt that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </q>
But this is no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41409:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Query, for the Query is not, Whether or no it was Chriſt that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but about the Value or Vertue of his Death, to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice; to which they reply nothing, but quibble and rail, but dare not Anſwer plainly Yea or Nay. But it's plain hereby they own not Satisfaction by that one and once offering of himſelf, as in the <hi>Hebrews</hi>: But they go on, and cavil, ſaying,
<q>Whereas thou querieſt whether the Juſtice of God be not ſatisfied for the Sins of the Elect? <hi>(ſay they)</hi> Where do'ſt thou find that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſatisfaction for the Sins of the Elect, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </q>
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Elect ſin not; now they term themſelves and Chriſt alſo the Elect.</p>
            <p>The fifth Query, <q>Be you reconciled to God by any other Obedience than that particular Obedience Chriſt performed in his own Perſon—once on the Croſs?</q>
I ſay, Nay. But they banter, and make no poſitive Anſwer.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Query, <q>Did not the Man Chriſt ſuffer as a Publick Perſon in the Elects ſtead, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </q> I ſay, Yea. They ſay, <q>For the Redeeming of the Elect from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Mouths as thine, did and doth Chriſt ſuffer.</q> 'Here ſquintingly making his now ſuffering in them, or any Saint, equal or of the ſame effect and value, and to the ſame end as his Perſonal Suffering without us: For ſay they, <hi>For the Redeeming,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did and doth,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Work of Redemption was not finiſhed nor perfected, as on Chriſt's part, by that one and once offering himſelf, but by his now Sufferings in them.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Query, <q>Is the Sufferings of Chriſt now in the Saints all the Satisfaction is made to God for Sins paſt, preſent, and to come?</q>
I ſay, No. They anſwer,
<q>Is not Chriſt the ſame now as ever? And is not the Sufferings of Chriſt ſatisfactory where-ever? What wilt thou have to ſatisfie, if Chriſts Sufferings do not ſatisfie?</q>
Hereby plainly implying Yea, in the Affirmative, that their <hi>now</hi> Sufferings, which they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly term his, is all the Satisfaction is made to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41409:43"/>
God for Sins, ſo plainly denied the Lord that bought them, and trampled his Blood under foot; for altho, the Words <hi>now</hi> and <hi>all</hi> be not in their Anſwer, yet they be in the <hi>Query,</hi> &amp;c. and you muſt not mind ſo much their ſquinting Anſwer, but alſo the Terms of the <hi>Query.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eighth Query,
<q>Was not that Body of Jeſus, conſiſting of Fleſh, Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> offered on the Croſs, the one and only Sacrifice for Sin, and to which alone excluſively, the Saints did before, and ſince do, look to be Juſtified by, without any other Works?</q>
I ſay, Yea; but they anſwer neither yea nor nay, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile.</p>
            <p>The ninth Query,
<q>Is there not another Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by which Saints are Juſtified, than that Chriſt works in and by them? I ſay, Yea. They anſwer, Thou preaches another Goſpel, and would have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Righteouſneſs than that of Chriſt, which he works in and by Saints</q>—We witneſs Juſtification by Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> plainly implying Nay to the Query, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Obedience and Sufferings of our Lord, as without us, from being the Righteouſneſs, for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of Believers.</p>
            <p>The eleventh Query,
<q>Is the Juſtice of God fully ſatisfied, for all the Sins of the Elect, ere he appear to their Souls?</q>
I ſay, Yea. But they anſwer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſay, <q>Doth the Elect ſin? Shall the Elect dye?</q> And they, as I ſaid before, term themſelves the Elect, and ſo imply they ſin not, therefore have no need of any to make Satisfaction for them, or of asking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs.</p>
            <p>The twelfth Query,
<q>Is the holy Lives or Works of Saints excluded from the Act of Juſtification?</q>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, Yea. But they anſwer ſquinting, quoting 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. but imply <hi>Nay,</hi> that the holy Lives and Works of Saints are not excluded.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth Query,
<q>Is the Righteouſneſs wrought by the Saints every way anſwerable to the Juſtice of God?</q>
I ſay, Nay. They anſwer,
<q>Is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41409:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there any Righteouſneſs but that of Jeſus Chriſt? And is not that every way anſwerable to the Juſtice of God?—The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt we own and witneſs; </q>hereby ſquintingly making the Saints obedience to be the Satisfaction to Gods Juſtice, and ſo Chriſt dyed in vain, unleſs as they ſay, <hi>he was a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> or <hi>Example,</hi> or as ſomtimes they imply, to take away the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Act.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth Query,
<q>Is none accounted Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in God's ſight, in whom there is any failing, or doth not fulfil the Law, and anſwer every Demand of Juſtice?</q>
I anſwer, Yea, in and for Chriſt's ſake. But they ſay,
<q>God doth not accept any where there is any failing, or that doth not fulfil the Law, and anſwer every Demand of Juſtice.</q>
But this is the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and plaineſt Anſwer I find, of all the twenty:
By this Anſwer, as by ſome of the former, they ſeem to me to exclude God's Mercy in forgiving or Pardoning Sin, and alſo make void or uſeleſs the Suffering, Blood and Death of our Lord Jeſus on the Croſs without us; for if they can and do (as their Anſwer implies) <q>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law, and anſwer every Demand of Juſtice, and have not any failing in them,</q> what need have they of Forgiveneſs, or of Chriſt's Death and Blood, as a Sacrifice for them, or to ſanctifie them?
For if I am able to pay my own Debts, I have no need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do it for me; nay, if I am not, if another is able and willing, if my Creditor will not, or <hi>doth not accept</hi> his Payment for me, (then I am not benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) as their Anſwer implies: But the firſt part of their Anſwer ſeems to make uſeleſs (or that there is no need of) the latter; for if, as they ſay, <q>God doth not accept any where there is any failing,</q> then what hath Juſtice to do with ſuch? For the Law is not for the Righteous, but for Sinners: Alſo hereby they maintain as rigid a Satisfaction as any whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to oppoſe; and the difference between them and the Proteſtant Miniſters, is chiefly about the Perſon who makes the Satisfaction, or anſwers the Demands
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41409:44"/>
of Juſtice—The Quakers imply the Sinner, Man, (for it is ſuch is intended in the Query by the word <hi>any,</hi> any Man or Perſon) and the Proteſtants make our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as he was both God and Man in one Perſon without us, to be He <hi>who fulfils the Law, and Anſwers the Demands of Juſtice</hi> for us and in our ſtead. But if, as they imply by their Anſwer, they have no <hi>failing,</hi> they may appear boldly without an Advocate or Mediator, for that within them is the <hi>only Principle and Foundation,</hi> and <hi>admits not of any other,</hi> as they ſay; no, not the Blood nor Offering of the Body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> ſhed outwardly on the Croſs, but that within, even their <hi>not having any fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them,</hi> but <hi>anſwering every Demand of Juſtice,</hi> and their <hi>fulfilling the Law</hi> themſelves, (and not our Chriſt or our Lord Jeſus for them) is their
<q>Interceſſor, Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Reconciler, and Chriſt within them;</q> and they (as aforeſaid) have no need of him, or any thing of his on that account.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth Query,
<q>Is a Soul Juſtified by the Non-Imputation of Sin, and the Imputation of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Perſon of Chriſt? Or by a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wrought by Chriſt in the Perſon?</q>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, Not by that wrought in the Perſon, but by the Non-Imputation, or not charging the Sin, but by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or laid hold on by a living Faith. They An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <q>I own no Righteouſneſs but what is of Chriſt, and wrought by him;</q> plainly implying, it's that wrought in the Saints is the procuring Cauſe of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and not Chriſt's Perſonal Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; for they ſay, <q>I own no Righteouſneſs but that of Chriſt <hi>wrought by him</hi>;</q> it's very ſquinting, but if you conſider the terms in the Query, <hi>Wrought by him in the Perſon Juſtified,</hi> now you ſee their Anſwer hath that term, <hi>Wrought by him,</hi> altho' they leave out them words, <hi>In the Perſon Juſtified</hi>; yet their Anſwer implies that is their meaning, elſe why do they rail ſo, and ſay, <hi>It's a heap of Confuſion from the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41409:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>The ſixteenth Query is, <q>Is Chriſt in the Saints, in reſpect of that Nature he ſuffered in at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi>
               </q> I ſay, Nay; underſtanding it the Manhood: But they revile, and anſwer nothing to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The ſeventeenth Query, <q>How may Chriſt be ſaid to be in a Saint, and not in a Reprobate?</q> I anſwer, By a lively Faith, Governing the whole Man, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Faculties and Senſes ſubject to him, Body and Soul and Spirit being his; and ſo he is not in the Reprobate: But they rail, and not anſwer.</p>
            <p>The eighteenth Query,
<q>Doth Chriſt now take on him—our Fleſh?—Doth not this Aſſumption cauſe ſuch a perfection of the Godhead and Manhood, that both are United into one Perſon?</q>
I ſay, No.
But they anſwer, <q>Do'ſt thou limit Chriſt to Days, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him the form of a Servant? —Is not he now the ſame as ever he was?—The perfect Union with Chriſt we witneſs, who is the ſame to day, ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and for ever:</q>
They ſquintingly imply, That Chriſt and they be but one Perſon, as in <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> and they God and Man as he was; for, ſay they, <hi>The Perfect Union we witneſs,</hi> as farther appears: For the Miniſters ſay,
<q>Far be it from us to think, Chriſt is equally God incarnate in that Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> and in all Saints:</q>
This <hi>Fox</hi> falſly cites, <hi>Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> p. 22. but oppoſes, and in anſwer, ſays <hi>Fox,</hi>
               <q>The Scripture ſays, He is the <hi>Everlaſting Father,</hi> and his Name is called <hi>The Emanuel, God with us</hi>:</q>
And their oppoſing this Doctrine, and quoting it as an Error, implies that they do believe that they have the ſame Union of, or in their Natures, as was in, with, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Divine Nature and Manhood of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi>; and therefore ſays that Pagan-like <hi>Foxonian</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, <hi>Iſaac Penington,</hi> 
               <q>Doth not the Name belong to every Member as well as to the Head?</q> And <hi>Fox</hi>'s oppoſing the Miniſters, and their now above Anſwer to this eighteenth Query, implies the ſame, That <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> was no other ways Chriſt, but as they be; only more, becauſe he had more of the Spirit in him.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41409:45"/>
And thus it is that they own Chriſt, <hi>as he was Man,</hi> (as they ſay) that is, as he was in all Ages, and is now in them (the Light) and they one Spirit with him, and he one with them, as he was with all Saints in all Ages; and ſo by that Oneneſs he was and is Man, and they by the ſame Figure be Chriſt; as appears by <hi>Fox</hi>'s oppoſing and ſquintingly Anſwering to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and this their afore Anſwer to the Query: And on charging them to hold <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is in them as Man,</hi> and <hi>the Man Chriſt dwells in them</hi>: Now in <hi>Great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> p. 68. they do not deny the Charge, but in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it ſay,
<q>Is not <hi>Chriſt in Man?</hi> And how can you call him Chriſt in Man, without <hi>the Man be there?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The nineteenth Query, <q>Is Chriſt now converſant on Earth, as he was in the Apoſtles times?</q> I ſay, No. But they ſay,
<q>Did he not appear to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſince his Aſcenſion?—And is he not the ſame now, as he was then?</q>
Hereby they imply that Chriſt was no other ways with his Diſciples, but as he is with them now; that is, that our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that Perſon or Man whom <hi>Herod</hi> ſaw, was not the Chriſt; for they ſay, the Jews never ſaw the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>The twentieth Query,
<q>Did not Chriſt dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Saints in a more viſible manner than now in his Saints?</q>
I ſay, Yea. They Anſwer,
<q>He is not, nor never was viſible to thy Generation—Them as thou and thy Generation—doth crucifie him— and thou do'ſt now (i. e. <hi>Crucifie him now.</hi>)</q>
So that there now acknowledging the ſame Chriſt that was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is but fallacious; For it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they mean not him, the Man or Perſon, for they ſay he never was viſible to ſuch as this Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and that he is now crucified, as then; ſo that it's the Light in every Man, and not our Lord Jeſus, they aſcribe all the Works of Salvation to, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Perſon, Blood, and Sufferings outwardly.</p>
            <p>The tenth Query I omitted, being about the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41409:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Juſtification and Sanctification, which is firſt in order; and I thinking it's not ſo important, have wav'd it, and my Anſwers are with ſubmiſſion to abler Judgments.</p>
            <p>But take notice of what they ſay of theſe Sober Queries, in the Anſwer to the firſt: Say they,
<q>In this firſt Query thou haſt manifeſted what thou art; thou mighteſt have ſpared the other Nineteen—thou haſt Conjured them up in thy Black Art out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit, which is to be turned into Perdition.</q>
Conſonant to this, ſays <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and his Brother <hi>C. Atkinſon,</hi> to a Miniſter,
<q>Here is (ſay they) the three Perſons thou dream'ſt of, which thou would'ſt divide out of one, like a Conjurer, <hi>i. e. the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Trinity.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But whereas theſe Quakers ſay they have Anſwered theſe twenty Queries <hi>Plainly</hi> and <hi>Lovingly,</hi> their <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> you have ſeen already, now you ſhall hear their <hi>Loving Anſwers</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>In their Title Page, they ſay, the Miniſter is <hi>found a Deceiver</hi>—
<q>Thy Queries make thee manifeſt what thou art: Many of thy own Tribe, if they ſee thy Queries, would be aſhamed of thee and thy Queries. —Not worth Anſwering—leſt thou ſhouldſt boaſt in thy filthy Ignorance &amp; Darkneſs ſomething in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
This is, in the Preamble before the Anſwers. Yet I think them moſtly ſober and modeſt Queries, and think this Spirit which deſpiſes them cannot be of God: Yet they blaſphemouſly ſay,
<q>We have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thy Queries in the Eternal Light and Life of God.</q>
Truly was it ſaid, <hi>If the Light in you be Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how great is that Darkneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now comes their Loving Words. In Anſwer to the firſt, they term the Miniſter
<q>A Reprobate, a Child of Darkneſs, one of the Antichriſts and Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of—which Query comes from thy dark polluted Mind—without God in the World— among the falſe Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deceivers, Antichriſts— The Light condemns thee and all thy Generation
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41409:46"/>
(<hi>Miniſters</hi>) eternally.—We witneſs thee and thy Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to be in the Sorcery and Witchcraft—de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and betraying the ſimple—Thou art Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf—Thou art the Dragon that wouldſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Man-child—Thou the Dragon and thy Angels is caſt out into the Earth, and therefore doſt thou perſecute the Woman—Thou art blind.</q>
All this is in Anſwer to the firſt Query.</p>
            <p>And unto the ſecond, they ſay,
<q>Thou Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner art found adding to Scripture (<hi>its falſe</hi>) thy Divinations of thy own Brain—The Plagues of God is to be added unto thee, and poured on thee, O thou Lyar—and art for Condemnation—thee to be the Beaſt that makes War with the Lamb we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thou Antichriſt, which looks at Chriſt's Death at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alone, and cannot witneſs him no other ways but without thee.</q>
(<hi>I believe this is a Slander, altho' I knew not the Man.</hi>)</p>
            <p>To the third, ſay they,
<q>Thou full of all ſubtilty hath made manifeſt thy poyſon and enmity with the Light of Chriſt—thou art condemned for ever; Chriſt Jeſus in his own PERSON doth ſuffer by thee, thou blind Phariſee and Blaſphemer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to the fourth, ſay they,
<q>Thou Jeſuit art plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſt afar off,—as thy Father at <hi>Rome.</hi>— That Chriſt that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did not ſatisfie for thee, who art an Enemy to him—art under the wo, —and from that wo thou ſhalt never fly—Thou Lyar, art made manifeſt to all thy Congregation— Thou Lyar who art of the Lake—blind ignorant Sot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to the fifth, ſay they,
<q>Thou who art an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God, and a Child of Diſobedience, in whom the Prince of the Air rules—the Light in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience condemns thee—thou art an Enemy to the Croſs of Chriſt, and in the Myſtery of Iniquity—in the dark Power and Man of Sin—who art reconciled to thy luſt, and Sin reigns in thee.— Thou art blind,—who lives in ſtrife and envy:</q>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:41409:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Had not the Quakers need firſt to pull the Beam out of their own Eyes?</p>
            <p>To the ſixth, ſay they,
<q>Thou blind Guide—thou manifeſts thou doſt not know the MAN Chriſt at all. (<hi>See what Man they mean, when they confeſs he, Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Man</hi>) nor his Sufferings; for Death reigns in thee yet, that asks this Query for a Publick Perſon; Chriſt is not to thee but a Myſtery, which thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nothing of: For the Redeeming the Elect from under ſuch Mouths as thine,—did and doth Chriſt ſuffer: Thoſe that are brought to believe, deny ſuch dumb Idol Shepherds as thee, who as yet doth not believe, therefore ſhalt dye eternally.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to the ſeventh, they ſay, <q>Thou blaſphemouſly asks thou know'ſt not what—Let all People take notice what a Blaſphemer thou art, or what can they learn of ſuch an one as thee, who knows not the Juſtice of God, nor the Sufferings of Chriſt in his Saints.</q>
But Queries are not a Proof that the Queriſt knows not the thing he queries; for if it were ſo, then theſe Quakers were very <hi>Ignorant Sots,</hi> (in their own Dialect) for they have propounded hundreds of Queries to others.</p>
            <p>And to the eighth, they ſay,
<q>Thou art again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying thy former ſottiſh Query, which riſes out of thy dark Mind, concerning the Body of Jeſus, as the Devil did about the Body of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Let thy Mouth be ſtopt here; for the Body of Jeſus, and the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it up, and the Sacrifice for Sin, thou knows not, and thou art none of the Saints—Blind lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Blind into the Ditch, and for thee the Body of Jeſus is no Satisfaction; thou Reprobate, what haſt thou to do to talk of Believing—thou diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient one, on whom God will render Vengeance in flaming Fire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the ninth, ſay they,—
<q>Thou accurſed art made manifeſt, who preaches another Goſpel, and would have another Righteouſneſs than that of Chriſt, (<hi>a great Slander and Untruth</hi>) — Thou Beaſt, to whom
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41409:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Plagues of God are due, and upon whom his Wrath muſt be accompliſhed.—Thou would'ſt be Juſtified, and live in thy Sin, but thou art ſhut out from God for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the tenth, they ſay,
<q>Thou dark blind Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, haſt ſhut thy ſelf out from the knowledge of God in any meaſure: O that ever People ſhould be ſo blind, as to look to learn any thing at ſuch a one as thee (<hi>a Proteſtant Miniſter</hi>) but Sin and Filthineſs! —Let all People judge if thou be not a Teacher of Laſciviouſneſs and Uncleanneſs: How durſt thou mention a holy Life—who know'ſt neither Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation nor Sanctification? And the Man which art <hi>Cain (Mark, it's the Man and Creature he here reflects on, and by their own Doctrine ſuch are not of God)</hi> God doth not love nor accept thee nor thy Sacrifice; and thou who art in Envy do'ſt not love God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I will adventure to query, <hi>G W.</hi> Did thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>C. Atkinſon, J. S. W.</hi> and <hi>M. B.</hi> his Wife, <hi>T.B.</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> his Wife, your Travelling Female Agent, <hi>I. S. H. F. W. W. J. Moon,</hi> (that <hi>Croned</hi> Brother, and Man of War, with <hi>W. Penn,</hi> in the Dragon <hi>Fox</hi>'s Army, againſt <hi>J.S.) C. T. R. T.</hi> and <hi>Archer,</hi> mention'd in <hi>Satan Diſrob'd,</hi> and other of your unclean, beaſtly, <hi>Foxonian</hi> Brother Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, I ſay did they learn their Uncleanneſs and Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs of this Proteſtant Miniſter? Or hath he taught ſuch <hi>Laſciviouſneſs and Uncleanneſs,</hi> as theſe thy Brethren and Siſters, <hi>Foxonian</hi> Preachers, were guilty of? I had not thus digreſſed, but that they brand the Proteſtant Miniſter to teach <hi>Laſciviouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the eleventh Query, they ſay,
<q>Thou full of all ſubtilty—and with the Life judged and condemned, —Thou Sorcerer, doth the Elect of God ſin? Shall the Elect dye?</q>
Yea, theſe afore-mentioned ſinned and dyed, and were great Preaching <hi>Foxonian Quakers,</hi> and you term your ſelves <hi>the Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the twelfth, ſay they,
<q>Thou dead Beaſt—a ſtranger from the Life of God, and is excluded from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41409:47"/>
the holy Life of Saints—thee knows nothing of Jeſus Chriſt, but as thou haſt heard of him crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo art unredeemed—and ſo art not juſtified before God, nor never ſhalt be.</q>
(<hi>A po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive irrevocable Sentence! Or theſe Quakers Conjurers?</hi>) <q>—Thou art condemned in the Lake for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the thirteenth, ſay they,
<q>Thy Blindneſs is made manifeſt—Such polluted filthy Beaſts as thou— The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt we own, which ſhall be revealed on thee in flames of Fire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the fourteenth, ſay they,
<q>Thou polluted Beaſt haſt made it manifeſt what thou haſt been driving at all this while—that thou wilt have Corruption and Filthineſs to be accounted Righteous in God's ſight (<hi>But I rather think this is a filthy Lye and Slander</hi>) that, ſo (<hi>ſay they</hi>) thou mighteſt lie and wallow in thy fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.—The Son of God was made manifeſt to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and thou Man of Sin wouldſt have it to ſtand—them that walk in the Luſt of Uncleanneſs, and there thou art.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the fifteenth, ſay they,
<q>Here ſtop thy Mouth, thou Sorcerer, which is gathering up a heap of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which is fit for nothing but to be turned with thee into the bottomleſs Pit, from whence it comes, (i. e. <hi>the Queries</hi>)</q>
               <q>—Thy Language is of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Myſtery of Iniquity thou ſpeak'ſt it, which is condemned into the Lake of Perdition—which Righteouſneſs (<hi>i. e. Chriſts</hi>) ſhall confound thee, and all thy Unrighteouſneſs and Conjuration; and the ſame that Juſtifies us, ſhall Condemn thee Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſixteenth, ſay they,
<q>Thou Enemy of Chriſt, —thou art in that Nature which <hi>Judas</hi> was in, that betrayed him, and that they were in that crucified him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to the ſeventeenth, ſay they,
<q>What haſt thou to do to inquire after the Divine Nature—who art THE (<hi>i. e. not a</hi>) Natural Man, and knows nothing of God, but what thou knows naturally, as a brute
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41409:48"/>
Beaſt—who art a Reprobate, and thou ſhalt find him thy Eternal Condemnation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to the eighteenth, ſay they,
<q>O thou dark Beaſt and Conjurer, who art querying with thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured words, that which thou knows nothing of, </q>(<hi>an Untruth to be ſure</hi>)
<q>—Thou Blaſphemer, do'ſt thou limit Chriſt to Days?—With thee God, nor none of his Children have any Union; for God hath put an utter Enmity between thy Seed (thou Serpent) and the Seed of the Woman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to the nineteenth, ſay they,
<q>Thy Language is the Language of <hi>Egypt</hi>; thou makes it manifeſt thou knows not Chriſt—in the leaſt meaſure—thou dark ſottiſh Beaſt, who wouldſt be pleading for darkneſs and ignorance of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the twentieth, ſay they,
<q>Thou haſt ſhewed thy ignorance of the Scripture—He (i. e. <hi>Chriſt</hi>) is not nor never was viſible to thee nor thy Generation (<hi>Miniſters</hi>) for thoſe that profeſſed the Scriptures, as thee and thy Generation do, crucified him—and ſuch as thou art doth now, thou Blaſphemer, (<hi>and here they quote ten Lines of Scripture</hi>) — but (<hi>ſay they</hi>) theſe Scriptures are hid from thee, thou art one of them propheſied of, and the Scripture is fulfilled on thee, —<hi>He hath blinded their Eyes</hi>—and (<hi>ſay they</hi>) now bleſſed be the Lord, he hath diſcovered thee, and ſuch blind Guides as thou art: We have anſwered thy Queries in the Eternal Light and Life of God, and we have given Judgment upon thee and them (i. e. <hi>the twenty Queries</hi>) which thou ſhalt eternally witneſs. (<hi>And ſay they</hi>) Theſe ſtumbling Queries which we have anſwered Lovingly and Plainly in Scripture-Language, and with the Eternal Light and Life of God, ſet thee in thy own place, which thou ſhalt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally witneſs.</q>And again term them
<q> black, dark, ſtumbling Queries, and thy conjuring words, which thou haſt no Scripture for, as <hi>Ambiguity, Efficacy,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
And in their Concluſive Preamble, ſay they,
<q>Let People read and conſider what they do, who hold up
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41409:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch as thee, who is ſhut out from God, Scriptures, and Saints Life and Language—thou art to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the Light.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe grievous Wolves, and fierce Deſpiſers, <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. thus defame, and are in all this deadly fury and malice againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, becauſe this one Man <hi>P. B.</hi> asks theſe ſober Chriſtian Queries of them, according to their own Propoſal in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and in page 565. But this is like moſt of their fair pretences, to delude and blind People: for judge how contrary their Practice (in theſe Anſwers) is to this pretence, and yet they have the face to ſay in Print, <q>Theſe Queries are Anſwered Lovingly and Plainly, and in Scripture-Language, p. 34.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And that you may ſee all this their helliſh Railing is intended againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters in general, as well as <hi>P. B.</hi> ſay they in concluſion,
<q>A horrible thing is committed in the Land, <hi>Drunkards, Swearers, Lyars, Strikers,</hi> preach: O wonderful! Where are your Eyes? Try your Prieſts by Scriptures: See if they be not found in the ſame Generation that all the falſe Prophets and Deceivers were in.—See if they be not the Antichriſts which cannot confeſs Chriſt come in the Fleſh, preach for Sin againſt Perfection, and never any that follow them ſhall come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.—Theſe blind Guides deny the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which <hi>Moſes</hi> writ of— (<hi>It's a Slander and Untruth</hi>) and are found in the Sorcery and Witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they begun and end, reviling the Proteſtant Miniſters; and they not only condemn this Miniſter to <hi>the Lake</hi> and <hi>Bottomleſs Pit,</hi> but the Queries alſo: <hi>We have given Judgment on thee and them,</hi> (ſay they:) So that it's not only the Proteſtant Miniſters, but the Doctrines of the Proteſtant Faith, as theſe twenty Queries contain, have theſe Quakers alſo judged to the like condemnation with the Miniſters: All this Envy and Fury in ſeven Pages in Folio, have they Reprinted, whereas two or three Lines might have contained ſufficient Anſwers, had they believed and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41409:49"/>
owned theſe things, according to the Scriptures, as they pretend. And the Doctrines and Practices of the Proteſtants, as ſprinkling Infants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſay is <hi>Damnable, Doctrine of Devils, a meer Cheat,</hi> and your ſinging <hi>David</hi>'s Experiences in Rhime and Meeter, is a very Lye unto you; and ſay they,
<q>The Law which commands to pay Tythes, we cannot be obedient to it; and the Reaſon they give, is, Becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God, p. 313.</q>
And ſay they,
<q>If the Houſe (i. e. <hi>Publick Churches</hi>) were for any good purpoſe, or honeſt Practice, as for Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God would not deny to uphold it—but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's ONLY a place to commit Idolatry in,</q> (<hi>mark h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is Only</hi>) P. 347.
And ſay they,
<q>All you Churches, by what Name ſoever you are known, you are the Seed of the great Whore, and ſhe hath brought you forth.</q>
Here the Church of <hi>England</hi> may ſee it's not only the Diſſenting Miniſters, altho' their Envy is chiefly againſt them, but all. P. 4416.
<q>Have altogether forgotten God — Chriſtians all their Prayings, Preachings, Singings, Baptiſms, breaking Bread, and all that you perform as unto God,—is an Abomination unto him. The very practice of thoſe things now by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being degenerated, is become Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 432.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſay they,
<q>The Lord ſhall deſtroy your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and confound it, and no more is the Lord wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Steeple-houſes, they are left deſolate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —Your worſhip in Steeple-houſes is an Abomination to him. P. 481.</q> 
Again, ſay they,
<q>In the Name and Authority of the Lord, we declare againſt—your whole Worſhip, p. 479.</q>
Again, ſay they,
<q>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Infants, and calling it the Baptiſm into the Faith of Chriſt, and the Seal of the Covenant, —it's an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the great Whore, p. 489.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And particularly, of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſay they,
<q>This we ſay, Their Office nor Call is not from the Lord, nor by the Authority of his Spirit,—nor according to Scriptures—and is not from Heaven, but rather from the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> p. 638.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:41409:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>All this and much more of their helliſh Rage and Envy againſt the Proteſtant Religion and Miniſters, in one Book, Reprinted in <hi>Folio,</hi> and in 1672. promoted and eſpouſed by <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. to bring the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Miniſters into contempt, ſcorn, and hatred, in future Ages: For to confirm, and ſeal, and fix it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly, ſay they,
<q>You called Chriſtians—you— having loſt that which gave you a true Title to the Name Chriſtian, you deſerve not that Name: (<hi>and declare it</hi>) in the Name of the Lord.</q>
Here it's plain the Engliſh Proteſtants, and theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> cannot both be Chriſtians, one muſt quit the Title, p. 419. and ſay, <q>The Heathen ſhall ſee your Nakedneſs, and your Shame, and ſhall hiſs at you, p. 421.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how doth this agree with what <hi>W. Penn</hi> now pretends to, (as I hear?) He ſaid that they own all except three, of the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the three they differ'd in were about Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and not Doctrine. And yet here you ſee they ſay <hi>All</hi> the Proteſtants <hi>Doctrine and Practices Falſe,</hi> the <hi>whole Religion</hi> of the Engliſh Proteſtants they <hi>Deny</hi>: Theſe be their <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> their <hi>Truth</hi> in <hi>the beginning</hi> taught them before 1660, which is now in 1696. under hand enjoyned their Subjects to <hi>maintain</hi>; and this Noval owning of the Thirty Six Articles, is the Counterfeit Quakers New Teſtimony. But they ſay their <hi>Truth changes not</hi>; but they may now change their Words and Actions, and yet mean the ſame as they did 1656; for their deſign was to defame, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to root out the Proteſtant Miniſters; and if they do not effect it, they prove themſelves Lyars and falſe Prophets, and impudent Blaſphemers; therefore in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to drive on their deſign, they print theſe Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſay, <hi>It's for you and your Children.</hi> To plant this Root of Bitterneſs in after Ages, as well as in other Nations, is the deſign of this <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit in <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> And they have great Advantage for this Work in their great Schools or Houſes, where they teach their youth, and read to them, or cauſe them to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41409:50"/>
read, their great Volumes of <hi>Fox</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Works, and where theſe <hi>Foxonians</hi> are the Maſters, Governours, or Teachers, and whither their chief <hi>Foxonian</hi> Prieſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort; and as they ſay in Print, <hi>This is worthy of taking notice of—How abominable is this</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that theſe things ſhould be—much more that they paſs unreproved</hi>; i. e. their Envy againſt the Proteſtant Miniſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For altho' they thus Unchriſtian all Engliſh Proteſtants. Yet the Heathen (who make no Profeſſion, nor have not the knowledge of Salvation by our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as in the New Teſtament) theſe, under the Name of Pious Gentiles, they allow to have <hi>Faith,</hi> that they may degrade and under-value the Authority of the New Teſtament, and the Neceſſity of believing the Relation thereof, concerning the Dignity and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Perſonal Sufferings and Blood of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> outwardly. And ſeeing they have ſo much hatred to the Engliſh Proteſtant Miniſters, and ſo much Charity for the Gentiles, let them, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Foxonians</hi>) go for Gentile Preachers. And by theſe afore, and what follows, it's proved that theſe <hi>Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> chief Prieſts, <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> are influenc'd by an evil Spirit, if no other matter were proved againſt them, but their wrathful terms and envious proſecuting the Proteſtant Miniſters, theſe ſhew them Uncharitable, and therefore Unchriſtian.</p>
            <p>That theirs is not Chriſtian Charity, is evident by their Partiality; for notwithſtanding they Unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, for ſaying <hi>they be ſaved by Chriſt without them,</hi> and recorded ſuch for <hi>Reprobates</hi> and <hi>Ignorant ones too</hi> of Chriſt within; and give it as a ſure Mark of <hi>the Devil's being in ſuch</hi>; and all who <hi>pay Tythes, altho' freely,</hi> as <hi>Deniers of Chriſt,</hi> and mark'd <hi>them for Antichriſts,</hi> yet you ſee how kind they are to the Gentiles, and to their blaſphemous lying Brethren <hi>Foxonian</hi> Preachers, <hi>S. Eccles,</hi> notwithſtanding he <hi>S. E.</hi> was proved ſuch a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Lyar,</hi> yet they are ſo charitable to him, that in Antidote, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 225. they believe he died in Peace: And to <hi>G.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41409:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Blaſphemer, his Blaſphemy againſt God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chriſt; ſay they,
<q>As to thoſe offenſive Words, we do not affect the terms, neither are they proper to the true Chriſt.</q>
But by their Charity to him, it may be feared they think them proper enough to our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> his Perſon, which you term <hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>Contemptible, a Veſſel, a Garment:</hi> This your Charity to your blaſphemous Brethren, and your Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Proteſtant Miniſter, ſhews your Zeal nor Charity are not Chriſtian: For you ſay, <hi>G. G.</hi> the Miniſter was <hi>poſſeſſed with a Legion of Lying Spirits.</hi> And of <hi>J.

But they may blaſpheme and deny the Lord, if they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And their Unchriſtian Spirit further appears in their Excommunicating <hi>G. Keith</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> altho' twelve Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had acknowledged they <hi>had nothing againſt his Doctrine nor Converſation</hi>; but they pretended he was <hi>Apoſtatized from the Spirit of Meekneſs and Charity</hi>: But he was rather departed from their wrathful uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit againſt the Proteſtants, and more come into the Spirit of Charity: And that which they charge on him as Uncharitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was, becauſe he teſtified againſt their Errors, and maintained the Truth; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they make other Pretences, as that he on ſome great Provocations (in Diſcourſe) gave ſome harſh Names to ſome of their Erroneous Preachers. Now conſider all theſe afore and after, of their hell-fetch'd terms (and wicked Actions) of theirs to the Proteſtant Miniſters, Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all People; I ſay, Conſider whether all theſe do not prove them either to be gone from, or rather that they never had the Spirit of <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Charity</hi>; and therefore more juſtly Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from the Proteſtant Society, than <hi>G. Keith</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:41409:51"/>
did, according to their own Judgment and Practice: For let <hi>Algier</hi> be ſearch'd, if all the Runnagadoes there, for this hundred years paſt, have ſo villified and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Proteſtant Religion and Miniſters, as theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Prieſts have done.</p>
            <p>How can you, (eſpecially you Governours of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) expect to convert any to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Church, while that and you lye under ſuch foul Scandals ſo publickly in this and other Nations, without contradiction, and the chief Actors and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters in favour and incouraged in Reprinting theſe Blaſphemies, in great Volumes, as in <hi>E. B.</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi>'s wicked Works, which may have coſt near a thouſand pounds; and I hear they are Reprinting more of that Blaſphemer <hi>Fox</hi>'s, to the value of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> charge; and this alſo doubtleſs intended to be preſerved in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for a Monument of Infamy to the Engliſh Proteſtant Miniſters.</p>
            <p>And in the Title Page they put high Titles of the Authors, and term them <q>worthy Prophet, true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and Servant, and Sufferer for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, dyed a Priſoner for the Word of God; an Ambaſſador by ſpecial Authority, and ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt, <hi>and ſay they of the wicked Author,</hi> Generations which have not yet a Being, ſhall count thee bleſſed; becauſe of the want the Inheritance of the Lord hath of thee; my Subſtance is almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</q>(but you have taken care his wicked Works ſhall not be wanted.)</p>
            <p>Again ſay they of him,
<q>The firſt Fruits unto God, ſince the Apoſtacy; endowed with the Almighty Power of God, which Lived and Reigned in him.</q>
(By his Fruits herein produc'd, you may judge what Power and Spirit they, <hi>Foxonians,</hi> be ruled by, which they term Chriſt.) It ought to ſtrike Terror and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement in all Proteſtants, to conſider how they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themſelves and defame the Proteſtant Miniſters, and ſay,
<q>At the deſire of many Friends, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and Works of this valiant Soldier of Chriſt to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41409:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
continue on Record, as Monuments of his Service for the Lords.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider the time of their venting their Fury againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, and the time of the French King's dealings with the Proteſtant Miniſters and their Churches there; and this is not only the effect of one Man's paſſion, but the premeditated Work of theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts, <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, who, in his <hi>Serious Apology,</hi> ſays,
<q>If the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Expreſſions (againſt the Miniſters) had been Ten Thouſand times more ſignificant-and ſharp againſt that curſed bitter ſtock of Hirelings, they had been but enough; — and (ſays he) we have nothing for them but Wo's and Plagues, who have made drunk the Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — and laid them aſleep, — whil'ſt they have cut their Purſes, and pickt their Pockets.</q>
               <hi>W. Penn</hi> is not in jeſt here, but <hi>ſerious</hi> and in earneſt, to confirm, <hi>maintain,</hi> and <hi>hold up</hi> the <hi>Ancient Teſtimony their Truth taught</hi> them <hi>in the beginning,</hi> which they now enjoyn their <hi>Foxonian</hi> Subjects to <hi>hold up, and maintain in all the parts of it</hi>; for their <hi>Truth changes not</hi> ſay they, and therefore <hi>W. Penn</hi> confirms his Fathers, <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>E. B.</hi>'s curſed Envy againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters; for further, ſay they, in their Book, <hi>A Brief Diſcovery,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>The Proteſtant Miniſters, they are Conjurers, Thieves, Witches, Devils, Lyars, Stewards of the Devil's Magazines,—who go about to Murther the Child Jeſus where he is manifeſt; —even theſe bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Herodians they would devour the Child Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —Hold up a Worm-eaten Beaſtly Form, — yea of the Devil; — fearful Blaſphemers, ſcarlet-colour'd Beaſts—ſelling Beaſtly-ware; they ſell the report of others Riches, the Letter which is Duſt and Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this cannot be the <hi>Paper and Ink</hi> as the Quakers now pretend, for the Miniſters do not (as they ſay) <hi>ſell</hi> that, but it's the Doctrines of Scripture they thus condemn; for as afore they ſay, the <hi>report of other Mens Riches</hi>: Now the Paper and Ink is not the report,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41409:52"/>
but the Doctrine or Matter ſignifi'd by the Letters wrot in the Paper with the Ink. This ſhews the now Quakers fallaciouſneſs, in their now forged excuſes for <hi>their Ancient Teſtimonies of their Truth in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>: But in this Book they go on, and ſay of the Miniſters,
<q>Poſſeſſing nothing but Heatheniſh ſtuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               </q>—Really they are Blood-hounds, (but if they be not, to be ſure your <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit is) <q>hunting and gaſping after their Prey, like the mouth of Hell —ſtill barking and raging like <hi>Sodomites, &amp;c.</hi> Wo, wo! is their Portion, and of the upholders of that Treacherous Crew, the Proteſtant Miniſters.</q>Here is the Judgment paſſed on all, Kings and People, by theſe Quakers; and all this and much more ſuch Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Envy and Scandal in two leaves, beſides what's in the reſt of the Book; ſigned by four chief Quakers, one of them <hi>T. Lawſon,</hi> and his Work eſpouſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the now <hi>Foxonians,</hi> and juſt above this Chapter, in the concluſion of the foregoing, it's ſaid, <hi>written from the Spirit of the Lord</hi>; and this, where this Helliſh ſtuff is, I think is of <hi>Fox</hi>'s own indicting, the Language and Method being ſo like his; and was printed 1653.</p>
            <p>A Hundred times as much ſuch Hell-fetcht Fury of theſe Quakers, I can, out of their <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> produce; but theſe, and what is afore, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhews, that if the Proteſtant Miniſters be ſuch as they print them, then, as <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſays,
<q>What remains, but that the Rabble or the Government Sacrifice them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was becauſe a Miniſter ſaid, that the Womb of Iniquity was in the Quakers Writings.</q>
See it in the <hi>Quakers ſet in the true Light,</hi> by <hi>F. B.</hi> p. 2. But then, how much more guilty are theſe Quakers, <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. not only thus to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame the Proteſtant Miniſters of this Age, but all paſt and to come, that pay Tythes or uphold the Miniſters; Kings, Martyrs, and all People. Equivocating, delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Hypocrites: He (i. e. <hi>G. W.</hi>) hath proved himſelf and all others (mark it's all others) <hi>to be ſo except Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41409:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and page 228. ſay they,
<q>The Prieſt's work hath been to teach People to keep in, and not to come out of their Luſts to Chriſt:—And page 267. ſay they, You, all Prieſts and Teachers (<hi>mark, it's not ſome but all</hi>) who are inwardly ravened from the Spirit of God, —have turned all People from the Light to the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo have kept Thouſands, and Millions of Souls in Damnation; —and keeping them in the way to Hell, who are Satan's Miniſters; —and this hath been the Work of your Miniſtry ever ſince the days of the Apoſtles, as this Day and the People of the whole Nations witneſſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if they think to quibble it off, that it's not all, but them who have <hi>ravened from the Spirit</hi> (they mean) it's afore ſhew'd they include all; this by <hi>Fox,</hi> and ſo well approved by <hi>Penn</hi>; and to make it Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scripture, He, <hi>Penn,</hi> hath printed of him, this wicked <hi>Fox</hi>; <q>Many have done well, but thou, Dear <hi>George</hi> hath excelled them all,</q> (mark it, not the Light in him, but <hi>George</hi>) altho' himſelf has pretty near match'd him; for ſays he, <hi>W. Penn,</hi>
               <q>Theſe idle gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandizing Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> run away with 1500000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, under pretence of being God's Miniſters;— no ſort of People have been ſo univerſally, through Ages, the bane of Soul and Body of the Univerſe as that abominable Tribe, for whom the Theatre of God's moſt dreadful Vengeance is reſerved to Act their Eternal Targedy on.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſays <hi>W. Penn,</hi>
               <q>There is not any thing ſo Proud, Railing, and ſometimes Ignorant, as a ſort of Prieſts, —who think their Coat will bear out their worſt Expreſſions for Religion: —An Ill-bred and Pedantick Crew, the bane of Reaſon and peſt of the World; the old Incendiaries to miſchief, and the beſt to be ſpared of Mankind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Surely <hi>William,</hi> altho' He, <hi>Fox, excells all</hi> as went before him, yet thou haſt, if poſſible, exceeded him, and gone further into the Pit of Darkneſs than he whil'ſt alive: But thou had'ſt not <hi>Penſilvania</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41409:53"/>
but as much as thee could'ſt do, ſomething for the Devil and the Papiſts, as I have ſaid, he knew who he pleaſed, and that there were thoſe in power able to Defend and Reward him for any injury he could do the Proteſtant Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Again, ſay they, in their Book, <hi>A Serious Warning,</hi> &amp;c. <q>could people hear the cry of Thouſands out of the Pit of Damnation, they would intelligibly hear their Idol of Jealouſy and Others thus lament, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Independants, under the Notion of Goſpel-Miniſters and Reverend Divines, were the Men that ſeduced us hither by their Preaching Peace to us: Had it not been for them, we had—turned from the evil of our ways and never came here: Thus crys (ſay they) <hi>J. Indicot,</hi> and this is the dolorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of Thouſands of our, but yeſterday, Dear Countrymen;—if People were not in a Lethargy, they would beware of you all, as the Plague of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and in concluſion ſay) I ſhall prove theſe very Men (<hi>i. e.</hi> Presbyterians and Independant Miniſters) to be the very Men—to be in Doctrine and Practice the very Floodgate of Atheiſm and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, is breaking in as a mighty Torrent upon this miſerable Age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not evident, by all this Wrath and Reproach, the Quakers vent againſt the Miniſters, that they (<hi>i. e.</hi> theſe Quakers) are more likely <hi>poſſeſſed with a Legion of lying Spirits</hi> than <hi>G. G.</hi> the Miniſter, whom they ſay was ſo <hi>poſſeſs'd.</hi> For, notwithſtanding all this, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times more ſuch defamatious <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> of theirs in print, yet they now have the confidence to ſay in print (becauſe their wickedneſs is diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) they are
<q>Perſecuted with ſhameful Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Blaſphemies, to murder their Reputations as Men not ſparing living nor dead ſay they;</q>
but, who of Kings and Martyrs have they ſpared ever ſince the Apoſtles, and to the end of Time: Surely theſe <hi>Foxonians W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. as little read the Second Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and are as Ignorant of that as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41409:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they were of the Second Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi>: But they may ſay of them, and any Scripture, as they do in their <hi>Ancient Teſtimony,</hi>
               <q>Which their Truth taught them in the beginning, in 1654. That is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God to me, which he commands to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
But this, with the many others, proves that they abide not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and ſo are by their own Doctrine <hi>of the Devil</hi>; for they are more likely to be them <hi>grievous Wolves</hi> the Apoſtle foretold ſhould come, rather than <hi>Chriſt's Lambs,</hi> as <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. has the Face to Stile themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now if you, Miniſters and Governours of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> think that all this their Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not affect you, but the Diſſenters, yet know, that they have repreſented you worſe than them (if it may be;) Therefore think not your ſelves uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, but they were and are for driving that Nail they could eaſieſt make go; and the Diſſenting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (in 1672.) were more out of faſhion at Court here than you, as the Proteſtant Miniſters were in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if it be true as <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſays, that <hi>they who call Names for Religion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be ſure be no Chriſtians of Chriſt's making,</hi> then who made theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts Chriſtians? i. e. <hi>W. Penn.</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead, to be ſure not Chriſt.</hi> And whereas <hi>W. Penn,</hi> among his many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Defamations, upbraids the Miniſters with Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Sure they are not Ignoranter than Himſelf and <hi>Fox,</hi> &amp;c. was, who, as one <hi>infallible</hi> proof of his Ignorance (as well as the fallibleneſs of their <hi>infallible Foxonian Spirit</hi>) print our <hi>Lord Jeſus as Born at</hi> Nazareth, when Scripture ſays at <hi>Bethlehem</hi>: But this ſhews how little they converſe with the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And they have ſo intollerably ſcandalized the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Proteſtants, that it's (as they ſay) not fit it ſhould paſs without being taken notice of, and that by them it more concerns; but eſpecially the Miniſters they vent their Fury againſt, and ſet themſelves ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Tythes, becauſe they thought them a great
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41409:54"/>
Support to the Proteſtant Miniſters, and a likely Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prevail with the vulgar, covetous, luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and poor People, which are a great Party in the Nation, conſidered as incouraged by theſe Quakers, who have printed ſo many of their envious and wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Doctrines againſt the Miniſters, as <hi>Prophecies,</hi> or by the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. And they are obliged to drive on the ſame deſign, for fear they appear (as they are) <hi>proud, envious, blaſphemous Lyars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for further Proof, that they have no more, (if ſo much) kindneſs for the Epiſcopal Clergy, than for the Diſſenters, obſerve what they ſay:
<q>Did you not once make a Solemn Covenant with God, that you would utterly extirpate Epiſcopacy, that dead loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Form? Did you not ſpue it up? And will you turn again, and lick up your own Vomit? O do not ſo; do not run wilfully into deſtruction:</q> (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſhewed you how theſe Quakers blame them for not keeping the Covenant.)
By the foulneſs of the Expreſſions, you may judge from whence the Spirit came.</p>
            <p>Alſo one having commended Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s Works, the Quaker in contempt replies,
<q>Thou at laſt flieſt to the muckieſt hole of all—Was not Biſhops voted down, and ſome of them put to Death, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Cauſes they maintained?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore be not deceived by their preſent Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: For the Proteſtant Religion and Miniſters are no better now, but as bad <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Teachers of Laſciviouſneſs,</hi> with them now, as then; and the Magiſtrates as much in fault now (with <hi>G. Whitehead, &amp;c.</hi>) for upholding them, as then.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>G. W.</hi> thou ſaid'ſt to <hi>J. P.</hi> becauſe he ſhewed (juſtly deſerved) contempt to ſome of your ſeditious Pamphlets, <hi>that he was inſtigated by the Devil</hi>; but who but he inſtigated Thee and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> &amp;c. thus to vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Proteſtant Miniſters as you have, and to be ſo arrogant as to threaten the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>accuſe them for abuſing their Power</hi>; for, as you ſay, <hi>either the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41409:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Spirit of Christ, or that of the Devil leads Men.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe your Blaſphemies, and Treaſons, and ſeditious Practices and Doctrines herein mention'd, be ſome part of your Ancient Truth's Teſtimony, which it taught you in the beginning, or of Error. Now if it be not the Teſtimony of the Spirit of Truth, then they ought to be by you diſowned, and you were not lead by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> in reprinting them, and ſo blaſphemouſly exalt the wicked Authors, but by <hi>that of the Devil,</hi> by your own Doctrine; and in caſe you do not diſown them, it's a plain proof you do hold them as your <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> which your <hi>Truth</hi> taught you in the Beginning, and ſo are by your laſt years <hi>White-hart-court</hi> Conclave of <hi>Foxonian</hi> Cardinals, <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> enjoyned your Subjects to <hi>maintain</hi> and <hi>hold up</hi>; for ſay you <hi>Truth changes not,</hi> but that you do own them, appears by your ſquinting general Anſwers and Acknowledgments you now make to deceive the Government with; for, ſhould you anſwer'd plainly yea, or nay, to the two Queries in the <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> then you had either diſcovered your Errors, or elſe contradicted your <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, if you have any honeſty and plainneſs, to which you ſo highly pretend, make known which of theſe many printed <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> of yours you do diſown; for ſo many of them as you do not diſown, as you did <hi>D. S.</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>F. B.</hi> your are juſtly chargeable with, as them you enjoyn your Subjects to maintain and hold up as your <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi>; for your ſilence herein will be taken as conſent. Now as I have ſhewn you ſome of theſe Quakers rage and of their envy againſt the Proteſtant Miniſters, I will alſo give you ſome Reaſons they give to prove the Proteſtants <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> &amp;c. which I think includes themſelves, as well as others; in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, page 835. ſay they,
<q>All you who are divided in your Knowledge and Judgment—about the matters pertaining to God's Kingdom, you are Apoſtate Chriſtians, and you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet received the Spirit of Chriſt, (<hi>mark that</hi>) and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41409:55"/>
that is the Reaſon of all your Diviſions in Religious matters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
—Page 838.
<q>As Chriſtians are brought again to receive the Spirit of Chriſt, and walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Strife and Diviſion about Religion will ceaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
               <q>And other Marks of falſe Miniſters be, They have a place they call Church, and obſerve one day in a week to worſhip, and a few hours in that day, and an Hour-glaſs.</q>
Now if the Quakers be found to have Strife and Diviſions about Religion, then by their own Judgment they are condemned, as not to have yet received the Spirit of Chriſt. (But then by what Spirit they have been moved, and whoſe Miniſters and Embaſſadors they have been, judge.)</p>
            <p>That they have had Diviſions among them early, is proved by the Difference between <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and <hi>J. Nailor</hi> and his Party; alſo that of <hi>G. Fox</hi> and his Party, with <hi>J. Perrot</hi> and his Party; and that Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Fox</hi> and his Party, and <hi>J. Story</hi> and <hi>J. Wilkinſon</hi> and their Party in the North and Weſt; as alſo that between the now <hi>Foxonians,</hi> and <hi>G. Keith</hi> and his Party in <hi>Penſilvania</hi>; beſides many more I could mention, as <hi>Reading, &amp;c.</hi> as abundance of printed Books on both ſides proves, eſpecially <hi>W. R</hi>'s Eight Parts of the <hi>Chriſtian Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. And his ſecond Scourge for <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> an Apoſtate Quaker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whereas <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. terms <hi>G. K.</hi> Apoſtate, <hi>G. W.</hi> is there made to be one himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Judgments Signed by many on both ſides, one againſt another. I will give you ſome paſſages out of two Letters for proof of their Religious Difference, beſides what is in print in hundreds of Books; one Quaker of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Party.
<q>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Papers have come from <hi>J. N.</hi> ſince his being in Priſon—I hearing and ſeeing to be juſtified by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that what is there writ came from the Spirit of God; and that they are witneſſes of the ſame with him:</q>
I knowing the contrary writes as follows. — <hi>A Parable about a Tree is made, and ſix Perſons named:</hi>
               <q>The fruitleſs Tree (<hi>ſays he</hi>) that cumbers the ground —in <hi>J. N.</hi> is the Root. Let his Papers ceaſe to go abroad,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41409:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for more may be deceived by him than the others; his being ſecretly covered with words of truth to cover lyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Another Quaker of <hi>J. N.</hi>'s Party, contrary to this afore, ſays,
<q>One morning being awake in my Bed, the word of the Lord ſpake to me thus; —go to <hi>G.R.</hi>'s and ſpeak for <hi>James</hi>; — and finding that which is Eternal moving me, I went, —after ſome time one laid a Paper before me preſſing me to read it; but finding my Heart pricked as with ſome ſharp thing, I felt it was that Spirit gave it forth (<hi>i. e.</hi> the aforementioned Paper;) I denied the reading of it; for in the Life of God that Spirit was judged,— therefore, with the Spirit that is true, is that Spirit judged which called, that the Spirit of the Prince of the Air, which miniſtred forth that which was titled, <hi>How Sin is ſtrengthened, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
and in concluſion ſays,
<q>Therefore with the witneſs of God in all who live in the ſence of it, judged it is according to the Eternal Judgment;</q> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> the Spirit wrot the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>J. N.</hi>
I forbear their Names in reſpect to the Perſons, tho' I think they be both dead. Here is both as from God peremptory againſt one another, and one muſt be high Blaſphemy, if not both.</p>
            <p>Many more Inſtances I could give to prove their being at difference among themſelves, or one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore, by their own Doctrine, are ſo far from being guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, that <hi>they have it not, nor never received it</hi>; or elſe <hi>G. W. &amp;c. were Conjurers</hi> in printing this, if it was not from the Mouth of the Lord. But, if they object they do not differ, but it's ſome that go or fall off from them and the Truth, that differ and oppoſe them; no more do any others who agree, for wherein they agree they do not differ; nor do them of the Proteſtants differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves who be of the ſame mind, no more than the Quakers, altho' they differ one from another in ſome leſſer matters, yet they all agree and hold one Head and Foundation, and are not ſo uhcharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41409:56"/>
as you (<hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers are.) Now here is one great reaſon why theſe modern Quakers ſo endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and cover, and vindicate the Errors of their firſt Founders, <hi>Fox,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe they will not acknowledge any difference or change in their Judgments; for if they do, <hi>they are Self-condemn'd Apoſtates.</hi> Therefore it is that they reprint their old Books in great Volumns and alter, by leaving out and putting in as they ſee cauſe; eſpecially their treaſonable, ſeditious Doctrines, becauſe they were afraid to own them.</p>
            <p>But it's apparent, that the ſame Arguments as they uſe againſt the Proteſtants, to prove them not to have the Spirit of Chriſt, are concluſive againſt themſelves alſo, and they, the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, inexcuſable in condemning others, for that they are guilty off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and their ſaying they are not of them that oppoſe them, is not more than others may ſay for themſelves; for, if <hi>G. W.</hi> ſays <hi>W. R.</hi> &amp;c. were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; <hi>W: R.</hi> ſays <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>G. F.</hi> were ſo, and better proves than they <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. do, and better to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. But, if there were no other proof of their wickedneſs but their helliſh Fury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt the Proteſtant Religion, that's enough. And theſe wicked envious Hypocrites, the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to get in favour with the Papal Intereſt then in Court, have raked into the Graves and Sepulchers of the Ancient Martyrs and Fathers of the Proteſtants; nay, have been ſo <hi>preſumptious</hi> and arrogant, as not to ſpare the Sepulchers of Kings, but torn them out, and caſt as in the open Street, with infamous terms on their Perſons and Families, as well as their Power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and yet will not endure to have their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors diſcovered and teſtified againſt; but will Puniſh, Fine, Whip, and Impriſon, and take away Goods and Life too, if they could have reach'd it.</p>
            <p>Now you Engliſh Proteſtants; Surely if the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo concern'd for the Levites Concubine, as in the 19 and 20 Chapters of <hi>Judges,</hi> ſurely here is ſome cauſe of inquiry.</p>

But here theſe <hi>Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onian</hi> Quakers do not only condemn them that be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buryed, but barbarouſly violate the Sepulchers of the Proteſtant Kings, Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Biſhops, Martyrs, and Miniſters; and caſt Infamy on them, to make them hateful and odious to the Young of this Age, as well as future. For, they ſay it's for their <hi>Children</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the <hi>Heathen</hi> may <hi>ſee your ſhame, and hiſs at you,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſters; that is the very intent and drift of theſe now <hi>Foxonian White-hart-court</hi> Conclave of Chief Cardinals, <hi>Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Penn, &amp;c.</hi> to bring reproach and infamy on the Proteſtant Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Now, as theſe Quakers ſay, there is but two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that of God, or the wicked one. Therefore if the Quaker's be Gods, then the Proteſtant Miniſters in general, eſpecially all who pay or uphold Tythes and the Laws for them; you are all guided by the Spirit of Antichriſt, and are denyers of Chriſt, and under all theſe Hell-rak'd afore Names and Terms of the Quaker; unleſs theſe now Modern Quakers do as <hi>G.

            <p>Much more I can produce, in further proof of the wickedneſs of this <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit, if they proceed in their old way of denying the Truth, and ſlandering them that diſcover their wickedneſs, which is very great, even Pride, Envy, and Hypocriſie, who in 1661. ſay, <q>The Government of King <hi>Charles,</hi> was ſet up by the purpoſe of God.</q> Compare this with what is afore, and in the <hi>Snake in the Graſs</hi> againſt it.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe Quakers ſo defame the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Miniſters, and accuſe them to render them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, like as <hi>Haman</hi> did the <hi>Jews</hi>; yet hear how they deifie and exalt themſelves and one another: You have heard how they exalt this fierce Deſpiſer, <hi>E.

<q>He was the Inſtrument in God's hand, to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel, hid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—The Lord revealed it to him, and made him open the New and Living Way—A Meſſenger to my Houſe in <hi>Swartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more (ſay Margaret Fox)</hi> whither he brought the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Tidings of the Everlaſting Goſpel. As a Father in Chriſt, he took care of the whole Houſhold of Faith, over which the Lord made him an Overſeer, and endued him with ſuch an Excellent Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding</q> (and yet knew not the difference between the <hi>ſame degree,</hi> and <hi>a degree of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41409:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Nay, <hi>W. Penn</hi> is ſo falſe to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Knowledge, as to exalt him above all, as is before ſhewed.

            <p>Alſo another of their Idolatrous Preachers ſays of <hi>Fox,</hi> 
               <q>The Droppings of his tender Words in the Lords Love, was his Soul's Nouriſhment.</q> Where ſhall you find ſuch a high Character of any of the Words of our Lord JESUS?</p>
            <p>And to <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> he titles himſelf, <hi>An Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of Righteouſneſs</hi>; and ſays, <hi>From him whom the World calls</hi> George Fox, <hi>who am the Son of God</hi>: Now it's not the Light that the World calls <hi>G.

            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>Saul</hi>'s Errand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do not deny, but vindicate <hi>Fox,</hi> ſaying, He was <hi>Equal with God</hi>; and, he <hi>was the Eternal Judge of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in their Book, <hi>News out of the North,</hi> on the Title, ſay they,
<q>Written from the Mouth of the Lord (<hi>i. e. that Blaſphemous</hi> Fox) from one who is naked— cloathed with Righteouſneſs, whoſe Name is not known in the World (<hi>Yes it was that vagrant blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Cobler,</hi> Fox) riſen out of the North, which was propheſied off, but now is fulfilled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
And in p. 41. ſay,
<q>To your Conſciences I ſpeak,—who am not of the World, therefore the World knows me not—I am not known to the World, but well known to God—To every one of you I have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Conſcience.</q>
Now hereby it's plain it's not the Light, but <hi>Fox,</hi> that thus blaſphemed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41409:58"/>And in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, page 64. They ſay of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Quakers,
<q>Whom God, hath—choſen to place his Name in, and to take up his Habitation among, above all the Families of the Earth, the Tabernacle of God is with you—and only among you is God known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—You are God's only Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —Ye are the Royal Seed and Off-ſpring of the Lord—All Nations ſhall call you bleſſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in page 66. they ſay of the North from whence they came,
<q>O thou North of <hi>England</hi>!—Out of thee did the Branch <hi>(Fox)</hi> ſpring, and the Star ariſe, which gives Light unto all the Regions round about. —Out of thee the Terrors of the Lord proceeded, which makes the Earth to tremble—Out of thee Kings, Princes and Prophets (<hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi>) came forth in the Power of the moſt High—Gird on your Swords—Prepare your ſelves to Battel, for the Nations defie our God <hi>(Fox)</hi> —Our Enemies are whole Nations,—Rebellious People that will not come under our Law—and will not have our King <hi>(Fox)</hi> to reign, but deſpiſe his Law.—Let the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions know your power, and the ſtroke of your hand. Give unto the great Whore <hi>(the Proteſtants)</hi> double, <hi>(ſay they)</hi> — As ſhe hath loved Blood, give her Blood—Let none of the Heathen Nations, nor their Gods, eſcape your hands—Your Captains, (<hi>i. e. this E B. Fox, &amp;c.</hi>) are mighty Men: Curſed be every one that riſeth not up to help the Lord (<hi>Fox</hi>) againſt the Mighty.—The Beaſt (i. e. <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>) is mighty, and the falſe Prophet (i. e. <hi>Miniſters</hi>) is great, and they keep the Nations under their Power; but, O thou Beaſt, and thou falſe Prophet, you ſhall both be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>J. Coal</hi>'s Works, they ſay,
<q>God hath raiſed us up—according to his purpoſe, and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fore-knowledge, to be faithful Witneſſes.</q>
And again, to the Quakers,
<q>Conſider what the Lord hath done for you: Hath he done ſo for any People on the Earth?</q>
(<hi>Why? Did Chriſt dye only for you?</hi>)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41409:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Again, <q>Therefore it may be ſaid that us (<hi>Quakers</hi>) hath he known above all the Families of the Earth, page 82, 83.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>W.B.</hi>'s Works, page 173.
<q>The Eternal God hath ſworn—this People [i. e. <hi>Quakers</hi>] only ſhall proſper, of all the Families of the Earth (who fear his Name, and tremble at his Word)—they that bleſs them ſhall be bleſſed, and they that curſe them ſhall be curſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in p. 111. they make themſelves to be the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly propheſied of (<hi>Jer.</hi> 50.9.) to come out of the North, as alſo is afore ſhewn; and term themſelves, the <hi>Seed, the Elect</hi>; and they ſay,
<q>There is but two Seeds, Chriſt that never ſinned, and the Seed of the Serpent.</q>
Now they will not own themſelves to be the Serpent's Seed, but to be <q>the Elect Seed of Chriſt,</q> as in <hi>Huberthorn</hi>'s Works,
<q>the Seed, the Elect, his own Seed, the Arm of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to the World he is manifeſt through us, as being his natural Branches: All the Dominions of the World, are not equal in Treaſure and Wiſdom unto thee—You hath he choſen of all the Families of the Earth, to place his Name among, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — And your Laws ſhall all the Nations of the Earth become ſubject unto—All that riſeth up in Judgment againſt you (<hi>Quakers</hi>) ſhall be confounded—thou chiefeſt Son of his Love.</q> By <hi>E. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſays <hi>G. Fox,</hi> 
               <q>The Quakers are in the Power of God upon the Throne, p. 318.</q> And in <hi>W. B.</hi>'s Works, ſay they, <q>We are them of whom <hi>Enoch</hi> propheſied, the Saints;</q> and they are charged to ſay, <hi>They are as pure as God:</hi> In Anſwer, <hi>Fox</hi> does not deny it, but in juſtification of it, ſays, <hi>As he is, ſo are we in this preſent World,</hi> page 232.</p>
            <p>And being charged to ſay, <hi>He was the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and the Eternal Judge of the World</hi>; he doth not deny it, but quibble it off, <hi>It was not ſo ſpoken, he doth not ſay</hi> G. Fox <hi>is Chriſt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if when any one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to a queſtion, and ſays, <hi>I am,</hi> &amp;c. yet becauſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41409:59"/>
they do not pronounce their own Names, but ſay, <hi>I am,</hi> &amp;c. therefore they may deny they ſo ſaid, becauſe of the changing the terms <hi>I am,</hi> into <hi>G. F.</hi> (or he) <hi>ſaid he was,</hi> therefore they deny. Alſo another quibble they have to excuſe <hi>Fox</hi>'s Blaſphemy, That it was not <hi>Fox,</hi> but Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. in or by <hi>Fox</hi>; as they ſay in one Book, <hi>Muſt we deny him the Mouth to ſpeak by.</hi> But ſurely by this Figure <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> need not, when he was asked, to have ſaid, <hi>I am not he</hi>; for he had the Light i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him: But what Blaſphemy can be ſpoken, but may be excuſed by ſuch <hi>Quibbles</hi> as they uſe to excuſe the blaſphemous <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> their <hi>Truth taught them in the beginning?</hi> But by the ſame Rule every one of them may ſay as <hi>Fox</hi> did, and take the ſame blaſphemous Titles; and they may be given to any Quaker as well as to <hi>Fox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo in page 242. <hi>Great Myſt.</hi> they cite one, ſaying, <hi>The Apoſtles were Eye-Witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c. In the Anſwer, ſays <hi>Fox,</hi>
               <q>All may ſee what you have received—not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Goſpel by the ſame means the Apoſtles did, who are not Eye-Witneſſes, as the Apoſtles were;</q>
hereby implying the Quakers had or did ſee Chriſt, in the ſame manner as the Apoſtles did: For the ſeeing by Faith, no Proteſtants oppoſe (as I know) therefore that could not be the ſeeing the Man intended whom <hi>Fox</hi> oppoſes; but the Man meant a ſeeing with bodily Eyes, and it's in this ſence <hi>G. Fox</hi> oppoſes and banters the Man; and does thereby imply he was not Chriſt, but ſomeching in him (and ſo in <hi>Fox</hi>) was the Chriſt; and he (<hi>i. e. Jeſus</hi>) but the <hi>Veſſel, Garment,</hi> or Shell that the Kernel, Chriſt, dwelt in: And hereby the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit is proved to be a proud ſelf-exalting Spirit (as well as an envious and contemptuous one) which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture muſt be brought down: For altho' they give themſelves and one another ſuch high Titles, yet becauſe a Miniſter termed another Miniſter <hi>Reverend Man,</hi> they ſay,
<q>Are you not aſhamed to court one another with falſe and flattering Titles?—Ye ſhameleſs and preſumptuous ones, who durſt aſſume that Title to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41409:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your ſelves, which is appropriated to the Lord alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now having given ſome proofs of the Quakers highly exalting themſelves and one another, I will ſhew how they exalt their own Sufferings and Blood alſo above our Lord's, in this fierce deſpiſer <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, page 273. ſay they,
<q>The Sufferings of the People of God in this Age, is greater Suffering and more Unjuſt, than in the days of Chriſt, or of the Apoſtles;—What was done to Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was chiefly done by a Law, and in great part by due execution of a Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Oh horrible Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous undervaluing, of our Lord's Sufferings, and exalting theirs as above His, and juſtifying or excuſing them who Crucified him: Alſo altho' they ſo contemn our Lord's, yet of theirs, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Quakers Blood in print, ſay they to ſome Magiſtrates,
<q>Do not raſhly draw out your Swords againſt thoſe harmleſs Ones, whom your bloody Teachers—repreſent to you as Deceivers:—be not prevailed on to releaſe <hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> and give over Jeſus to be Crucified, to gratifie the murderous Appetites of your Prieſts. Conſider, altho' you may with <hi>Pilot</hi> waſh your Hands, and — appear clear from his Blood, yet before the pure Eyes of the Lord will the condemning ſtain thereof be found on you ſo freſh, that you will by no means be from thence cleanſed, but by the ſame Blood (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Quakers,) which you ſo cruelly ſhed.</q>
Here they Anſwer that Pagan queſtion of <hi>Iſ. Pennington</hi>'s, i. e. <hi>can outward Blood cleanſe?</hi> &amp;c. Yes, you ſee theirs can, altho' our Lord's cannot, as they imply: Theirs is the Blood of <hi>cleanſing, no other means</hi>; not by the Blood of our Lord outwardly ſhed, but by the ſame (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) Blood.</p>
            <p>Alſo I ſhall further prove theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers lead by an evil Spirit, by their contempt of and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing the Scriptures, and exalting their own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them: <hi>Fox</hi> on the Titles of his Pamphlets ſays, <q>To all Friend every where; this is the Word of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41409:60"/>
Lord unto you all.</q> And in another, Entituled, <hi>A Meſſage from the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. ſays three times, <hi>this is the Word of God</hi>; and yet ſays <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> 247.
<q>The Scriptures they are not the Word of God as thou blaſphemouſly affirm:</q>
And in the <hi>Scorned Quaker,</hi> &amp;c. page 19.
<q>The Scripture is not his Voice, but (ſo far as truly Tranſlated) A Declaration of what he ſpake to, and by thoſe Holy Men that were moved to write, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here you ſee, they not only undervalue our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, but render the Scripture as an old Almanack, or Gazette, as to its being binding to us; the Ten Commandments, or Chriſt's Sermon on the Mount, not God's <hi>Voice</hi> to us: Yet I have afore prov'd <hi>Fox</hi> ſaid, <hi>his is the Word of God</hi>; and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> Entituled a little Pamphlet of his, <hi>The Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. Now if <hi>G. W.</hi>'s be the Voice of Wiſdom, then it's Chriſt's <hi>Voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how they exalt their own Writings above Scripture; and yet have the Arrogance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they prefer Scripture before all other Books; and <hi>Fox</hi> ſays in his <hi>Meſſage from the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John is the Goſpel,</hi> — &amp;c. with the Light; all this Doctrine is ſeen to be falſe. And in <hi>News out of the North &amp;c.</hi>
               <q>So Duſt is the Serpents Meat; their original is but Duſt, which is but the Letter, which is Death. Their Goſpel is Duſt; <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> which is the Letter: And you ſay (<hi>ſays Fox</hi>) That <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> is the Goſpel, which is Carnal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Again ſays <hi>Fox, that the Letter is the Word</hi>; and that the four Books, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are the Goſpel, and—<hi>all your abominations are diſcover'd.</hi> Now none means them four Words or Names be the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but the Doctrine in and by them four Books, by them four Evangeliſts, is the Doctrine of the Goſpel; and it's this <hi>Fox</hi> oppoſes; for, when <hi>Fox</hi> put on his, <hi>this is the Word of God,</hi> it's not ſuppoſed he meant the Paper and Ink, but the Doctrine therein, or thereby
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41409:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſignified; as when the Quakers will not ſuffer their Papers to be called Mens Edicts, it's not thought they mean the Paper (abſtractly conſidered) but their Laws therein made for their Subjects to obey: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's the Doctrines of Scripture, and not the Paper and Ink <hi>Fox</hi> undervalues and condemns, and his, and <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s Blaſphemous Imaginations, they Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly term <hi>the Word of God, and the Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> and make their Preachings and Writings to be God's by them, but all others to be Man's, and <hi>outſide Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, carnal Letter</hi>; even the very Scriptures, unleſs when they as their Fathers did (againſt our Lord) uſe them to contemn the Chriſtian Faith; for, altho' they ſo often uſe ſome Scriptures,
<q>as Chriſt in you except you be Reprobates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Word is nigh in the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thouſands of times;</q>
yet I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge them to ſhew me how often, if ever, they preſs that 15 Chapter of the 1 of <hi>Corinth.</hi> the firſt ſeven ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; or the 9 and 10 verſes of the 10<hi>th.</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> altho' they thouſands of times uſe the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, yet I remember not that ever I heard them mentioned in any Quakers Meeting before <hi>G. Keith</hi> did, ſince his laſt coming into <hi>England,</hi> nor in any of their Books; nor remembred I that there was ſuch Expreſſions in Scripture ſo Ear-boar'd (as other be) was I to them. Let them produce theſe aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Scriptures, uſed by <hi>S. C.</hi> or any of their printed Sermons or Books, as to the intended ſervice of them in Scripture; I will undertake to produce a hundred, if not a thouſand times for one of their uſing them other. Let this be the touch-ſtone; and for their undervaluing Scripture I can give hundreds of more contempts of theirs.</p>
            <p>Theſe their contempts of our Lord's <hi>Perſon,</hi> Blood and Sufferings, and exalting their own. Theſe <hi>Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Quakers will not diſown, but underhand have approved and confirmed them, and enjoyned their Subjects <hi>to maintain and hold them up</hi>; for theſe be their <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> that their <hi>Truth taught them in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41409:61"/>
beginning,</hi> and they ſay <hi>it changes not</hi>; ſo it ſeems by their ſo juſtifying and excuſing thoſe Blaſphemous fierce Deſpiſers, the Authors and their wicked Works. But for further proof that the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit is an evil one, appears in the caſe of <hi>J. Gilpin,</hi> who relates how he was deluded to Blaſpheme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God he was ſenſible, and acknowledg'd his Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by neglect of <hi>Hearing, Reading,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>harken only to a Voice within me</hi> (ſays <hi>J. Gilpin) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what was ſpoken by it, was ſeconded by lying Wonders, &amp;c.</hi> This Voice, he ſays, led him to a Fidlers Door, where he <hi>knocked</hi> and ſald, <hi>Behold Chriſt ſtands at the door and knocks! J. Audland</hi> a <hi>Foxonian</hi> Preacher (who wrot the blaſphemous Letter to <hi>G. Fex</hi>) followed him, and he ſays, as he went he was <hi>moved to proclaim, I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.</hi>—Again he ſays, <hi>my Hand was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to take up a Knife, and carried with it towards my Throat; and the Voice ſaid unto me, open a hole there and I will give unto thee the Words of Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many more prodigious Actions he did by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Voice,</hi> or Spirit <hi>within him</hi>; and he ſays,
<q>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Quakers came to him, and bid him harken to the Voice within.</q>
Now <hi>Fox</hi> Anſwers this Book in Great Myſtery, and in citing them words of <hi>Gilpins</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, that he confeſſes his Error by <q>harkening only to a Voice within me</q> (ſays he.) Now <hi>G. Fox</hi> in page 298. terms this wicked deluding Spirit or <hi>Voice</hi>
               <q>The Voice of God within; he ſaith (<hi>ſays Fox</hi>) he began to conſider how he had offended God, by his neglect of external means,—Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—and harken to the Voice of God only within.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby it's apparent what Spirit, or Voice influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced him, <hi>Fox,</hi> even the ſame wicked one that led <hi>Gilpin</hi>; for he, <hi>Fox,</hi> terms that, <hi>the Voice of God,</hi> and ſo proves himſelf to be one of them who was given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Deluſion to believe a lye; and as he, <hi>Fox,</hi> ſo his Followers, <hi>Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. are by the ſame Spirit gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vindicate and excuſe him. Alſo in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> two Women Quakers, and Preachers, charged their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41409:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
own Siſter and her Husband to have murdered and buried their own Child, and cauſed the Man and his Wife to be tryed at an Aſſizes for it; many wicked blaſphemous paſſages there was in the whole Tragedy (too long to relate here,) in the printed Narrative by the Man himſelf, <hi>Henry Winder,</hi> Entituled, <hi>The Spirit of Quakeriſm,</hi> &amp;c. worth reading.</p>
            <p>This moſt murderous and blaſphemous Spirit thro' theſe two Women's Preaching, Quakers affirmed this was <q>A meſſage from the Lord—by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</q> The whole Tragedy is moſt Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, and when made publick, not diſown'd, but rather incourag'd by the Quakers in general, ſo fat as I can ſee by the Narrative; and it's this ſame wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirit which ſo defame the Proteſtant Miniſters, and which <hi>Penn</hi> balſphemouſly calls the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>: But, from theſe few ſad Inſtances it's apparent, that the Quakers when they mention Jeſus Chriſt do not mean that Man or Perſon, our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> but a Spirit or Light in them and all Men, as their terms of diſtinction ſhew. They make Jeſus Chriſt to be a Denomination or Title, which they give to any Spirit they pleaſe, as the King doth Titles of Honour. Whereas in your Book <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> &amp;c. you boaſt of your Principles, as for you as Hearers, in charity we may believe you; but if you like not theſe ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and erronious <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> in Print, of your chief Prieſt, why do not you publiſh againſt them, as againſt <hi>D. S.</hi>? Until you do ſo, you are chargeable therewith.</p>
            <p>But if you mean by your Principles, <hi>Fox,</hi> &amp;c. their <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> you are very ſhameleſs: For that of <hi>Fox</hi>'s in ordering <hi>Lords of Mannors Property to be taken away,</hi> &amp;c. But whenever that is put in Execution, I adviſe to begin with his Succeſſor, <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s, &amp;c. and ſee how they like it; for what Right have you to Fines or Quit-Rents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more than Lords have here, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral under Propriators of Tythes? If you have the Kings Patents or Grants, ſo have they, or what's as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41409:62"/>
equivalent, being confirmed by ſundry Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more than yours, and by them who had as much Original Right, as them from whom yours was granted.</p>
            <p>But the Proteſtant Miniſters are as great an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore to your chief Prieſts, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were to <hi>Haman.</hi> But why may not they enjoy what is granted and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, as well as any of you? For <hi>W. Penn</hi> works no more for his Fines or Quit-Rents, than many of them do, nor ſo much neither, I think.</p>
            <p>But if you ſay, It's the <hi>Compelling</hi> you oppoſe; that's falſe: For, as in the <hi>Snake in the Graſs</hi> appears, you oppoſe any freely paying, as is manifeſt by your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>W. R.</hi> As alſo Unchriſtian all who pay Tythes, as Deniers of Chriſt, and Antichriſts; ſo that you are not for Liberty of Conſcience, but for inforcing of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Laws, above the Laws of the Nation, (as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in your ſo charging and reviling <hi>T. C.</hi> as a <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor.</hi>) But whoever takes Houſe or Lands Tytheable, does or may know before-hand, it's under ſuch Duties. And whereas your laſt yearly Paper ſays, <hi>Truth is the ſame, and changes not</hi>; in 1660. you told King <hi>Charles</hi> you <hi>deny'd all outward Fighting for any End or Pretence whatſoever.</hi> Now either your chief Prieſts, <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>E. B.</hi> &amp;c. were of this mind in <hi>O. C.</hi>'s &amp;c. times, or elſe changed; Now if not changed, but always of the ſame mind, then they <hi>G. F.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>failed,</hi> to complain of ſome being put out of the Army: What ſhould they do there? they ought to have voluntarily quitted it: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>G. F,</hi> &amp;c. did <hi>fail,</hi> ſo to encourage <hi>Oliver,</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn.</p>
            <p>Therefore either they were and be <hi>Changed,</hi> ſince <hi>O.C</hi>'s time, or were Hypocrites; if Hypocrites, not to be believed: If <hi>Changed,</hi> either your <hi>Truth</hi> hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or they gone from it; and ſo that and you (i. e. <hi>the Quakers) not the ſame,</hi> and ſo may change again, as is for your <hi>ſordid Intereſt,</hi> as in the caſe of the Sloop in <hi>Penſilvania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo you are as uncertain and falacious in your
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41409:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
main Principle of the Light within, as in the caſe of Fighting: In <hi>Great Myſtery.</hi> p. 58. you cite one ſaying, <q>To ſay the Light in every Man is Chriſt the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is Error.</q> 
               <hi>Again,</hi>
               <q>They that ſay the Light in every Man that condemns of Sin, to be Chriſt the Redeemer, have ſet up an Idol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

To both theſe <hi>Fox</hi> anſwers: To the firſt, he ſays,

N.</hi> (in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſame Man, and the ſame Paſſage, as is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd to in <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> p. 58.) In this Vindication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 51. there is many Particulars which the Man, as <hi>J.

               </gap>. of your <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> &amp;c. you ſay,
<q>Divers more Deceits haſt thou made up into Lyes, and laid on us, as if we ſaid them, when it's thy own wickedneſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here you may ſee that to the ſame Man and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in one Book, i. e. <hi>The Great Myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. what the Man oppoſes as Error is owned as true; and his oppoſing it made contrary to Scripture.

W.</hi> As to Chriſt's being in every Man, that is not our words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo in page 27. ſays <hi>J. N.</hi> thou tells four horrible lyes on me; the ſecond is, that <hi>J. N.</hi> calls the Light within, the Eternal Spirit.</q>
Alſo in your Book, <hi>Deceit brought to Day light,</hi> &amp;c. You charge the Man with many lyes, one is his ſaying that you hold—<hi>the Light in every Man is Chriſt,</hi> page 5. Alſo in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works page 298.
<q>There <hi>E. B.</hi> being charged, as ſaying, that every Man has the Spirit of Chriſt; in Anſwer you, by way of denyal, ſay, I never ſaid, nor thought ſo. Now if the Light within every Man be not Chriſt, nor the Spirit of Chriſt, nor of Truth, nor the Word, nor God's Righteouſneſs, nor God's Son, nor the Eternal Spirit,</q> as afore is ſhew'd you have in your <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> in print, held formerly: How then is it?
Or why did you excommunicate <hi>G. Keith</hi> as an Heretick? for ſaying.
<q>The Light within was not ſufficient without ſomething elſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Either theſe aforemention'd denyals in your <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> be the Teſtimonies of Truth or Error; if of Error, then you ought to publiſh againſt them, and the Authors; but your not ſo doing, you are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41409:63"/>
with owning them; and ſo either you and your Truth hath changed, or contradict your ſelves: For, afore I have ſhewn, that in your <hi>Great Myſtery</hi> you contradict what you ſay in your Books, <hi>A Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Deceit brought to Day Light,</hi> &amp;c. In one paſſage your Books do contradict each other; one owning the ſame, the other denies; as alſo in your excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>G. Keith</hi> as an Heretick, for aſſerting the ſame as ſome of your own <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> do.</p>
            <p>Alſo, whereas here afore I ſhewed you deny every Man to have the Spirit of Chriſt, yet in <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. p. 9. to the ſame Perſon who denies that every Man has the Spirit of Chriſt, and charges you with an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for ſo ſaying, yet you charge him with it as an Error, to deny every Man has the Spirit of Chriſt; and in contradiction thereto, you Anſwer,
<q>
                  <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Every Man is enlightened,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>And the Spirit of Truth he ſhall reprove the World of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. (Mark) (<hi>ſay you</hi>) All People, here is Saints, here is Diſciples, here is the World; get from under this how thou canſt; for under Reproof thou art come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And here are all Men, ſays <hi>Fox,</hi> to the ſame Perſon, and words or Sentence.</q>
In <hi>Great Myſtery</hi> you oppoſe him for ſaying every Man has not the Spirit of Chriſt; and yet in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, you term him <hi>lying Tongue,</hi> for charging you as ſaying, <hi>Every Man has the Spirit of Chriſt</hi>; and ſay, <hi>You never ſaid nor thought ſo.</hi> Why ſure, if as in <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> you imply they have it, then you ought to think and believe ſo.</p>
            <p>And <hi>J. Bunyan</hi> ſays,
<q>Every Man as he comes into the World, receives a Light from Chriſt, as he is God, which is Conſcience, which ſome call Chriſt, tho' falſly—This will ſhew a Man there is a God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
This you anſwer by way of Denial, in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, p. 143. <q>I do deny them, (i. e. <hi>who call the Light Christ</hi>) and thee, if thou haſt not made a Lye of ſome body.</q>
Now in <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> p. 208. to the ſame Sentence, in your Anſwer there, you ſay,
<q>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> &amp;c. and doth not ſay
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41409:64"/>
its Conſcience—you have given Chriſt a New Name —that calls him Conſcience—Will Conſcience blot out Sin? — (Chriſt will.)</q>
Here by oppoſing <hi>J. B.</hi> and in <hi>Fox</hi>'s ſquinting way, he owns the <hi>Light Bunyan</hi> calls <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and yet again, in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, you deny the Doctrine, and them who call that Light <hi>Chriſt</hi>; thereby denying <hi>G. Fox,</hi> nay, and your ſelves too: For if it be ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe, then it muſt be Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Alſo about the Seed they ſeem to write confuſed, ſaying,
<q>There's but two Seeds, of God, and of the Serpent; and they ſay, Chriſt is the one ſeed, and the ſeed is Chriſt; and in the Lip of Truth <hi>T. L.</hi> ſays, now Chriſt is riſen for the Elect [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſeed] ſake, and it, he is redeeming, page 55.</q>
And in <hi>Love to the loſt</hi> they ſay, <q>In this ſeed as it's redeemed, hath the Saints fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, page 47.</q> Here they imply the ſeed is not the Redeemer, but the Redeemed; yet it's either Chriſt or the ſeed of the Serpent. Yet in ſeeming contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they ſay, in <hi>Love to the loſt,</hi> that ſeed which Man hath ſinned againſt muſt make the Atonement, page 3. Here again it's the Attoner or Saviour; and to this add their Excommunicating <hi>G. K.</hi> as an Heretick, becauſe he ſaid, <q>The Light was not ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe,</q> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and what he did and ſuffered for us without us,) This by <hi>S. Jennings</hi> in <hi>Penſilvania</hi>; and yet above three years after this <hi>N. Marks</hi> publickly acknowledg'd,
<q>They had nothing againſt him for Doctrine or Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to this effect:</q>
Thus confuſedly contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, or one another, they prove themſelves to be <hi>Babel</hi>'s Builders.</p>
            <p>Now your thus contracting one another, or your ſelves, owning and diſowning the ſame things, are both your <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> whereby you have, or may make this deceitful advantage, you can produce either of them, as you ſee is moſt for your ſordid Intereſt, and ſo affirm or deny what you pleaſe as your <hi>Ancient Teſtimony,</hi> and bring proofs accordingly: But your
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41409:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
own Judgment you have paſſed on the Miniſters takes hold on your ſelves; who have condemned others, and are guilty of the ſame things. How think you, <hi>Foxonians,</hi> to eſcape the Judgment of God? Who condemn others for differing, yet you differ one from another, or contradict your ſelves; in one Book denying that which in another Book you ſeem to own; and not only in ſmall matters, but in your main Foundation Principle.</p>
            <p>A further proof of the wickedneſs of the <hi>Foxonians</hi> and their Spirit, is, in that they ſhuffle, and quibble, and wave to anſwer but to two (of the ſeven) Queries ſent them, as in <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. And they were there urged to it, and reminded of their quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, yet they durſt not Anſwer plainly yea nor nay, but uſe their old Trade of quibbling long ſquinting Anſwers. The two Queries were theſe, i. e. <hi>Do you believe in a Christ without you, now in Heaven?</hi> And the other is thus; <hi>Is Christ now, and for ever to come, really a Man, in true and proper humane Nature, without all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Queries be ſhort and plain; therefore if theſe Quakers truly believe as they now pretend, they might and would have anſwered yea to both, and that had been ſatisfaction; but then that had contradicted ſome of their <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies their Truth taught them in the beginning,</hi> which they now enjoyn their Subjects <hi>to maintain, and hold up in every part</hi>; for their Ancient Books of <hi>Fox,</hi> and <hi>E. B.</hi> have oppoſed and contradicted the Proteſtant Miniſters for affirming theſe Truths; and therefore if they had anſwered yea, they had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted them, and ſo changed; and they durſt not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer nay plainly, becauſe then they had diſcovered their Blaſphemy and Hypocriſie both: Therefore, to hide themſelves and deceive, they make ſuch long ſquinting two Fac'd general Anſwers; but it's their own Doctrine and true on themſelves, <hi>deceit lurks in Generals</hi>; and whatever they pretend, yet their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and Contradicting others for affirming theſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41409:65"/>
Truths, do prove they do not believe in a Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them (or in Heaven) any otherwiſe, but as he is within them <hi>only,</hi> as in <hi>W. S.</hi>'s Catechiſm.</p>
            <p>Alſo in a Book, Entituled, <hi>The Deceived Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. by Mr. <hi>Caffin</hi> where in page 29. he ſays, <hi>G. Fox</hi> 
               <q>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he knew him, (<hi>i. e. Chriſt</hi>) come within him; and he looked for him to come no otherwiſe.</q>
This Book <hi>G. Fox</hi> anſwers to, and in page 211. cites ſome of theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> G. Fox <hi>ſaid he knew Christ come in him.</hi> And in his anſwer page 142. ſays, <hi>Christ is in you except you be Reprobates, ſo Reprobates witneſs it not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>M. C.</hi> did not deny, but own the Spirit of God dwells in the Saints; but it's the latter part of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Sentence that is objected againſt (i. e. <hi>that he looked for him to come no otherwiſe</hi>) ſo denying his, <hi>i. e.</hi> Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that was nailed to the Croſs, ſo coming again: And this latter and chiefeſt part of the Sentence <hi>Fox</hi> leaves out, and cites not, but does not deny that he ſo ſaid. Therefore it's plain, it's their <hi>Ancient Teſtimony of Truth in the beginning</hi>; and they ſay <hi>Truth is the ſame and changes not.</hi> This Book of <hi>Caffins</hi> was printed 1656. Therefore whatever deceitful general Confeſſions they may now make, unleſs they diſown this of <hi>Fox</hi>'s; it's clear they do not believe nor look for Chriſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth to come any otherwiſe than as he is come within them</hi>; ſo no outward coming of an outward Jeſus, as was taken away from the Apoſtles; and therefore no outward or other Day of Judgment, but what they have already within them. And this paſſage does not only prove <hi>Fox</hi>'s Error in oppoſing Chriſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi>'s coming again without Men, or outwardly (which now the Quakers pretend to own) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by plainly implies nay to the ſix Queries, being the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond which they in <hi>The Snake in the Graſs</hi> are again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire'd to anſwer; which Queries altho' twice put to them, yet they will not anſwer with plain yea or nay, but in deceitful <hi>generals they lurk</hi> to hide their Errors, and to avoid the ſhame of their pride and folly in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41409:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be guided by the infallible Spirit; whenas, they expoſe themſelves to more ſhame and add wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their former Sins hereby: But I ſay not only that their Error herein (<hi>i. e.</hi> this falſe citing of <hi>Fox</hi>'s words to <hi>Caffin</hi> aforementioned is diſcovered, but more of their wickedneſs, by their leaving out the latter part of the Sentence, which was the moſt material and objected part; they falſly repreſent this <hi>M.C.</hi> as oppoſing Chriſt's Inward or Spiritual coming in his People, which he, <hi>M. C.</hi> did not; alſo by this falſe citing of <hi>M. C.</hi>'s words they hid their Error; but by this they prove themſelves falſe Accuſers and Forgers, to falſe cite Men's words, to falſly repreſent their Principles; and that they, or at leaſt <hi>Fox</hi> did not <q>believe in a Chriſt, to come really a Man in true and proper hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, without all other Men;</q> for, ſo he was not come in him; and he ſaid, <hi>he looked for him to come no otherwiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some more Inſtances I may give (in <hi>Fox</hi>'s oppoſing <hi>J. Bunyan</hi>) of their contempt of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and his Forgery. Alſo in page 643. <hi>J.B.</hi> ſpeaks of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Deluſion, how it deceives People, ſaying, <hi>at laſt it (i. e.</hi> the falſe Spirit) begins to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—
<q>Shewing the Soul a new Chriſt;—the new and falſe Chriſt is a Chriſt crucified within, Dead, Raiſed again, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended within, —in oppoſition to the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was Crucified, Dead, Riſen again without, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Again, ſays <hi>J. B.</hi>
               <q>This falſe Chriſt hath a falſe Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to apprehend this Chriſt (<hi>i. e.</hi> the falſe Chriſt) Crucified, Dead, Riſen again, and Aſcended within.</q>
And ſays <hi>J. B.</hi> 
               <q>They have a Scripture to prove their Doctrine, but it's of the Devil's making, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, out of this Sentence of <hi>J. B.</hi>'s (which I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg) <hi>G. F.</hi> forges three ſeveral falſe Sentences; and is ſo wicked as to ſay to them all three, <hi>they ſay (i. e. J. Bunyan</hi> and <hi>J. Burton</hi>) when it's his own Forgery, in page 206. ſays <hi>Fox,</hi>
               <q>They ſay—it's deluding poor Souls to hold forth a crucified Chriſt within, Riſen, Aſcended within.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:41409:66"/>Again, <hi>Fox</hi> ſays. <q>They ſay, falſe Chriſts hath a new falſe Faith to apprehend this crucified Chriſt within.</q> (Obſerve, here he forges <hi>J. B.</hi>'s word <hi>Christ</hi> ſingular, into <hi>Chriſts</hi> plural; is not this as bad as you, for thou about which he and they have made ſuch a noiſe.)</p>
            <p>Again, ſays <hi>Fox,</hi>
               <q>they ſay it's a Scripture of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's making, to apprehend this crucified Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</q>
Here, beſides his wronging <hi>J. B.</hi>'s ſenſe and meaning, by taking his words ſo in pieces; he, <hi>Fox,</hi> changes <hi>J. B.</hi>'s words <hi>a Chriſt crucified within,</hi> into <hi>a crucified Christ within,</hi> by tranſpoſing the words, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the word <hi>Crucified</hi> firſt, and the word <hi>Christ</hi> after, whenas in <hi>J. B.</hi>'s the word <hi>Christ</hi> is firſt, and <hi>Crucified</hi> laſt: But however this Forger, <hi>Fox,</hi> (or them <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> for him who mended his Blaſphemy, in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Capt. <hi>Drury</hi> to <hi>O. C.</hi>) falſly cite; yet obſerve the Sentence, as <hi>J. B.</hi> ſays, and not as they forge it; he <hi>J. B.</hi> condemns it as Error, to hold out
<q>A Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified within, Dead, Riſen again, and Aſcended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in oppoſition to the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Dead, Riſen again, and Aſcended without.</q>
This <hi>Fox</hi> cites, tho' falſly, and oppoſes as Error, and do thereby imply it's not Error, but Truth; and that it's Error in <hi>J. B.</hi> to contradict it; for in the Anſwer ſays <hi>Fox,</hi>
               <q>Which is contrary to the Faith of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which preached Chriſt that's Crucified within, and not another, him that was raiſed from the Dead was riſen </q>
               <hi>(obſerve it)</hi> him that was raiſed was riſen.
Doth this ſhew his <hi>extraordinary Wiſdom</hi> or Ignorance, or rather doth it not prove their extraordinary <hi>Failing,</hi> who, contrary to their own knowledge, ſo falſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm of him: But to return.</p>
            <p>Again, ſay <hi>Fox</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>J. B.</hi>
               <q>If there be any other Chriſt but he that was Crucified within, he is the falſe Chriſt;—he that hath not this Chriſt that was Riſen and Crucified within, is a Reprobate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Obſerve, altho he falſly put it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>J. B.</hi>'s <hi>Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt</hi> three times, too falſly repreſent <hi>J.B.</hi> as oppoſing Chriſt's being Spiritually in his People (which is falſe,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41409:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for he owns it as I ſhall ſhew)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in all his three an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers he again tranſpoſes the words, and puts the word <hi>Christ</hi> before <hi>Crucified,</hi> altho' in his forg'd Sentence as <hi>J. B.</hi>'s he puts the word <hi>Crucified</hi> before <hi>Christ.</hi> Now this could not be an overſight, becauſe it's three times in one page, and anſwers between to every Citation; in every one of which anſwers, the word <hi>Christ</hi> is put firſt; but in the forged Sentences all three, the word <hi>Crucified</hi> is put firſt, and cauſe they had for it; for elſe <hi>J. B.</hi>'s words would not have appear'd to oppoſe Chriſt that <hi>was crucified, being manifeſt within,</hi> which was their deſign ſo to repreſent him; nor could they had that ſeeming occaſion to oppoſe him, nor could they have rendered him, <hi>J. B.</hi> ſuch a Reprobate as they do; for, who that reads this or any ſuch Book of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, can think any others, but when they ſay in print, <hi>he</hi> or <hi>they ſay,</hi> &amp;c. that it's the words of the Perſon they cite; only I having <hi>come after them and ſearcht</hi> them, have diſcovered their wicked forgery, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenting Mens words to defame them.</p>
            <p>But, in this oppoſing of <hi>J. B. Fox</hi> does, in his ſquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting way, contemn the Perſon of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> outwardly (for, as ſuch he is not within) and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, makes the Light within every Man to be <hi>Christ that's crucified</hi>; and ſo do not as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, direct to the Man or Perſon who was Nailed to the Croſs, and whom <hi>Herod</hi> ſaw; and whom them after Saints had not, nor did not ſee, becauſe he was taken up from them—out of their ſight: I ſay this <hi>Fox</hi> not preaching the ſame Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> as they did, but oppoſing them that did ſo preach him, ſhews <hi>Fox</hi>'s Spirit or Light was not the ſame as the Apoſtles, but a contrary one, ſo Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>But further, to prove <hi>Fox</hi>'s contempt: I think as to the terms, <hi>Suffered</hi> or <hi>Crucified</hi> they import much the ſame, when ſpoke in reference to our Lord's Death; but that of the two, the word <hi>Suffered,</hi> moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies what he in Soul and Spirit, or inwardly, endured, rather than the word <hi>Crucified</hi>; for that moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41409:67"/>
reſpects the manner, or circumſtances of his being put to Death, and Suffering is more extenſive to all he underwent inwardly, as well as outwardly. Now whereas one <hi>T. M.</hi> maintains the value, vertue, and dignity of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi>; his Perſonal Sufferings in his own Perſon without us in oppoſition to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers contempt thereof, and ſetting up ſomething done in their Perſons, as is afore ſhewn <hi>G. F.</hi> oppoſes him as he does <hi>J. B.</hi> and ſays, page 131.
<q>All be in the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who be out of the ſtate of witneſſing Chriſt (that Suffered) within them, and Roſe again.</q>
Obſerve the two words <hi>that Suffered</hi> be in the parentheſis; but in caſe them two words had not been to put, but been without them Parentheſis, theſe now <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers ſay,
<q>Now who would have concluded any otherwiſe, but that <hi>G. F.</hi> undervaluing the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had publiſhed that his Sufferings were within Man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:—But now take it with the Parentheſis, this alters the caſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, if it be ſo, here the words <hi>that's Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> needed as much the Parentheſis about them, as the words <hi>that Suffered,</hi> becauſe <hi>Crucified</hi> has more relation to his outward Dying than <hi>Suffered</hi>; and it's twice in this 206 Page; <hi>Chriſt that's Crucified within,—He that was Crucified within</hi>; and in neither of theſe two Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, not ſo much as a Comma to ſeparate them two words <hi>that's Crucified</hi> from the afore nor following words <hi>within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I think, ſeeing there is neither Comma nor Parentheſis to ſeparate them words <hi>that's Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> from the afore going, and the following word <hi>within,</hi> as is in page 131.
<q>I may conclude that <hi>G.Fox</hi> undervalues the Crucifying of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> without, and publiſh that his (i. e. <hi>Chriſt</hi>) Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying was within Man only.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, by their own Judgment, <hi>Fox</hi> is guilty of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing the Crucifying</hi> of our Lord Jeſus, which I think amounts to as much <hi>as contemning</hi> them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41409:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they have made him guilty of my Charge: And altho' he <hi>Fox</hi>'s Anſwers, here and elſewhere, be ſo ſquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and two-fac'd that it's difficult to prove any Charge againſt him, in plain and clear expreſs words of his, but by what he oppoſes; but herein not only his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of our Lord Jeſus, but his wicked Forgery is manifeſt, and my Charge proved: And by theſe and a few more proofs I have given in my <hi>Eſſay,</hi> to allay <hi>G. Fox's Spirit,</hi> and my <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>inlarged.</hi> Theſe Quakers Errors and wicked Forgeries are fully prov'd, (but I hope I ſhall publiſh theſe and many more others. But whereas <hi>Fox,</hi> by His Forgery, falſly repreſents this good Chriſtian <hi>J. Bunyan</hi> as being againſt Chriſt's being within his People, to prove that falſe; and that as I aforeſaid, he does not oppoſe it, but own it: He ſays in the ſame Book, <q>The cauſe of Believers Hope is this, Chriſt or the Spirit of Chriſt in them.</q> Again, ſays he,
<q>Some looking only on what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered without them; reſting in an Hiſtorical —Faith of it, without looking for the Spirit of Jeſus to come into their Hearts, —without which they cannot rightly—believe in Chriſt without them;</q>
This proves theſe Quakers had no cauſe to oppoſe him on that ſcore; but his diſcovering their Errors and bearing witneſs to, and for our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> as being God's Chriſt, did torment the wicked Spirit in <hi>Fox,</hi> &amp;c. And through them caſt out Floods of Forgery and falſe Accuſation againſt him, as in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s Works, page 139. ſay they, <hi>Thus much is the mind of the Pen-man's Spirit, ſecretly ſmiting at the Doctrine of the true Faith, Christ within, and directing altogether without and afar off.</hi> But what's afore cited of <hi>J. B.</hi>'s proves theſe Quakers wicked Slanderers: This may ſerve for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their Book, Entituled, <hi>An Antidote,</hi> &amp;c. A pretended Anſwer to <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. But that worthy Author, hath in that Book, and his <hi>Satan Diſrob'd,</hi> &amp;c. drove them out of their lurking holes, only one, i. e. <hi>Their Errors are ſo groſs, that it's a ſhame to confute them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:41409:68"/>Now <hi>H. Goldny, W. Sanders,</hi> &amp;c. do not call me <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Fellow,</hi> as you did <hi>J. Pennyman,</hi> on full Change, without his ſpeaking ever a word to you; nor be not ſo envious againſt me, as you were againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Quaker <hi>D. S.</hi> for his Anſwer to <hi>F. B.</hi> on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: For in your Book <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> &amp;c. I have leave to Print. But if this envious <hi>Foxonian</hi> Spirit ſhould be ſo powerful in you, as it was in your Pope <hi>Penn</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Whitehead,</hi> againſt <hi>G.

               <hi>I</hi> Am glad to find ſome of our Clergy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Controverſie with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> conſidering the high Concernment it is of, it being about the Foundation of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and as it's the peculiar Duty of the Paſtors to earneſtly contend for the Faith: And as I hear, <hi>Mr Bugg,</hi> who hath ſo eminently expos'd himſelf to their Fury, is become a Member of our Church, and thereby hath put himſelf under her Protection, and ſhe ought to take care of him: And altho' the <hi>Quakers</hi> defame him with many reproachful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, but do not, as I find, prove any matter of evil Fact againſt him, or Heretical Principle, but becauſe he detects their Errors, yet they brand him with the infamous Name of <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> &amp;c. whereby I think they not only defame him, but ſcandalize our Church; and it affects not him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but all the Members thereof; and the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41409:69"/>
thereby, is not only the ſcandal, but the hinderance it muſt be to deter others, who may be willing to return to the True Faith and Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Therefore I think if ſome Eminent and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful appeared in his behalf, not eſpouſing any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in his Management (if any ſuch be) it would be a Check to their Inſolency, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his Diſcovery: For in their Anſwer to the Queries they do not give <hi>Dr. Lancaſter</hi> thoſe foul terms as formerly they had done to Men of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter on ſuch Occaſions; which I cannot aſcribe to any change in their Judgment or Spirit, but their Tongues are ty'd by their Intereſt; they know with whom they have to do.</p>
            <p>I take the boldneſs to impart my thoughts of the Reaſonableneſs and advantage it may be for ſome Eminent in our Church to concern themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Hereſies and Scandals of theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> beſides what I have above hinted.</p>

they belong to; and there receive information of other matters proper to communicate to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Circuits; ſo that as the Blood hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and fixed Circulation all over, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt parts of the Body, from the Heart or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo do their affairs: Their Preachers, as I hear, being moſtly Trading Men, and travelling from one Countrey to another, can manage their Affairs of Trade (as well as their Errors) to their Advantage; and they have Orders that their Meetings (which are many) are to have ſome of all Books they Print. Alſo I am inform'd they bring them to their Meetings, (Mens and Womens) there to be bought by Particulars, and not without encouraging Invitations, Chapman-like, as they do their other Wares, and their People charged, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to read them. By ſuch cunning Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they vend many, and thereby make them much cheaper to them; for the more of any Impreſſion is vended, the more is the Bookſellers Encouragement. And indeed there ſeems to be ſome Truth in what is ſaid of them, <hi>None have the like Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency but the Jews and Jeſuits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Controverſie is of Concernment, and theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> are more potent, able and numerous than could be imagined; and it's the ſeverity of their Diſcipline that upholds them, more than Truth and Juſtice.

that is, that a Book of each ſort may be ſent to every Pariſh, to the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> to impart as he ſees needful. But that ſuch Books may not be too numerous nor impertinent, care may be taken, that none be printed or ſent, but what be (by ſome appointed therefore) approved.</p>
            <p>Alſo a ſtrict Eye kept over what the <hi>Quakers</hi> Print, and that not to be left to the management of mean under Officers; for they are ſuch a great and able Body, and have plenty of a ſort of Duſt that will blind a common Eye: For it's for lack of Encouragement to the Bookſellers, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to undertake to Print ſuch Books, unleſs at the Authors Charge; and it's too great a Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for any Private Perſon to manage a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with ſuch a numerous and able Body as they are; for its not one ſingle Perſon, but their whole Body as one Man. And they have ſuch a common road of Defaming Terms and Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to reproach any who oppoſe them, that many are afraid to meddle with them. Their Slanders paſs for Truth with many; and altho' Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> being a Scholar is not under the ſame Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as Mr. <hi>Bugg</hi> and <hi>Criſp,</hi> yet his Acquaintance being but little beſides among them, and his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the World but indifferent, and they ſo rich and numerous, do over-power him with Books, too many for him to anſwer. But were his Labours Encouraged and Eſpouſed by the Heads of our Church, he is the moſt capable of Detecting their Errors, as being a Scholar, and having ſo long been a Preacher among them.</p>

            <head>An Expoſition on the <hi>2 Peter, 1</hi> Chap. <hi>19</hi> Verſe.</head>
            <p>
               <q>WE have alſo a more ſure word of the Prophets whereunto you do well; that ye take heed as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day Star ariſe in your Hearts.</q>
Some ſay this <hi>more ſure word</hi> is the Light or Spirit within; but I take it here to be meant of the Scriptures or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets, altho' it's commonly read <hi>a more ſure word of Propheſy</hi>: But in an old Tranſlation I find it tranſlated <hi>a more ſure word of the Prophets.</hi> Therefore I conclude the words will bear to be ſo read, and I believe the Apoſtles meaning by <hi>a more ſure word</hi> was a more unqueſtioned Teſtimony or Word; as if he had ſaid; if any Doubt or Queſtion what we ſay, concerning that Voice we heard in the Mount, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their was but three that heard it, and ſo are witneſſes to the Truth thereof; yet the words of the Prophets they own as ſure and true, and they all te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify to the ſame Lord Jeſus as we do: And therefore you do well to take heed unto them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> to give himſelf to Reading and Study in the Scriptures; for they, as our Lord ſaid, teſtifie of me. Alſo by the next adjoyning words, it ſeems plain to be the Apoſtles meaning; for ſays he, <hi>No propheſy of Scripture is of private Interpretation, but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Holy Men of God ſpeak as they were moved.</hi> Alſo in the third Chapter, ſays St. <hi>Peter, This ſecond Epiſtle I write unto you,—that you may be mindful of the words which were ſpoken before of the Holy Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. And in his firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, firſt Chapter and tenth Verſe, ſaith he, <hi>Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired—who propheſied of the grace that ſhould come unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby it ſeems to me that the Apoſtle did not here in this Scripture direct them to a Light or Word within them, for a proof of his Doctrine (that Jeſus was the Chriſt,) but to the words of the Prophets, as in the Acts in his Sermons, he refers to the Scriptures
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41409:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for proof, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. ſays he, <hi>Theſe Scriptures muſt needs be fulfilled which the Holy Ghoſt, by the mouth of David ſpake,</hi> Again, Verſe 20. ſaith <hi>Peter, This is that which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the prophet Joel.</hi> Again, St. <hi>Peter</hi> in proving that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was the Chriſt, and that he was riſen, ſays of <hi>David, Seeing he</hi> (i. e. David) <hi>was a prophet,</hi> &amp;c. Again, Chap. 3.18. ſays he, <hi>The things which God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed by the mouth of his prophets that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, he hath fulfilled,</hi> &amp;c. and in verſe 24. ſays he, <hi>All the prophets from Samuel and thenceforth, as many as have ſpoken have foretold of this day</hi> (even of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Riſing, and Aſcending of our Lord Jeſus) <hi>whom</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the heavens muſt contain until the time that all things be reſtored, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince the world began.</hi> Alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>Peter</hi> Preaching that <hi>Jeſus whom they had hanged on a tree—was ordained of God to be judge both of quick and dead</hi> (ſaith) <hi>to him (i. e.</hi> Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth) gave all the prophets witneſs, that thro' this man, all that believe in him ſhould receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it's evident from Scripture, that 'twas St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Method to prove his Doctrine by, or from <hi>the words of the Prophets,</hi> and not by directing them to a Light within them; and as it was his former uſe in his Sermons, ſo alſo he continued the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in his Epiſtles; and the reaſon or cauſe ſeems plain; foraſmuch as the Prieſts and Rulers of the <hi>Jews</hi> could perſwade the People to believe, that Jeſus was not riſen; but that his Diſciples had ſtolen him away notwithſtanding ſo many witneſſes of his Reſurrection, as is mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. And was ſeen forty days, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>I ſay, notwithſtanding ſuch evident demonſtration, if the <hi>Jews</hi> could perſwade the People it was falſe, much more might the Apoſtles expect they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and not believe them three Perſons (<hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s) Teſtimony; alſo conſidering it was not known to any others, until after his Reſurrection, as by our Lord's command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.9. <hi>Tell the viſion to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41409:72"/>
no man, until the Son of man be riſen from the dead?</hi> Alſo <hi>Paul</hi> preaching at <hi>Antioch</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he prov'd out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that Jeſus was the Chriſt and ſaid, <hi>Becauſe they knew him not, nor the voice of the Prophets read every ſabbath day,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Acts</hi> 15. ſaith <hi>James, To this agree the words of the Prophets.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoning with them of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> out of the Scriptures, that Jeſus was Chriſt; and <hi>Apollo</hi> he mightily convinced the Jews, ſhewing by the Scriptures that Jeſus was Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. and <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays he ſaid, <hi>None other things then Moſes and the Prophets did ſay ſhould come; King Agrippa believ'ſt thou the Prophets? I know thou believ'ſt.</hi> Here alſo, it was not a Light within, but the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to: And in the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Chriſt himſelf prefers the Scriptures, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them; if they will not hear them, neither will they be perſwaded altho' one roſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here our Lord does not direct to a Light within, but the Prophets and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s words; in conformity to which I ſuppoſe <hi>Peter</hi> did the ſame, and did not in this place mean a Light within them, but the words of all the Prophets in Scripture was more ſure or leſs queſtionable than their three Teſtimony of that Voice that they heard (I mean not as to themſelves, but as to other) as to proving the <hi>power and coming of our Lord Jeſus Christ</hi>; to convince and ſtop the mouths of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, and falſe Prophets which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid ſhould come, and therefore it was needful for the Apoſtle to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſtrengthen his Teſtimony and their Faith by the Words of the Prophets, as alſo further appears in that he ſays, <hi>Whereunto you do well to take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place until the day dawn, and the day Star ariſe in your hearts</hi>: Hereby making the ſure word to be ſomething elſe, beſides or more than a Light within them, or then <hi>the dawning of the day, or the day Star in their hearts</hi>; and the Apoſtles giving the preference to the words of the Prophets before his own, is a ſign of his great Humility and Obedience
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41409:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to our Lord's Doctrine, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14. Therefore, as the Apoſtle ſaid, ſeeing we are ſo compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes for the Authority of the Scriptures, alſo for this expounding this Text, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the words of the Prophets, and not a Light within them.</p>
            <p>Then how much are they to blame who oppoſe this Expoſition, and make a contrary one, and undervalue the Scripture, and prefer their own Writings before the Scripture, as the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers do, who ſay it's Blaſphemy to call <hi>the Scripture the Word of God,</hi> and yet term their own or <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and give many contemptible Names to the Scripture, as <hi>Carnal Letter, Duſt, Serpents-Meat,</hi> &amp;c. and ſay <hi>the Scripture is not</hi> his (<hi>i. e. God's) Voice,</hi> &amp;c. But Title their own idle, ſeditious Pamphlets <hi>The Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>G.W.</hi> does. What, is not the Scripture as much God's Word or Voice as theſe Blaſphemers, <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pamphlets be, which they command and charge their Subjects to read in their Meetings? But let them ſhew me where-ever they enjoyned the reading any one Chapter in the Bible to confirm their undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture: Say they, the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Crucified Chriſt; and by their own Doctrine the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Light within them alſo; therefore their Argument they bring to undervalue the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is as much in force againſt the Light within as againſt the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But in oppoſition to this afore Expounding of this Scripture may be objected the words in <hi>James</hi> 1.21. <hi>Receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word, which is able to ſave your Souls</hi>; that this may refer to the Eternal Word in the beginning I will not oppoſe; but it may more particularly relate to him as he became Incarnate or made Fleſh, born of the Virgin, and was the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> even that Perſon, Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi>; for ſo he was united or ingrafted into our Nature, like unto us, except Sin; and as the Children partook of Fleſh and Blood, ſo likewiſe he himſelf took part of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41409:73"/>
ſame as the Children (<hi>make it.</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that, I think it is the receiving him in meekneſs (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Seed of the Woman, made under the Law, made of a Woman) Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> by Faith, as the Chriſt of God and Saviour; and as ſuch, relying on him alone for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as well as for Salvation, is the receiving with meekneſs the ingrafted Word, as the Apoſtles ſays, <hi>We are all children of God by faith in Christ Jeſus.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Let Christ dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, by this ingrafted Word is not meant here the common Illumination in all Mankind, but the peculiar Gift of Chriſt to thoſe who, thro' Faith in his Blood, receive him into them; and ſo, altho' the Word or Belief be within, yet Him, the Perſon or Object of that Faith is in Heaven, a place without Men; <hi>and which muſt receive him until the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets ſince the world began,</hi> Acts 3.21. which time I think is not yet; for, as ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.8. <hi>We ſee not yet all the things put under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But altho' I have here teſtified againſt theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Revilings and Envy to the Miniſters, yet I do not juſtifie them in all thing, many of them being blameable; and I wiſh they were generally more mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the good Advice of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and did not give encouragement to others to be conformable to this World; for example generally hath more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on People than Doctrine; and we are more apt to fault the mote in another's Eye than the beam in our own. But People being generally too quick-ſighted to ſpy their faults, I would not aggravate them; But theſe Quakers Defamations being ſo general, affect all, even the Biſhops alſo, who are eminently concern'd in the Civil Government, being Members of the Houſe of Peers, ſome of them the King's Privy Council. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Quakers are very arrogant; and I have Warrant from Scripture, and their own Doctrine and Practice for my thus <hi>ſhewing them their wickedneſs</hi> [which is great] <hi>that they may repent.</hi>
