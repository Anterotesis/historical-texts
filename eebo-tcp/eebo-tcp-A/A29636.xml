            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>From men of sence, (our Patrons heretofore,)</l>
            <l>By whom, (because all was well understood,</l>
            <l>In our worst Plays, something was still thought good,)</l>
            <l>To you the tastless judging Tribe we fly,</l>
            <l>Who treat our best with that severity,</l>
            <l>You never know, where 'tis the Wit does ly;</l>
            <l>Poets do justly your dull Censures scorn,</l>
            <l>Men of your parts, for us alone were born,</l>
            <l>Your Natural parts, which ne're would fail to Charm,</l>
            <l>Did not your Damn'd acquir'd ones do you harm;</l>
            <l>To please our Sex, you question all that's writ,</l>
            <l>You Sham, Clinch, Quibble, Cant, and Counterfit,</l>
            <l>And something fain you'd shew, might pass for wit,</l>
            <l>While folly can alone our wishes hit.</l>
            <l>Half Fools 'tis true, like half Wits, aukward prove,</l>

            <l>A quiet Husband? or a free Gallant?</l>
            <l>You have him, but a Wit is such a Tool!</l>
            <l>Fit to make nothing, till he's made a Fool,</l>
            <l>And that's about the Bush, which to prevent,</l>

            <l>Instead of Courage, saucy Confidence;</l>
            <l>With antique Dresses, and Impertinence.</l>
            <l>One eminent Grace does in that Land abound,</l>
            <l>Manners, which you sweet Sparks have never found.</l>
            <l>Manners, in these refin'd, though ill-bred Times,</l>

                     <p>Yes, and then he wou'd have answered me, that your
extravagant courses have cost your Uncle at least Fifteen hundred
Pounds, and upon your last debauch (when he resolv'd never to
concern himself for you again, about a year ago) he cast ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Five hundred Pound after you, with this Proviso that you
shou'd never trouble him any more; and at last finding you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible,
he Marry'd on purpose to disinherit you.</p>

—I'll make him know what it is to abuse simple Innocence. He
had no way to accomplish his wicked design, but by promising
to Marry me, and at the same time made me refuse the offers
of a good match in the Country, by which I incurr'd the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of all my Friends; and does he think to leave me now
at last, without making some provision for me? but he shall
find that my Kinsman has mony, and will stretch his purse to
right me by Law.—for I have already given him an Account
of his ill usage to me.</p>

enjoy'd you, and the Wheres, and the Whens.</p>

                  </sp>

                     <p>Is that a question for me to answer, Madam?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, and which in Honour you are bound to answer:
Did you not betray her to shame and infamy, and rob'd her of
her Virgin purity?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lor.</speaker>
                     <p>I did not ravish her, Madam.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not say you did. But you had Flattery which did much
more than force; I ask not her Honour back, but her life, and
self, for we have never heard of her since that fatal Treachery
of yours, and 'tis of you that I demand her.</p>

            <l>Dear Friends, go home and look unto your Wives,</l>
            <l>Bid 'em keep in and mend their gadding lives;</l>
            <l>They all have got a trick to see a Lord,</l>
            <l>—<hi>Yet ne'er the sooner for a hasty word.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I mean no harm, for there are Wives that do</l>
            <l>Keep open Shop, and trade as well as you;</l>
            <l>Deal by retail, and are to Husbands aiding,</l>
            <l>And oftentimes, have much the better Trading.</l>
            <l>When time and place are fit, I'll name you some</l>
            <l>Who keep a journy-man, or two at home.</l>
            <l>I'll say no more; truth sometimes hatred draws:</l>
            <l>—<hi>Yet</hi>
            </l>

            <l>I am a Glass in which you all may view,</l>
            <l>What strange good Natur'd things are most of you.</l>
            <l>Tho you'll believe no Man i th' way of Trade,</l>
            <l>Yet what believing Fools, by Wives you're made?</l>
            <l>Three years you're marry'd, and have ne'r a Son,</l>
            <l>Your Wives make visits, and the job is don,</l>
            <l>She smiles to see you Rock and Sing, by, by,</l>
            <l>And think 'tis Yours; ah,—<hi>Stultitia tua tibi.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And of your Wives a Pattern see in <hi>Aly,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When Trading's dead, they all will strike a Tally;</l>
            <l>Yet my dear Friends, be not at this dejected,</l>
            <l>Carry't as I do, fair, <hi>and stand Corrected:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Act not a <hi>Henrick,</hi> or a jealous <hi>Diego,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>'Tis safer much, to be an <hi>Assenego.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then let my Wife go visit Knight, or Lord;</l>
            <l>Or they come to her, I do not care one—<hi>hum,</hi>—</l>
            <l>
