         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>Firſt Reaſon againſt ſhutting Men up for the <hi>Plague,</hi> From the Communion of Saints, and the practiſe of the Primitive Chriſtians.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WEre Men (thoſe ſociable Creatures) made thus, every Man to live by himſelf? and if the Principle of ſelf-preſervation may alter the courſe of Nature, is this the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints we believed? is this the mutual care we ought to have one of another? We can endure to read in <hi>Euſebius</hi> of Heathens, who as ſoon as the Peſtilence was among them <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, and fled from their moſt loving and dear friends, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them half dead in the Streets: how they left the dead unburied to be devoured of Dogs, to the end they might avoid death, which yet they could not eſcape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While we obſerve withal how Grace above Nature enabled the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians by reaſon of their great love and brotherly Charity</hi> (they are <hi>Euſebius</hi> his own Words) <hi>not ſparing themſelves to cleave one to another, to viſit the ſick of the</hi> Plague, <hi>to attend them diligently, to Cure them in Chriſt though it coſt them their Lives; and being full of other mens maladies took the Infection off their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and tronſlated off their own accord the ſorrows of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours upon themſelves; fulfilling indeed the common ſaying, that friendſhip is alwayes to be retained. In this ſort, the beſt of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren departed this life, whereof ſome were Miniſters, ſome were Deacons, in great reverence among the Common People: So that this kind of death for their great Piety and ſtrength of Faith may ſeem to differ nothing from Martyrdom; for they took the dead Bodies of the Saints, whoſe breaſts, faces, and hands lay upwards, and cloſed their eyes, ſhut their mouths, and joyntly with one accord, being like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned, embraced them, and prepared their Funerals, their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little while afterward in all likelyhood prepared by others, for the Living continually traced the ſteps of the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then as the Body was one, and had many Members, all thoſe Members being one body, ſo was Chriſt; for by one Spirit were all Men Baptized into one Body, the eye ſaid not to the hand I

have no need of thee; nor the head to the foot I have no need of thee; yea, the weaker the Members of the Church were, the more care they had of them; and there was no Schiſm in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, each Member having an equal care one of another; and ſo if one Member ſuffered, all the Members ſuffered with it: they all looking on themſelves as the Body of Chriſt, and Members in particular: Then they did not Excommunicate whole Families when it pleaſed God to viſit them; no, then the Elders of the Church carefully attended them, prayed with them, and the effectual fervent prayer of thoſe righteous Men availed much.</p>

                  <head>Second Reaſon againſt the ſhutting up of Houſes infected with the <hi>Plague,</hi> From the ſpreading of the Infection by it.</head>
                  <p>BUt alas! a diſcourſe of publick mindedneſs to private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits looks like a fit of Melancholly; we urge not then your duty, but your Intereſt, not ſo much what concerneth us as your ſelves: alas! while you by this ſevere courſe would ſecure, you deſtroy your ſelves, and that ſhutting up of infected Houſes, which you think would ſtop the Infection, ſpreads it: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We are acted by a Principle of ſelf preſervation, as well as you, and therefore aſſoon as we find our ſelves or any member of our Families infected, ſo dreadful it is to us to be ſhut up from all comfort and ſociety, from free and wholſome air, from the care of the Phyſician, and the Divine, from the overſight of Friends and Relations, and ſometimes even from the very neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conveniences of Nature, that we run as far in City and Country as our feet can carry us, leaving Wives and Children to the Pariſhes, empty walls, and ſhops to Creditors, ſcattering the infection along the Streets as we go, and ſhifting it from Lodging to Lodging with our ſelves, till at laſt we drop in ſome Alley, Field, or neighbour Village, calling the people round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by the ſuddenneſs of our fall to ſtand awhile aſtoniſhed at our deaths, and then take their own; each fearful man of us frighted from his own houſe, killing his whole Town by ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them unprepared; whereas were we permitted to enjoy the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37246:4"/>
content and freedom of our own Habitations, we might by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes cure others, and be cured our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>See, ſee, we infect not our next Neighbours, and this ſickneſs ſpreads not much in any one place, but we carry it from place to place, running from our home as from our places of torment, and thus the Roads are viſited, and men travel the ſame way to the Country, and to their long home: Thus the Contagion hath reached moſt places round the Citty, which is now as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged with the judgment, and encompaſſed with the Viſitation and deſolation: We have not yet learned how to manage a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in all likelihood did perſons prepare themſelves (upon the firſt breaking out of the Plague) with Antidotes to viſit the ſick, who would be very well contented to keep within doors and converſe onely with their neareſt Friends, their Phyſicians and their ghoſtly fathers) and administer to them ſuch preſervatives, and other neceſſaries the Plague might go no further.

                  <head>Third Reaſon against ſhutting up Houſes viſited with the <hi>Plague</hi> from the experience of former times, when Plagues did not ceaſe till there was freedom of Converſe allowed.</head>
                  <p>IN the years 1346. 1348. 1350. there was a great Plague all over the World, eſpecially in <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſuch as was never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to be in any place before, ſweeping away Prieſts and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians firſt; when Men were troubled with no other diſeaſe, when the Living were not able to bury their Dead, all lay in common, there was no diſtinction between Sacred and profane; the very Birds of the air were poyſoned, and Men were all over ſore, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome Limb or other if they eſcaped with their Lives.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as the people diſcerned by Obſervation, by ſight or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they had this ſickneſs or not, they haſted away, left the other helpleſs: Whereupon (ſaith the Hiſtorian) many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for want of ſucour, who might otherwiſe have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. This inhumane forſaking took its riſe from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and Infidels; where the Parents forſook their Children, and the Children their Parents; Brothers and Siſters forſook one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37246:4"/>
nay, the Wife left the Husband, and the Husband the Wife. Nor was this monſtrous cruelty wanting among Chriſtians alſo, ſome of whom retired themſelves to ſolitary places, others kept themſelves cloſe in their Houſes or Caſtles to ſecure themſelves as they thought from the outrage of the general Viſitation; but all this could not any way prevail or prevent Gods Divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, againſt whom the ſtrongeſt Fortification never defended: Whereupon, mark it, many became more reſolute and Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; referring themſelves to Gods mercy, and with a holy reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to welcome death; they became kind and ſerviceable to the viſited, miniſtring to them all things neceſſary, and thus many recovered health, and became ſecure, and then yielded the like help to others: In which Chriſtian courſe God ſo bleſſed their endeavours, that very many of them were healed by viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſiſting one another.</p>
                  <p>Nay, within many Mens memory now alive, when the effect of Cooping Men up was no other, than that the Sick were ſo many that they could not be watched or kept in by thoſe that were well, in the year of our Lord 1625. and thereupon it being found convenient that the Sick ſhould have their Liberty to viſit and be viſited, and all Men ſhould meet and pray heartily to God to appeaſe his wrath: What with the freedome of the Ayre, what with the accomodations Men had for neceſſaries, it pleaſed God that the Sickneſs which had by ſhutting up,</p>

                  <head>Fourth Reaſon againſt ſhutting up of houſes infected with the Plague, from the condition of thoſe houſes and the inhabitants thereof.</head>
                  <p>BUt if we will not be wiſe by other mens experience, let us be ſo by our own moſt ſad and moſt deplorable, whereby we have known the healthieſt men ſhut up, and with the very thought of a ſad and diſmal reſtraint, contracting firſt a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and then a feaver, and at laſt (as all diſeaſes turn to that which is moſt epidemical) a Plague. Little is it conſidered that ſome ſpirits are ſo averſe to the very leaſt reſtraint, that the lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their pew door puts them to a ſwound, and a dayes impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment to them is mortal. Neither is it a fourth part of the inconvenience of this mewing up of men, that a whole &amp; healthy familie to day, for want of preſervatives, antidotes, attendance, and (it may be) neceſſaries of meat and drink, is to morrow none at all. If they want meat, then the infection ſeizeth their empty veins, if they eat ill-dreſſed, or unwholſome meat, that turns to crudities, and that to diſtempers, and theſe to the prevailing one, the Plague. This ſhutting up would breed a Plague if there were none: Infection may have killed its thouſands, but ſhutting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37246:5"/>
up hath killed its ten thouſands. Little is it conſidered how careleſs moſt Nurſes are in attending the Viſited, and how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (being poſſeſſed with rooking avarice) they are to watch their opportunity to ranſack their houſes; the aſſured abſence of friends making the ſick deſperate on the one hand, and them on the other unfaithful: their eſtates are the Plague moſt dye on, if they have any thing to loſe, to be ſure thoſe ſad creatures (for the Nurſes in ſuch caſes are the off-ſcouring of the City) have a doſe to give them; beſides that, it is ſomething beyond a Plague to an ingenious ſpirit to be in the hands of thoſe dirty, ugly, and unwholſome Haggs; even a hell it ſelf, on the one hand to hear nothing but ſcreetches, cryes, groans, and on the other hand to ſee nothing but uglineſs and deformity, black as night, and dark as Melancholy: Ah! to lye at the mercy of a ſtrange woman is ſad: to leave wife, children, plate, jewels, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of poverty, is worſe; but who can expreſs the miſery of being expoſed to their rapine that have nothing of the woman left but ſhape?</p>
                  <p>With what art do they neglect the rich? and with what ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the poor? <hi>A world, cry they, for drink, for phyſick, for ſweat, for cordials: by and by</hi> anſwereth the cunning <hi>Suecuba,</hi> till the poor patient breaths out his ſoul in his vain wiſhes, glad now to eſcape into a reſt and quietneſs much happier than his fretful ſtate wherein his diſeaſe tormented him much, but his overſees more, adding her fury from without, to the diſeaſes rage from within, and proving the more <hi>Intollerable Plague.</hi> And now the Husbands gone, if Sorrow doth not, a Cloſe Room, and Poſſet drink, ſhall break the good womans heart, equally divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her grief for the husband that is gone, and her fear for the children that are left behind: a needleſs fear, they ſhall not long ſurvive, heirs rather of the parents misfortune, than their eſtates; and if the bleſſing of God and the poor upon the devout and charitable family (according to the promiſe made to them and their ſeed) keeps up a child or two againſt the infection of the diſeaſe, the unwholſomneſs of their diet, the naſtineſs of their chamber, and the artifice of their tender, they are conveyed away forſooth, in order to their ſecurity, and in the mean time the well-furniſhed houſe lyeth at a beggar or

If the contagion ſeizeth any man at meals, or when he is full of meat or drink, he immediately vomiteth; as ſoon as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or ſtomach is emptied, applying <hi>Eleciuarium de Ouo,</hi> which the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> uſed, or ſome other Medicine to the outward parts that might draw the poyſon of the diſeaſe to it, and call it back from the heart.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the infected perſon hath applyed this or ſome other

Medicine of the like nature, he is laid in a warm bed, made with ſoft ſheets, and well-covered with cloaths, to the intent he might there ſweat three or four hours or longer, according to his ſtrength, and when by this means they could hardly provoke him to ſweat, they laid tyles heated at the fire to his feet, which might, by reaſon of their extraordinary heat provoke ſweat. And in all this time that the infected man did ſweat in, they took a ſpecial care that he neither ſlept, eat, nor drank. After his ſweating, diligently rubbing, and wiping off the ſweat, with very clean, and fine Linnen cloaths, afterwards permitting the poor man to riſe out of bed, upon condition that he looked not by any means into the open air, the air of the place wherein the ſick lieth being corrected and amended by odoriferous things, and ſweet ſmelling perfumes daily four or five times.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Infected perſon was removed from one chamber to another, becauſe the air of one chamber, by the continual tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſick in it, is much corrupted, and not eaſily amended or corrected, the chamber into which he went being very well perfumed before hand.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Two or three hours after the Patient hath ſweat, they made him ſome Chicken broth, which they gave him in little proportions, but often, for an infected perſon muſt be nouriſhed by little and little: to the broth they added the Chickens fleſh, ſodden with Sorrel, or with the juice of Lemmons, or elſe Verjuice.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The ſick is kept altogether from ſleeping the firſt day, by talk of the aſſiſtants, by rubbing their extreme parts, by pulling their eares, noſe, and hair, or by dipping a ſponge in very ſharp vinegar, and holding it to the Noſe.</p>

               <head>Seventh Reaſon why Houſes ſhould not be ſhut up for the Plague, Becauſe people are ſo much afrighted out of Town, and the bad conſequence thereof.</head>
               <p>BUt if it be of no conſideration among you to allow a liberty to the Infected to converſe with ſuch diſcreet men as are not ſo, becauſe they may (as you ſee before your eyes ſome have done to their own and other mens great benefit) underſtand the original, the nature, and the proper way of Curing this diſeaſe; yet conſider what it is by theſe ſevere Courſes, to affright ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands from their reſpective Habitations, thereby not onely ſcattering the Infection abroad, but obſtructing Trade at home, and leaving other thouſands without any employment, to tipple, loyter, and wander from one place to another; and for want of Neceſſaries on the one hand, and by exceſſes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, infect, and are infected; Whereas, had they due employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they would not meet in heards as they do, they would not ſurfet with rioting and drunkneſs; but they would ſecurely ſtick to their work, keep their bodies by exerciſe and temperance in a good frame, and provide themſelves wholſome dyet and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; fly, theſe poor men cannot as the <hi>Rich,</hi> for none will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, and they are not able to maintain themſelves; Work they cannot, for none will employ them, and they have nothing to do but to commit thoſe ſins, which certainly <hi>deſerve,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly <hi>bring</hi> the Plague upon them. Take, O take theſe Reaſons and many others, which your own judgments will ſuggeſt to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37246:11"/>
your ſerious Conſideration, but as they are tendred with all humble and due ſubmiſſion to the care and authority of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſons who are over us as intent as ever Magiſtrates were upon the means of our <hi>welfare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For an Eighth Argument I alleage the miſchief and ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that may ariſe from the high fits of Frenzy, that uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend this and all other the like Diſtempers; wherein the ſick (if not reſtrained by main force of their Attendants) are ready to commit any violence, either upon themſelves or other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wife, Mother, or Child. A ſad inſtance whereof we had this laſt week in <hi>Fleet</hi> Lane, where the Man of the Houſe being ſick, and having a great Swelling, but not without hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt ripe for breaking, did in a ſtrong fit riſe out of his bed, in ſpight of all that his Wife (who attended him) could do to the contrary, got his Knife, and therewith moſt miſerably cut his Wife, and had killed her, had ſhe not wrapped up the ſheet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, and therewith ſaved her ſelf, till by crying out Murther. a Neighbour (who was himſelf ſhut up) opened his own doors, and forced into the houſe, and came ſeaſonably to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The man is ſince dead, when in all likelihood (had he not by ariſing ſtruck in the diſeaſe) he might have recovered.</p>
               <p>Add to this a ſerious confideration of the ſad condition of Women neer the time of their travel, (or newly delivered) when ſhut up, (as 'tis the caſe of many at this time) having neither Midwife to help them, nor Nurſe to attend them, nor Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries provided for them, nor any friends to comfort them; and in this condition have continually for their object their own poor innocent Babes newly brought into the World, either to be ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for want of ſuſtenance, or poyſoned by the Breaſts that ſhould preſerve them.</p>
               <p>For concluſion I ſhall onely ſay that a liberty of freſh Aire, and acceſs of ſuch as are willing to viſit their ſickfriends, may be ſo regulated and limited as not to ſpread the Infection, and I am ſure will ſave the lives of Hundreds, who by ſo ſevere and cloſe reſtraint are little better then Murther'd, or buryed alive.</p>
