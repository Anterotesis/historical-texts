            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That you may
<pb facs="tcp:34033:3"/>
know upon what grounds we goe, and what securitie we expect there, and what advantage you in the South are to derive from it, you must know we have sent over 10000. foot armes, besides the Garrison neere 2000 horse armes, and 20 peece of Canon; we bring over wagons and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation to march so soon as we arrive, we carry ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry considerable Officers from hence, and by the advice we receive from that side 8000 men are on foot already, 6 Troops of Horse, and the rest will not belong on rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing after we come there. Generall <hi>King</hi> is designed for Lievtenant-generall, hath been with the Queen, and will be suddenly there. From <hi>Denmarke</hi> are likewise sent Arms for 10000 foot, and 1500 horse, with a traine of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and every thing proportionable, to the very Drums and Halbards. Two good men of warre come their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, and in them an Embassadour to His Majesty, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of great qualitie in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> I hope it will be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall care there to see him Nobly treated, for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and neglect of the last was much complained of, and is so much insented by the King, that it had like to have frustrated all our expectations in that Court, had not <hi>Cochran</hi> very handsomely evaded it, he comes along with the Embassadour, with whom if you encounter you will communicate some Propositions of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which in how much the fewer hands they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, will be so much the better liked by them you are to deale with, if my imployment in this affaire may fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your servant that writes to you, I know you will not be unmindfull of him.</p>
            <p>We have great apprehensions here by something inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated from my Lord of <hi>Holland,</hi> of a treaty further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into then we have advertisement of, or can well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove;

We have confidently bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eved your approaching <hi>London,</hi> (if you had not made too long stay upon the way) would have determined that matter, and what the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are now of that we cannot yet understand, for if intelligence from hence came as freely to you as to us, the Kings partie there are very considerable, and full of that expectation, and a day or two losse of time by the late example of <hi>Hull,</hi> may be judged of what contrary consequences it may produce.</p>
            <p>We heare my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> approaches <hi>London,</hi> but beleeve he will be so waited on by the Kings Horse, not to let him joyne with their Forces there, being now so lame an Army without Horse or Canon, as the Relations you send hither makes him to be. We beleeve the Kings Horse likewise, now so great a body, that it will be as troublesome as unnecessary for them to subsist together, and thinke so many Troops might be well spared as might be sent into <hi>Kent,</hi> to countenance a partie to be set on foote there, which according to our intelligence here would undoubtedly be found very affectionate and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, so that by sparing 500 Horse, you might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly adde to your Army 5000 Foote, to be imployed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River on that side the Towne.</p>
            <p>If the unhappy interception had not come of the last weeks Letters, we had undoubtedly been with you on the other side in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> within three weekes, and in that condition having all the Kingdome behinde us on every side, it will not be hard to judge whether should have been better able to subsist, they within the Towne, or the Kings Army without; admit my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> were gotten in, or that the Towne had not yeelded it selfe so soone as you had approached, you may yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb facs="tcp:34033:4"/>
presume on this, that our being once on foote we shall be able to collect for you all the 400000 l. Subsidies, universally throughout the Kingdome, which will make the Kings Army subsist, and weare out theirs, besides which the money we bring; what we expect from <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> are all encouragements to make us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no Treaties to be admitted, but upon termes of great advantage and honour to His Majesty, those you are best able to judge of upon the place. If the King have use of them, I am confident you may expect from <hi>France,</hi> (so soone as you set footing in <hi>Kent,</hi> and shall intimate you desire the same) the three Regiments of His Majesties own Subjects there imployed, under Colonell <hi>Hill,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Fitz williams,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Beling:</hi> your Letters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>Newcastle</hi> will direct our addresses to <hi>France,</hi> for I hope wee shall yet be there before you can returne any in answer to this.</p>

            <p>ON Saterday morning the Gentleman that brought this letter from <hi>Holland</hi> came up to <hi>London</hi> in a <hi>Gravesend-boat,</hi> intending to land at <hi>Brainford,</hi> and therefore for the more expedition shot the Bridge, which being perceived by one of the Pinaces that lie on this side for the guard of the City and Parliament, and being known to be a <hi>Gravesend-boat,</hi> which alwayes land on the other side at <hi>Billinsgate</hi>: they called to them to know their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; But they not regarding their summons still posted away, whereupon the men in the ship made after them and hald them in, examined the Gentleman, and having some suspition searcht him, and found this with some other letters about him; whereupon they presently carried him up to the Parliament, where after examination his letters were taken from him, and he committed to safe custody.</p>
            <p>This letter (as is supposed) was writ by Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Goring.</hi>

            <p>VVHereas certain Letters from forrain parts and severall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdom have been intercepted, and brought unto the Parliament, discovering the desperate designes and plots of Papists and other ill affected, in collecting great sums of money and providing many thousands of men and Arms, for the ruine of our Religion and Kingdom. For the preserving and securing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there is great necessity of a present and speedy supply of money, that the Army may suddenly advance, for preventing of the many outrages that the Cavaleers daily commit in severall places of this Kingdom at once; &amp; in regard the burthen hath hitherto lain upon the willing and well-affected persons; the Lords and Commons as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in Parliament have passed an Ordinance, that all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as hitherto have not contributed, or not proportionable to their estates, upon the Propositions of Parliament, for the safety of the Kingdom, shall be assessed and compelled to contribute and pay according to their ability. And forasmuch as moneys cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by vertue of that Ordinance, to supply the urgent and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing occasions of the Army; It is desired by a Committee of the Lords and Commons, appointed by the Parliament, for advancing of mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
