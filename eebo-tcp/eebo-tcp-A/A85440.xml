            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And beſides, it is the beginning, and a taking poſſeſſion

            <p>That theſe words ſhould aim at this <hi>ſelf-ſame thing,</hi>
cannot be diſcerned, without conſulting the fore-going
part of the Apoſtles diſcourſe: and yet I cannot be
large in bringing down the coherence, having pitch'd
upon what this fifth Verſe contributes unto this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which alone will require more than this time
allotted, having alſo very largely gone through the
Expoſition of the fore-going Verſes elſwhere: and I

            <p>
               <hi>The Coherence in brief thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 16 Verſe of the fore-going Chapter (where
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114820:6"/>
the Well-head of his Diſcourſe is to be found) he
ſhews the extraordinary care God hath of [<hi>Our inward
man</hi>] to <hi>renew it day by day;</hi> where <hi>Inward man</hi> is
ſtrictly the <hi>Soul</hi> with its Graces, ſet in oppoſition unto
<hi>Our outward man</hi> [the Body with its appurtenances]
which he ſaith daily <hi>periſheth,</hi> that is, is in a mouldring
and decaying condition.</p>
            <bibl>Chap. 5. ver. 1.</bibl>
            <q> For we know that if our earthly houſe
of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building
of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.</q>
            <p>In this firſt verſe of this fifth Chapter, he meets
with this ſuppoſition: But what if this outward man
or <hi>earthly tabernacle</hi> be wholly <hi>diſſolved</hi> and pull'd
down, what then ſhall become of this <hi>inner man?</hi> And
he reſolves it thus, <hi>That if it be diſſolved, we have an
houſe, a building of God in the heavens.</hi> And what is
the [WE] but this inner man (he had ſpoken of) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
Souls,</hi> which dwell now in the body as in a <hi>taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi>
as the In-mates that can ſubſiſt without it? And
it is as if he had ſaid, If this inward man be deſtituted
of <hi>one houſe, we have another.</hi> God that in this life
was ſo careful over this <hi>inner man,</hi> to renew it every
day, hath made another more ample proviſion againſt
this great change. It is but it's <hi>removing</hi> from one
<hi>houſe</hi> to a <hi>better,</hi> which God hath built. As your ſelves
(to ſpeak in your own language) if Wars ſhould beſet
you, and your Countrey-houſe were plundred and pull'd
down, you would comfort your ſelves with this, I
have yet a City-houſe to retire unto.</p>
            <p>Neither is the terming the glory of Heaven, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114820:6"/>
that as it is beſtowed upon a ſeparate Soul, alien from
the Scripture-phraſe, <hi>Luke 16. 9. That when you fail, they
may receive you into</hi> EVERLASTING HABITATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS.
Death is a <hi>failing</hi> ('tis your City-phraſe
alſo when a man proves Bankrupt) A Statute of
Bankrupt comes forth then upon your old houſe (<hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum
eſt omnibus ſemel mori</hi>) and upon all you have;
and <hi>then</hi> it is that there is a <hi>receiving</hi> or entertaining
that otherwiſe-deſolate Soul <hi>into everlaſting habitations,</hi>
that is, into <hi>an houſe eternal in the heavens,</hi> as the
Text.</p>
            <p>Nor yet is the phraſe of terming Heaven <hi>A City-houſe,</hi>
remote neither: for <hi>Heb. 11. ver. 13. Abraham
and the Patriarchs died in faith,</hi> (Mark that!) in faith
or expectation of what? He had told us, ver. 10. <hi>He
looked for a City whoſe Builder is God.</hi> What is a <hi>City,</hi>
but an aggregation and <hi>heap of houſes</hi> and Inhabitants?
Multitudes had died afore <hi>Abraham,</hi> and gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
from <hi>Adam, Abel, Seth,</hi> downwards; and God
promiſeth him <hi>peace</hi> at his death, and a being <hi>gathered</hi>
to thoſe <hi>fathers,</hi> Gen. 15. 15. There was then a City
built, and already repleniſh'd with Inhabitants; and
amongſt others, <hi>an houſe</hi> provided for him, that is, his
Soul <hi>built</hi> of God, and ready furniſhed againſt this
removal.</p>
            <bibl>Verſe 2.</bibl>
            <q> For in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be
clothed upon with our houſe which is from heaven.</q>
            <p>In this Verſe he utters the working of the affections
of Chriſtians towards their <hi>being clothed upon with this
houſe;</hi> and ſo in order to this enjoyment of it, their
DESIRING even to be diſſolved: which <hi>Paul</hi> alſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114820:7"/>
utters of himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. Now if the firſt Verſe ſpeaks
of the <hi>glory</hi> of a ſeparate Soul when he calls it an <hi>houſe,</hi>
this ſecond Verſe muſt intend the ſame.</p>
            <bibl>Verſe 3.</bibl>
            <q> If ſo be that being clothed, we ſhall not be
found naked.</q>
            <p>In this Verſe he gives an wholeſome <hi>Caution</hi> by the
way; and withall inſinuates, why he uſed the word
<hi>clothed upon,</hi> in the fore-going Verſe, <hi>thus,</hi> ſpeaking of
the glory of ſuch a ſeparate Soul, even becauſe it is
abſolutely neceſſary that all our Souls be <hi>found clothed</hi>
firſt, and <hi>renewed</hi> with <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and not be

            <q> For we that are in this tabernacle do groan,
being burthened; not for that we would be unclothed,
but clothed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed
up of life.</q>
            <p>The fourth Verſe gives a genuine and ſincere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
why a Chriſtian doth thus groan, and that after
diſſolution it ſelf, in order to this glory; which he ſets
out with an accurate <hi>diſtinction</hi> of <hi>their</hi> deſires of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
in difference from <hi>like</hi> deſires in all <hi>other</hi> men:
Firſt, <hi>Negatively,</hi> not <hi>for that being burthened</hi> we deſire
to be <hi>unclothed,</hi> or diſſolved; that is, ſimply for eaſe of
thoſe <hi>burthens:</hi> nor out of a deſpiſing of our bodies we
now wear (as their Heathen Wiſe-men and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
did, and others do) No. But ſecondly <hi>Poſitively,
For this,</hi> as the top-ground of that deſire, That <hi>we would
be clothed upon</hi> with that <hi>houſe</hi> (ſpoken of Ver. 1. and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114820:7"/>
that ſtill taken in the ſenſe, ſpoken of in the 2. Ver.) to
the end that this <hi>mortal animal life</hi> which the Soul
(though Immortal in it ſelf) now leads in the body,
full of ſins, clogg'd with a <hi>body of death</hi> and miſeries;
(each of which hath a <hi>Death</hi> in it) and ſo it lives but
a <hi>dying life;</hi> that this life may be exchanged, yea,
<hi>ſwalloed up</hi> by that which is <hi>life</hi> indeed, <hi>The onely true
Life, the knowing God as we are known, and enjoying
him:</hi> All which, as to our <hi>Souls,</hi> is <hi>truly</hi> performed
at our Diſſolution; although the final ſwallowing up
the mortality of our bodies alſo, doth yet remain to
be accompliſh'd: which will be done at the latter day,
at that Change both of Body and Soul, though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Body it will be completed as then more
<hi>fully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Interpretation, and the ſuiting of all the phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

as a clue of thred drawn through the windings of the
former verſes to ſhew us, that one and the ſame Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall
Glory hath been carried on all along, and ſtill
is in this verſe alſo. So then we ſee where we are.</p>
            <p>What this <hi>ſelf-ſame thing</hi> ſhould be, ask the firſt
verſe and it will tell you, it is <hi>That houſe eternall in the
Heavens, a building of God,</hi> prepared by him againſt
the time that this earthly houſe is diſſolved. Ask the
ſecond verſe, it is <hi>the ſame houſe we grone to be clothed

fourth verſe, and more plainly: It is <hi>that life,</hi> which
ſucceeds this mortall life the ſoul now lives in this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and ſwallows up all the infirmities thereof. And
then here it followes, <hi>Even for this ſelf-ſame thing,</hi> &amp;c.
So then, if the glory of the ſeparate ſoul be the ſubject
of any of theſe verſes, then of all, and ſo of this verſe
alſo.</p>
            <p>And to be ſure it cannot be that extraordinary way
of entrance into Glory, by ſuch a ſudden change, both
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114820:8"/>
of ſoul and body into glory, at once, without diſſolution
ſhould be the <hi>ſelf-ſame thing</hi> here aimed at. For it was
not the lot of any of thoſe <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> (of whom
the Holy Ghoſt here ſpeaks this) [<hi>He hath wrought us
for this thing</hi>] that they ſhould be in that manner chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and ſo enter into glory: but the contrary. For
they all, and all Saints ſince for theſe 1600 years, have
<hi>put off their Tebernacles</hi> by death, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and ſpeaks
of himſelf, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. and therefore the Scripture (or
Holy Ghoſt) foreſeeing, as the phraſe is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. this
change would be their fate, would not have uttered
this of them, [<hi>God hath wrought us for this</hi>] whom he
knew God had not deſigned thereunto.</p>
            <p>Neither is it that thoſe groaning deſires ſpoken of in
the foregoing verſes, 2, 3, 4. is [<hi>that ſelf-ſame thing</hi>]
here (as ſome would) for indeed as <hi>Muſculus</hi> well: If
the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>He that hath wrought this thing in
us,</hi> &amp;c. That expreſſion might have carried it to ſuch
a ſenſe: But he ſaith, <hi>He that wrought us for the ſelf-ſame
thing:</hi> And ſo 'tis not that deſire of glory <hi>in us</hi>
is ſpoken of: But <hi>us, our ſelves and ſouls as wrought for
that glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be asked, what is the ſpecial proper ſcope of
theſe words, as touching this glory of the Soul? The
anſwer in generall, It is to give the <hi>Rationall</hi> part of this

That indeed God hath thus ordained and prepared

elſe is the end of all the workings of Grace in you, and

               <p>We Preachers have it in uſe, as to alledge proofs of
Scripture for the points or ſubjects we handle: So to
give <hi>Reaſons</hi> or <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of them. And ſo doth
our Apoſtle here of this great point he had been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

For inſtance; In giving an account, why God in <hi>bringing

1 <hi>Cor. 15. 21. Since by man came death, by man came alſo
the reſurrection of the dead;</hi> that is, it was <hi>congruous,</hi>
harmonious, it ſhould thus be; the one anſwering
correſpondently to the other. The like congruity will be
found couched here, in <hi>Gods bringing ſouls to glory, afore
that reſurrection.</hi>

               <p>Now there are two ſorts of harmonious Reaſons
couched in the fore-part of theſe words, <hi>He that wrought

               <p>I. That it is <hi>Finis operis &amp; operntis,</hi> The End of

<hi>this thing, is GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a third point to be ſuperadded; and that is,

               <p>Ere the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this will appear, I muſt firſt open

               <p>Firſt, that the <hi>Thing</hi> here ſaid to be <hi>wrought,</hi> is Grace
or <hi>Holineſs;</hi> which is a <hi>preparation</hi> unto <hi>Glory.</hi> (1.) <hi>Grace</hi>
is <hi>the Work.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. termed, <hi>The good
Work.</hi> A frame of Spirit, <hi>created to good Works:</hi> Eph.
2. 10. <hi>We are his Workmanſhip, created unto good Works.</hi>
The Text here ſayes, <hi>Who hath wrought us:</hi> There ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarly,
<hi>We are his WORKMANSHIP.</hi> And (2.) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
this <hi>Work</hi> is a <hi>preparation to Glory.</hi> For, for one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114820:10"/>
thing to be firſt wrought in order to another, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
thereunto. Now ſaith the Text, <hi>He hath
wrought us for this thing;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. it is <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,
The veſſels of Mercy, which he had AFORE PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PARED
TO GLORY;</hi> which was by working Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
for it follows, ver. 24. <hi>Even us whom he hath
called.</hi> Likewiſe. <hi>Col. 1. 12. Who hath MADE us

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond, what is the <hi>principal Subject wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or prepared and made meet for Glory: 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>the Soul,</hi> in analogie to the phraſe here. We uſe
to ſay (when we ſpeak of our Converſion) <hi>Since my ſoul
was wrought on.</hi> And though the <hi>Body</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi>
1 Theſſ. 5. 23. yet the immediate ſubject is the
Soul; and that primitively, originally: the Body by
derivation from the Soul. And hence it is, the Soul
(when a man dies) carries with it all the Grace by <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency:
All fleſh is graſs which withers;</hi> that is, the Body
with all the appurtenances, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. c. 1. v. 24.
But you, having <hi>purified your Souls, being born again of
incorruptible ſeed</hi> (our Bodies are made of <hi>corruptible
ſeed,</hi> which is the oppoſition there) <hi>by the Word of God,
which lives and abides for ever: And this is the Word</hi>
(he ſayes he means) <hi>which by the Goſpel is preached</hi> (eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day) <hi>unto you,</hi> ver. 25. and by preaching is engrafted
in your Souls, <hi>purifying [your Souls</hi>] ver. 22. In no
other ſubject doth that Word (as preached) for ever
abide. For the <hi>Body</hi> rots, and in the grave hath not
an inherent, but a <hi>relative</hi> Holineſs, (ſuch as the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Brethren would have to be in Churches conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114820:10"/>
by them) becauſe once it was <hi>the Temple of the
Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who dwells in us.</p>
               <p>And that it is the Soul the Apoſtle hath here in his
eye, in this diſcourſe of his in my Text, as that which
he intends the Subject here wrought upon, appears, if
we conſult the Well-head of his diſcourſe about the
Soul, which is the 16 ver. of the 4 Chap. <hi>Our inward
man</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is renewed, &amp;c.</hi> (there is your <hi>wrought
upon</hi> here) <hi>whilſt the outward</hi> (the Body) <hi>periſheth.</hi> Which
Soul, in being call'd <hi>the inward man,</hi> connotates at once
both Grace and the Soul conjuct together, and diſtinct
from the Body, as well as from Sin and Corruption.
Elſwhere it is declared the ſubject firſt and originally
wrought on, <hi>Eph. 4. 23. Be renewed [in the Spirit of
your mindes.</hi>] Look round about the Text, and what
is the [<hi>US</hi>] wrought on? plainly this <hi>Inward man,</hi> by
the Coherence afore and after. Ask ver. 1. <hi>If our
earthly tabernacle</hi> (that is, our Body) <hi>be diſſolved, WE
have, &amp;c.</hi> that is, This inner man, our Souls, have;
for the Body is ſuppoſed diſſolved. So likewiſe,
ver. 4. [<hi>WE] in this tabernacle,</hi> that is, our Souls in
theſe Bodies. More expreſly after, ver. 8. our very
Souls not onely whilſt in our Bodies but when ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from our Bodies, have the [<hi>WE</hi>] given them;
<hi>We are willing to be abſent from the body, and preſent
with the Lord.</hi> The <hi>We</hi> preſent with the Lord, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from the Body, is nor can be no other than a
ſeparate Soul in its eſtate of widowhood. And ſo
here, ver. 5. Hath wrought <hi>US:</hi> The Soul bears
the <hi>Perſon,</hi> carries away the Grace with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Add to this, the <hi>Time</hi> here ſpecified in the Text,
in which we are wrought upon: It is but this <hi>life,</hi>
and during the term thereof. <hi>Hath wrought us,</hi> ſayes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114820:11"/>
the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">Obſerva quòd non in futuro dicit, <hi>Parabir nos.</hi> Non demum <hi>parabitur;</hi> ubi jam induendum eſt, &amp;c. <hi>Muſc. in lucum.</hi>

it: That [hath wrought] referring to the work of
Converſion at the firſt, <hi>Who [HATH MADE] us meet

ſtill to work us; the <hi>Preterperfect</hi> being often put by
the Apoſtle for the <hi>Preſent, God renewing the inner man
DAY BY DAY,</hi> Chap. 4. 16. So working upon it, in
order to this ſelf-ſame thing, continually. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which words there, theſe here have an evident
aſpect; yet ſo, as that time of working is but during
this life: For it is whilſt the outward man is mouldring,
and that <hi>by afflictions, which during this moment work an
eternal weight of glory,</hi> ver. 17. and that is expreſly ſaid
to be <hi>but this preſent time,</hi> Rom. 8. So then, there is
<hi>NO PARABIT</hi> in that other world: But as <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſayes of man, There is <hi>no work</hi> after this life; <hi>No re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi>

this is a meet and congruous ordination of God, the
Scripture it ſelf owns, and ſeems ſo to pitch the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it, in <hi>Rom. 8. 10, 11. And if Chriſt be in you the
body is dead, becauſe of ſin: but the Spirit is life, becauſe
of righteouſneſse. But if the ſpirit of him that raiſed
us Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up
Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies
by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> He gives an account of
what is to become hereafter both of the <hi>bodies</hi> and
<hi>ſouls</hi> of them in whom Chriſt is. (1.) Firſt, for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that is condemned to die, <hi>The body is dead becauſe of
ſin.</hi> By <hi>Body</hi> I underſtand the ſame which he in the
11. verſe termes <hi>the mortall body to be raiſed up,</hi> which
(ſayes he) <hi>is dead,</hi> that is, appointed to die, as one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to death you term a <hi>dead man.</hi> And this [<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſinne.</hi>] It was meet that that firſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>dying</hi> ſhould have ſome effect to evidence the
<hi>truth</hi> of God therein. Onely God is favourable in his
ordination in this, that he arreſteth but the Body, the
<hi>leſſe principall debtor.</hi> But <hi>that</hi> (to be ſure) ſhall pay
for it: <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die,</hi> even for
men that are in Chriſt, as this place of the <hi>Romans</hi>
hath it. Then (2.) followes, what remains the ſoul
of ſuch an one when the body dyes. [<hi>But</hi>] ſayes he,
(ſpeaking by way of exception, and contrary fate too)
<hi>The Spirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſſe.</hi> The Spirit is
the Soul in contradiſtinction to the Body. <hi>This,</hi> when the
body dies, is [<hi>Life</hi>] He ſayes not <hi>living</hi> onely, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;

<hi>becauſe of righteouſneſſe,</hi> which is Chriſts image; and ſo
preſerves, and by Gods ordination upon dying, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114820:12"/>
of it, (which is the point in hand.) <hi>For this thing</hi> it
is, God hath <hi>wrought it.</hi> But then becauſe the Quaerie
would be, Shall this body for ever remain <hi>dead, becauſe
of</hi> (this firſt) <hi>ſin,</hi> and bear this puniſhment for ever?
No: Therefore (3.) he addes, <hi>He that raiſed up Chriſt
from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies.</hi> So at
laſt, and then bringing both body and ſoul together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
compleat glory.</p>
                  <p>And the congruity of reaſon that is for this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is obſervable, ſomething like to that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
<hi>As by man came death, ſo by man came alſo the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the dead.</hi> For that ſin that condemned us to
this death, we had from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>bodily gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>

the <hi>generation of our bodies.</hi> The <hi>Body</hi> therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly
payes for this, and the death thereof is a <hi>means</hi>
to let ſin out of the world, as the propagating it was a
means to bring ſin in: but an holy <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>ſpirit</hi> which
is the Off-ſpring of God, having now <hi>true holineſse</hi> and
<hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> from the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> communicated to
it, and abiding in it; and being not onely the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

                  <p>I come (2.) to the <hi>Argumentation</hi> it ſelf, which
ariſeth out of theſe things laid together. (1.) That
the Soul is <hi>the immediate Subject</hi> of Grace. (2.) The

is alone and immediately <hi>capable of Glory,</hi> which Grace

<hi>hath wrought</hi> all of Grace he intends to work, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to Glory. Out of all theſe a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth ariſe, That ſuch a Soul upon death ſhall be
admitted unto Glory; and not be put to ſtay till the
time of the Reſurrection, when both Soul and Body
ſhall be joyned again together. And that this holdeth
a juſt and meet <hi>conveniency</hi> upon <hi>each,</hi> or at leaſt, <hi>all</hi>

this working and preparation for Glory. Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of this Grace wrought in this Soul, depends not
upon its conjunction with the Body; but ſo as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
as an everlaſting and perpetual conſerver of that
Grace ſtampt on it; yea, and carries it all with it
ſelf, as a rich Treaſure innate unto it where-ever it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114820:13"/>
goes, when ſeparate from the Body. I ſay, it either
hath <hi>in it,</hi> or <hi>appertaining unto it,</hi> all that hath been
wrought for it, either <hi>in it,</hi> or <hi>by it.</hi> Revel. 14. 13.
<hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord: [And their

it ſhould partake the benefit thereof, and live upon
them now when it is ſingle and alone, and in its wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows

by a Glory given it for that holineſs, this ſhould now
appear, That it was the Soul which was the ſole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick

of Holineſs, from which it is derivatively in the body.
Meet it was this Soul ſhould not be deferred till the

it ſelf firſt poſſeſſion given of that inheritance, the

And (3.) it being in it ſelf, when ſeparate, as <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
capable</hi> of <hi>this Glory,</hi> as when it ſhall be again
<hi>united</hi> to the Body: For what is the Eſſential of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of that <hi>Life</hi> that ſwallows up all?
But (as we ſaid on ver 4.) Gods immediate <hi>Preſence,</hi>
and our <hi>knowing him face to face, as we are known.</hi>
Now of this the Apoſtle doth in theſe 6, 7 and 8 ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
expreſly inform us, That the ſeparate Soul is not
onely capable thereof, but that it then begins to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it: <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>we are alwayes confident,
knowing that whilst we are in the body, we are abſent from
the Lord; (For we walk by faith, not by ſight.) We are
confident, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the
body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Where to be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>live by ſight,</hi> is expreſly made
the priviledge of a Soul <hi>abſent from the body;</hi> which
can mean no other ſtate, than that of the Soul between
the death of the Body, and the Reſurrection. For
whilſt it is <hi>preſent</hi> in the <hi>body</hi> afore death, <hi>it is abſent from
the Lord;</hi> and when it ſhall be <hi>preſent with the Lord,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Reſurrection, it ſhall not then be any more <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from the body.</hi> This conjunction therefore of <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from the body,</hi> and <hi>preſent with the Lord,</hi> falls out in
no ſtate elſe, but onely in that interim or ſpace of time
between. And let us withall view this Place in the
light, (by bringing the one to the other) which that
paſſage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. doth caſt upon it: <hi>For now we
ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face; now
I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as alſo I am
known. [To ſee as in a glaſs darkly</hi>] there, is to [<hi>walk
by faith</hi>] here: But to <hi>ſee face to face,</hi> and <hi>to know
God as we are known,</hi> (ſo there) is all one; and to attain
<hi>to ſight,</hi> and to be in <hi>Chriſts preſence</hi> (here.) And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114820:14"/>
to be ſure, the Body is in no eſtate whatever capable
of <hi>knowing God, as we are known of him:</hi> None durſt
ever ever affirm that. For beſides that, the Spiritual
Knowledge of God is proper to an Intellectual nature:
Further, <hi>So to know God, as God known us,</hi> and ſo to be
elevated to the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of <hi>Gods underſtanding,</hi> is not
communicable to the Body. We may as well dare to
affirm God himſelf to be a <hi>Body,</hi> as that our bodies are
capable of ever being raiſed up <hi>thus to know God.</hi>
Hence therefore, whether the Soul be <hi>out of the body,</hi>
as after Death, or ſo <hi>in the body,</hi> as it <hi>ſhall</hi> be after the
Reſurrection; yet ſtill it is the <hi>Soul</hi> that is immediately
alone capable of that <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>knowledge of God.</hi> And
therefore ſeeing it depends not on the body, it is as
well capable of it <hi>afore the Reſurrection</hi> without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as after the Reſurrection <hi>in the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Onely this muſt be added, That whilſt indeed the
Soul is at <hi>home in this body,</hi> (this earthly tabernacle) it
is not capable of this ſight, of the Glory of God, that
is, ſo as to continue in the body, and enjoy it; for it
would crack this earthen veſſel: as 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 50. Fleſh
and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Paul,</hi> as a <hi>ſtander-by,</hi> was an <hi>over-hearer,</hi> and an
<hi>eye-witneſs</hi> (by way of Revelation and Viſion) of
what the Spirits of juſt men in Glory do enjoy:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> Even
as on the contrary, the Angels are often <hi>ſtanders-by</hi> on
Earth, and <hi>overſeers</hi> of us, what is therein done, (as the
phraſe is, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 7.) yet he was not eſtated into it, or
admitted a poſſeſſor thereof himſelf, no more than
Angels into an earthly eſtate; and therefore could not
ſay, whether the Revelation vouchſafed him, might
not be <hi>in the body,</hi> as well as <hi>out of it:</hi> Whereas God
had otherwiſe long ſince peremptorily determined that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114820:14"/>
queſtion, <hi>That no man could ſee God, and live;</hi> that is,
at once continue in <hi>this body,</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> him <hi>face to face.</hi>
And <hi>Paul</hi> here in my Text alſo determines it, That
<hi>whilſt we are at home in the body,</hi> (as now) <hi>we are abſent
from the Lord:</hi> They are two incompatible eſtates. But
ſtill when <hi>that which,</hi> thus, <hi>lets</hi> (this body) <hi>is taken out of
the way,</hi> the Soul it ſelf is ſufficiently capable, as
truly as ever it ſhall be.</p>

                  <p>But if this Argument from theſe be yet judged not
home enough, but ſhort; Then let us in the fourth
place added what force the third <hi>Premiſe</hi> will give to it,
concerning the <hi>Time</hi> of Gods working on us, to drive
all cloſer home; namely, That God <hi>hath wrought</hi> upon
the Soul <hi>in this life, all that he ever means to work,</hi> by
way of preparation for Glory. <hi>For this thing God [hath
wrought us</hi>] which though it might with the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Sub-arguments that now ſhall follow, be
made an Argument alone; yet I chooſe to caſt it into
this total, to make the whole the more ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (4.) gather up the Demonſtrations thus:
If the <hi>Soul</hi> be the <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>firſt</hi> ſubject of Grace,
which is a preparation to Glory, and <hi>capable</hi> of this
Glory, when out of the body; <hi>And God, the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or Worker, hath wrought all that ever he means to work
in it,</hi> this way, by way of preparation to Glory: Then,
as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid in the caſe of admitting the Gentiles to
Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Acts 10. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>What ſhould hinder</hi> that theſe Souls ſhould
not be <hi>glorified,</hi> inſtantly, when out of their bodies?
If indeed, as the Papiſts, and corrupted Jews and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
have feigned, there were any work to be after
wrought, a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or the like; Then a <hi>Demurre</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:114820:15"/>
or <hi>Caveat</hi> might be yet put in, to ſuſpend this their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into glory: But the contrary being the truth,
then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the ſtrength of the <hi>Argument</hi> from
this latter, ſuperadded to the reſt, ſtands upon two
ſtrong Grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if we conſider what is <hi>common</hi> to God in this
with all other, but <hi>ordinary wiſe Efficients</hi> or Workers,
that are intent upon their Ends, which muſt be given
to him, the onely <hi>Wiſe, All-powerful God,</hi> (who is here
ſaid, as <hi>an Efficient,</hi> to <hi>work</hi> us <hi>for this</hi> End.) When
any ordinary Efficient hath brought his Work to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
and done as much to ſuch or ſuch an End as he
means to do, he delays not to accompliſh his End, and
bring it to execution; unleſs ſome over-powring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
do lie in his way to it. If you have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long and great Coſt upon any of your Children, to
fit and prepare them for any Imployment; <hi>The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi>
ſuppoſe, or other Calling; Do you then let
theſe your Children lie <hi>Truants, idle,</hi> and <hi>aſleep at home,</hi>
and not put them forth to that which you at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<hi>that</hi> their <hi>Education</hi> unto? Will you ſuffer them
(in this caſe) to loſe their time, <hi>Do you know how to
do good to your Children?</hi> and doth not God? We ſee
God doth thus in <hi>nature.</hi> We ſay, when the <hi>Matter</hi>
is as <hi>fully prepared</hi> as ever it ſhall be, that <hi>the form en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
without delay:</hi> Now Grace is expreſly termed a
<hi>preparation to</hi> Glory. Alſo God doth obſerve this in
working of <hi>Grace</hi> it ſelf, when the Soul is as fully
humbled and emptied, and thereby <hi>prepared for the
Lord,</hi> by <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Miniſtry, as he means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it; the <hi>Work</hi> of juſtifying <hi>Faith</hi> preſently follows.
In all his Diſpenſations of <hi>Judgements</hi> or <hi>Mercies,</hi> he
obſerves the ſame. When mens <hi>ſins are</hi> at <hi>full</hi> (as of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114820:15"/>
the <hi>Amorites</hi>) he ſtays not a moment to <hi>execute Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
So in anſwering the <hi>Faith</hi> of his People waiting
on him for <hi>Mercies.</hi> And <hi>thus</hi> it is for <hi>Glory; I have
glorified thee on earth,</hi> (the onely place and condition of
our glorifying God) <hi>I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt
me to do: And now</hi> (what now, and preſently now
remained there, follows) <hi>glorifie me, &amp;c.</hi> Thus ſpake
Chriſt our Pattern.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is <hi>this</hi> further falls out, in this <hi>Caſe</hi>
and <hi>Condition,</hi> of ſuch a Soul, as doth indeed call for
this out of a kinde of <hi>neceſsity,</hi> and not of <hi>congruity</hi>
onely. For whereas by Gods Ordination there are
<hi>two wayes</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with him, and <hi>but two,</hi> unto all
Eternity; either that of <hi>Faith,</hi> which we have at <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi>
and of <hi>Sight,</hi> which is for <hi>hereafter.</hi> Into theſe
<hi>two,</hi> the Apoſtle reſolves all Gods Diſpenſations to us,
ver. 7. of this Chapter, <hi>We walk by faith,</hi> (namely, in
this life) <hi>not by ſight.</hi> And again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. [<hi>Now]
we ſee in a glaſs, [Then] face to face.</hi> Theſe two
[<hi>Now</hi>] and [<hi>Then</hi>] do divide the Diſpenſations for
Eternity of time to come. The like in <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt.
1. 8. <hi>In whom though [Now] you ſee him not,</hi> (as you one
day ſhall) <hi>yet believing:</hi> If therefore when the Soul goes
out of the Body, <hi>that way</hi> of communion with God
by <hi>Faith utterly ceaſeth</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 8, 13.</note>, that door and paſſage will
be quite ſhut up; God having<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 11 John 6. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>fulfilled all the work
of faith (The work of God) with power,</hi> that ever <hi>he</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth:
Then ſurely <hi>Sight</hi> muſt ſucceed according
to Gods Ordination, or otherwiſe this would inevitably
follow, That the Soul would be for that interim, until
the Reſurrection, cut off from all communion with
God, whatever; having yet all its acquired holineſs of
Sanctification abiding in it, and Righteouſneſs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114820:16"/>
of it all that while. Look therefore as a <hi>Childe</hi>
hath <hi>two,</hi> and but two <hi>wayes</hi> of <hi>living,</hi> and when the
<hi>one ceaſeth,</hi> the <hi>other ſucceeds,</hi> or Death would follow:
In the <hi>Womb</hi> it <hi>lives</hi> by <hi>nouriſhment</hi> from the <hi>Navel,</hi>
without ſo much as <hi>breathing</hi> at the mouth: but it no
ſooner comes into the world, but that former means is
cut off, and it liveth <hi>by breath,</hi> and taking in nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the mouth, or it muſt inſtantly die. So ſtands
the <hi>caſe</hi> with the <hi>Soul</hi> here between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sight:</hi>
So that we muſt either affirm, That the Soul dies to
all ſpiritual actings and communion with God until the
Reſurrection, which thoſe Scriptures ſo much do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict,<note place="margin">John 9. 51.</note>
                     <hi>He that believeth hath eternal life, &amp;c. and ſhall
never</hi> (no not for a moment) <hi>die;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 11. 26.</note> (and in thoſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
it is not ſimply a ſluggiſh Immortality, but to live,
and act, and enjoy God (which is our life) muſt needs
be meant:) Or we muſt on the other ſide affirm, That
the life of <hi>Faith</hi> ceaſing, and God yet having that
way wrought all that ever he intendeth, That <hi>then, Sight
of God</hi> face to face muſt come in its place: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Apoſtle in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. affirms in ſaying,
ver. 10. <hi>When that which is perfect is come, then that
which is but in part is done away.</hi> There is not an utter
ceaſing of the imperfect, and then an interval or long
ſpace of time to come between; and <hi>then,</hi> that which
is perfect is to come: but the <hi>imperfect</hi> is done away
by <hi>the very coming</hi> of that which is thus perfect. And
in the 12th Verſe he explains himſelf, That the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is this our <hi>ſeeing [Now] in a glaſs darkly,</hi> that is,
by <hi>Faith;</hi> and that perfect, to be that <hi>ſeeing God face
to face,</hi> as that which preſently entertains us in that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world. Nay, the Apoſtle admits not ſo much as
a <hi>moment</hi> of ceſſation, but ſayes, That <hi>the imperfect is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114820:16"/>
done away,</hi> (v. 10.) and <hi>vaniſheth,</hi> (as v. 8.) by the <hi>coming
in of the perfect</hi> upon it: and ſo the imperfect, namely,
[<hi>Faith</hi>] is <hi>ſwallowed up</hi> of the <hi>perfect,</hi> namely, [<hi>Sight.</hi>]
Now if we thus grant (as we muſt) this <hi>ſeparate Soul</hi> to
have this <hi>ſight,</hi> or nothing now left it, to enjoy God any
way by; Then it is no other than <hi>Glory,</hi> it is admitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
For, the <hi>ſight of God face to face, and to know as we
are known,</hi> is the very eſſence of Glory, as it differs from
<hi>Faith.</hi> Neither indeed is <hi>that ultimate Enjoyment,</hi> or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
in God, which <hi>Souls</hi> ſhall have after the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
any other (in Name or Thing) than <hi>the ſight of God,</hi>
as it is thus diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Faith;</hi> and therefore the
ſoul is <hi>now</hi> admitted to the ſame enjoyment it ſhall be
<hi>Then</hi> for <hi>Kind,</hi> although it ſhall be then raiſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto far higher degrees of Perfection.</p>

                  <p>And for a Concluſion of this firſt Point, that which
follows in that place lately cited out of 1 <hi>Pet. 1. v. 9. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the end of your faith, the ſalvation of your ſouls,</hi>
may as fitly ſerve for the confirmation of <hi>all theſe latter</hi>
fore-going Notions, as to any other ſenſe Interpreters
have affixed.</p>
                  <p>I am aware how theſe words, <hi>Receiving the end of
your faith, the ſalvation of your ſouls,</hi> are interpreted of
that <hi>joy unſpeakable, and full of glory,</hi> which the Verſe
afore had ſpoken of, <hi>In whom though, Now, ye ſee him
not, yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full
of glory,</hi> ſo as, in thoſe <hi>joyes</hi> vouchſafed the Saints are
ſaid to receive the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of their ſouls, as being the
<hi>earneſt</hi> of it in the ſame kind, and ſo a part of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
of Faith received in <hi>hand</hi> (as we ſay) and vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
over and above the ordinary way of <hi>living</hi> by
Faith. This Interpretation I no way gainſay, nor will
go about to exclude: for I know it doth conſiſt with

that other I am about to give, and is ſubordinate to it:
But if this Senſe ſhould obtain, that it were, <hi>Directly,</hi>
Alone intended, yet by <hi>conſequence,</hi> and at the rebound,
it doth ſtrongly argue the point in Hand. For if whileſt
<hi>Faith continues,</hi> God is pleaſed to vouchſafe ſuch joyes,
much more when <hi>faith ceaſeth,</hi> He will vouchſafe a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Enjoyment: for why elſe are theſe <hi>preſent</hi> joyes
termed <hi>Salvation?</hi> That is, in a ſort <hi>part</hi> of the taking
<hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of Salvation aforehand, and that as diſtinct
from the <hi>Right</hi> to Salvation, which Faith in ordinary
gives without ſuch joyes at all times to all believers:
they have the <hi>name</hi> given them, as being an earneſt of
the ſame kind, of that greater ſumme. And again, why
are theſe preſent joyes termed the <hi>Salvation</hi> of their
SOULS? But becauſe <hi>they</hi> are intended by God, (being
alſo, <hi>now</hi> wrought immediately in the Soul, without
the body's influence) to be an earneſt that it is their
Souls, when <hi>without</hi> their <hi>bodies,</hi> ſhall have that fuller
poſſeſſion given them; and ſo this earneſt aſſigneth this
payment to be made to this <hi>Legatee,</hi> the SOUL ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the firſt <hi>receiver</hi> of it. [2.] Every payment having
<hi>a day,</hi> or <hi>ſet time</hi> appointed for it, which the earneſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
the <hi>trustee</hi> unto, as well as to make payment it
ſelf, and uſeth to be at the end of the performance on
his part to whom the contract is made, this therefore is
as elegantly deſigned to be <hi>the end of their faith;</hi> there's
the day of payment. And [3.] it would be hard to
think that God ſhould give forth joyes whileſt <hi>faith
continues;</hi> and then for ſo long a time as till the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
withdraw all communication of himſelf, both of
<hi>faith</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> (through ſight) alſo. Surely they are not
left worſe than in this life they were.</p>
                  <p>I alſo know, the <hi>Soul</hi> being the eminent part of man,
is often in Scripture, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> put for the <hi>whole</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:114820:17"/>
And I muſt not deny but that ultimately it is intended
here, it extending it ſelf to the whole of <hi>Salvation</hi>
firſt, and laſt after Faith ended. Which ſenſe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand many interpreters are for.</p>
                  <p>I onely contend for this, That the <hi>ſalvation of the
ſoul</hi> is intended alſo of that Salvation which falls out in
the midſt between theſe joyes (<hi>the earneſt</hi>) in this life,
and that ultimate Salvation at the Reſurrection, that is
the Salvation of the Soul, whileſt ſeparate, as being
the next. It hath a weight in it that <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
ſhould ſo often be ſaid to be of the <hi>ſoul</hi> by Chriſt
himſelf, as <hi>Mat. 26. 16. What ſhall it profit a man to gain
the whole word</hi> (and ſo provide for his body) <hi>and loſe his
own ſoul?</hi> And again, in ſpeaking of the Soul as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
apart from the Body, <hi>Mat. 10. 28. Fear not them
that are able to kill but the body, and are not able to kill
the ſoul.</hi> But that which is more conjunct to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
it is obſervable, that this our Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>
ſhould chooſe to uſe in this Epiſtle, more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apoſtle, this phraſe of [<hi>Soul</hi>] in relation to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
either as being the <hi>eminent</hi> ſubject, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as the <hi>ſingle</hi> ſubject both of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
So in this Chapter, <hi>You have purified your ſouls,</hi> &amp;c.
as the immediate ſuſceptive of the <hi>incorruptible ſeed</hi> (as
was obſerved.) Then again, in ch. 2. 11. <hi>Abſtain from
fleſhly luſts which war [against the ſoul</hi>] and 8. 25. <hi>Ye are
returned to the Biſhop of your Souls.</hi> Which he ſpeaks as
being the eminent part, and (upon ſeparation from the
body) the ſpeciall charge he hath paſtorall care of.
And more directly to our purpoſe, ch. 4. laſt v. he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
them when they come to die, <hi>to commit their
ſouls to God,</hi> as then being to be ſeparate from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Now it were hard to think that this Salvation to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114820:18"/>
come ſhould bear the title and name of the <hi>ſalvation of
the ſoul</hi> in this and other Scriptures;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. v. laſt.</note> and that yet when
this Soul ſhall in the other world come to ſubſiſt for a
long time ſingle and alone,<note place="margin">Jam. 5. v. laſt.</note> and then be properly and
without figure: A <hi>meer ſoul</hi> without a body, a <hi>lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſoul:</hi> That during that ſtate it ſhould not be the
ſubject of this Salvation, and ſo intended here, when
more properly and literally, if ever, it is <hi>the ſalvation of
the ſoul.</hi> And it would be yet more ſtrange, that the
phraſe, <hi>ſalvation of the ſoul,</hi> ſhould be wholly reſtrained
unto that eſtate of the ſoul, when remitted to the body
at the Reſurrection, and <hi>onely unto that;</hi> And that word
the <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould ſerve onely ſynecdochically as a part put
to ſignifie the whole man, as then it is to be raiſed up:
but eſpecially, it were ſtrangeſt of all, if it ſhould be
confined and limited in this place of <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein
this <hi>ſalvation of the ſoul</hi> is ſet forth for the comfort of
ſuch as were to lay down their <hi>tabernacles</hi> of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<hi>for Chriſt</hi> (as this <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf in the
next Epiſtle) and whoſe faith was then to ceaſe with
their lives, whoſe expectations therefore he would in
this caſe certainly pitch upon that ſalvation of the ſoul
which was next, which is this of the <hi>ſoul ſeparate.</hi> To
confirm all which,</p>
                  <p>That which further invited me to this place, was this
phraſe [<hi>The end of your Faith</hi>] eſpecially upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
that he ſpeaks it unto, <hi>ſuch Chriſtians,</hi> who in
thoſe times were (as he foretels, ch. 4. v. 4.) ſhortly to be
martyred, and at preſent were ſorely <hi>tried</hi> (v. 7. of this
Chapter) and in the laſt verſe of the fourth, he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
inſtructeth and exhorteth them to <hi>commit their ſouls</hi>
(when they come to die) <hi>to be kept by God:</hi> And ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in a proper and literall ſenſe, <hi>this ſalvation of their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114820:18"/>
ſouls</hi> is in all reſpects termed <hi>The end of their Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that it is the next and immediate event that
Faith ends and determines in, as Death is ſaid to be the
<hi>end of life.</hi> So noting forth, that when Faith ends, this
Salvation of the Soul begins and ſucceeds it. <hi>The end</hi>
of a thing ſignifies the immediate event, iſſue, period
thereof. As of wicked men it is ſaid, <hi>whoſe end is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Phil.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. laſt v. Apoſtaſy &amp; unbelief are
ſaid to be a <hi>drawing back unto perdition.</hi> And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
there Faith is termed a <hi>believing to the ſalvation of
the ſoul:</hi> And both note out the finall event and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of each, and <hi>ſalvation of the ſoul to be the end of
faith,</hi> when men continue and go on to believe, untill
their faith arriveth at, &amp; attaineth this Salvation of the
Soul. To this ſenſe alſo, <hi>Rom. 6. 22. You have your fruit
in holineſse,</hi> and the [<hi>end] everlaſting life.</hi> And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Peter</hi> having in the foregoing verſes celebrated
the fruits and workings of their faith in this life, as in
ſupporting them gloriouſly under the ſoreſt trials, v. 7.
and then ſometimes filling their hearts with <hi>joy unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
and glorious,</hi> v. 8. he here at laſt concludeth with
<hi>what</hi> will be the <hi>end</hi> or <hi>iſſue</hi> of it in that other life, when
faith it ſelf ſhall ceaſe; and what it is that then they
ſhall receive, <hi>Receiving</hi> (after all this) <hi>the end of your

ſhall end, you may be ſure on't, even of that Salvation
(that great <hi>Salvation</hi> ſo ſpoken of by the Prophets, v.
10.) of your ſouls, which as it hath <hi>no end</hi> to be put
unto it, as Faith hath: ſo no interruption or ſpace of time
to come between (during which your ſouls ſhould not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114820:19"/>
be actually ſaved) A ſalvation of your ſouls ſingly
(whileſt through death they ſhall ſo exiſt) as well as of
the ſame ſouls <hi>primarily,</hi> and more eminently, when
both ſoul and body ſhall be reunited.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>end</hi> of <hi>your</hi> Faith, that is, of your aims and
expectations in your Faith: the end importing the
aim or expectation, which is alſo a proper and literall
ſenſe of that word. And upon this account alſo <hi>the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the ſoul,</hi> when they ſhould die, that being the
very next thing their eyes muſt needs be upon, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here intended.</p>
                  <p>And 3. <hi>The end of your faith,</hi> that is, as being that for
which the great God (who <hi>keeps us by his power through
faith unto ſalvation,</hi> v. 5.) <hi>hath wrought</hi> this faith in you.
Accordingly we find it termed <hi>the work of faith, 1 Theſ.</hi>
1. 3. Which when God hath fully wrought, and brought
to that degree he aimed at in this life; (or to uſe the
Apoſtles own expreſſion of it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11. when God
hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> the work of faith with power, he then
<hi>crowneth</hi> it with this Salvation of the Soul without end.
As <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Patience,</hi> when it hath had its perfect
work, ch. 1. 4. compared with v. 12. and ſo ſpeaks my
Text, for <hi>this ſelf-ſame thing he hath wrought us.</hi> And
therefore when this Faith ſhall ceaſe which he wrought
for this, he will attain his end without delay: &amp; you (ſays
he) ſhall attain your end alſo: and Faith thus ceaſing

                  <p>That nothing may be wanting in this laſt place cited,
to make up all the particulars in the fore-going Sections
inſiſted on: So it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plainly inſinuate, That this <hi>ſalvation</hi> (here) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in the <hi>ſight and viſion</hi> of Chriſt (which was one
particular afore-mentioned) accompanied with <hi>joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable,
and glorious.</hi> The Coherence (if obſerved)
makes this forth clearly: For whereas in the Verſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
fore-going, he had commended their preſent
ſtate of faith by this, <hi>Whom [NOW] though you ſee
not, yet believing, rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
That [<hi>NOW] you ſee not,</hi> (in this life) is ſet in
oppoſition, and carries a promiſe with it of a <hi>Time to
come,</hi> wherein they ſhould ſee, even as Chriſt ſaid to
his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 33, &amp; 36. compared, <hi>Whither
I go, I [NOW] ſay to you, ye cannot come; but thou
ſhalt follow me</hi> [AFTERWARDS]. So here [<hi>NOW]
believing,</hi> (which is the Principle at the preſent which
you live upon) <hi>you ſee him not;</hi> but when the <hi>end</hi> of
your faith ſhall come, you ſhall then ſee him; and in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114820:20"/>
this it is conſiſteth the <hi>ſalvation of your ſouls.</hi> So that
ſtill it carries on what I have afore ſpoken unto, That
when <hi>Faith</hi> ceaſeth, <hi>Sight</hi> cometh; yea, <hi>perfects</hi> and
<hi>ſwallows</hi> it up, as was ſaid even now, out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>And let me adde this, That the Apoſtle on purpoſe
doth bring in the mention of this ſupereminent fruit
of faith, (<hi>Even Now when we ſee not</hi>) that <hi>believing, ye
yet rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious:</hi> On pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I ſay, to make way for the raiſing up their thoughts
and apprehenſions, how infinitely tranſcending that
ſalvation of their ſouls muſt be, when <hi>Faith</hi> ending,
they attain to <hi>Sight, To ſee</hi> him face to face, whom
their ſouls have loved: It is implicitly as if he had ſaid
unto them, Oh! think with your ſelves, what Joy,
what Glory that muſt needs be, which exceedeth and
ſurpaſſeth this that now accompanies your faith, in an
anſwerable proportion, as much as <hi>ſight</hi> of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and face to face, muſt be ſuppoſed to excel
the knowledge of him by faith, which ſees him but as
abſent, darkly!</p>
                  <p>And further, give me leave to improve this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
You may take this aſſured evidence, That your
ſouls ſhall then ſee and enjoy God, when your faith
ſhall <hi>CEASE,</hi> which will be, when once your ſouls
ſhall come to be ſeparate from your bodies by death:
In that, even now, in this life, it is your Souls and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
that are the immediate receptives, or partakers and
ſubjects of ſuch glorious joys.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul enjoys them (though in the body, yet)
without the help or concurrence of the body, or the
phantaſms of it: yea, ſuch Raptures do <hi>paſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
that is, the common way of underſtanding,
which by the uſe and help of the body, or images in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114820:20"/>
the fancy, the Minde exerciſeth in other things, and
which do concurre with the underſtanding ordinarily in
<hi>faith.</hi> But this joy falls into, and is illapſed within
the ſoul it ſelf immediately; yea, the weakneſs of your
bodies, and bodily ſpirits, will not permit you to have
ſo much of this joy, as otherwiſe the ſoul is now capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of by faith. And therefore by this experimental taſte
aforehand in your own ſouls, you may be aſcertained,
That your ſouls, when ſeparate from your bodies by
death, as well as when united again unto their bodies,
ſhall enjoy this <hi>great Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much for the firſt Point raiſed out of the
words, which did undertake an Argumentation for a

<hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> as the immediate ſubject of
Grace wrought in it. (2.) From Gods Ordination of
the <hi>Work</hi> wrought, To raiſe the ſoul up to life,

(3.) From the <hi>Scope</hi> of the <hi>Worker, God</hi> himſelf; who
as an Efficient will accompliſh the end, when his work
for that end is finiſh'd. And all theſe, as comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>He that wrought us for this, is God.</hi>

                  <p>When Gods <hi>ordinary Works</hi> are ſpoken of, it ſufficeth

note of Reflection upon, and pointing at <hi>Him,</hi> to
have done as <hi>God.</hi> And it is ordinary among men,
when you would commend the known worth of the

to commend the <hi>Workmanſhip.</hi>

                  <p>And thus both when the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of this

I. On the Souls part.</head>
                     <p>Therein two things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the ſpecies, <hi>the kinde,</hi> and <hi>intrinſecal rank</hi> of
<hi>being,</hi> which this creature (we call the <hi>Soul) thus wrought
upon</hi> ſtands in afore God.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>outward condition</hi> or <hi>caſe</hi> this Soul is left in
upon its parting with the body, unleſs God takes it up
into glory.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for its <hi>rank</hi> or <hi>kinde</hi> of <hi>being.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therein</hi> two things.</p>
                     <p>1. This Soul was by its <hi>firſt</hi> creation <hi>a Spirit,</hi> and
that in the ſubſtance or <hi>native kinde</hi> thereof; and in
that reſpect (conſidered apart for its union with the
body) is in a more ſpecial manner <hi>allied unto God,</hi> than
all other creatures (but Angels) are.</p>
                     <p>You have the <hi>Pedegree</hi> of man, both in reſpect of
<hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> ſet out, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. the extract of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
in ver. 26. <hi>He hath made of one blood all nations of
men:</hi> So then on that ſide (as we ſay) in reſpect of our
<hi>bodies,</hi> there is a <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> of all men, being made
of <hi>one blood,</hi> between one another: But then in reſpect
of our <hi>Souls, we are Gods off-ſpring,</hi> ver. 28. and ſo on that
ſide there is an alliance (not of Conſanguinity) unto
God, upon the account of having been created imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by him, and <hi>IN the very ſubſtance</hi> of our ſouls,
made like him, and in his Image; and yet we are not
begotten of his Eſſence or Subſtance, which is onely
proper to <hi>His Great Son:</hi> And in a correſpondency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, God is ſtyled Heb. 12. 9. <hi>The Father of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
in diſtinction from <hi>the fathers of our fleſh</hi> or bodies:
(ſee the words) which <hi>alliance</hi> or <hi>fatherhood,</hi> take it as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114820:22"/>
in common with <hi>all</hi> mens ſpirits, lieth in this, That he
not onely <hi>created</hi> our Souls immediately out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but in his own <hi>Image,</hi> as to the ſubſtance of them,
which image or likeneſs other creatures did not bear,
which yet were made out of nothing, as the <hi>Chaos</hi> was;
both which appear, by putting two places together,
<hi>Zech. 12. 1. He frameth their Spirits</hi> (ſpeaking of the
Souls of men) and that, [<hi>altogether</hi>] ſaith the Pſalmiſt,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 15. (ſo <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and others reade it) that is,
both, <hi>each</hi> of thoſe Spirits; and alſo wholly and total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
every whit of the ſubſtance of them: <hi>Creatio eſt
productio totius entis;</hi> for <hi>creation</hi> differs from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this, that it is a <hi>raiſing up or producing the whole
of a being out of meer nothing,</hi> that is to ſay, [<hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>]
whereas <hi>generation</hi> preſuppoſeth pre-exiſtent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
as in the generation of our bodies, which are not
<hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>every whit</hi> of God immediately, but he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
afford the ſtuff, <hi>the matter,</hi> and the <hi>formative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
beſides, by which our bodies are framed. So then,
in reſpect of our <hi>firſt creation,</hi> our ſouls (apart conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
are thus allied to God, which our bodies are not;
being Spirits in the very being of them, that altogether
do owe that their being to him.</p>
                     <p>But there is a <hi>taint</hi> come upon the <hi>ſouls of all men</hi>
by <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo as this <hi>alliance</hi> is thereby worn out, yea <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,</hi>
until it be <hi>reſtored.</hi> Now therefore theſe <hi>Souls</hi>
(the onely ſubject of our Diſcourſe) being ſuch as God
hath <hi>wrought,</hi> and <hi>ſo are become his workmanſhip</hi> by a <hi>new</hi>
and far nobler <hi>Creation,</hi> and thereby created <hi>Spirit</hi> anew,
according to what Chriſt ſays,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>That which is born of the
Spirit is Spirit.</hi> Hereupon theſe Souls are <hi>Spirit,</hi> upon a
double account: as you ſay of Sugar, it is <hi>double-refined;</hi>
ſo this is now become <hi>a ſpiritual Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Spirit ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualized</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:114820:23"/>
and ſublimated; yea, and thereby the inward
Sanctuary, <hi>The Holy of Holies,</hi> the ſeat of Gods moſt
<hi>ſpiritual Worſhip;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 22, 25.</note> which the body is not, but onely as
it is the outward Temple or Inſtrument of this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made
Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And hereupon that original <hi>Affinity</hi> to God of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
is not onely <hi>reſtored,</hi> but <hi>endeared;</hi> for now there is
both the ſtuff, or the <hi>ground-work,</hi> and then the <hi>work-manſhip,</hi>
or <hi>embroidery</hi> upon it, and <hi>both</hi> of them the
works of God; that ſo look as the <hi>gold</hi> wrought upon
commends the <hi>enamel,</hi> and then again the enamel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunceth
the value of the gold, ſo as both are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in the <hi>price;</hi> ſo it's here with <hi>this ſoul wrought</hi>
by God in both reſpects.</p>

Condition</hi> of ſuch a Soul, that of it ſelf would fall

                     <p>1. It <hi>fails</hi> of all ſorts of Comforts it had in and by

It is of all creatures left the moſt deſtitute and

                     <p>This is a ſpeciall ſeaſon <hi>for God</hi> to ſhew his love to

<hi>Pſ. 26. My fleſh and my heart faileth</hi> (as at death to be

<hi>David</hi> ſpake this with an eye unto the Glory to come,
when Heart, and Fleſh, and all in this world he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw

                     <p>1. <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and thereupon in a ſpeciall manner
(as <hi>Wiſd. 11. 26. The Lord a lover of ſouls</hi> above all his

when ſuch Spirits ſhall <hi>come to him,</hi> and have ſuch a

an immediate way to <hi>appear before him,</hi> in ſuch a manner
&amp; upon ſuch a change as this, as they never did before;
theſe Spirits alſo having been the <hi>ſeat,</hi> the inner Temple

allied to him, the <hi>lofty one.</hi> Hear how in this caſe he
utters himſelf, <hi>The Spirit would fail afore me,</hi> ſayes he, &amp;
<hi>the ſouls which I have made.</hi> He ſpeaks of their very
ſouls properly and reſpectively conſidered, And [<hi>them</hi>]
it is which he conſidering, and it moves him unto pity;
for he ſpeaks of that in man, whereof God is in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner the Maker or Creator [<hi>The ſpirit which I
have made</hi>] (ſayes he) and it is one of the eminent titles
he takes into his coat, <hi>The framer of the ſpirit of man
within him, Zach.</hi> 12. ch. 1. as in many other places:
This is argued alſo in that he ſpeaketh of <hi>that</hi> in man
which is the ſubject ſenſible of his immediate <hi>wrath.
I will not contend for ever; nor will I be alwayes wroth.</hi>
(This I have obſerved in what is publick of mine.)<note place="margin">Child of Light; walking in Darkneſſe.</note> Now
what moves him to remove his wrath from ſuch an
one? <hi>The ſpirit would faile</hi> (ſays he.) Now doth God thus
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114820:25"/>
profeſſe to have a regard to them in this life, and that
upon this account, that they are Spirits, leſt <hi>they ſhould
FAILE,</hi> or <hi>faint;</hi> and ſhall we not think that when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
otherwiſe they <hi>do faile</hi> (as after death you have

into everlaſting habitations</hi> (as Chriſt there alſo

on them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. God at <hi>this ſeaſon,</hi> forgets not, but full well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
his <hi>Relation</hi> of being [<hi>THEIR CREATOUR</hi>]

ingratiating the remembrance of the firſt) [<hi>The SOULS
which I HAVE MADE</hi>] ſaid he in <hi>Eſay.</hi> But in our
<hi>Peter</hi> this is more expreſſe, and mentioned as that which
indeed moves God (and ſhould be accordingly a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to our Faith) to take care of our Souls when we
come to die, even upon this account, that he is <hi>the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
creatour</hi> of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. laſt. <hi>Wherefore let them
that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the KEE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PING
OF THEIR SOULS to him, in well-doing, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a FAITHFUL CREATOR.</hi> He ſpeaks this ſpecially
unto ſuch as were continually expoſed unto perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>unto death</hi> for Chriſt in thoſe Primitive times; which
therefore, v. 12. he termes the <hi>fiery triall,</hi> and ver. 17.

going on upon <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> ſuch as they had not

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114820:25"/>
death you know it is that when mens bodies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and ſo the ſeaſon when their <hi>ſouls</hi> to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
therefrom ſhould be committed to Gods care;
as our <hi>Darling</hi> (as our Tranſlation) or <hi>lovely</hi> ſoul,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22. See <hi>Ainſw.</hi>
                        </note> when
ſeparate (as others) as Chriſt in <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22. And
<hi>Peter</hi> had in his eye Chriſt example, and pointed them
thereunto, who at his death <hi>committed</hi> his ſeparate Soul

                           </gap>.</note> onely
there is this difference, that whereas Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
I commit, <hi>Peter</hi> ſubſtitutes another title of Gods
(there being more than one Relation moving God, and
ſtrengthening our Faith to this) even of <hi>faithfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi>
And I underſtand not the <hi>firſt</hi> creation onely or
chiefly here meant by <hi>Peter;</hi> but the <hi>ſecond</hi> creation
chiefly (which brings into repute and acceptation with
God the firſt again together with its own) and ſo
God is thereupon engaged to be <hi>faithfull</hi> in his care
and proviſion for ſuch <hi>ſouls,</hi> according to his <hi>promiſes:</hi>
And <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> doth alwayes reſpect and refer unto
Promiſes; and my reaſon why thus I underſtand it, is,
becauſe I find Gods <hi>faithfulneſse</hi> ſtill annexed unto his
<hi>calling</hi> of us, that is, converting us, which is al one
with this <hi>new creation: Faithfull is he that hath called
you,</hi> that is, made you new creatures. 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 9. 1 Theſ.</hi>
5. 24. And I find that <hi>David</hi> alſo urges it upon God as
a motive, as in other Pſalms. So <hi>Pſ. 138. 8. Forſake not
the works of thine own hands,</hi> that is, this double <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip</hi>
of thine of the <hi>first,</hi> and then ſuperadded
unto <hi>that,</hi> of the <hi>ſecond creation</hi> which he urgeth
thereby to move him to <hi>perfect the work</hi> begun, and to
be <hi>mercifull unto him for ever,</hi> in the former part of that
verſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:114820:26"/>
3. God profeſſeth himſelf <hi>the</hi> FATHER <hi>of</hi> SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITS;
which relation, though it ſpeaks his being the
<hi>Creatour</hi> of them, at the firſt, yet hath ſomething more
of <hi>bowels</hi> in it: it ſayes withall ſomething further, when
it falls out that ſuch <hi>Spirits</hi> as he is a Father unto by
the firſt creation, are alſo the <hi>ſubjects of His eternall
love,</hi> by Grace and Election unto the <hi>Adoption of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. ſee the words. Which love, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
accordingly taken hold of their ſouls by a work
of Grace wrought upon them <hi>in this life,</hi> thereby own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them as his, in this caſe, that God that is <hi>a father of
their Spirits</hi> by the <hi>law</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> creation, is in a more
tranſcendent manner become the <hi>father of the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
by <hi>Grace,</hi> and the ſecond Creation ſuperadded:
Hence it falls out, in a parallel way, that (as it was ſaid)
ſuch ſouls were become [<hi>Spirit</hi>] upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that is <hi>ſpirits</hi> for the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of their being, and
again <hi>ſpirit,</hi> by being <hi>born again</hi> of the [<hi>ſpirit</hi>] ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably
it is, that God ſtands in relation unto them as
<hi>a father of their ſpirits</hi> upon the like double reſpect.
And this is equitable upon a very great account; for
his relation of <hi>Father</hi> is more eminent to his Grace by
Election, and then again by the grace of his ſecond
Creation then it could be any way ſuppoſed to be by
the <hi>firſt</hi> creation. And therefore is ſet and pitcht in
like ſingularity and eminency upon the ſame object,
that is their ſpirits. And hence it may well, yea muſt be
ſuppoſed and acknowledged, That if God did make
ſuch a <hi>darling</hi> of the Soul, ſuch an account of it by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to entitle himſelf ſo ſpecially <hi>the father thereof,</hi>
then certainly this love of <hi>grace</hi> much more hath in
like equipage taken up the ſame gracious <hi>ſpecial relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in its kind of <hi>Father</hi> thereunto: not onely becauſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114820:26"/>
Natura ſhall never be found to exceed Grace in its
favours; but that indeed the motives are far greater,
that God ſhould extend the like and greater priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
where he meant to love by <hi>election</hi> and <hi>choice,</hi> then
he did where he loved onely by a <hi>due</hi> and meet <hi>law of
creation:</hi> So that when God ſhall profeſſe himſelf a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
to <hi>their ſpirits,</hi> ſpeaking to ſuch as are his Elect, he
ſtrongly inſinuateth thereby, That he is by Grace like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the <hi>father of their ſpirits</hi> in a peculiar manner.
And truly that ſpeech of our Saviour at his death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
it, <hi>Father into thy hands I commit my ſpirit:</hi> It
was not barely as <hi>a father</hi> of his ſpirit by creation (as
our all know) but by everlaſting love, and ſo in that
reſpect alſo in a peculiar manner the <hi>Father of his ſpirit;</hi>
and therefore as to a <hi>Father</hi> he commends his <hi>ſeparate</hi>
Spirit unto him. And this he did, although he was to
riſe again in leſſe than three whole dayes ſpace.</p>
                     <p>Now we read <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12. the Apoſtle to hold forth
this very relation of Gods being <hi>a father of ſpirits,</hi> with
this promiſe thereunto annexed, <hi>That they ſhould live:</hi>
which relation of <hi>Father,</hi> &amp;c. although it be there expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
ſpoken in reſpect of their firſt Creation (which
is common unto the Saints with others) yet being utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of and unto men in the ſtate of Grace (as thoſe
were ſuppoſed, whom he there exhorteth, and that to
move them to be <hi>ſubject</hi> unto him <hi>as ſuch;</hi> with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
that they <hi>ſhould live</hi>) it evidently reſpecteth not
meerely the relation of <hi>Father</hi> in reſpect of what <hi>was
paſt</hi> the act of creating them, but it looketh to the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
That they depended upon him (as children do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Fathers for their future <hi>livelihood,</hi> ſo theſe) for to
<hi>live</hi> in him and with him as a <hi>father</hi> to their Spirits by
<hi>Grace.</hi> For I take hold of that word [<hi>and live</hi>] this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114820:27"/>
life is well interpreted by ver. 14. <hi>They ſhall ſee God,</hi> that
is, be glorified, and ſo I conclude all thus, that if he
would have them be ſubject unto God in holineſſe, as
upon that relation, as unto <hi>the father of ſpirits,</hi> with this
promiſe, <hi>That they ſhould live;</hi> then ſurely one ſpeciall
aim of the promiſe is anſwerable, and hath this eye,
That God as a <hi>Father of their ſpirits</hi> will therefore take
care of their ſpirits <hi>ſingly,</hi> and ſo when <hi>ſeparate,</hi> that
they ſhall live. And that accordingly he will give de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of this ſpecial relation born to their <hi>ſpirits</hi>
(when the occaſion ſhall be) conſidered apart in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
this life on them: and truly when its more
proper for him to ſhew himſelf a Father then when
their ſouls after their ſubjection to him in holineſſe
here accompliſhed, and when that as naked ſpirits they
come to ſtand in need, and ſtand afore him in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
being now turned out of houſe and home, and
quite caſhired out of this world, and come ſtript and
naked of all but holineſſe unto their Father (for it is
ſaid <hi>They return to God that gave them</hi>) who proves to be
their Father by Grace. And doubt not of it but he will
certainly then own them, and give them a Fathers
bleſſing, and not reject them as if they were but <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards</hi>
and no <hi>children</hi> (as that Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
ſpeaks) but as <hi>ſpirits,</hi> who as <hi>ſons</hi> that have ſerved him,
and been <hi>ſubject</hi> to him.</p>
                     <p>Add to this, Fourthly, God his being <hi>our God,</hi> which
is more home to the demonſtration of this point then
all the former. The Text ſayes, <hi>He that wrought us for
this, is God.</hi> I adde, he is <hi>your</hi> God. And this alone, if
we will take the Scriptures verdict, will carry it, and
loe, as he is ſtyled <hi>The Father of ſpirits</hi> in common, and
yet withall <hi>a father of their ſpirits,</hi> out of ſpecial love:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114820:27"/>
So in like manner,<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 22.</note> he is ſtyled both <hi>The God of the ſpirits
of all fleſh,</hi> (that is, of man, <hi>Job</hi> 12. 20.) thus in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
and alſo to his Elect, <hi>I am your God by grace.</hi>
And theſe two relations, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate,
and exactly parallel, whether they be applied
unto all men <hi>in common,</hi> or to the <hi>Elect</hi> in <hi>ſpecial,</hi> he
is termed <hi>The God of the Spirits,</hi> and likewiſe, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Spirits of all men:</hi> So in common, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
he is <hi>Your God,</hi> and <hi>Your Father,</hi> by <hi>ſpecial</hi> grace
to his Elect; both which in this latter reſpect you finde
yoked hand in hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 17. Look how farre he is
a <hi>God</hi> of the one, ſo farre a <hi>Father</hi> alſo extendeth in the
other: And look how farre that he is <hi>our God,</hi> ſo farre
reacheth alſo that he is <hi>Our Father.</hi> If therefore the <hi>God
of our Spirits,</hi> to provide for them becauſe he is <hi>our
God,</hi> then anſwerably the <hi>Father of our Spirits</hi> in the
like peculiarneſs, becauſe <hi>our Father.</hi> And ſo the proof
of this fourth Particular, will adde further ſtrength and
confirmation to that we preſented in the former.</p>
                     <p>Now that his being <hi>our God</hi> (which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Covenant of Grace) doth engage him to
provide glory for <hi>ſeparate Souls,</hi> That one inſtance of
<hi>Abraham (The Father of the faithful,</hi> and we all his ſons
perſonated in him) is a ſufficient evidence, God did
profeſs himſelf <hi>The God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob,</hi>
and unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15. 1. perſonally, <hi>I am thy
abundant reward,</hi> (which reſpected the life to come)
and his <hi>Friend,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 7.</p>
                     <p>Now the Scriptures of the New Teſtament do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this relation of Gods unto us, unto <hi>two inferences</hi>
drawn from <hi>Abrahams</hi> inſtance: whereof the one is the
point afore us.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is Chriſts inference from thence, That
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114820:28"/>
therefore <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſoul lives, and <hi>Abraham</hi> both <hi>ſoul
and body ſhall riſe again, for God is not the God of the
dead, but of the living,</hi> Matth. 22. 31. Thus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi>'s collection from the ſame Promiſe, is, that
God had provided in the mean time for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſoul
<hi>afore the Reſurrection,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> and an <hi>Houſe</hi> therein <hi>for
him.</hi> Thus <hi>Heb. 11. 16. But now they deſire a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not aſhamed
to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them
a City.</hi> To give light to this, <hi>Paul</hi> had repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſtory and caſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt of the
Patriarchs, in the verſes afore, to have been this; That
God had indeed promiſed the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to him
and them, ver. 8, 9. whereupon, ver. 13. it is ſaid, That
theſe <hi>all died in faith, not having received the promiſes,
being ſtrangers in the land;</hi> yea, not <hi>having a foot of
land</hi> in the Land of Promiſe, as <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.
5, 6, 7. And alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 9th verſe of this <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
Now then, when they died, what was it their faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in ſtead thereof? The 10th verſe tells us, <hi>He
looked for a City whoſe maker and builder is God.</hi> From
which compared, obſerve, That when he died, his faith
was thus pitch'd to look for this City, in ſtead of that
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> promiſed. This was the expectation
of their faith on their part. Well, but how doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that this flow'd from Gods having profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be <hi>the God of Abraham, &amp;c. his reward, and his
friend?</hi> You have this clear in the 16th verſe, where
you have the whole ſumm'd up as the Concluſion of the
ſtory, and as the proof and ground hereof; but now
<hi>they deſire a better Country, that is, an heavenly:</hi> there is
their faith and expectation when they ſhould come to
die. Then it follows, <hi>Wherefore God is not aſhamed to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114820:28"/>
be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City;</hi>
which is ſpoken in full anſwer to that their expectation
at their deaths, to ſhew, that God in profeſſing himſelf
<hi>to be their God,</hi> he had thereby engaged himſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own intent in that promiſe, to make this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for them at their deaths: The words are expreſs,
<hi>Wherefore God is not aſhamed;</hi> what ſhould this mean in
this Coherence, but that his declaring himſelf to be
<hi>their God,</hi> did import and carry this with it, That he
had provided this <hi>eſtate</hi> for them at their death, even <hi>an
heavenly; and,</hi> that otherwiſe (as the Apoſtle gloſſeth
upon it) he had not come up unto the amplitude of,
nor filled full this convenanted Engagement and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of HIS BEING THEIR GOD. Will you
have it in <hi>plain Engliſh</hi> (as we ſpeak) if he had not
made this proviſion for their ſouls, he would have been
<hi>aſhamed</hi> to have been called <hi>their God:</hi> thus deeply
doth this oblige him, That he is our God and Father,
which is the point in hand.</p>
                     <p>And judge of this in the light of all that Reaſon we
have hitherto carried along; and again, let this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Apoſtle mutually ſerve to confirm us in
all <hi>that Reaſon.</hi> For poor <hi>Abraham</hi> to be driven out of
his own Country by God, who <hi>called him to his foot,</hi>
and ſaid no more, but as a Maſter to his Servant, Take
your Cloke, and follow me (who muſt preſently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado, trig and foot it after his Maſter) as
<hi>Iſa</hi> 41. 2. and then to live a <hi>ſtranger</hi> in the <hi>Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi>
upon the faith, that God would be <hi>his God:</hi> which
faith in him was alſo to ceaſe when he came to die. If
this God in this caſe ſhould not have taken care to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
his faith in ſome greater way, in ſtead of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and that after, upon his being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114820:29"/>
out of that Country too, which he ſojourned in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this life, if God had not provided another Houſe,
or Country, or City for his ſoul, that was to live, to
bring it into, when it ſhould be deprived of all in this
world; The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>God</hi> (in this caſe) <hi>would
have been aſhamed</hi> to have been called <hi>his God:</hi> which
now, having provided ſo abundantly for him upon dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there is ſuperabundant cauſe to ſay, <hi>God is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed;</hi>
for that is a <hi>diminutive,</hi> implying, That he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
exceedeth that their expectation could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be.</p>
                     <p>Let us but view the force of this inference of the
Apoſtles (and ſo of all the reaſonings hitherto read)
But according to man, or what is found amongſt men,
(and God will be ſure infinitely to ſurpaſs men in <hi>his</hi>
ways of favour.) Take an ordinary friend, if his friend
be turn'd out of houſe and home, plundred, baniſhed,
driven out of all, as the <hi>Steward</hi> in that Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi>
16. was, and comes to his <hi>friend at midnight,</hi> as in
that other Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 5, 6. will not his friends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him into their houſes; as ver. 9. of <hi>Luke</hi> 16.
yea, and riſe at midnight to do it, as ver. 5, 6. in that
Parable of <hi>Luke</hi> 11. ſhall profeſſion of friendſhip engage
and oblige men to do this, and ſhall not Gods profeſſing
himſelf to be <hi>our God, Father, Friend,</hi> engage his heart
much more? Nay, will he not ſo entertain them, as
ſhall exceed all wonderment? What need I ſay more
than this? Wherefore <hi>He is not aſhamed to be called their
God:</hi> He will therefore give you an entertainment that
ſhall be worthy of his being your God.</p>
                     <p>The fifth and laſt Conſideration is, That theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Souls having done and finiſh'd all their work,
that in order to glory God hath appointed them for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114820:29"/>
ever to do, they now at death appear afore him as a
JUDGE AND REWARDER. And that is the fifth
<hi>Relation</hi> moving God to beſtow at this ſeaſon ſuch a
glory on them. How that then the Soul <hi>returns to God,</hi>
you have heard again &amp; again out of <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 7. and that
it is upon the account of his being the <hi>Judge</hi> thereof at
the end of their work in this life. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe
hath long ſince gloſſed upon it, <hi>It returns to God, that
it may ſtand in Judgement afore Him.</hi> In this life it
came unto God by faith, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>believing
that God is,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently
ſeek him;</hi> and now at the end of its faith, it comes unto
God for the <hi>reward</hi> of its faith, as ſome interpret that
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. (which we ſo largely have inſiſted on.) This
is certain, That in that Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> To be <hi>his
God,</hi> he intended and included, his being to him <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great reward.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 1.</note> And ſo we come to connect this
fifth Head with the fore-going. And therefore if the
<hi>being his God,</hi> moved him to <hi>prepare that City againſt his
death</hi> (as hath been ſaid) Then ſurely his being <hi>his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
doth alſo then take place. I ſhall not omit it,
becauſe it falls in the next Chapter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. that
in <hi>that</hi> ſtupendious Aſſembly of Heaven, God <hi>the
Judge</hi> of all is mentioned between <hi>the Church of the
firſt-born which are written in heaven;</hi> this afore: <hi>and the
Spirits of juſtified men made perfect;</hi> this after it: For
there are none of theſe <hi>firſt-born,</hi> or <hi>the Spirits of juſt
men,</hi> do come to ſit down there, but they paſs the
award of this <hi>Judge</hi> firſt, for they ſit down by him;
and ſurely, having done all their work in the time of
<hi>that day</hi> is allotted to each man to work in, it is a <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
thing with God</hi> to give them a <hi>Reward</hi> in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this day, (which is Chriſts time ſet for reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114820:30"/>
and it is the twelfth and laſt hour ſucceeding the
eleventh of the day,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Burgenſis, Maldonat. &amp;c. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Matth. 20. 6, &amp;</hi> 9. compared)
which is when the night of death comes. Now there
is a Law given by God, that the wages to a man hired
ſhould be given him (by him that ſet him awork) in <hi>his
day,</hi> that is, ſays the Septuagint, the <hi>very ſame day,</hi> ſo
as his <hi>work,</hi> or the wages of his work, <hi>abide not with
thee all the night untill the morning,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 24. 15.</note> ſays God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.
15. Did God take care for hirelings, when their work
was done not to ſtay any ſpace of time, no not a night,
and doth he not fulfil this himſelf unto his Sons that
ſerve him? Surely yes: he defers not, nor puts them
off to the <hi>morning</hi> of the Reſurrection, as the Pſalmiſt
elegantly calls it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. laſt. It <hi>abides not with him</hi>
all that dark and <hi>long ſome</hi> night, or ſpace after death, in
which their bodies reſt in the grave, which is termed
<hi>Mans long home:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 5.</note> and, <hi>The days of darkneſs are many</hi>
(ſays <hi>Solomon</hi>) no; he rewards them in the <hi>evening of
the day,</hi> beſides what he will adde to it in the morning.
It is obſervable, that <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9, 10. concerning the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Souls ſlain for Chriſt, that whilſt they cry for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
on their enemies only, <hi>And when he had opened the
fifth Seal, I ſaw under the altar the ſouls of them that were
ſlain for the word of God, and for the testimony which
they held, And they cried with a loud voice, ſaying, How
long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge
our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi> that they had
white robes given them to quiet them in the mean
time; ver. 11. <hi>And white robes were given unto every
one of them, and it was ſaid unto them, that they ſhould
reſt yet for a little ſeaſon;</hi> till they heard that vengeance
alſo was executed on that Roman Empire for their
blood ſhed. And thus to deal is a righteous thing with
God.</p>

                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:114820:30"/>
Thus you have ſeen the Point confirmed from all
ſorts of relations that God bears unto us, by congruous
Reaſons, that ſo it becometh God, the great God to
do—<hi>He that hath wrought us for this thing, is God.</hi> And

[<hi>He hath prepared for them a city</hi>] of the Soul, in like

Will God (think we) leave this his Houſe ſtand deſolate,

are in ſuch a manner wrought apart, ſo as to ſuit

                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>therein,</hi> even to wonderment, doth the Glory

and <hi>wonderfull in working,</hi> when he hath hiddenly
contrived one thing for another, when as each are in
themſelves, and apart glorious. It is ſaid by <hi>David</hi> of
himſelf (and it is true of all men in their meaſure) <hi>Pſal.</hi>
139. 15. <hi>I was made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the
loweſt parts of the earth;</hi> that is, in my mothers womb,
as the context ſhews; which are termed the <hi>Lower
parts of the earth,</hi> as when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. to <hi>have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114820:32"/>
deſcended into the lower part of the earth;</hi> that is, to be
conceived in the womb of a Virgin; when a child is
born, a lump of fleſh, animated with a ſoul comes
forth, <hi>curiouſly wrought,</hi> &amp;c. but wrought, for what?
in <hi>Davids</hi> perſon (in which this was ſpoken) it was for
a Kingdome, the ſupremeſt condition of enjoyments in
this World. But in every other man (that is born) it
is that he was curiouſly wrought, in a fitneſſe and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to all things that are in this world, <hi>made</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
exactly for it long afore it came into the world;
you may ſee it in <hi>Adam</hi> (our firſt pattern) more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
God was buſie for ſix dayes in making this world,
the Angels all that while ſtood wondring with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to what end,<note place="margin">Job 36. 7.</note> or for whom all this was prepared.
At the end of the ſixth day, they ſaw God to ſet
down into the world this little thing called <hi>Man;</hi>
and then they ceaſed their wonderment; for they
ſaw all this world (prepared aforehand) ſet in mans
heart, and all in man curiouſly wrought and fitted
for all things made in this world, <hi>richly to enjoy,</hi> as
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. We may apply that in the Text, to
this it appeared, <hi>That he that hath man for this ſelf-ſame

to each other: All wonderment exceeding—I
might much more enlarge upon the ſuiting of <hi>Chriſt the
Head and Husband,</hi> and the Church His <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi>
wrought and growing up to him in all ages, both apart,
ſecretly and hiddenly prepared, and each ſo glorious
in themſelves, and yet put together. Let us refer our
Admiration hereat untill the latter day. Juſt thus it is
in fitting the ſoul for that glory: and again, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in Heaven for that ſoul: God works the one for the
other apart.—The very ſimilitude in the former ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114820:33"/>
do import ſo much; He ſtyleth Glory in Heaven a
being <hi>clothed upon,</hi> and Holineſſe here he compares to
an <hi>under-garment,</hi> which that of Glory is to be put <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
or upon: There was never a curious Artiſt in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Garments that ever took meaſure of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of an <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>under</hi> Garment, to fit the one to
the other, as God hath in proportioning his work upon
us here, and his preparation of Glory for each of us
in the world to come: He hath took exact meaſure,
and his law is (that deſigned his own workings on both
hands afore-hand) that <hi>every man ſhall receive his own
reward according to his own labour,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 8.</p>
                     <p>Now the Artifice of God in both theſe lies in this,
That each are hiddenly contrived apart, and yet ſo
gloriouſly matcht as wrought one for the other; which
is an argument as of two Artificers, the one in the
Eaſt Indies, the other in the Weſt; ſhould the one
make the <hi>Caſe,</hi> the other make the <hi>Watch,</hi> unbeknown

                     </p>
                     <p>1. He tells us there of an <hi>inward man renewed,</hi> whileſt

with what the Text ſayes? God <hi>works</hi> Us (theſe
ſouls) <hi>day by day:</hi> Even as the child is curiouſly
wrought in the womb, to ſubſiſt of it ſelf alone in this
world, ſo this <hi>inward man</hi> in that other.</p>
                     <p>2. He then immediately ſubjoyns ver. 17. that All
<hi>Afflictions</hi> (which are nothing elſe but the <hi>Periſhings</hi>
of this <hi>outward man</hi>) as alſo <hi>All things</hi> and <hi>diſpenſations</hi>

are but outwardly a work, as inferiour Artificers or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments:
Therefore,</p>
                     <p>3. He further declares, 1. verſe of this chapter, That

               <p>But you will ask me, How I fetch this out of my

               <p>1. You ſee here are Two Perſons expreſly named,
<hi>God [the Father</hi>] namely, and the <hi>Spirit.</hi> This is a <hi>Rule,</hi>
that where the name <hi>God,</hi> and then ſome beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Two Perſons, <hi>Christ</hi> or the <hi>Spirit,</hi> are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

(not eſſentially onely) to expreſſe <hi>The Father:</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:114820:34"/>
Now here the <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> is mentioned diſtinct
from <hi>God;</hi> For it is ſaid that This <hi>God hath given</hi> the
<hi>Spirit;</hi> which alſo Chriſt ſo often ſpeaketh of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as I need not to inſiſt on it.</p>
               <p>2. It is an other Rule, That in any Scripture where
<hi>Two Perſons</hi> are mentioned, as concurring in any thing,
or matter; There the other Third Perſon alſo muſt be
underſtood to have his ſpeciall ſhare therein alſo; as
when he wiſheth <hi>grace and peace from God the Father,
and from Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> 'Tis certain the holy Ghoſt is
as ſpecially underſtood; as indeed we find him in that
Apoſtolicall bleſſing as diſtinctly ſpoken of as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

taken in, who alſo in <hi>John</hi> is ſo often ſaid to <hi>give the

               <p>Doth God <hi>work</hi> Us for this thing ere he brings us to it?
What <hi>hath</hi> God <hi>wrought</hi> hitherto upon <hi>Thee</hi> or <hi>Thee,</hi>
in order to this end? 'Tis a blunt queſtion, but the
Text puts it in my mouth: How many ſouls are there
living in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, that know not
what this means, to have a <hi>work</hi> wrought on them (a-new
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114820:35"/>
upon them) over and above what morall Honeſty
(which was Natures portion) and the common profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſtianity addes thereunto, by cuſtome and

obſerving the Principles of his Religion, upon the

all thy Religion is founded but upon the like foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

efficacy of them. They muſt <hi>enter thy ſoul</hi> by a ſpirituall
faith and frame, and mold it anew to a likeneſs to them.
Carry home therefore the <hi>Caveat</hi> our Apoſtle hath put
in ver. 3. <hi>If ſo be that being clothed, we be not found naked</hi>
of Grace and Holineſs wrought, and Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
by ſpiritual efficacious faith applied, (<hi>Faith</hi> in

as <hi>heartily</hi> and as <hi>honeſtly,</hi> as it expects ſalvation by
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> as without which thou wilt never be ſaved. This
is our Religion; and when at death <hi>thy Soul</hi> (thy poor
<hi>loneſome</hi> Soul) being ſtript of all things in this world;
even the <hi>Body</hi> and all, ſhall come afore the great God

               <p>No matter what befals thee, ſo it <hi>works</hi> towards this
end; let whatever be, ſo thou findeſt God to go on
with this deſign, that he <hi>works upon thy ſoul;</hi> be it <hi>upward,</hi>
in communion with himſelf, or <hi>downward,</hi> in diſowning
thy ſelf, thy vileneſs and corruptions, <hi>ſo it works.</hi> Thou
haſt afflictions that break thy heart, (as <hi>reproch broke
Chriſts heart,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt in his name) no matter,
<hi>ſo they work</hi> upon thy Soul. Know then, that they are
ſet awork by the hand that ſent them, to <hi>work a far
exceeding weight of glory</hi> for thee:<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>If by any means</hi> (ſays
<hi>Paul</hi>) no matter what, <hi>ſo the work go on.</hi> A Carver
comes with his Chiſſels, and cuts <hi>off</hi> this piece, and
cuts <hi>in</hi> to that part of the Stone: No matter; a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Statue</hi> bearing the Image of ſome Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
is to be ſet up for perpetuity, and is accordingly

at any condition, <hi>whilſt</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays) <hi>it turns to thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Election</hi> ſent thee not into this world to have
a <hi>great Name</hi> (perhaps God will load it) nor to be Rich,
or to have Power, but to <hi>work thee for this ſelf-ſame
thing;</hi> and if thou ſeeſt <hi>that Plough</hi> a going (though it
makes <hi>deep furrows on thy back,</hi> yea heart) yet ſo, that
this ſeed be ſown therein, rejoyce, for <hi>thou ſhalt bring
thy ſheafs with thee.</hi> For my ſelf, ſo that I finde <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
purſuing its deſign, <hi>of making me holy,</hi> and <hi>bleſsing
me with ſpiritual bleſsings in heavenly places,</hi> (as <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
1. 4.) I care not (I would not care) what befalls me in
this World.</p>
