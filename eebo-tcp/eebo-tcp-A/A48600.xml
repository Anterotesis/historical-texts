            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Deference I bear to your Integrity, and great Judgment, subjects me to the least of your Commands, and that brings before you my Thoughts on those several Heads you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to me.</p>
            <p n="1">1. My Opinion of Companies in Trade, by Authority of the Great Seal in general.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the present Company in <hi>England</hi> for the Linnen Manufactory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of that for the same in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt you may judge of my Sense in this Discourse, as Men do of Minerals, that when they appear near the day, as they phrase it, and are easily come at, that the Vein is not good. So may you judge of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Opinion in the following Lines; however, you that command, can pardon, and by your better Judgment supply my Defects.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with that of Companies in general. These I take to have been very common in the early days of Trade, when Navigation was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Mystery next to that of the Black Art, and such as would venture their Persons and Estates into the New World, as they termed new found Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Heroes equal to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <q>Aes triplex circa pectus erat— <hi>Horace:</hi>
               </q>
In these Times Kings could not exceed in their Grants and Privileges, that by them Adventurers might be increased, and Trade brought to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, we see how fond Princes were of Merchants, by the great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges our Kings gave to the <hi>Easterlings,</hi> as they then called the <hi>Flemings,</hi> the <hi>Still-Yard</hi> is a lasting Monument of their Grandure; and our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles tell how boldly they would upon any Distaste bear on our Kings.</p>
            <p>So were our Companies in following years courted by Foreign Princes, and States, to settle their Trade in their Dominions; but as Trade and and Commerce became familiar in the World, the Wisdom of Government made the Privileges of Trade universal to their Subjects: and so by degrees Companies were abated, and only such continued as were thought useful for preserving some particular Trades, that if left at large might become less profitable to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There is another Reason for Companies in Foreign Parts, which some bring to strengthen their Opinion for them here. They tell us Companies are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in <hi>France, Holland, Swedeland,</hi> and likewise in most small Princes Dominions; but in all these Places there may be Reasons which hold not here, some of them have but little Trade and Navigation, the People not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Trade, but content themselves with the Product of their own Country. Now in this Case there is Reason for the Government to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Companies even to the seeming loss of the People in general, that is by placing such Duties and Prohibitions on Foreigners: as to keep them out,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32860:3"/>
that so their own Subjects may set their own Rates on what they import, otherwise they would not be able to manage a Trade that Foreigners could undersel them in, and so their Country would become a Province to other Princes, I take them to be not better who govern not their own Trade, but are beholding to Strangers. Companies in Countries under these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances seem absolutely necessary to preserve some Trade of their own, but we in <hi>England</hi> are not under these Necessities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> and other Countries before mentioned have Inducements much of the same Nature; for tho they may drive considerable Trades in the World, yet they come after us in their Foreign Plantations, and Trade, and where they are so, nothing but Companies can introduce them, but had they an open and secure Trade they would soon throw down the Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and make their Trade common to all their own Subjects.</p>
            <p>There is yet another reason for Companies, and that is all I can find which carries a pretence for any in <hi>England,</hi> that is, where there wants a Force and Government to secure Ships and Men, whilst they are imployed in the Trade of the Country among Savages, and so have not the Protection of the Country, as in other more civilized Nations. Here, if the Government of the Kingdom do not at the publick Charge set up and maintain Forts and Garrisons for the security of their own People that trade there, the Trade can be no other way carried on but by a Company and Joint-stock, and that Trade appropriated to them as a Fund and Recompence for their Charge of maintaining a Force and Government. But this seems to proceed rather from the Mistakes or Neglect in Government, than a good Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for Trade, that any Society of private Men should have a Regal Power to make War, or Peace, give Commissions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be thought an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Weakness in the National Power they derive from, and is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture within a Creature that wants a Name: and however this Management may secure a Gain to the Company, yet at the same time it may be a Loss to the Nation to which they belong. As that of the <hi>African</hi> Company, which by the best Judgment is depricated as the Bane of our Foreign Plantations. Something of which is touched upon by Mr. <hi>Dalby Thomas</hi> in his Historical Account of the Rise and Growth of the <hi>West-India</hi> Colonies, a more Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Mercantine Discourse I have not met with. Now it might be thought more Honorable for the Nation to secure every part of their Trade at the publick Charge, than to leave it to the Conduct of private Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so set up a Common-Wealth within a Monarchy: that for any Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages are not called to account like other Offenders, but treated like an Ally, I know not how better to distinguish Men that seise Ships and Goods where they find them without Process of Law.</p>
            <p>By this Account you will believe me no Friend to Companies; and I must confess my Judgment and Experience, as far as it goes, is against them: but still with a Reserve to such, as by a long Descent from their Predecessors, that purchased it by signal Service to the Nation, have in a manner a Freehold, as that of the <hi>Turkey, Hamburg,</hi> and some other Companies in being. But that Projectors and Courtiers should be inspired with New Lights, and out of Love to the Nation, create new Methods in Trades, that none before found out; and by inclosing Commons the Liberty of Trade into Shares, in the first place for themselves, and then for such others as will pay for both, is, I must confess, to me, a Mystery I desire to be a Stranger unto.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the second part of your Enquiry, my Thoughts of the present Linnen Manufactory in <hi>England.</hi> You know my Aversion to the Sin of this Age, Scandal and Reflection, to avoid which, I may perhaps
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32860:3"/>
be short in setting forth my Sense of this Company; and the Progress they make in the Design they propose, of making Linnen to the Advantage of the Nation, and Profit of the Company.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First then, I submit to better Judgments, that a Company and Joint-Stock is not a proper way to set up and increase Manufactory. It is usual for any Man that designs to take up the Trade of another, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to exceed, but labours to imitate, to follow the Steps of him he makes his Aim. Now then if we take up the Trade of Linnen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory from <hi>Germany, Holland,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> let us see if any of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms established it by Companies; if they did not, and grew great in it by other Methods, it might then be thought our best way to do as they did.</p>
            <p>But that the very Name of a Company and Joint-Stock in Trade, is a Spell to drive away, and keep out of that place where they reside, all Men of Industry, and Business that relates to what the Company pretends unto, is not new to any Man of Imployment in the World. The great Motive to Labour and Incouragement of Trade, is an equal Freedom, and that none may be secluded from the delightful Walks of Liberty. Now Trade to Merchants, and mechanick Arts to Workmen are their Walks, which where any challenge a Right to keep the Key, they will not come; a Subjection in Manufactories where a People are obliged to one Master, tho they have the full Value of their Labour, is not pleasing, they think themselves in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Servitude, and so it is observed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the <hi>Irish</hi> made a Trade of Linnen Yarn, no Man could ingage them, but they would go to the Market and be better satisfied with a less price, than to be obliged to one Master: but this of a Company is one Master to a Kingdom; and whatever they pretend unto in saying they hinder no Man, yet they have such Advantages by being a Body incorporate, and having a Joint-Stock, that no Man of a private Purse dares ingage in that Trade they call themselves a Company of: Much less will any new Stores come, where at their Entrance they must put on a Shackle of the Company's forging.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the Practice of former Ages against the introducing of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories by Companies. I do not find that the Woollen Manufactory, first introduced by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third who brought in the <hi>Flemings,</hi> was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Companies, but that he gave like Immunities to all that would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themselves in it. And however Notions and Opinions may prevail in Schools, the plain Methods of Labour are better understood by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick than Theory.</p>
            <p>There was much more Reason for a Company and Joint-Stock to set up the Woollen Manufactory in that ignorant Age, than there is for this of the Linnen Manufactory; that of the Woollen was a new Art not known in this Kingdom, it required a great Stock to manage, there was required Foreign as well as Native Commodities to carry it on, Oil, dying Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when the Manufactory was made, there must be Skill and Interest abroad to introduce the Commodity where others had the Trade before them: but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this in the Linnen Manufactory; Nature seems to design it for the weaker Sex. The best of Linnen for Service is called House-wife's Cloth, here then is no need of the Broad Seal, or Joint-Stock to establish the Methods for the good Wife's weeding her Flax Garden, or how soon her Maid shall sit to her Wheel after washing her Dishes; the good Woman is Lady of the Soil, and holds a Court within her self, throws the Seed into the Ground, and works it till she brings it there again, I mean her Web to the bleaching Ground.</p>
            <p>Now to appropriate this which the poorest Family may by Labour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto, that is, finish and bring to Market a Piece of Cloth: to me seems
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32860:4"/>
an infallible Expedient to discourage universal Industry, making the World believe they will do Wonders in their Company, and by that means dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all private Endeavours; and when all is done, themselves like the Mountain in the Fable bring forth a Mouse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As a Company will hinder the Increase of new Comers, so it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy such as are settled here already. There are, as I am told, in several parts of the Kingdom, private Men that imploy themselves and their little Stock in the Linnen Manufactory of Thread, Cloth, Tapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now tho I believe any one of these Men with five hundred pounds Stock, shall actually increase the Trade more than a Company with five thousand pounds, yet this Company drives out five thousand small Traders that are now in it. Traders are like Armies in a Field, small parties, tho numerous, yet being disjoint, give way to a united Force: and this of the Linnen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory above any Trade I know, if (which I must confess I doubt) it be for the Good of the Nation, requires more Charity than Grandeur to carry it on, the poor Spinner comes as often to her Master for Charity to a sick Child, or a Plaister for a Sore, as for Wages; and this she cannot have of a Company, but rather less for her Labour, when they have beat all private Undertakers out.</p>
            <p>These poor Spinners can now come to their Masters Doors at a good time, and eat of their good, tho poor Masters Chear; they can reason with him, if any mistake, or hardship be put upon them, and this poor People love to do, and not be at the Dispose of Servants, as they must be where their Access can only be by Door-keepers, Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Governors of the Company.</p>
            <p>I have seen a short Discourse of that Labourer in Charity, Mr. <hi>Tho. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and his Endeavours to promote the Linnen Manufactory, his Work was to relieve the poor, God's way, not by a Tax, which at best is but Man's way, and as it is imployed in <hi>England</hi> not the best. But I lose Mr. <hi>Fermin</hi>; that he did in little, shewed what might be done at large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that would (in my weak Opinion) have been a more probable way, to have inured idle and the most useless Hands in the Kingdom to spinning Linnen, as he proposed, than the Formalities of a Company.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As a Company destroys particular persons, and hinders the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every particular Man would make in the Trade a Company invades, or rather ingrosses; so a Company imposes upon the Nation in general: It is, a Natural Consequence, and let them say what they can, all Men will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, that as they become Masters of the Trade, so they will be of the Prices of the Commodity: and that they must have greater Rates for their Linnen, than private persons could afford it for, is of necessity; otherwise how shall the Grandeur of the Company, Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be maintained, and that which will be more than all the rest, the Frauds, Neglects, and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of their numerous Agents, and Instruments imployed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging part; and it is to be noted, that this Company (to which I believe we have nothing like in Story, if considered in all its preposterous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Machins) hath not the Advantage of Companies that trade by Sea, for they by a Joint Stock make great Adventures in one Bottom, and so are in many things at no more Charge with the Management of Ten thousand pounds in Trade, than a private Man may be with One. But here with our Company it is not so, but on the contrary, the Company must be at more Charge than a private Man in their several Cheques, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolers upon their Servants; whereas every private Man doth his own Work, and as it is always done so to most Advantage, so most especially in this of the Linnen Manufactory, where there must be a particular

Eye to every pound of Thread Weaving, Whitening, and a multitude of other things; all which extraordinary Charge and Difficulty the Company must lie under more than private Men, can no other way be raised, but by lessening the Wages of the Poor that make the Linnen, and raising the Price on the Rich that wear it? Our Laws provide well against Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallers in Markets, and tho not so well as it might be, yet there is some care taken that Men have the fair buying of the Victuals they eat. This I have sometimes thought is like Tithing Mint and Rue, neglecting the more weighty things of the Law, we provide Men should not be cheated in buying a pennyworth of Eggs, but make no provision to secure them from the same Abuse in a hundred pounds laid out in Cloaths. The poor Artizan shall not be oppressed in laying out his penny to one poorer than himself, but he is without Remedy shortened by a Company in his Penny as it comes in. I have heard Complaints of this Nature in greater matters of the publick Sales of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, perhaps if due Consideration were had of these great Ingrossers, there would be sound more Reason to restrain them, than a poor Woman that travels in the Country to buy up and sell in a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket a few Hens and Chickens. But to return to our Corporation for Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Linnen Manufactory.</p>
            <p>I shall now lay down what offers to me, that if it were possible to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it in this Kingdom, that yet it would not be for the Interest of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have a Linnen Manufactory set up as a Trade in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Divine Providence that appoints to every Nation and Country a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Portion, seems to allot that to <hi>England</hi> which was the first acceptable Sacrifice to his Omnipotency, that of the Flock: the Produce of which is the most universal Covering of all the civilized Countries of the World, our Woollen Manufactory; a Talent which no Nation hath to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as we have. This hath been for many Ages the Support of the Nation, imploying the poor at home, our Men and Ships at Sea. Now to decline this, and set up another Manufactory, looks like an extravagant Mechanick, who by his Improvidence hath lost his own Art, and thinks to retrieve his Misfortune by taking up that of another Mans. This is condemned in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, and to be feared in a Community.</p>
            <p>But it will be said, there is not Imployment for the Hands of the Nation in the Woollen Manufactory: and since Linnen carries away so much of our Money, it seems the Interest of the Nation to imploy idle Hands in that which will keep Money in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now tho both these Assertions have too much Truth in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet neither of them have Weight enough to enforce the Conclusion, that the Linnen Manufactory is the only Remedy. If we search into the Bottom of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper we shall find another Cause of our Disease.</p>
            <p>It is not because there is less Woollen Manufactory used in the World than formerly, that our Trade declines, nor yet because we make more than formerly; for it is demonstrable, that from the year 1673 to the year 1680, there was much more Wooll wrought up in <hi>England,</hi> than in eleven years since: Nor is it altogether to be assigned to the present War; for that our Trade decayed in the latter part of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and all the Reign of the late King. The Reasons then for our Decay in the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory seem to be these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Growth of course Woollen Manufactory in <hi>Germany,</hi> with which the <hi>Venetians</hi> trade to <hi>Turkey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Prohibition of our Woollen Manufactory into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Increase of the Woollen Manufactory by our Neighbours with the help of our Wooll, so that in some things they out-do us in the price they can sell at.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:32860:5"/>4. By the great Wear of <hi>East-India,</hi> and other Silks, and the use of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes, which was formerly supplied by our Tammies and Sayes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The want of the Consumption of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which abated all the Reign of the late King.</p>
            <p>There is yet a Cause as valid as any of the former, which for some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons I forbear to mention.</p>
            <p>Now to me it seems possible to Counterpoise all these, and to retrieve our Manufactory, and that by two ways.</p>
            <p>First, By preventing the Transporting of Wooll, which if done, the <hi>French</hi> and others, that now furnish Markets abroad, would not be able to supply their own Expence.</p>
            <p>It may be thought a vain Assertion, after all Attempts that have been made to prevent the Exportation of our Wooll, to say there is yet a way that may effectually do it. Yet I am morally sure it may be done both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and if this were done, there is another thing that might oblige the <hi>French,</hi> when there is a Peace, to take off their Prohibitions on our Manufactory.</p>
            <p>The other way to bring our Woollen Manufactories into esteem abroad, is, to make them so cheap as to undersell the <hi>German</hi> Coarse Manufacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and that may be done with ease, which I can make out upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>These two things if practicable, as I persuade my self they are, will set the Woollen Manufactory on so good a Foot, as together with a Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not yet practised in <hi>England,</hi> will find Imployment for the meanest Hand in <hi>England.</hi> So that there will be rather Want than Superfluity of Hands in the Woollen Manufactory.</p>
            <p>Now if there be any thing in all I have said, it seems reasonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider well, before the Nation gives up its Staple and long continued Trade for a Shadow, as I take the Linnen Manufactory to be: for although I believe it can never come to effect, yet so far it may go as to injure that of the Woollen, by diverting some that are now in i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and so raise the price of Spinning, than which nothing can be more prejudicial; for as I mentioned before, nothing can retrieve our lost Trade abroad, but underselling our Competitors: so then we must labour to make ours as cheap as we can, and not set up another Manufactory, to bid who gives most for Spinners; a ready way to ruin the Clothing Trade of <hi>England,</hi> but not to set up the Linnen, which whenever it thrives must have a better way than the Methods the Company takes.</p>
            <p>But because some pretend this Company may be of good use to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in laying a Foundation for a Linnen Manufactory, for Argument sake allow it doth take. Let us consider, beside what hath been said before of injuring the Woollen Manufactory, how it will affect the Kingdom in the two Pillars that support it, that of the Rents of Land, and the imploying our Ships and Men at Sea, which are thought the Walls of the Nation.</p>
            <p>For the Rents of Land they must certainly fall, for that one Acre of Flax will imploy as many Hands the year round, as the Wooll of Sheep that graze twenty Acres of Ground. The Linnen Manufactory imploys few Men, the Woollen most, Weaving, Combing, Dressing, Shearing, Dying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These Eat and Drink more than Women and Children; and so as the Land that the Sheep graze on raiseth the Rent, so will the Arable and Pasture that bears Corn, and breeds Cattle for their Subsistence.</p>
            <p>Then for the Employment of our Shipping, it will never be pretended that we can arrive to Exportation of Linnen; there are others and too many before us in that: and the Truth is, he that cannot thrive at his own Trade,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32860:5"/>
will hardly in that of another Mans. If we are beat out of our Inheritance the Woollen Manufactory, by Foreigners, over whom we have such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in our Wooll, Fullers-Earth, and long continuance in the Trade, it can be nothing less than a Miracle for us to take from them their Linnen Manufactory, in which they have so much the Ascendant over us.</p>
            <p>I shall end this part of my Discourse with the answer of a West Country Man to his Neighbour, that asked what Voyage he had made in a Fishing at <hi>New Found-Land</hi> that proved not good, <hi>I have made,</hi> said he, <hi>a brave Voyage, as you may guess, for I have sold my Bible and bought a Tobacco-Box.</hi> Would it not be so to this Nation, if they should change the Noblest Manufactory in the World, for the poorest, and most despicable? So are those People in all parts of the World that are Imployed in the Linnen Manufactory, which only thrives where the Country is crowded with Poor, and Bread not to be had at the charge of the Parish; where the Tenant is but a Vassal to his Lord, and there is no power in any to relieve, but in the Lord, who is a stranger to the practice.</p>
            <p>It is a mistake in them that believe the Linnen Manufactory in <hi>Holland</hi> to be the Product of their own Country: it is only the easie part, that of Weaving and Whit'ning, most of their Thred comes from <hi>Saxony,</hi> where there is both Laws and Necessity for Industry; both of which, one as the blessing of God, the other by the impunity of our Government, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is free from. And thus you have my Opinion and Grounds for it, that if it were possible to raise a Linnen Manufactory, it is not profitable to the Kingdom, but of most dangerous Consequence to put that in the Heads of the Poor, that may alter the Imployment of their Hands. I know some Countries where they would have ill Entertainment that should on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence change the Hands of the People; and this at least gives a pretence to the Spinners of Woollen to stand on their terms with their Masters.</p>
            <p>I now come to your third Enquiry; My Opinion of the Company for the Linnen Manufactory of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for that I have the same value as for this of <hi>England,</hi> but for different Causes, and they are these:</p>
            <p>First, Though it must be allow'd that <hi>Ireland,</hi> every thing being consider'd, is the aptest part of the World for a Linnen Manufactory; yet under its present Misfortunes I cannot see how it can be great in it, and that which may be set going in the Kingdom towards so good a Work, a Company seems the ready way to blast; for at the first Planting of a Country (and as <hi>Ireland</hi> now stands, so it must be considered) every Man comes with his design in his Head, some perhaps with a little Mony in their Pockets, lay a Scheme for making Linnen Cloth; they intend to settle themselves where they may find most Spinners, and spend their time in Riding the Country round to incourage them, and buy up the Linnen Yarn. These Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers have their Friends and Partners in <hi>England,</hi> to whom they send over their Linnen, and have back in Returns Tobacco, (for by the way it is to be noted they of <hi>Ireland</hi> are forbidden any but what comes directly from <hi>England</hi>) Hops, and <hi>English</hi> Manufactories. This now is a Trade and probable incouragement to make a growing Manufactory that <hi>England</hi> may gain by, and this way was begun in the latter end of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign with hopeful success. But here these honest Men will meet with an invincible Enemy, with their Standard the Broad Seal set up, giving notice that they are the Men that will incourage and set on foot the Linnen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; and this being Proclaimed puts an end to our several <hi>English</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, and Foreign supplies of Poor that might be drawn to <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Incouragement of a Universal Freedom and Liberty, in setting up the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32860:6"/>
Linnen Manufactory. But however a Company may operate to the driving out the poor that are already in that Business of Linnen I know not, but sure I am there is Experience of other Places that Companies keep out new Stores.</p>
            <p>But the Company will tell you, they hinder none from working or buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Linnen; this would not be believed, if they had not the Broad Seal to tell us so. They are the first Men I ever heard of that were at the Charge of passing a Patent, only to tell us, they intended to do no Body wrong, nor proceed in the Trade they incorporate themselves in; whatever Belief the first part of their Declaration may gain, I leave the Squires of the Company (I mean those that pay the Reckoning) to judge: but for the last part, that they intend not to proceed in the Trade most believe, and yet they equally do Mischief, as if they did; since in the Opinion of the World these Men that incorporate get great Privileges, great Men to head them, and of their Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, raise great Sums of Money of one half of the Company to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in with those that pay nothing but a Trifle for a Pretence. I say all this gives Ground for honest Men that know not the Original Design, to believe that they intended to do as much mischief as they have power for: that is, proceed in buying Linnen Yarn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As the time is most improper for setting up a Linnen Manufactory in <hi>Ireland,</hi> so are the Methods and Constitutions of Companies in <hi>Ireland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland</hi> I take to stand in its Relation to <hi>England</hi> much in the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with our Foreign Plantations, and might be made more beneficial than them all. But if <hi>Ireland</hi> be at first setting out, after this late Devastation, begun with Companies that will, as I said before, be a Barr to the peopling that Kingdom with Foreign Protestants, and <hi>Ireland</hi> can never be safe whilst the <hi>Irish</hi> so over-ballance the <hi>English,</hi> as they do to this day. So then there seems Reason to preserve <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a Foreign Plantation, from the impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemy of <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Irish,</hi> but Companies in Trade will hinder New-comers, and that makes for the <hi>Irish</hi>; this is against the Security of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing <hi>Ireland</hi> may be considered in, is how it stands as a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Plantation to <hi>England</hi> in point of its Trade, and Consumption of our Woollen, Iron, and other Manufactories; and in that, by an Account I have seen, it exceeds all the <hi>West-India</hi> Plantations, as also in that of our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Product, Corn, Hops, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, that which hinders the Increase of People (and that does Companies) abates the Consumption of the Product of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will next consider <hi>Ireland</hi> in its Natural and Artificial Product as a Foreign Plantation, and as such how we should use it. I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned how they consume our Product, we will now see what becomes of theirs, and in that we use them as Foreign Plantations, prescribing them Rules, Methods, and Prohibitions in some of their Commodities, as their Wooll, Linnen, Yarn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we oblige them to send no where but to <hi>England</hi>; and if they be kept to it in their Wooll, as I am sure they may, <hi>England</hi> would find it wants, not abounds in Wooll, for the seeming Excess of Wool in <hi>England</hi> is not because we have too much from <hi>Ireland,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have not all, for one pound of their Wooll works up ten of Foreign, and that enables them in their Manufactories abroad, to furnish the Trade we formerly had intire to our selves. But to return, as we prescribe Rules to <hi>Ireland</hi> what they shall send here, so we do what they shall send to other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32860:6"/>
parts; to our Foreign Plantations they may not send any Manufactories, but have Liberty to send their Provisions, Servants and Horses; and as we confine what, how, and where they may export, so we do in many things their Imports; that they shall import none of our Foreign Plantation Commodities from thence direct, but all from <hi>England.</hi> After all this it may be thought <hi>Ireland</hi> is so intirely a Plantation of <hi>England,</hi> that it may deserve the Care of the Nation, to people that Kingdom, but the Noise of Companies will keep out Planters, and therefore to be suppress'd.</p>
            <p>If any should presume to set up a Grant that might keep out People from the Foreign Plantations, it may be presum'd the Government would lay its Hands on such mistaken Grants; this of the Linnen Manufactory is such, it will keep out People disposed to that Manufactory, for such love to have Choice of Masters.</p>
            <p>Therefore we never see Companies set up in our Foreign Plantations, every Man is Master of his own Invention, Labour and Designs; so it seems the Interest of <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>Ireland</hi> to have the like Freedom there; for if Companies are once admitted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is not the Subjects of either Kingdom shall be Masters of them; there are those in the World that know how to use such Advantages better than we do; and with their Money will soon purchase the Ruling Shares, especially when the Grant is design'd for selling, not trading Shares, and being so bought, the Purchasers have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to set up a Joint-Stock, can sue, and must be sued as a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick with all the other Privileges usual in such Grants. Being thus esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, they shall ingross all the Trade in the Kingdom, let their Company be called what you please, and these Men may live in what part of the World they think fit, and govern the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> by their Factors, tho the Company bears the Name only of the Linnen Manufactory.</p>
            <p>And however the Generality of Men see not the hidden Mysteries and Influences Companies have in Trade, yet Merchants and Handicrafts do; and that is the Reason I find those of <hi>Ireland</hi> give, why that wonderful Statute, (for such I take it to be) which gives greater Privileges to Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than native Subjects, had no Effect, brought not ten Families, some say not one into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all because Men love not Inclosures in Trade, tho they may be in them themselves; for by the Statute before mentioned, any Foreign Protestant that would settle in <hi>Ireland,</hi> might upon his demand, taking the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy before any Justice of Peace, be made free of any City, Trade or Company in the Kingdom, paying twenty shillings, and was also by the same Statute declared, and was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized. But all this would not do whilst there were Companies in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, tho they are not of so appropriate a Constitution as this of the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Manufactory and all Companies of Joint Stocks are.</p>
            <p>I now come to shew how in particular the Company for a Linnen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory in <hi>Ireland</hi> will affect <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It will prejudice <hi>England</hi> in its Manufactories of Fustian, Tapes and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> Ware, much of which are made by the Linnen Yarn of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now tho this Company cannot promote a Linnen Manufactory in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet they may, and if they design any thing, it must be that, ingross the Linnen Yarn in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was formerly sent to <hi>England,</hi> and imployed as aforesaid, the want of which or setting a price upon it, must be of prejudice to the Manufactories of <hi>England,</hi> with some other Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that would swell this Discourse here to mention.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this Company should prevail, of which there is no reason to fear, they by their Compact made with the Company here, have agreed that all the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32860:7"/>
Linnen of <hi>Ireland</hi> shall be sold by the Company here, so then the People of <hi>England</hi> must pay for their Linnen what they please, and that which is yet worse, the Linnen and Linnen Yarn, that hitherto hath been purchased by the Manufactories and Commodities of <hi>England,</hi> the Company will be paid for in Money: And then where is the Difference to have it from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Ireland?</hi> Nor will the Company's selling for Money be an Advantage to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but to the contrary enable the Company to impose on the Kingdom what Goods, and at what Rates they please, when they have beat out the numerous Chapmen that use daily the <hi>Irish</hi> Trade: even the Farmers of the West of <hi>England</hi> would come for <hi>Ireland</hi> with their Hops, Cyder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so the <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are our Bone and our Flesh, dealt with us as Brethren, but it will not be so when the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> is managed by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners in Companies as it seems now design'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The admitting this Company for Linnen Manufactory will be a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the same in all other Trades, and Imployments of the Kingdom. It is said there is a Patent now passing for the Fishing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there may with as much Reason be another for Plowing.</p>
            <p>And why not some publick spirited Projector have a Patent for a more excellent way of cutting Turf, a Fuel much used in <hi>Ireland</hi>?</p>
            <p>This way of appropriating the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> is happily of worse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to <hi>England,</hi> than at first sight appears. Perhaps it will not be thought a Prejudice to <hi>England,</hi> that a Patent is granted for a Fishing in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when it shall be in the Name of Men of <hi>England.</hi> But when this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is transferred to Foreigners, and they with their Men and Ships manage this Fishing, what will <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> get by it? Several Small-Crafts that use to come from <hi>England</hi> to the West of <hi>Ireland</hi> will be beat out of their Trade, and in conclusion <hi>Ireland</hi> made a Province for Trade to any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners that will buy from our projecting Patentees.</p>
            <p>As I said before, <hi>Ireland</hi> is no more than one of our Foreign Plantations, only I think it will be allowed the first place, and more than any other in nearness of Blood, and that of our Nobles, there being many Familes in that Kingdom descended from the ancient Families of this, and most of the Estates in <hi>Ireland</hi> held by the Descent from our Brethren, who purchased it with their Blood. These Reflections may prevail for our Care of them, at least equally to any Colony abroad; and we never think it our prejudice to have them thrive, nor would the Growth of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if rightly disposed or understood. And here give me leave to make a Digression, if it may be call'd so, but you may think it not foreign to the Discourse.</p>
            <p>I find it generally believed, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is as mischievous to our Trade in time of Peace, as it is destructive to our Men and Treasure in time of War. And tho this Opinion never went far with me, yet something I did doubt was in it, until I met with that which gave plain Demonstration to the contrary, and it was this.</p>
            <p>I fell into an entire acquaintance with a Gentleman of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whose Experience, and long Continuance in all the Foreign Trade of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, furnished him with Arguments I could not answer, to prove that <hi>England</hi> was a great Gainer by the Trade of <hi>Ireland.</hi> When I could not confute him, nor he prevail with me, he told me he would shew me that which carried Authority with it, and so he did; being, as he assured me, the Work of some years, as he could spare time to compose it. The whole Discourse takes up many Sheets, upon the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> to all parts, and particular Remarks upon every Commodity exported and imported into that Kingdom, and where, and how it affects <hi>England.</hi> Some other things
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32860:7"/>
he reserved as Secrets from me, as he doth the rest to others; for it was never seen by any but one beside my self. Out of the whole he hath extracted an exact Account of the Exports and Imports for one year in a Medium out of six; and then distinguished what related to <hi>England,</hi> by what Ships brought in, and out; then computed the Value of each Commodity, and to what they were improved being manufactored in <hi>England</hi>; and then what Money in <hi>Specie,</hi> or Bills of Exchange, which is the same, was returned from Foreign Parts to <hi>England</hi> out of the Proceed of Goods sent from <hi>Ireland,</hi> all which being brought to a Sum, it appeared, that <hi>England</hi> gained by <hi>Ireland</hi> more than two Millions Sterling <hi>per annum.</hi> It seemed to me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing, but being, as he affirms, Matter of Fact, for which he hath the Account of the Customs, it is not to be denied, the Breviat is drawn in so plain and intelligible a Method as renders it easie to any Understanding, and therefore to mine: I would fain have prevailed with him to Print the whole Matter, but he thinks it may be made better use of another way; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that as great as this looks, yet it might be improved to much more, if the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> were disposed, as it might be, to the Advantage of <hi>England.</hi> But he said that Kingdom was in no Reign, since the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Ireland,</hi> consulted in its Trade, but left to its self, or treated like an Enemy, all the use made of it was, for Courtiers, Men of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Necessity, to traffick, and dispose it into Grants, Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Offices, and so made it rather a Forest for Game, than a Plantation of Trade and Commerce; and that which continued it so in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, was the Jealousies and Mistakes of <hi>England,</hi> believing it grew too fast, and incroached on their Trade, tho it is demonstrable, <hi>Ireland</hi> doth us no hurt, but where we by our own Laws force it; and that act, pardon the Expression, like Lunaticks that strive to suppress their Shadows, for fear they should assault them.</p>
            <p>None will say <hi>England</hi> would be the worse, if it were double the Acres it now is, and tho the Sea part us from <hi>Ireland,</hi> may not Laws make us one, in our Interest and Trade, and so that <hi>Ireland</hi> may be more profitable to <hi>England</hi> in general, than <hi>Wales</hi> or any County in <hi>England</hi> is to the whole in its proportion? There never was so fair an Opportunity for inriching this Nation by <hi>Ireland</hi> as now; it is by Divine Providence once more put a Blank in our Hands, in which his Majesty may stamp what he pleases: and we have Reason to believe, that he who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures His Royal Person so freely for the Preservation of these Kingdoms, will not deny us any thing that can contribute to our Growth in Trade and Treasure. One thing I must not omit, which I had from this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that to me seems valid for Confirmation of all he asserts: That <hi>Ireland</hi> neither insures nor gains on <hi>England</hi>; for that in the last twenty years of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s greatest Prosperity, not one Man of <hi>England</hi> purchased in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but numbers of <hi>Ireland</hi> have in that time purchased in <hi>England</hi>; as they of that Kingdom, I mean the <hi>English</hi> always do, as they increase their Fortunes. This being so, <hi>Ireland</hi> is to <hi>England</hi> a Mine of Treasure, and affects us, tho in a much larger Proportion, as <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland,</hi> and <hi>Hudson's Bay,</hi> whatever is gain'd in them terminates in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall close this Discourse with the Complaint I have heard from the Generality of Merchants, that when all the Governments of <hi>Europe</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:32860:8"/>
have for more than twenty years past been consulting their Interest in Trade, and how they might improve it, we of <hi>England</hi> make no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for ours, but leave it to the Ravage of Strangers, and the worse Confusions of an ungovern'd Multitude in Trade, whereas, if we had a Council of Trade composed of Merchants from all parts of the Kingdom, set apart for searching into the several Practices of Trade, and Miscarriages therein, <hi>England</hi> would have grown beyond any part of the World in Trade, and Navigation, and might thereby have prevented the wonderful Rise of <hi>France</hi>; whose prodigious Advance in Navigation and Commerce is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to the Experience and Conduct of <hi>Colebert</hi> that was originally bred a Merchant, of whom it is said, that when he was prime Minister of <hi>France,</hi> he would say he did his Master better Service in a Committee of Merchants, than at the Council-Board. We have much greater Funds for Trade than <hi>France</hi> can pretend to; and tho we may want <hi>Coleberts,</hi> yet lesser Men, with greater Helps than he had, might at least retrieve, if not increase our lost Trade, which in several Branches are decayed almost to a total Loss: as that of <hi>Muscovy, Greenland, Newfoundland,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>And if Fame be true, we are in the ready way to lose what we have left, the Exchange being filled with Projects, Wagers, Stock Jobbing, upon imagnary Wrecks, Pharee Companies of Manufactories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which bode ill, and is a Green Sickness in Trade; when Men are taken up with Rubbish, like Maids feeding on Chalk, and Cinders, rejecting wholsome Food. This Evil looks like a spreading Leprosie over the Nation, when Merchants and Tradesmen live like Gamesters on the Spoil of each other, setting up Projects instead of Merchandize, which cunning Men cut into Shares, and so manage their Designs, as to fix their <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> at last on innocent and well meaning Men, to the Ruin of them and their Families. I name not Men or Things to avoid Reflections; but wish those that are faulty in this matter would consider, that such Artifices, however the Hand of Justice in this World cannot reach, yet the Cries of Widows and Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less ascend a Tribunal that brings all things to Judgment. Those Frauds are of a new Stamp, not known in former Ages, and therefore want a Law to restrain them: which, it is hoped, the Great Council of the Nation will look into, and that there may never more appear amongst us any of these Syrens, that a Council of Trade may be the standing Probationers of all new Inventions, and Expedients for Trade, that so Quacks in Trade may be suppress'd, and honest Industry and ingenuous Discoveries incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>
            <p>By which means a Stop may be put to those Men, who like <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s Serpents Teeth sowed in the Ground, bring up Men in Armour killing one another: I wish the Moral prove not truer than the Fable, we see Losses between private Men in Gaming often end in Blood; and National Gaming, Projects and Deceits, with Wagers on the Success of Companies, taking Cities, and Success of Monarchs, must needs alienate the Affections of the Subject one from the other, and some from the King. This to me seems not an accidental Misfortune, but an Artifice of <hi>France,</hi> to raise Divisions amongst us, and bring our Trade to Confusion; for the <hi>French</hi> have as well Jesuits in Trade, as in Religion, to distract us. But we have not such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Champions for the first, as blessed be God we have for the latter: In my weak Judgment and Reflection on the present Condition of this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32860:8"/>
Nation, nothing hath a worse Aspect than the Trade, Navigation, and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories of it, and all for want of publick Spirited Men, that would, like our Ancestors, who whatever they were at home, every Man, when in Parliament, was no less than a County, or Burrough, and spake not himself, but them. If this Bravery of Mind were in our Senators now, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of <hi>England</hi> would not look like a Scramble, for want of due Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; which cannot properly be without Men of practical Heads in Trade appropriated to the Work; nor is the present War a valid Pretext for the Neglect, since there seems as much Reason to provide for Trade in Time of War against Times of Peace, as there is for Armies in Time of Peace against a Time of War, which God in his due time put an End unto.</p>

            <head>SOME Considerations: Humbly Offered to Demonstrate How prejudicial it would be to the <hi>English</hi> Plantations, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown, the Navigation and general Good of this Kingdom, that the sole Trade for Negroes should be granted to a Company with a Joynt-Stock exclusive to all others.</head>
            <p>THe great and unspeakable Advantage the <hi>West-India</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to <hi>England,</hi> is so well known, that it needs no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration to prove it. The only thing Necessary, is to endeavour to improve and increase this mighty advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trade, by securing them from the Insults of their Enemies, and enabling them to make larger quantities of the Commodities of those Colonies.</p>
            <p>Now the means most conducive thereunto will be to make the Trade to <hi>Affrica</hi> open and free for all the Native Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> which Trade for Slaves is chiefly from <hi>Acra</hi> to <hi>Angola,</hi> and contains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1200 Miles Sea-cost, in which extent the present <hi>Affrican</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany have neither Fort, Castle, nor Factory; so that they have not the least colour for a Pretence to an exclusive Right of Trade into those Parts.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that the Riches of the Plantations consists in Slaves chiefly, by whose strength and labour all their Commodities, as To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, Ginger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are produced; and the more Slaves those Plantations are supplyed with, the more Commodities are made, and the stronger they are to defend themselves against any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults. Neither can there be any more danger of being over-stockt with Negroes, than there is that too much Tobacco, Sugar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be sent to <hi>England</hi>; for it is a plain consequence, the more Negroes the more Goods will be produced, the more Goods the more Custom paid, and all those Commodities rendered here at home so cheap as will enable this Nation to send them abroad cheap also. to the great discouraging of the Plantation-Trade of all other Nations. Wherefore it is very plain, that a large supply of Negroes will not only bring great Riches to this Kingdom, but will also greatly Increase our Navigation.</p>
            <p>Whereas on the contrary, should the <hi>Affrican</hi> Trade be inclosed, and confin'd to the Wills and Powers of a Company, the consequence would prove as fatal to the Plantations as a Power given to one Person in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to supply the Gardners with Servants, and the Farmers and Carriers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32860:10"/>
with Horses: It is not to be doubted that the one would be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay yearly for his Servants as much as his Years product would amount to, and the other for his Team as much as the Rent of his Farm, which would prove great Discouragements to their Labour and Industry. This may we reasonably suppose would be the Case of the Planters in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> were there but one Person that must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with Slaves, they being so extreamly Necessary, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to live without them, every Man being rich or poor according to his Stock in Slaves. A Man that may be Proprietor of 10000 Acres of Land, would still be poor had he no stock of Negroes to employ upon it.</p>
            <p>It might be fairly Objected, That the present <hi>Affrican</hi> Company have carryed on their Trade but very imperfectly as to their own Advantage, (notwithstanding that was all the Design they aimed at) as may be plainly proved from the Care they have taken to supply all the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it being very well known that they have not for these 20 Years or more sent one Ships-loading of Negroes to <hi>Virginia</hi> nor <hi>Maryland,</hi> which are two very large Countreys, and capable of making twice as much To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco as they now do, were they but well supplyed with Negroes.</p>
            <p>Every Negro that is sent into those Plantations, makes as much To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco yearly as pays from 30 <hi>l.</hi> to 40 <hi>l.</hi> Sterl. Custom, but the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think that is not material to their Stock: They understand the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are generally poor, and therefore will not venture to trust them; whereas at the same time private Men have, (tho' with the hazard of being seized by the Companies Agents) and had it not been for that Supply those Countries had been in a much worse Condition than at present they are.</p>
            <p>To further demonstrate what before is hinted at, that the Company have no Forts, Castles nor Factories from <hi>Acra</hi> to <hi>Angola,</hi> nor do they suppose them necessary to carry on the Slave-Trade, is plainly proved from their own Practice and Management of that Trade, for when they design a Ship to trade for Slaves, they put a Lee-ward Cargo (as they term it) on board the Ship, and give the Master or the chief Officer of the Ship full power to dispose, barter and sell the said Cargo for their Accounts, allowing them a Commission of 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the said Cargo, taking on board the Negroes, and delivering them to their Factors in the Plantations, who have usually been the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of those Places, who have disposed of the Negroes not always to the poor Planters liking, but necessity hath no law, so must submit to the Will and Pleasure of their Superiours.</p>
            <p>Now this great and growing Evil can only be prevented by permitting more Sellers of Negroes than one, wherefore since it is evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable, that it is no charge to carry on and manage the Slave-Trade, and of what great Concern it is to encourage and support the <hi>English</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations, whereby the Navigation of the Kingdom, Revennues of the Crown, and the General Good of this Narion is so much advanced, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is humbly hoped that the Trade from <hi>Acra</hi> to <hi>Angola</hi> inclusive may be henceforth judged and allowed to be free and open for all the Subjects of this Kingdom.</p>

            <head>A LETTER From a MEMBER of the Parliament of Scotland To his Friend at LONDON, Concerning their late ACT, for Establishing a Company of that Kingdom, Tradeing to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Account you give me by your last, of the various Shapes into which some Persons at <hi>London</hi> have Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed our late Act of Parliament, for Establishing a <hi>Company Tradeing to</hi> Africa <hi>and the</hi> Indies, and their represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it under so many several Colours, to those of different Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and Affections, puts me in mind of the Shepherd, who, ambitious to be thought Weatherwise, never fail'd with an air of Gravity, to publish his pretended Revelations of the ensuing Weather, in various and quite contrary manners to his several Profelites, thereby securing to himself certain Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all Weathers that could happen, if any should dare to call the Infallibility of his Predictions into question. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, The exact Idea you give me of the manner in which these Persons seem to busie themselves in other Mens Affairs, affords me matter sufficient to renew my Speculation, concerning the precarious Nature of all Mankind, in point of Interest; and by Retrospection into some Transactions of this and the last Age, I am induced to trouble you with the following Narrative of some Observations naturally arising from the same, which to me seem directly to point at the Temper, Inclination, and real Interest of all <hi>BRITAIN:</hi> But before I launch into so wide an Ocean, I cannot forbear expressing the Satisfaction I have in Reflecting, That the whole Representatives of a Nation so little experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Trade, as ours, should with so unanimous a Voice <hi>(Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contradicente)</hi> agree to such Measures and Foundation of Trade, as now seem worth the Notice of so great a People as our Neighbouring Nation; and my Satisfaction therein is still the more exalted, by finding in your Account, That the most
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32860:11"/>
Sober and Tradeing People of that Kingdom, are so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any disgust at, or dislike to it, that they generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press an Inclination to be concerned in it: Excepting (as you observe) a few who (every body knows) are preingaged to a dear Self-monopolising Interest, together with some few others, whose Instructions from a Foreign Court must in all probability oblige them to lay hold of any seeming Opportunity for blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coal of Sedition in this Island, that they may fish in troubled Waters: And as a little Leaven leaveneth the whole Lump, you must always expect to find such Persons very vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, by their Emissaries, to amuse the Unthinking Crowd with groundless Apparitions; and by a more industrious Artifice, have their designing Insinuations buz'd into the Ears of some great Ministers, who, having the bent of their Thoughts employed about Matters of State and Government, sutable to the great Sphere in which they move, may possibly, through want of Time, consider this Matter no further than by a bare superficial View of such fallacious Positions as may probably, by Prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, be dogmatically obtruded upon them, to serve private Ends, though mask'd under the specious Pretences of a National Concern. Wherefore, I hope those worthy Gentlemen at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who are concerned in this Company, will endeavour to anticipate any evil Effect of these or the like Mis-representations and groundless Suggestions mention'd in your <hi>Letter,</hi> by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating the Fallacy of such noisie Arguments as (you say) are daily with an Ayre of Magisterial Stiffness dictated at <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raways,</hi> and from thence diffus'd amongst the credulous Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; which, whensoever impartially examin'd and considered, will doubtless appear to have no other Merit at bottom, than a Noose of Sophistry to catch Woodcocks in. For there was never any Constitution of Trade concerted by any Free King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, State or Commonwealth in <hi>Europe,</hi> with greater regard to the Constitutions and Privileges of all other Nations in Amity with His Majesty, than this hath been: yea, should we have had a Committee of English Merchants to Examine and Report our Proceedings while we were Passing this ACT, they could not possibly have been more nicely tender of Encroaching upon, or Interferring with the English Immunities, either Abroad or at Home, than we have been. And in regard that Pyracy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility, and all manner of violent Force, is not only inconsistent with, but diametrically opposit to the natural Lawes and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Trade, we have, in the Body of this ACT, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the <hi>Company</hi> from Acting or Setling in the very <hi>Indies,</hi> without Consent of the Natives. And, in short, we had then the Law of Nations so immediately under our Consideration,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32860:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it was thought by the most Precautious of our Assembly, we had left no room for so much as a possibility of Cavilling. But there's none so blind as they who will not see; and by what you write, I find, had there been any thing in our <hi>Act</hi> that could not bear the Tryal of the strictest Enquiry on the aforesaid Heads, it had certainly been long e're now ript up and printed in Capital Letters by those who were at the Trouble and Expence of Reprinting the <hi>Act</hi> at <hi>London</hi> in several shapes, and under a new Title of their own framing, of design to adapt it more properly to the Notion of Rivalship and Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which (you say) they so industriously preach in Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Oh! but (say they,) Tho' there be nothing in the <hi>Act</hi> that at present may seem to interferr with, yet in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence it may prove pernicious to the Interest of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Answer to which, give me leave to observe, That as this <hi>Act</hi> was calculated for a Common and Publick Good; so though it be a received and standing Maxim, That <hi>No Evil is to be done, that Good may come of it</hi>; yet no reasonable Man will urge from thence the Alternative, <hi>That we ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear doing an apparent Publick Good, because of a remote possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of an imaginary Evil Consequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And before I step further, pray let us take a short View of what Prospect there may be of this bug-bearing Consequence. Why, truly <hi>Scotland</hi> proposeth an Advantage by Foreign Trade, and leaves it at <hi>England</hi>'s door to accept or refuse, being concerned for one Moiety of all the Profits, Emoluments and Advantages arising from such Trade; and by the bye, <hi>England</hi>'s embracing that Offer, seems to me an auspicious Prognostick of future Success. Now, should we happen to be frustrate in our Expectation by this Trade, then all the vain Jealousies of Rivalship and Competition fall of course. But if it should (as I hope it may) answer our Wishes, by a plentiful and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Harvest, in return to our Honest and Infant-Undertaking, <hi>England,</hi> sure, would be mightily hurt, to reap One Half of all the Profits thereof; which I pray God may prove the happy Consequence, so much fear'd by your Monopoly-men.</p>
            <p>Yet all this (you say) cannot please them that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to be implacable; for that there are a certain sort of such good-natur'd Christians in the World, as would chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lose a certain Benefit and Advantage to themselves, than endure the very thoughts of seeing their Neighbours in any tolerable degree of equal Prosperity. In allusion to which,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32860:12"/>
'tis no new thing to tell you, That ever since the Reformation of Religion, the Jesuits, in their various shapes, have left no means unessayed, to propogate the several Sects and Schisms which, during the last Age, have, like a general Contagion, overspread this Island, and undoubtedly gave the first rise to all the sad Catastrophe and dismal Consequences of the late bloody Civil Wars. And even so, since the Union of both Kingdoms under one Monarchy, we have too too manifest and pregnant Proof of how far the <hi>Matchevilian</hi> Maxims of Policy have, by the means of <hi>French</hi> Pensioners and Emissaries, gain'd credit enough at the Court of <hi>England,</hi> to improve the Remnants and Dregs of the ancient Feuds of both Kingdoms into an almost avowed Reason of State (though a much mistaken one) <hi>That it was the Interest of</hi> England, <hi>to suppress and keep</hi> Scotland <hi>poor.</hi> Which was indeed chiefly intended and contrived with design to leave <hi>England</hi> in the lurch, and carry on the real Interest of <hi>France,</hi> where this Maxim had its birth, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining <hi>Scotland</hi> into their ancient League.</p>
            <p>For the Sting and hidden Poyson of the Serpent lay in this, That the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the natural consideration they must needs have of any severe Treatment, or unreasonable and intollerable Exactions imposed upon them by their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering Neighbours, might in time be tempted, like the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in the Wilderness, to <hi>murmur</hi> and <hi>look back into the Onions, Melons, Garlick, and Flesh-pots of their old acquaintance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet by the Influence of this Jesuitical, Barbarous and Hellish Principle, together with the general Corruption of such col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguing and self-designing Ministers as have (to the grief of these Nations) been at the Helm of Affairs during those latter Reigns, this poor Nation in particular hath been most unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully crampt and fetter'd in its natural Liberties, both as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Property, Trade, and indeed, all the real Badges of a Free and independent Kingdom, other than in shadow; till the late Providential and Happy Revolution gave us not only a fair opportunity of reassuming all our ancient Freedoms, and natural Liberties, but also of extending the same, in point of Trade, far beyond those Limits which some of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours seem now unwilling to allow Us.</p>
            <p>And I would gladly offer it to the serious Consideration of any Honest, Unbyass'd and Free-thinking <hi>English-man,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon His present Majesty's Accession to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> when <hi>Ireland</hi> was in a manner quite lopp'd off, <hi>France</hi> making mighty Preparations for War, all <hi>Europe</hi> invelop'd in almost unquenchable Flames; and <hi>England</hi> it self, not free from Intestine Divisions, and Bosom Enemies, who flatter'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32860:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
themselves with the Hopes that <hi>Scotland</hi> would, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of its being so long kept at Arm's-length, be tempted to act by an Interest separate from that of <hi>England?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (I say) upon condition of assurance then, that we would follow <hi>England</hi>'s Example, in placing the Crown of this Realm upon the Heads of our present Gracious Sovereign, and and His late Royal Consort (of Blessed Memory,) when they fear'd our Demurring upon it, <hi>England</hi> would not have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly fulfilled, and put us in possession of the long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Union of both Nations; and settled the same upon such an equal and lasting Foundation, as that we might have freedom of Trading into the very Heart of their Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>For, how little soever the apparent Proportion be, which our Nation may at present seem to bear on the Theatre of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Action, as being in a manner wholly eclypsed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent and radiant Beams of <hi>England</hi>'s more resplendent Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I may without Hyperbole justly say, That as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then stood, We had the Ballance of <hi>Europe</hi> in our Hands.</p>
            <p>Yet all the Considerations we had in view of our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Interest, and the Advantages which we might have made of that Opportunity, soon gave way to the irresistible Zeal and Affection which we had for the Restorer of the Protestant Religion, and common Liberties of <hi>Britain.</hi> For, lest that by any Delays in our Proceedings, the Measures of <hi>England</hi> might be protracted, We did, in almost One Breath, Declare the Throne Vacant, our Selves a Free, Independent State, Their Royal Highnesses King and Queen of this Realm, and war against all Their Majesty's Enemies; as not in the least doubting, but that such our generous and frank Proceeding, with respect to our Neighbours, at so critical a Juncture of Affairs, might in due time reasonably plead for a grateful Resentment from the King and Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> by an equally ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Condescension, on their side, to our having the same freedom of Trade, by which, but a little time before, the wisest and most leading Men of that Nation thought it their Interest to have secured our Affection.</p>
            <p>And that this was the sence of the Court of <hi>England</hi> at that time, needs no further Evidence than His Majesty's two suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive <hi>Speeches</hi> to both Houses of His First Parliament; wherein the consideration of an intire Union with <hi>Scotland</hi> was seriously recommended: In order to which, some Schemes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and consulted by certain Noble Patriots of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:32860:13"/>But no sooner had we, in the interim, solemnly consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, in manner aforesaid, all that <hi>England</hi> could have either wish'd or fear'd from us on that Occasion; but of a sudden, all thoughts of such Union fell to the ground: so that being left to chew our Cud upon that melancholy Proverb, <hi>Post est occasio calva,</hi> which in our Dialect may be render'd, <hi>A True Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is Wise behind-hand</hi>; our next and only Remedy was, to <hi>make the best of a bad Market.</hi> In order to which, we then Resolved to think of framing such wholsom and advantagious Lawes for the Advancement of our poor Trade, as might not only rouze up and animate the depressed and often-disappointed Genius of our fellow-Natives, but also invite and enduce Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers more experienced in Trade, to embarque upon the same bottom with us: and to that end, We did, in the Third Session of this current Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1693, Pass a Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Act,</hi> conceived in general Terms, <hi>for the Encouragement of Foreign Trade,</hi> which you see narrated in the beginning of this last <hi>Act:</hi> By the gracious and necessary Concessions of which, we have a plain Demonstration, through the Vertue of those Noble and worthy Patriots whom His Majesty's discerning Eye singled out of the Crowd of Pretenders to the Offices of State, That our present King is not only <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> but <hi>Pater Patriarum</hi>; and, like the true Emblem of that Immense Deity whose Anointed he is, diffuseth his Favours with a more unconfined and universal Influence than any of our late Kings of <hi>Britain</hi>; Their natural Easiness of Temper giving many fatal Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the mercenary Ministers of those Times, both to impose on their Masters, and prey upon the Liberties of their fellow-Subjects: whereas, our present King doth not only penetrate into what is Just, but hath also a Nobleness of Soul, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, with an impartial Hand, what to him seemeth to be so. And that the giving his Royal Sanction to this <hi>Act,</hi> was the effect both of his Justice and Gratitude, is plain from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Regard which in Reason we must needs suppose him to have had to our frank and seasonable Services, when in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they were most Valuable, and when indeed he stood most in need of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But (you say) the Out-cry is, That these are such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented Concessions and Exceptions as never were, or ought to be granted by a Prince to any Society or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Traders in the World: <hi>Ergo,</hi> —</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:32860:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hah! Is the Hue and Cry got up then? I am glad of it: For certainly, the Great, the Grave, and Wise Men of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do never joyn in that Chorus.</p>
            <p>But to be more serious; 'Tis true, that these Concessions may seem somwhat strange to a People whose Wealth, Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Naval Strength, Foreign Possessions, Plantations, Forts, and Universal Settlements, want no more to carry on what Trade soever they please, than to will and to execute.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, if they look upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, as in it self it is, deficient to a degree of Extremity, in all the necessary Qualifications of Trade above-recited; they must own of course, that nothing less than these Concessions and Exemptions could give this <hi>New Company</hi> a prospect of so much as a Possibility of ever grappling with such infinite and almost insuperable Difficulties as they (and indeed, all other Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings) must necessarily encounter with: so that if such Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had not been granted, we had as good have erected no <hi>Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to these Concessions being without Precedent, I will not pretend to give an Instance of any that are exactly the same with the Privileges contained in this <hi>Act</hi>: but if I let you see much greater, I hope that may serve the turn. Nor to do that, need I go so far from hence, as to search into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of other Nations, such as <hi>France, Holland, Denmark,</hi> and others who have given illimited Powers, and vast En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to their respective Tradeing Companies; but even in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when we could not be presumed to have had any great Notions of Trade about Thirty five Years past, upon the Restauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. in his First Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the several Sessions thereof, (before the French King had time to plant his Janizaries in the Court of <hi>England,</hi>) there were several <hi>Acts</hi> Pass'd in favour of Trade and Manufactories, with Privileges and Exemptions far exceeding any in this <hi>Act,</hi> with respect to the Purposes for which they were granted, <hi>Mutatis Mutandis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that I may not seem to speak altogether without Book, I shall give you an Instance of one for all; namely, the <hi>Act</hi> Pass'd, in the Year 1661, <hi>for the Fishings, and Erecting of Companies for Promoting the same</hi>; which being too long to be transcribed, I send you, by way of <hi>Postscript,</hi> a short Abstract of the most considerable Privileges and Exemptions therein contained, as they stand in order, in the <hi>Act</hi> it self; and all these were Granted for Perpetuity: Whereas, all the most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Concessions in this late <hi>Act</hi> are limited, some to Ten, some to Twenty one Years; in which time (God knows) we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32860:14"/>
must run very fast, to come up with any of all our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations, who have started so long before Us.</p>
            <p>Now let us further compare both the said <hi>Acts,</hi> and the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses for which they were severally intended, and then, with respect to this last, we must think of going we know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, undergo the Danger of boysterous Storms, and long Voyages, with which we are not acquainted: tye up our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs to strict, regular, and unaccustomed Diets; prepare against the Effects of quite contrary Climates, and there pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase Plantations, Collonies, Settlements, and build Forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet as to the Time when all this will happen, he must be a wiser Man than I, that can tell.</p>
            <p>But as to the former <hi>Act for the Fishing,</hi> &amp;c. all Matters thereunto relating were to be transacted in view of our own Doors, and in our own Power. But then you'll ask me, How it came to pass, that this excellent Constitution for our Fishings has had no better Effect? Why truly, I'll tell you, For the very same Reason which may possibly prove the Overthrow of this New Undertaking (which God forbid) if we have no better luck in getting honester Men at the Head of it: For the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have got most of their Wealth by Fishing in other Mens Waters, looking upon us then with a jealous Eye, found a way (as it was then believ'd) to grease a certain Great Man in the Fist; who thereupon embarqued himself, and all his Friends, with all his Might, on our Bottom; and who being once at the Head of all, thwarted all, over-rul'd all, and ruin'd all: For the Honest and Well-meaning Men, finding themselves no other than Cyphers, grew wearied, and so gave up the Cudgels.</p>
            <p>By all which, you have a plain Demonstration and Proof, That what may do in one Nation, will not do in another. But I'm resolv'd to wait with Patience, and hope for the best: <hi>Exitus acta probat</hi>; the meaning of which is in English, <hi>The Proof of the Pudding is in the Eating.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But then (you say,) The unanswerable and thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Dilemma,</hi> which these Grumblers would seem, and do actually boast, to fasten upon His Majesty, is, That either he must retract what he has done, by some publick Mark of his Discountenancing this <hi>New Company,</hi> or otherwise he cannot in reason deny the like Concessions to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Tradeing Companies of <hi>England,</hi> who have so largely contributed towards the Expence of this present War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:32860:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is truly the most plausible Difficulty of all that's offer'd, and such a Noose as may readily catch Larks, but will never gravel the judicious part of Mankind more than any of the former, as being all of one piece. The better to obviate which, I shall give you a plain, easie, just and adequate Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel in the like Case. As for Example: Supposing me Lord of a considerable Mannour producing abundance of Corn, Hay, Fruit, and having all the marks of a fertile and well-cultivated Soil, which I have Lett to Farm for a certain Annual or Yearly Rent; which Rent I have, by Contract of Marriage, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Payment of my Wife's Joynture: in the interim, there comes to me an Undertaker, with a Proposal, That whereas I am also Proprietor of a certain piece of unprofitable, waste Ground, together with some Acres of Land quite under Water, both which yield me no Rent; he will engage, at his own Hazard, Labour and Expence, to cultivate the one, and drain the other, providing I grant him a Lease thereof free of all Rent for Twenty one Years; to which I readily and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably assent, as foreseeing the Advantage that must thereby accrue, if not to my self immediately, yet to my Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. Upon the executing of which Lease, should he who Farm'd my Principal Mannour in manner aforesaid, come and tax me of being an exacting and partial Landlord, if I would not also let him sit Rent-free, as well as his new Neighbour-Undertaker; Pray, what Regard do you think I ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to any Demand that were grounded only upon such a Reason? The Application whereof is so easie and natural, that it were calling your Judgment into question, to expatiate any more upon that Head: Yet lest you may say that <hi>omne si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile est dissimile,</hi> and think this to be only an indirect Answer to all the Parts of your <hi>Objection,</hi> I shall touch them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
            <p>And, First, As to any publick Mark of His Majesty's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance to this <hi>New Company,</hi> which would be the doing and undoing of a thing with the same breath, is so tender a Point, that the very Thoughts of it is attacking and wounding His Majesty, at once, in two of his most peculiar Attributes, <hi>Wisdom in Council,</hi> and <hi>Stedfastness of Resolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then as to what Concessions may be advisable to be given to all or any of the Tradeing Companies of <hi>England,</hi> I must suspend my weak Judgment therein, the King, and ensuing Parliament, being the only proper Judges thereof; only thus far I'll venture to judge, That whoever audaciously dare pretend to anticipate the Sence of so Great and August an Assembly, by Dictating in Coffee-houses what his Arrogance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32860:15"/>
thinks, forsooth, they ought to do, may likewise think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self well come off at last, if he escape with only a Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>And then as to the last Branch of the <hi>Objection,</hi> which seems to point at, <hi>our not contributing, so largely as they have, towards the Expence of the War;</hi> let us consider, whether they think Us equally concerned? and whether We may expect a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable share of the Glory and Advantage? If not, then we are but Auxiliaries, and ought not to undergo any narrow scrutiny on that head: For, <hi>A given Horse ought not to be examin'd in the Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing (as indeed I think) We are equally concern'd in the same Common Cause; it must be confess'd, That we cannot boast of any great store of Wealth, (for which we may partly thank those Familiar Spirits of <hi>France,</hi> who by a Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain Trick of <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> have too often assumed the shapes of Court-Cards, in the most considerable Games which have (till of late Years) been play'd on the English Stage;) yet, in Proportion to what our Strength was, in any tollerable measure, able to bear, we have always signified our good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, by giving such Supplies, from time to time, as have not only rais'd very considerable Numbers of excellent Troops, but also Maintain'd the same, till call'd out of the Nation by His Majesty, and then we successively rais'd others, to be a constant Nursery for the English Army. This was all we could do; and could we have done more, we stood in need of no Spurr to do it: The <hi>Widow's Mite</hi> in the Gospel was more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Our Saviour, than all the large Offerings of those who gave only out of the Abundance of their Superfluities: <hi>Of them to whom much hath been given, much shall be required.</hi> And if His Majesty should question us upon this head, we can justly answer him with a Scripture Phrase, <hi>Silver and Gold have we none; but such as we have, we give unto him.</hi> True Hearts, and Valiant Hands; Brave Trusty Lads, arm'd with Natural Buff, who dare encounter Fire and Smoke, and whose Undaunted Resolution and Valour, upon all Occasions of Tryal, have, to the Diminution of their Number, given at least some small Addition to the Advancing Glory of the English Arms: which if we had not given, an equal Number of equal Troops from any of our most entirely beloved Confederate Princes (if any such they had to spare) would certainly be good Meat, but must needs have cost <hi>England</hi> very dear Sauce.</p>
            <p>And since I now treat of our Usefulness to <hi>England,</hi> how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle soever they may value it; I shall beg leave to look back again upon the further Motives that induced us to be forward
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32860:15"/>
in Passing this <hi>Act,</hi> and take also a further view of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that may probably arise, not only unto our Selves, but to <hi>England</hi> in general, by it.</p>
            <p>As to the First of these, we observed, That the Customs, Fashions, and Luxury of other Nations, having bewitch'd our Travelling Nobility and Gentry, had introduced a certain kind of Necessity among us, of using and consuming many more and greater quantities of Foreign Commodities than were so much as ever known almost to the honest Simplicity of our plain and wise Fore-Fathers, and more truly than we had superfluous Money to pay for; especially at such exorbitant Rates as are impos'd upon us at the third, fourth, fifth, and (possibly) sixth hand, by our own Pedlars, and the exacting Broakers of all other Countries about us. This we see a growing Evil, and such as we could not justly answer for, to our Constituents, who were equally concerned, if we had not taken it into our most serious Consideration, and with all expedition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the most effectual Remedy we could think of; which, after all our Consultations, and the best Advice we could have, terminated in this <hi>Act</hi>; as hoping thereby, that at some time or other we may, by degrees, come to have at first Hand, and upon an equal Lay, such Foreign Commodities as are now palm'd upon us.</p>
            <p>By all which, you may plainly see, we had no sinister De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; we meant no harm to any other Kingdom, State, or Company: <hi>Evil to them that Evil think:</hi> We had no thoughts of drowning our Neighbour's Garden, but of watering our own; and I have no reason to doubt, but that the Simplicity and Honesty of our Intention therein, will upon all occasions meet with a sutable Return.</p>
            <p>And as to what further Advantages <hi>England</hi> may probably reap from this <hi>Act</hi>; I think, with submission, that of all sorts of Men, the <hi>English East-India Company</hi> hath least reason to murmur at it; and I am glad to hear the Wisest of them do not, nor indeed, any of them (I believe) at their Heart. For, whatsoever Concessions, Exemptions, or Establishment, the Wisdom of the ensuing Parliament may think fit to grant to that Company, they have reason enough, from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their own Mismanagement, which (I humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume) occasion'd the late Treatment some of them had at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> to ground the best part of their Hopes for better Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there at this time, upon the Emulation which Our <hi>Act</hi> hath seemingly entitl'd them to raise in the Hearts of their Friends in Parliament, whom I heartily wish to be many: <hi>Salvo Jure cujuslibet.</hi> For I am sure, the World is spacious enough to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32860:16"/>
contain both Them, and the <hi>Scotch Company,</hi> for more Efforts than either one or other, or both of them, are able to put in execution. They may, in time, be serviceable each to the other, <hi>Manus Manum fricat</hi>; and as I hope, the <hi>English Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> may have reason, before the Determination of the ensuing Session, to Thank the King and Parliament. They will at the same time be pleas'd to remember, that <hi>they owe us a Day in Harvest</hi>; that is, some seasonable piece of Friendship.</p>
            <p>Now, if the ensuing Parliament do (as I believe they will) take the <hi>East-India Company</hi> into their Care, whether out of a particular Regard to the said Company, or with respect to the Interest of the whole Nation, or out of Emulation, from a mix'd Consideration of both; I shall have infinite Satisfaction, to find that we are so far useful to our Neighbours, as to let them see that to be their Interest now, which for some Years past they at least seem'd to have overlooked, till we put them in mind of it. And my Hopes are, That if Emulation will once enter within the Doors of that Noble Assembly, they will raise their Thoughts upon the very Wings of Emulation, and <hi>take the right Sow by the Lugg;</hi> that is, cast their Eyes about them, and point at Objects worthy of such Noble Efforts as They only are able to put in Practice, by curbing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Britain,</hi> and putting some stop to the Career and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Greatness of its Rivals in Trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whose Affection or Friendship <hi>England</hi> can be no longer secure, than they are sure of Gaining by <hi>England:</hi> Whereas, We poor Mortals must at all times look upon our selves as in the State of Matrimony, <hi>For better for worse</hi>: So that if we are not allowed some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable measure of <hi>Due Benevolence,</hi> that Essential Part of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Duty, the World will certainly look upon Us as the more excusable, if at some time or other we should venture to peep abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But still these Grumblers (you say) do urge that this <hi>New Company</hi> will Steal vast Quantities of Goods both by Sea and Land into <hi>England,</hi> and over-stock the Markets there with <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, to be Sold at Under-rates, to the apparent loss of the English <hi>East-India</hi> and <hi>Affrican</hi> Companies.</p>
            <p>This is truly a very wide supposition; yet supposing it all to be true, (as I believe it cannot) pray wherein is <hi>England</hi> hurt by it? For over all <hi>England</hi> there must be a vast many more Buyers than Sellers of any one particular Commodity, and as <hi>Of two Evils the least is to be chosen</hi>; so, <hi>Of two interferring Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, the most publick and universal good of these two is always preferrable to the other</hi>; then beyond dispute, the Buyers of such particular Commodity (whom I take to be the Body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) will find it their Interest at all times, to beat down the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32860:16"/>
Market-price; especially of Forreign Goods; otherwise our Forefathers of both Nations, were very much overseen to make so many Laws, which stand yet Unrepealed, against the Forestalling of Markets, and the Engrossing of Commodities into few hands. So that if all Restrictions, Limitations, and Prohibitions upon Trade between both Nations were wholly abrogated, the great and natural ends of Trade, would (in my humble opinion) be more universally and much better answered.</p>
            <p>Now, upon summing up the Evidence on both sides, I find we must reckon upon many Enemies beyond-Sea: But I hope I may modestly conclude, That after a true Scrutiny is made, this <hi>Act</hi> will meet with no Enemies within the Isle of <hi>Britain,</hi> but who may be comprehended in one or other of two sorts, and these Two (some say) very near related: The first are, such who may seemingly grumble at this <hi>Act,</hi> for no other reason, but to make a Scaling-ladder of it, to a Wall which (without it) they were past all hopes of ever getting over. The others are, a certain sett of Men, who (like Water-men) row one way, and look another. From both which, I hope, the Legislative Power and Government of both Nations will protect this Orphan.</p>
            <p>To Conclude then: As Almighty God, in his All-wise Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, often revealeth and brings to pass his Great and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Purposes, by ordinary and unexpected Means; who knows, but that the harmonious Unity which (I hope) will appear in the Equal, Just, and Impartial Management and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of this New <hi>Scotch-English,</hi> or <hi>English-Scotch Indian Company,</hi> may, in good time, be a happy Motive and Inducement to (at least) all the Wise Men of either Nation, to lay aside misplaced Passion, the Prejudices of Infancy and Education; Reason justly for their Own and Publick Interests sake; obliterate and bury in oblivion the distinguishing Names of <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>English</hi>; and then voluntarily list themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the United Banner of Undivided <hi>Britain</hi>; to be one in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and Inclination, in Offence and Defence. From the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of which happy Day, we may date the <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>BRITAIN</hi>'s being Truly GREAT. And pray, what should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? Nature seems to have intended Us for One People, as having concentered us within the same Liquid Walls; we are the Subjects of One King; we speak the same Language, differing only in Dialect, as most Counties do; we profess the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, differing only in some Forms, which may or may not be; our Lawes point at the same End, to distribute Justice, and defend Liberty and Property: All which may be soon reconciled, if the Wisdoms of both Nations should once heartily set about it.</p>
            <p>No Man alive can have greater Veneration for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32860:17"/>
and People of <hi>England,</hi> or be more tender of giving them any the least umbrage of Offence, than my self: But if any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Person will, from the Light within him, apply to his own Breast any Expression herein that may seem harsh, that's his fault, and not mine: In which case, I'd advise him, like a Friend, to lie still and be quiet; expiate for any former Escapes in his Life, by a better Regulation of his Actions in time to come; submit to all Laws and Ordinances of such as are put in Authority over us, and let the Wisdom of the Nation Rule the Nation.</p>
            <p>If herein I have not answered your Expectation, yet you have an Instance of my hearty and sincere good Wishes to the Interest of <hi>Britain,</hi> and of my readiness to comply with your Desire, whensoever you are pleas'd to Command,</p>
