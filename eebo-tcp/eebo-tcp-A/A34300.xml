            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Clear Wit, sound
Judgment and a
Merciful Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
are things so rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
inexcusable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
them with any
thing less excellent in
<pb facs="tcp:61573:3"/>
its kind. My know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of you were a
sufficient Caution to
me, to avoid your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of this Trifle, had
I not as intire a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Since I have
drawn my Pen for a
Rencounter, I think it
better to engage where,
though there be Skill
enough to Disarm me,
there is too much Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
to Wound;
<pb facs="tcp:61573:3"/>
for so shall I have the
saving Reputation of an
unsuccessful Courage,
if I cannot make it a
drawn Battle. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
the Comparison
intimates something of
a Defiance, and savours
of Arrogance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since I am Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Fear which I cannot

Policy of Cowards and
lay this Novel unarm'd,

naked and shivering at
your Feet, so that if it
should want Merit to
challenge Protection,
yet, as an Object of
Charity, it may move
Compassion. It has been
some Diversion to me
to Write it, I wish it
may prove such to you
when you have an hour
to throw away in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I have at least
beforehand, that in its

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SOME Authors are so fond of
a Preface, that they will write
one tho' there be nothing more
in it than an Apology for its self.
But to show thee that I am not
one of those, I will make no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for this, but do tell thee that
I think it necessary to be prefix'd to
this Trifle, to prevent thy over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
<pb facs="tcp:61573:6"/>
looking some little pains which I
have taken in the Composition of the
following Story. Romances are
generally composed of the Constant
Loves and invincible Courages of
Hero's, Heroins, Kings and Queens,
Mortals of the first Rank, and so
forth; where lofty Language, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Contingencies and impossible
Performances, elevate and surprize
the Reader into a giddy Delight,
which leaves him flat upon the
Ground whenever he gives of, and
vexes him to think how he has suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
himself to be pleased and
transported, concern'd and afflicted
at the several Passages which he
has Read, <hi>viz.</hi> these Knights Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to their Damosels Misfortunes,
and such like, when he is forced
to be very well convinced that 'tis
all a lye. Novels are of a more
familiar nature; Come near us,
<pb facs="tcp:61573:6"/>
and represent to us Intrigues in
practice, delight us with Accidents
and odd <hi>Events,</hi> but not such as
are wholly unusual or unpresidented,
such which not being so distant
from our Belief bring also the
pleasure nearer us. Romances give
more of Wonder, Novels more
Delight. And with reverence be
it spoken, and the Parallel kept
at due distance, there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of equality in the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they bear in reference
to one another, with that between
Comedy and Tragedy; but the
<hi>Drama</hi> is the long extracted from
Romance and History: 'tis the
Midwife to Industry, and brings
forth alive the Conceptions of the
Brain. <hi>Minerva</hi> walks upon the
Stage before us, and we are more
assured of the real presence of Wit
when it is delivered <hi>viva voce</hi>—
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61573:7"/>
                  <l>Segnius irritant animos demissa</l>
                  <l>per aurem,</l>
                  <l>Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta</l>
                  <l>fidelibus, &amp; quae</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Since all Traditions must indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
give place to the <hi>Drama,</hi> and
since there is no possibility of giving
that life to the Writing or Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Story which it has in
the Action, I resolved in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beauty to imitate <hi>Dramatick</hi>
Writing, namely, in the Design,
Contexture and Result of the
Plot. I have not observed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in a Novel. Some I have
seen begin with an unexpected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
which has been the only
surprizing part of the Story,
cause enough to make the Sequel
<pb facs="tcp:61573:7"/>
look flat, tedious and insipid; for
'tis but reasonable the Reader
should expect it not to rise, at least
to keep upon a level in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;
for so he may be kept
on in hopes that at some time or
other it may mend; but the 'tother
is such a balk to a Man, 'tis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
him up stairs to show him
the Dining-Room, and after force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to make a Meal in the
Kitchin. This I have not only
endeavoured to avoid, but also
have used a method for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
purpose. The design of the
Novel is obvious, after the first
meeting of <hi>Aurelian</hi> and <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito</hi>
with <hi>Incognita</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi>
and the difficulty is in bringing it to
pass, maugre all apparent obstacles,
within the compass of two days.

in opposition to the main
<pb facs="tcp:61573:8"/>
Design, <hi>viz.</hi> of marrying two
Couple so oddly engaged in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
Amour, I leave the Reader
at his leisure to consider: As also
whether every Obstacle does not in
the progress of the Story act as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to that purpose, which at
first it seems to oppose. In a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
this would be called the Vnity
of Action; here it may pretend to
no more than an Vnity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance.
The Scene is continued
in <hi>Florence</hi> from the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Amour; and the time
from first to last is but three days.
If there be any thing more in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
resembling the Copy which
I imitate (as the Curious Reader
will soon perceive) I leave it to
show it self, being very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
how much more proper it
had been for him to have found out
this himself, than for me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess
<pb facs="tcp:61573:8"/>
him with an Opinion of
something extraordinary in an
Essay began and finished in the
idler hours of a fortnight's time:
for I can only esteem it a laborious
idleness, which is Parent to so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
a Birth. I have grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Bookseller in pretending
an occasion for a Preface; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two Persons concern'd are the
Reader and my self, and if he be
but pleased with what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
for that end, my satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
follows of course, since it will
be proportion'd to his Approbation
or Dislike.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>AVRELIAN</hi> was the only
Son to a Principal Gentleman of
<hi>Florence.</hi> The Indulgence of his
Father prompted, and his Wealth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him, to bestow a generous Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon him, whom, he now began to
look upon as the Type of himself; an
Impression he had made in the Gayety
and Vigour of his Youth, before the Rust
of Age had debilitated and obscur'd the
Splendour of the Original: He was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
That he ought not to be sparing in
the Adornment of him, if he had Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61573:10"/>
to beautifie his own Memory.
Indeed <hi>Don Fabio</hi> (for so was the Old
Gentleman call'd) has been observ'd
to have fix'd his Eyes upon <hi>Aurelian,</hi> when
much Company has been at Table, and
have wept through Earnestness of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if nothing hapned to divert the
Object; whether it were for regret, at
the Recollection of his former self, or
for the Joy he conceiv'd in being, as it
were, reviv'd in the Person of his Son,
I never took upon me to enquire, but
suppos'd it might be sometimes one, and
sometimes both together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian,</hi> at the Age of Eighteen Years,
wanted nothing (but a Beard) that the
most accomplished <hi>Cavalier</hi> in <hi>Florence</hi>
could pretend to: he had been Educated
from Twelve Years old at <hi>Siena,</hi> where
it seems his Father kept a Receiver, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a large Income from the Rents of
several Houses in that Town. <hi>Don Fabio</hi>
gave his Servant Orders, That <hi>Aurelian</hi>
should not be stinted in his Expences,
when he came up to Years of Discretion.
By which means he was enabled, not
only to keep Company with, but also to
confer many Obligations upon Strangers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61573:10"/>
of Quality, and Gentlemen who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
from other Countries into <hi>Italy,</hi>
of which <hi>Siena</hi> never wanted store, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Town most delightfully Situate,
upon a Noble Hill, and very well suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Strangers at first, by reason
of the agreeableness and purity of the
Air: There also is the quaintness and
delicacy of the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue most
likely to be learned, there being many
publick Professors of it in that place;
and indeed the very Vulgar of <hi>Siena</hi>
do express themselves with an easiness
and sweetness surprizing, and even
grateful to their Ears who understand
not the Language.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Aurelian</hi> contracted an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with Persons of Worth of
several Countries, but among the rest
an intimacy with a Gentleman of
Quality of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Nephew to the
Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who had so
wrought himself into the Affections
of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> through a Conformity of
Temper, an Equality in Years, and
something of resemblance in Feature
and Proportion, that he look'd upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61573:11"/>
him as his second self. <hi>Hippolito,</hi> on
the other hand, was not ungrateful
in return of Friendship, but thought
himself either alone or in ill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
if <hi>Aurelian</hi> were absent: but
his Uncle having sent him to travel,
under the Conduct of a Governour,
and the two Years which limited his
stay at <hi>Siena</hi> being expired, he was put
in mind of his departure.</p>
            <p>His Friend grew melancholy at the
News, but considering that <hi>Hippolito</hi>
had never seen <hi>Florence,</hi> he easily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with him to make his first
Journey thither, whither he would
accompany him, and perhaps prevail
with his Father to do the like through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Travels.</p>
            <p>They accordingly set out, but not
being able easily to reach <hi>Florence</hi>
the same Night, they rested a League
or two short, at a <hi>Villa</hi> of the great
Duke's called <hi>Poggio Imperiale,</hi> where
they were informed by some of his
Highness's Servants, That the Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of <hi>Donna Catharina</hi> (near Kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to the great Duke) and <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61573:11"/>
de Rovori,</hi> were to be solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
the next day, and that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Preparations had been making
for some time past, to illustrate the
Solemnity with Balls and Masques,
and other Divertisements; that a
Tilting had been proclaimed, and to
that purpose Scaffolds erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
the Spacious Court, before the
Church <hi>Di Santa Croce,</hi> where were
usually seen all Cavalcades and Shews,
performed by Assemblies of the Young
Nobility: That all Mechanicks and
Tradesmen were forbidden to work
or expose any Goods to Sale for
the space of three days; during
which time all Persons should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
at the Great Duke's Cost;
and publick Provision was to be made
for the setting forth and furnishing
a multitude of Tables, with Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for all Comers and Goers, and
several Houses appointed for that use
in all Streets.</p>
            <p>This Account alarm'd the Spirits of
our Young Travellers, and they were
overjoy'd at the prospect of Pleasures
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61573:12"/>
they foresaw. <hi>Aurelian</hi> could not
contain the satisfaction he conceiv'd
in the welcome Fortune had prepar'd
for his dear <hi>Hippolito.</hi> In short, they
both remembred so much of the
pleasing Relation had been made
them, that they forgot to sleep, and
were up as soon as it was light,
pounding at poor Signior <hi>Claudio</hi>'s
Door (so was <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Governour
call'd) to rouse him, that no time
might be lost till they were arriv'd
at <hi>Florence,</hi> where they would furnish
themselves with Disguises and other
Accoutrements necessary for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of their Design of sharing in
the publick Merriment; the rather
were they for going so early because
<hi>Aurelian</hi> did not think fit to publish
his being in Town for a time, least his
Father knowing of it, might give some
restraint to that loose they design'd
themselves.</p>
            <p>Before Sun rise they entred <hi>Florence</hi>
at <hi>Porta Romana,</hi> attended only by
two Servants, the rest being left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
to avoid notice; but, alas! they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61573:12"/>
needed not to have used half that
caution; for early as it was, the
Streets were crowded with all sorts
of People passing to and fro, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man employ'd in something re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Diversions to come; so
that no notice was taken of any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
a Marquess and his Train might
have pass'd by as unregarded as a
single Fachin or Cobler. Not a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in the Streets but echoed the
tuning of a Lute or thrumming of a
Gitarr: for, by the way, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Florence</hi> are strangely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the love of Musick, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that scarce their Children can
go, before they can scratch some
Instrument or other. It was no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
Spectacle to our Cavaliers
(who, seeing they were not observ'd,
resolv'd to make Observations) to
behold the Diversity of Figures and
Postures of many of these Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Here you should have an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Vallet, who, Mimick'd the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of his Master, leaning care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
against the Window, with his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61573:13"/>
Head on one side, in a languishing
Posture, whining, in a low, mournful
Voice, some dismal Complaint; while,
from his sympathizing <hi>Theorbo,</hi> issued
a Base no less doleful to the Hearers.
In Opposition to him was set up per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a Cobler, with the wretched
Skeleton of a Gitarr, battered and
waxed together by his own Industry,
and who with three Strings out
of Tune, and his own tearing hoarse
Voice, would rack attention from the
Neighbourhood, to the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of many more moderate Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
who, no doubt, were full as
desirous to be heard. By this time
<hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Servant had taken a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and was returned, to give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
an Account of it. The Cavaliers
grown weary of that ridiculous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
which was diverting at
first sight, retired whither the Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey
conducted them; who, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Directions, had sought
out one of the most obscure Streets
in the City. All that day, to the
evening, was spent in sending from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61573:13"/>
one Brokers Shop to another, to
furnish them with Habits, since they
had not time to make any new.</p>
            <p>There was, it happened, but one
to be got Rich enough to please our
young Gentlemen, so many were
taken up upon this occasion. While
they were in Dispute and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
one another, (<hi>Aurelian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
that <hi>Hippolito</hi> should wear it,
and he, on 'tother hand, forswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it as bitterly) a Servant of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>'s
came up and ended the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
telling them, That he had
met below with the <hi>Vallet de Chambre</hi>
of a Gentlemen, who was one of the
greatest Gallants about the Town,
but was at this time in such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he could not possibly be at the
Entertainment; whereupon the Vallet
had designed to dress himself up in
his Master's Apparel, and try his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
at Court; which he hearing,
told him he would inform him how
he might bestow the Habit for some
time much more to his profit if not
to his pleasure, so acquainted him with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61573:14"/>
the occasion his Master had for it.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> sent for the Fellow up, who
was not so fond of his design as not
to be bought off it, but upon having
his own demand granted for the use of
it, brought it; it was very Rich, and
upon tryal, as fit for <hi>Hippolito</hi> as if
it had been made for him. The
Ceremony was performed in the
Morning, in the great Dome, with
all magnificence correspondent to the
wealth of the great Duke, and the
esteem he had for the Noble Pair.
The next Morning was to be a Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the same Night a Masquing
Ball at Court. To omit the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the universal Joy, (that had
diffus'd it self through all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
of Wine, which convey'd it
in large measures to the People)
and only relate those effects of it
which concern our present Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers.
You must know, that about
the fall of the Evening, and at that
time when the <hi>aequilibrium</hi> of Day and
Night, for some time, holds the Air
in a gloomy suspence between an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61573:14"/>
to leave the light, and
a natural impulse into the Dominion
of darkness. About this time our
Hero's, shall I say, sally'd or slunk
out of their Lodgings, and steer'd
toward the great Palace, whither,
before they were arrived, such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
number of Torches were on
fire, that the day, by help of these
Auxiliary Forces, seem'd to continue
its Dominion; the Owls and Bats
apprehending their mistake, in count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hours, retir'd again to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
darkness; for Madam Night
was no more to be seen than she was
to be heard; and the Chymists were
of Opinion, That her fuliginous
Damps rarefy'd by the abundance of
Flame, were evaporated.</p>
            <p>Now the Reader I suppose to be
upon Thorns at this and the like
impertinent Digressions, but let him
alone and he'll come to himself; at
which time I think fit to acquaint
him, that when I degress, I am at
that time writing to please my self,
when I continue the Thread of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61573:15"/>
Story, I write to please him; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
him a reasonable Man, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him satisfied to allow me this
liberty, and so I proceed.</p>
            <p>If our Cavaliers were dazled at the
splendour they beheld without doors,
what surprize, think you, must they
be in, when entering the Palace they
found even the lights there to be but
so many foils to the bright eyes that
flash'd upon 'em at every turn.</p>
            <p>A more glorious Troop no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
ever assembled; all the fair of
<hi>Florence,</hi> with the most accomplished
Cavaliers, were present; and however
Nature had been partial in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on some better Faces than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Art was alike indulgent to
all, and industriously supplyed those
Defects she had left, giving some Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
also to her greatest Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
Every body appear'd well
shap'd, as it is to be supposed, none
who were conscious to themselves
of any visible Deformity would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to come thither. Their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
was equally glorious, though
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61573:15"/>
each differing in fancy. In short,
our Strangers were so well bred,
as to conclude from these appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Perfections, that there was not
a Masque which did not at least hide
the Face of a Cherubim. Perhaps
the Ladies were not behind hand in
return of a favourable Opinion of
them: for they were both well
dress'd, and had something inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
pleasing in their Air and Mien,
different from other People, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
differing from one another.
They fansy'd that while they stood
together they were more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken notice of than any in the
Room, and being unwilling to be
taken for Strangers, which they
thought they were, by reason of
some whispering they observed near
them. They agreed upon an hour of
meeting after the company should
be broke up, and so separately
mingled with the thickest of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.
<hi>Aurelian</hi> had fixed his eye
upon a Lady whom he had observ'd
to have been a considerable time in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61573:16"/>
close whisper with another Woman;
he expected with great impatience
the result of that private Conference,
that he might have an opportunity
of engaging the Lady whose Person
was so agreeable to him. At last he
perceived they were broke off, and
the 'tother Lady seem'd to have
taken her leave. He had taken no
small pains in the mean time to put
himself in a posture to accost the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which, no doubt, he had happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed had he not been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
but scarce had he acquitted
himself of a preliminary bow (and
which, I have heard him say, was
the lowest that ever he made) and
had just opened his Lips to deliver
himself of a small Complement,
which, nevertheless he was very big
with, when he unluckily miscarried,
by the interposal of the same Lady,
whose departure, not long before,
he had so zealously-pray'd for: but,
as Providence would have it, there
was only some very small matter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
which was recovered in a short
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61573:16"/>
whisper. The Coast being again
cleared, he took heart and bore up,
and, striking sail, repeated his Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the Lady; who, having
obligingly returned it, he accosted
her in these or the like words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>If I do not usurp a priviledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for some one more happy
in your acquaintance, may I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
Madam, to entreat (for a
while) the favour of your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
at least till the arrival of
whom you expect, provided you
are not tired of me before; for then
upon the least intimation of uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I will not fail of doing my
self the violence to withdraw for
your release.</q> The Lady made him
answer, she did not expect any body;
by which he might imagine her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
not of value to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoke,
and to afford it him, were
but farther to convince him to her
own cost. He reply'd, <q>She had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said enough to convince him of
something he heartily wished might
not be to his cost in the end.</q> She
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61573:17"/>
pretended not to understand him
but told him, <q>If he already found
himself grieved with her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
he would have sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to repent the rashness of his
first Demand before they had ended:
for that now she intended to hold
discourse with him, on purpose to
punish his unadvisedness, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
upon a Person whose dress
and mien might not (may be) be
disagreeable to have wit. I must
confess (reply'd <hi>Aurelian</hi>) my self
guilty of a Presumption, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
submit to the punishment you
intend: and though it be an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of a Crime to persevere
in its justification, yet I cannot help
defending an Opinion in which now
I am more confirm'd, that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conjectures may be made of the
ingenious Disposition of the Mind,
from the fancy and choice of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</q>
               <q>The humour I grant ye
(said the Lady) or constitution of
the Person whether melancholick or
brisk; but I should hardly pass my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61573:17"/>
censure upon so slight an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of wit: for there is your brisk
fool as well as your brisk man of
sense, and so of the melancholick.
I confess 'tis possible a fool may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
himself by his Dress, in wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
something extravagantly singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and ridiculous, or in preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
suiting of colours; but a decency
of Habit (which is all that Men of
best sense pretend to) may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by custom and example, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
putting the Person to a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
expence of wit for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance;
and though there should
be occasion for it, few are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
in their Relations and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
not to have some Friend
capable of giving them advice, if
they are not too ignorantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
to ask it.</q> 
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was so
pleased with the easiness and smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her Expostulation, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to make a reply, when she
seem'd to expect it; but being a
Woman of a quick Apprehension, and
justly sensible of her own Perfections,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61573:18"/>
she soon perceived he did not grudge
his attention. However she had a
mind to put it upon him to turn
the discourse, so went on upon the
same Subject. <q>Signior (said she) I
have been looking round me, and
by your Maxim I cannot discover
one fool in the Company; for they
are all well drest.</q>  This was spoken
with an Air of Rallery that awakened
the Cavalier,who immediately made
answer: <q>'Tis true, Madam, we see
there may be as much variety of
good fancies as of faces, yet there
may be many of both kinds bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
and adulterate if inquired
into; and as you were pleased to
observe, the invention may be Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to the Person who puts it in
practice; and as good an Opinion
as I have of an agreeable Dress, I
should be loth to answer for the
wit of all about us. I believe you
(says the Lady) and hope you are
convinced of your error, since you
must allow it impossible to tell who
of all this Assembly did or did not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61573:18"/>
make choice of their own Apparel.
Not all (said <hi>Aurelian</hi>) there is an
ungainness in some which betrays
them. Look ye there (says he)
pointing to a Lady who stood
playing with the Tassels of her
Girdle, I dare answer for that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
though she be very well dress'd,
'tis more than she knows. His fair
unknown could not forbear laughing
at his particular distinction, and
freely told him, he had indeed light
upon one who knew as little as
any body in the Room, her self
excepted. Ah! Madam, (reply'd
<hi>Aurelian</hi>) you know every thing in
the World but your own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and you only know not those,
because 'tis the top of Perfection
not to know them. How? (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Lady) I thought it had
been the extremity of knowledge
to know ones self. <hi>Aurelian</hi> had a
little over-strain'd himself in that
Complement, and I am of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would have been puzzl'd to
have brought himself off readily:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61573:19"/>
but by good fortune the Musick
came into the Room and gave him
an opportunity to seem to decline
an answer, because the company
prepared to dance: he only told
her he was too mean a Conquest for
her wit who was already a Slave to
the Charms of her Person. She
thanked him for his Complement,
and briskly told him she ought to
have made him a return in praise
of his wit, but she hoped he was
a Man more happy than to be
dissatisfy'd with any of his own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments;
and if it were so, that
he had not a just Opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
she knew her self incapable of
saying any thing to beget one.</q>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not know well what to
make of this last reply; for he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
abhor'd any thing that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
with which this seem'd to
reproach him. But however modest
he had been heretofore in his own
thoughts, yet never was he so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful
of his good behaviour as
now, being rally'd so by a Person
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61573:19"/>
whom he took to be of judgment:
Yet he resolved to take no notice,
but with an Air unconcerned and full
of good humour entreated her to
Dance with him: She promised him
to Dance with no body else, nor
I believe had she inclination; for
notwithstanding her tartness, she was
upon equal terms with him as to the
liking of each others Person and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and only gave those little
hints to try his Temper; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certainly no greater sign of folly
and ill breeding, than to grow se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and concerned at any thing
spoken in rallery: for his part, he
was strangely and insensibly fallen in
love with her Shape, Wit and Air;
which, together with a white Hand,
he had seen (perhaps not accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
were enough to have subdued a
more stubborn Heart than ever he
was master of; and for her Face,
which he had not seen, he bestowed
upon her the best his Imagination
could furnish him with. I should by
right now describe her Dress, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61573:20"/>
was extreamly agreeable and rich,
but 'tis possible I might err in some
material Pin or other, in the sticking of
which may be the whole grace of the
Drapery depended. Well, they danced
several times together, and no less to
the satisfaction of the whole Company,
than of themselves; for at the end of
each Dance, some publick note of
Applause or other was given to the
graceful Couple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was amaz'd, that among
all that danced or stood in view he
could not see <hi>Hippolito;</hi> but conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had met with some
pleasing Conversation, and was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
to some retired part of the
Room, he forbore his search till the
mirth of that Night should be over,
and the Company ready to break
up, where we will leave him for a
while, to see what became of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous
Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito,</hi> a little after he had
parted with <hi>Aurelian,</hi> was got among
a knot of Ladies and Cavaliers, who
were looking upon a large Gold Cup
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61573:20"/>
set with Jewels, in which his Royal
Highness had drank to the Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the new married Couple at
Dinner, and which afterward he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his Cousin <hi>Donna Catharina.</hi>
He among the rest was very intent,
admiring the richness, workmanship
and beauty of the Cup, when a Lady
came behind him and pulling him by
the Elbow, made a sign she would speak
with him; <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an utter Stranger to <hi>Florence</hi> and
every body in it, immediately gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
she had mistaken him for her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
as indeed it happened;
however he resolved not to discover
himself till he should be assured of it;
having followed her into a set Window
remote from Company, she address'd
her self to him in this manner: <q>Signior
<hi>Don Lorenzo</hi> (said she) I am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
to see you are so speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
of your Wounds, which by
report were much more dangerous
than to have suffered your coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
so soon; but I must accuse
you of great indiscretion, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61573:21"/>
in a Habit which so many
must needs remember you to
have worn upon the like occasion
not long ago, I mean at the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of <hi>Don Cynthio</hi> with your Sister
<hi>Atalanta;</hi> I do assure you, you were
known by it, both to <hi>Iuliana</hi> and my
self, who was so far concerned for
you, as to desire me to tell you, that
her Brother <hi>Don Fabritio</hi> (who saw
you when you came in with another
Gentleman) had eyed you very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
and is since gone out of the
Room, she knows not upon what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
however she would have you,
for your own sake, be advised and
circumspect when you depart this
place, lest you should be set upon
unawares; you know the hatred
<hi>Don Fabritio</hi> has born you ever since
you had the fortune to kill his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in a Duel: Here she paused
as if expecting his reply; but <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
was so confounded, that he
stood mute, and contemplating the
hazard he had ignorantly brought
himself into, forgot his design of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61573:21"/>
informing the Lady of her mistake.</q>
She finding he made her no Answer,
went on. <q>I perceive (continued she)
you are in some surprize at what I
have related, and may be, are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the Truth; but I thought
you had been better acquainted with
your Cousin <hi>Leonara's</hi> Voice, than
to have forgot it so soon: Yet in
Complaisance to your ill Memory, I
will put you past doubt, by shewing
you my Face;</q> with that she pulled
off her Mask, and discovered to
<hi>Hippolito</hi> (now more amaz'd than
ever) the most Angelick Face that
he had ever beheld. He was just about
to have made her some answer, when,
clapping on her Mask again without
giving him time, she happily for
him pursu'd her Discourse. (For
'tis odds but he had made some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of himself in the surprize he
was in.) Having taken him sami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
by the Hand, now she had
made her self known to him, <q>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
<hi>Lonenza</hi> (added she) you may
perhaps have taken it unkindly, that,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61573:22"/>
during the time of your indisposition,
by reason of your Wounds, I have
not been to visit you; I do assure you
it was not for want of any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I had both to see and serve you
to my power; but you are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Severity of my
Father, whom you know how late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you have disobliged. I am mighty
glad that I have met with you here,
where I have had an Opportunity to
tell you what so much concerns your
Safety, which I am afraid you will
not find in <hi>Florence;</hi> considering the
great Power <hi>Don Fabritio</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Marquess of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> have
in this City. I have another thing
to inform you of, That whereas <hi>Don
Fabio</hi> had interested himself in your
Cause, in Opposition to the Marquess
of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> by reason of the long A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosity
between them, all hopes of
his Countenance and Assistance are
defeated: For there has been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of Reconciliation made to
both Houses, and it is said it will be
confirm'd (as most such ancient
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61573:22"/>
Quarrels are at last) by the Marriage
of <hi>Iuliana</hi> the Marquess's Daughter,
with <hi>Aurelian,</hi> Son to <hi>Don Fabio:</hi> to
which effect the old Gentleman sent
'tother Day to <hi>Siena,</hi> where <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
has been Educated, to hasten his
coming to Town; but the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
returning this Morning, brought
word, That the same day he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Siena, Aurelian</hi> had set out
for <hi>Florence,</hi> in Company with a
young <hi>Spanish</hi> Nobleman, his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Friend, so it is believ'd, they
are both in Town, and not unlikely
in this Room in Masquerade.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> could not forbear smiling
to himself, at these last words. For
ever since the naming of <hi>Don Fabio</hi>
he had been very attentive; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
his Thoughts were wholly taken
up with the Beauty of the Face he
had seen, and from the time she had
taken him by the Hand, a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
warmth and chillness had
play'd about his Heart, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
him with an unusual Transport.
He was in a hundred Minds, whether
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61573:23"/>
he should make her sensible of her
Error or no; but considering he could
expect no farther Conference with
her after he should discover himself,
and that as yet he knew not of her
place of abode, he resolv'd to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
the mistake a little further.
Having her still by the Hand, which
he squeez'd somewhat more eagerly
than is usual for Cousins to do, in a
low and undistinguishable Voice, he let
her know how much he held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
obliged to her, and avoiding as
many words as handsomely he could,
at the same time, entreated her to
give him her Advice, toward the
management of himself in this Affair.
<hi>Leonora,</hi> who never from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
had entertain'd the least Scruple
of distrust, imagined he spoke faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as not being yet perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in his strength; and withal
considering that the heat of the Room,
by reason of the Crowd, might be
uneasie to a Person in his Condition;
she kindly told him, That if he were
as inclinable to dispense with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61573:23"/>
of that Nights Diversion as
she was, and had no other engagement
upon him, by her consent they should
both steal out of the Assembly, and
go to her House, where they might
with more freedom discourse about
a business of that importance, and
where he might take something to
refresh himself if he were (as she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him to be) indisposed with
his long standing. Judge you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Proposal were acceptable to
<hi>Hippolito</hi> or no; he had been rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
with himself how to bring
something like this about, and had
almost despair'd of it; when of a
suddain he found the success of his
design had prevented his own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
He told his Cousin in the
same key as before, That he was
unwilling to be the occasion of her
Divorce from so much good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
but for his own part, he was
afraid he had presumed too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his recovery in coming abroad
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> soon, and that he found himself so
unwell, he feared he should be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61573:24"/>
forc'd to retire. <hi>Leonora</hi> stay'd
not to make him any other reply,
only tipp'd him upon the Arm, and
bid him follow her at a convenient
distance to avoid-Observation.</p>
            <p>Whoever had seen the Joy that
was in <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Countenance, and the
Sprightliness with which he follow'd
his Beautiful Conductress, would
scarce have taken him for a Person
griev'd with uncured Wounds. She
led him down a back pair of Stairs,
into one of the Palace Gardens which
had a Door opening into the Piazza,
not far from where <hi>Don Mario</hi> her
Father lived. They had little Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
by the way, which gave <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
time to consider of the best way
of discovering himself. A thousand
things came into his Head in a minute,
yet nothing that pleased him: and
after so many Contrivances as he had
formed for the discovery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he found it more rational for
him not to reveal himself at all that
Night, since he could not foresee
what effect the surprize would have,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61573:24"/>
she must needs be in, at the appearance
of a Stranger, whom she had never
seen before, yet whom she had treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so familiarly. He knew Women
were apt to shriek or swoon upon such
Occasions, and should she happen to
do either, he might be at a loss how
to bring himself off. He thought he
might easily pretend to be indisposed
somewhat more than ordinary, and
so make an excuse to go to his own
Lodging. It came into his Head too,
that under pretence of giving her an
account of his Health, he might
enquire of her the means how a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might be convey'd to her the next
morning, wherein he might inform
her gently of her mistake, and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
something of that Passion he had
conceiv'd, which he was sure he could
not have opportunity to speak of if
he bluntly revealed himself. He had
just resolv'd upon this Method, as
they were come to the great Gates of
the Court, when <hi>Leonora</hi> stopping to
let him go in before her, he of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
fetch'd his Breath violently as if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61573:25"/>
some stitch or twinging smart had just
then assaulted him. She enquired the
matter of him, and advised him to
make haste into the House that he
might sit down and rest him. He
told her he found himself so ill, that
he judged it more convenient for him
to go home while he was in a condition
to move, for he fear'd if he should
once settle himself to rest he might
not be able to stir. She was much
troubled, and would have had a Chair
made ready and Servants to carry him
home; but he made answer, he would
not have any of her Fathers Servants
know of his being abroad, and that
just now he had an interval of ease,
which he hop'd would continue till he
made a shift to reach his own Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Yet if she pleased to inform
him how he might give an account
of himself the next morning, in a
line or two, he would not fail to
give her the thanks due to her great
kindness; and withal, would let her
know something which would not a
little surprize her, though now he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61573:25"/>
had not time to acquaint her with
it. She show'd him a little Window
at the corner of the House, where
one should wait to receive his Letter,
and was just taking her leave of him,
when seeing him search hastily in his
Pocket, she ask'd him if he miss'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing; he told her he thought a
Wound which was not throughly
heal'd bled a little, and that he had
lost his Handkerchief. His design
took; for she immediately gave him
hers: which indeed accordingly he
apply'd to the only would he was
then griev'd with; which though it
went quite through his Heart, yet
thank God was not Mortal. He was
not a little rejoyc'd at his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in getting so early a Favour from
his Mistress, and notwithstanding the
violence he did himself to personate a
sick Man, he could not forbear giving
some Symptoms of an extraordinary
content; and telling her that he did
not doubt to receive a considerable
Proportion of ease from the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what had so often kiss'd her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61573:26"/>
fair Hand. <hi>Leonora</hi> who did not sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Compliment, told him she
should be heartily glad if that or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in her power might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to his recovery; and wishing
him well home, went into her House,
as much-troubled for her Cousin as
he was joyful for his Mistress.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> as soon as she was gone in,
began to make his Remarks about the
House, walking round the great Court,
viewing the Gardens and all the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
leading to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that side of the Piazza.
Having sufficiently informed himself,
with a Heart full of Love, and a Head
full of Stratagem, he walked toward
his Lodging, impatient till the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of <hi>Aurelian</hi> that he might give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
vent. In which interim, let me
take the liberty to digress a little,
and tell the Reader something which
I do not doubt he has apprehended
himself long ago, if he be not the
dullest Reader in the World; yet
only for orders sake, let me tell him
I say, That a young Gentleman
(Cousin to the aforesaid <hi>Don Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britio</hi>)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61573:26"/>
happened one night to have
some words at a Gameing House with
one <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> which created a Quarrel
of fatal Consequence to the former,
who was killed upon the Spot, and
likely to be so to the latter, who was
very desperately wounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabritio</hi> being much concerned for
his Kinsman, vow'd revenge (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ancient and laudable
custom of <hi>Italy</hi>) upon <hi>Lorenzo</hi> if he
surviv'd, or in case of his death (if
it should happen to anticipate that,
much more swinging Death which he
had in store for him) upon his next
of Kin, and so to descend Lineally
like an <hi>English</hi> Estate, to all the Heirs
Males of his Family. This same <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britio</hi>
had indeed (as <hi>Leonora</hi> told <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>)
taken particular notice of him
from his first entrance into the Room,
and was so far doubtful as to go out
immediately himself, and make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
concerning <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> but was
quickly inform'd of the greatness of
his Error, in believing a Man to be
abroad, who was so ill of his Wounds,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61573:27"/>
that they now despair'd of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
and thereupon return'd to the
Ball very well satisfied, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Hippolito</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>So, Reader, having now discharg'd
my Conscience of a small Discovery
which I thought my self obliged to
make to thee, I proceed to tell thee,
that our Friend <hi>Aurelian</hi> had by this
time danced himself into a Net which
he neither could, nor which is worse
desired to untangle.</p>
            <p>His Soul was charm'd to the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Body: an Air so graceful,
so sweet, so easie and so great, he had
never seen. She had something of
Majesty in her, which appear'd to be
born with her; and though it struck
an awe into the Beholders, yet was it
sweetned with a familiarity of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
which rendred it agreeable
to every Body. The grandeur of her
Mien was not stiff, but unstudied and
unforced, mixed with a simplicity;
free, yet not loose nor affected. If
the former seem'd to condescend, the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61573:27"/>
latter seem'd to aspire; and both to
unite in the centre of Perfection. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
turn she gave in dancing snatcht
<hi>Aurelian</hi> into a Rapture, and he had
like to have been out two or three
times with following his Eyes, which
she led about as Slaves to her
Heels.</p>
            <p>As soon as they had done dancing,
he began to complain of his want of
Breath and Lungs, to speak sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in her Commendation; She smil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
told him, he did ill to dance so
much then: Yet in Consideration of
the pains he had taken more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
upon her account, she would
bate him a great deal of Complement,
but with this Proviso, That he was to
discover to her who he was. <hi>Aurelian</hi>
was unwilling for the present to own
himself to be really the Man he was;
when a suddain thought came into
his Head to take upon him the Name
and Character of <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who he
was sure was not known in <hi>Florence.</hi>
He thereupon, after a little pause, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to recal himself in this manner:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61573:28"/>
               <q>Madam, it is no small demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the entire Resignation which I
have made of my Heart to your
Chains, since the secrets of it are no
longer in my power. I confess I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took <hi>Florence</hi> in my way, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
any longer Residence, than
should be requisite to inform the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
of a Traveller, of the rareties
of the Place. Whether Happiness
or Misery will be the Consequence of
that Curiosity, I am yet in fear, and
submit to your Determination; but
sure I am, not to depart <hi>Florence</hi> till
you have made me the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Man in it, and refuse me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Kindness of Dying at your Feet.
I am by Birth a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> of the City
of <hi>Toledo;</hi> my name <hi>Hippolito di Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violina:</hi>
I was yesterday a Man free,
as Nature made the first; to day I
am fallen into a Captivity, which
must continue with my Life, and
which, it is in your power, to make
much dearer to me. Thus in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to your Commands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to my Resolution of remaining
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61573:28"/>
unknown in this place, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
you, Madam, what I am;
what I shall be, I desire to know
from you; at least, I hope, the free
discovery I have made of my self,
will encourage you to trust me with
the knowledge of your Person.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here a low bow, and a deep sigh,
put an end to his Discourse, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Expectation of her Reply,
which was to this purpose—(But I
had forgot to tell you, That <hi>Aurelian</hi>
kept off his Mask from the time that
he told her he was of <hi>Spain,</hi> till the
period of his Relation.) <q>Had I
thought (said she) that my Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
would have brought me in debt,
I should certainly have forborn it;
or at least have agreed with you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand about the rate of your
discovery, then I had not brought
my self to the Inconveniency of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
censur'd, either of too much
easiness or reservedness; but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
as much as I can, the extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of either, I am resolv'd but to
discover my self in part, and will
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61573:29"/>
endeavour to give you as little occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as I can, either to boast of, or
ridicule the Behaviour of the Women
of <hi>Florence</hi> in your Travels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> interrupted her, and swore
very solemnly (and the more heartily,
I believe, because he then indeed spoke
truth) that he would make <hi>Florence</hi>
the place of his abode, whatever
concerns he had elsewhere. She ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
him to be cautious how he swore
to his Expressions of Gallantry; and
farther told him she now hoped she
should make him a return to all the Fine
Things he had said, since she gave him
his choice whether he would know
whom she was, or see her Face.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> who was really in Love,
and in whom Consideration would
have been a Crime, greedily embrac'd
the latter, since she assured him at that
time he should not know both. Well,
what follow'd? Why, she pull'd off
her Mask, and appear'd to him at once
in the Glory of Beauty. But who
can tell the astonishment <hi>Aurelian</hi> felt?
He was for a time senseless; Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61573:29"/>
had suppress'd his Speech, and his
Eyes were entangled in Light. In
short, to be made sensible of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
we must conceive some Idea
of what he beheld, which is not to be
imagined till seen, nor then to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd.
Now see the impertinence
and conceitedness of an Author, who
will have a sling at a Description,
which he has Prefaced with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility.
One might have seen
something in her Composition resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Formation of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his
World, as if every Atome of Beauty
had concurr'd to unite an excellency.
Had that curious Painter lived in her
days, he might have avoided his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
search, when he collected from the
choicest pieces the most choice Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and by a due Disposition and
Judicious Symmetry of those exquisite
parts, made one whole and perfect
<hi>Venus.</hi> Nature seem'd here to have
play'd the Plagiary, and to have
molded into Substance the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
Thoughts of inspired Poets.
Her Eyes diffus'd Rays comfortable
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61573:30"/>
as warmth, and piercing as the light;
they would have worked a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
through the straightest Pores,
and with a delicious heat, have play'd
about the most obdurate frozen Heart,
untill 'twere melted down to Love.
Such Majesty and Affability were in
her Looks; so alluring, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
was her Presence, that it
mingled awe with love; kindling a
Flame which trembled to aspire. She
had danced much, which, together
with her being close masked, gave
her a tincture of Carnation more than
ordinary. But <hi>Aurelian</hi> (from whom
I had every tittle of her Description)
fancy'd he saw a little Nest of Cupids
break from the Tresses of her Hair,
and every one officiously betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his task. Some fann'd with
their downy Wings, her glowing
Cheeks; while others brush'd the
balmy Dew from off her Face, leaving
alone a heavenly Moisture blubbing on
her Lips, on which they drank and
revell'd for their pains; Nay, so
particular were their allotments in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61573:30"/>
her service, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
a young Cupid who was but just
Pen-feather'd, employ'd his naked
Quills to pick her Teeth. And a
thousand other things his transport re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to him, which none but
Lovers who have experience of such
Visions will believe.</p>
            <p>As soon as he awaked and found his
Speech come to him, he employ'd it
to this effect:</p>
            <p>
               <q>'Tis enough that I have seen a
Divinity—Nothing but Mercy can
inhabit these Perfections—Their
utmost rigour brings a Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to any Life, but what they
give—Use me, Madam, as you
please; for by your fair self, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think a Bliss beyond what now I
feel—You Wound with Pleasure,
and if you Kill it must be with
Transport—Ah! Yet methinks
to live—O Heaven! to have
Life pronounced by those Bless'd
Lips—Did they not inspire where
they command, it were an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Death of Joy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61573:31"/>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was growing a little too
loud with his Admiration, had she
not just then interrupted him, by
clapping on her Masque, and telling
him they should be observed, if he
proceeded in his Extravagance; and
withal, that his Passion was too sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
to be real, and too violent to be
lasting. He replied, Indeed it might
not be very lasting, (with a submissive
mournful Voice) but it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
during his Life. That it was
suddain, he denied, for she had raised
it by degrees from his first sight of
her, by a continued discovery of
Charms, in her Mien and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till she thought sit to set Fire to
the Train she had laid, by the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of her Face; and then he could
not help it, if he were blown up.</p>
            <p>He begg'd her to believe the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Passion, at least to enjoin
him something, which might tend to
the Convincing of her Incredulity.
She said, she should find a time to
make some Trials of him; but for the
first, she charged him not to follow
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61573:31"/>
or observe her, after the Dissolution
of the Assembly. He promised to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
and entreated her to tell him but
her Name, that he might have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to that in his Affliction for her
Absence, if he were able to survive
it. She desired him to live by all
means; and if he must have a Name
to play with, to call her <hi>Incognita,</hi> till
he were better informed.</p>
            <p>The Company breaking up, she
took her leave, and at his earnest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
gave him a short Vision of her
Face; which, then dress'd in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
smile, caused another fit of
Transport, which lasted till she was
gone out of Sight. <hi>Aurelian</hi> gathered
up his Spirits, and walked slowly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Lodging, never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that he had lost <hi>Hippolito,</hi> till
upon turning the Corner of a Street,
he heard a noise of Fighting; and
coming near, saw a Man make a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Defence against two, who pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
violently upon him. He then
thought of <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and fancying he
saw the glimmering of Diamond But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61573:32"/>
such as <hi>Hippolito</hi> had upon the
Sleeyes of his Habit, immediately
drew to his Assistance; and with that
Eagerness and Resolution, that the
Assailants, finding their unmanly odds
defeated, took to their Heels. The
Person rescued by the Generous Help
of <hi>Aunelian,</hi> came toward him; but
as he would have stoop'd to have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
him, dropp'd, fainting at his
feet. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> now he was so near
him, perceiv'd plainly <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and step'd hastily to take him
up. Just as some of the Guards (who
were going the Rounds, apprehensive
of such Disorders in an Universal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment)
came up to him with Lights,
and had taken Prisoners the Two
Men, whom they met with their
Swords drawn; when looking in the
Face of the Wounded Man, he found
it was not <hi>Hippolito,</hi> but his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<hi>Claudio,</hi> in the Habit he had
worn at the Ball. He was extreamly
surpriz'd, as were the Prisoners, who
confess'd their Design to have been
upon <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> grounding their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61573:32"/>
upon the Habit which was known
to have been his. They were Two
Men who formerly had been Servants
to him, whom <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
slain.</p>
            <p>They made a shift to bring <hi>Claudio</hi>
to himself; and part of the Guard
carrying off the Prisoners, whom <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>
desired they would secure, the
rest accompanied him bearing <hi>Claudio</hi>
in their Arms to his Lodging. He had
not patience to forbear asking for
<hi>Hippolito</hi> by the Way; whom <hi>Claudio</hi>
assured him, he had left safe in his
Chamber, above Two Hours since.
That his coming Home so long before
the Divertisements were ended, and
Undressing himself, had given him the
Unhappy Curiosity, to put on his
Habit, and go to the Ballace; in his
Return from whence, he was set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Manner he found him,
which if he recovered, he must own
his Life indebted to his timely As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61573:33"/>Being come to the House, they
carried him to his Bed, and having
sent for Surgeons <hi>Aurelian</hi> rewarded
and dismissed the Guard. He stay'd
the dressing of <hi>Claudio</hi>'s Wounds,
which were many, though they hop'd
none Mortal: and leaving him to his
Rest, went to give <hi>Hippolito</hi> an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what had happened, whom he
found with a Table before him,
leaning upon both his Elbows, his
Face covered with his Hands, and so
motionless, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> concluded he
was asleep; seeing several Papers lie
before him, half written and blotted
out again, he thought to steal softly
to the Table, and discover what he
had been employed about. Just as
he reach'd forth his Hand to take up
one of the Papers, <hi>Hippolito</hi> started
up so on the suddain, as surpriz'd
<hi>Aurelian</hi> and made him leap back;
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> on the other hand, not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that any Body had been near
him, was so disordered with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a Man at his Elbow,
(whom his Amazement did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61573:33"/>
him to distinguish) that he leap'd
hastily to his Sword, and in turning
him about, overthrew the Stand and
Candles. Here were they both left
in the Dark, <hi>Hippolito</hi> groping about
with his Sword, and thrusting at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Chair that he felt oppose him.
<hi>Aurelian</hi> was scarce come to himself,
when thinking to step back toward
the Door that he might inform his
Friend of his Mistake, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
himself to his blind Fury;
<hi>Hippolito</hi> heard him stir, and made a
full thrust with such Violence, that the
Hilt of the Sword meeting with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>'s
Breast beat him down, and
<hi>Hippolito</hi> a top of him, as a Servant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
with the noise, came into the
Chamber with a Light. The Fellow
trembled, and thought they were
both Dead, till <hi>Hippolito</hi> raising him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to see whom he had got under
him, swoon'd away upon the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his Friend. But such was the
extraordinary Care of Providence in
directing the Sword, that it only past
under his Arm, giving no Wound to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61573:34"/>
               <hi>Aurelian,</hi> but a little Bruise between
his Shoulder and Breast with the Hilt.
He got up, scarce recovered of his
Fright, and by the help of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
laid <hi>Hippolito</hi> upon the Bed; who
when he was come to himself could
hardly be perswaded, that his Friend
was before him and alive, till he
shew'd him his Breast, where was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a Wound. <hi>Hippolito</hi> begg'd
his Pardon a Thousand Times, and
curs'd himself as often, who was so
near to committing the most Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Act of Amicide.</p>
            <p>They dismiss'd the Fellow, and
with many Embraces, congratulated
their fortunate Delivery from the
Mischief which came so near them,
each blaming himself as the Occasion:
<hi>Aurelian</hi> accusing his own unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in stealing upon <hi>Hippolito; Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
blaming his own temerity and
weakness, in being so easily fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Disorder; and last of all, his
blindness, in not knowing his dearest
Friend. But there he gave a Sigh,
and passionately taking <hi>Aurelian</hi> by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61573:34"/>
the Hand, cry'd, Ah! my Friend,
Love is indeed blind, when it would
not suffer me to see you—There
arose another Sigh; a Sympathy seiz'd
<hi>Aurelian</hi> immediately: (For, by the
Way, sighing is as catching among
Lovers, as yawning among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.)
Beside hearing the Name of
Love, made him fetch such a Sigh,
that <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s were but Fly-blows in
Comparison, that was answered with
all the Might <hi>Hippolito</hi> had, <hi>Aurelian</hi>
ply'd him close till they were both out
of Breath.</p>
            <p>Thus not a Word pass'd, though
each wondred why the t'other sigh'd,
at last concluded it to be only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance
to one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> broke the Silence, by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the Misfortune of his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> rejoic'd as at the
luckiest Accident which could have
befall'n him. <hi>Aurelian</hi> wondred at
his unseasonable Mirth, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Cause of it; he answer'd, It
would necessitate his longer Stay in
<hi>Florence,</hi> and for ought he knew be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61573:35"/>
the Means of bringing a happy Period
to his Amour.</p>
            <p>His Friend thought him to be little
better than a Mad-man, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him of a suddain snatch out of his
Bosom a Handkerchief, which having
kiss'd with a great deal of Ardour,
he took <hi>Aurelian</hi> by the Hand, and
smiling at the Surprize he saw him
in;</p>
            <p>
               <q>Your <hi>Florentine Cupid</hi> is certainly
(said he) the most Expert in the
World. I have since I saw you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the most Beautiful of Women.
I am faln desperately in Love with
her, and those Papers which you see
so blotted and scattered, are but so
many Essays which I have made to
the Declaration of my Passion. And
this Handkerchief which I so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
Caress, is the Inestimable To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
which I have to make my self
known to her. O <hi>Leonora!</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he) how hast thou stamp'd
thine Image on my Soul! How much
dearer am I to my self, since I have
had thy Heavenly Form in keeping!
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61573:35"/>
Now, my <hi>Aurelian,</hi> I am worthy
thee; my exalted Love has Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
me, and rais'd me far above thy
poor former Despicable <hi>Hippolito.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> seeing the Rapture he was
in, thought it in vain to expect a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Relation of the Adventure, so
was reaching to the Table for some of
the Papers, but <hi>Hippolito</hi> told him, If
he would have a little patience he
would acquaint him with the whole
Matter; and thereupon told him
Word for Word how he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
for <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himself. <hi>Aurelian</hi> commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Prudence, in not discovering
himself; and told him, If he could
spare so much time from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of his Mistress, he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him of an Adventure, though not
so Accidental, yet of as great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to his own future Happiness. So
related all that had happened to him
with his Beautiful <hi>Incognita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ended the Story, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to consider of the Means they
were to use toward a Review of their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61573:36"/>
Mistresses. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was Confounded
at the Difficulty he conceived on his
Part. He understood from <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s
Adventure, that his Father knew of
his being in Town, whom he must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
Disoblige if he yet conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself, and Disobey if he came into
his Sight; for he had already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
an Aversion for <hi>Iuliana,</hi> in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of her being Imposed on
him. His <hi>Incognita</hi> was rooted in his
Heart, yet could he not Comfort
himself with any Hopes when he
should see her: He knew not where
she lived, and she had made him no
Promise of a second Conference.
Then did he repent his inconsiderate
Choice, in preferring the momentary
Vision of her Face, to a certain Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of her Person. Every thought
that succeeded distracted him, and all
the Hopes he could presume upon,
were within compass of the Two
Days Merriment yet to come; for
which Space he hop'd he might excuse
his remaining conceal'd to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61573:36"/>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> on the other side (though
<hi>Aurelian</hi> thought him in a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Way) was no less afflicted for
himself. The Difficulties which he
saw in his Friend's Circumstances,
put him upon finding out a great many
more in his own, than really there
were. But what terrified him most
of all, was his being an utter Stranger
to <hi>Leonora;</hi> she had not the least know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him but through mistake,
and consequently could form no Idea
of him to his Advantage. He look'd
upon it as an unlucky thought in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>
to take upon him his Name,
since possibly the Two Ladies were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
and should they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to each other their Adventures;
they might both reasonably suffer in
their Opinions, and be thought guilty
of Falshood, since it would appear to
them as One Person pretending to
Two. <hi>Aurelian</hi> told him, there was
but one Remedy for that, which was
for <hi>Hippolito,</hi> in the same Manner that
he had done, to make use of his
Name, when he writ to <hi>Leonora,</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61573:37"/>
use what Arguments he could to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
her to Secrecy, least his Father
should know of the Reason which kept
him concealed in Town. And it was
likely, though perhaps she might not
immediately entertain his Passion;
yet she would out of Generosity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,
what was hidden only for her
sake.</p>
            <p>Well this was concluded on, after a
great many other Reasons used on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Side, in favour of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance;
they at last argued themselves
into a Belief, that Fortune had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
them with a better Plot,
than their regular Thinking could
have contriv'd. So soon had they
convinc'd themselves, in what they
were willing to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> laid himself down to rest,
that is, upon the Bed; for he was a
better Lover than to pretend to sleep
that Night, while <hi>Hippolito</hi> set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
again to frame his Letter design'd
for <hi>Leonora.</hi> He writ several, at last
pitched upon one, and very probably
the worst, as you may guess when you
read it in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61573:37"/>It was break of Day when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who had been employed all the
foregoing Day in procuring Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements
for the Two Cavaliers, to
appear in at the Tilting, came into
the Room, and told them all the
Young Gentlemen in the Town were
trying their Equipage, and preparing
to be early in the Lists. They made
themselves ready with all Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at the Alarm: And <hi>Hippolito</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a Visit to his Governour,
dispatch'd a Messenger with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Directions to <hi>Leonora.</hi> At the
Signal agreed upon the Casement was
opened and a String let down, to
which the Bearer having fastned the
Letter, saw it drawn up, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It were a vain attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<hi>Leonora</hi>'s Surprize, when she
read the Superscription.—<hi>The Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate</hi>
Aurelian, <hi>to the Beautiful</hi>
Leonora—After she was a little
recovered from her Amaze, she recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to her self all the Passages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and her supposed Cousin,
and immediately concluded him to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61573:38"/>
               <hi>Aurelian.</hi> Then several little Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
which she thought might have
been sufficient to have convinced her,
represented themselves to her; and
she was in a strange Uneasiness to
think of her free Carriage to a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>She was once in a Mind to have
burn'd the Letter, or to have stay'd
for an Opportunity to send it again.
But she was a Woman, and her Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
opposed it self to all thoughts
of that Nature: at length with a
firm Resolution, she opened it, and
found Word for Word, what is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>

                  <p>IF your fair Eyes, upon the
breaking up of this, meet with
somewhat too quick a Surprize,
make thence, I beseech you, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61573:38"/>
upon the Condition I must
needs have been in, at the suddain
Appearance of that Sun of Beauty,
which at once shone so full upon my
Soul. I could not immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
my self from that Maze of
Charms, to let you know how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
a Captive your Eyes had
made through mistake. Sure, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
you cannot but remember my
Disorder, of which your Innocent
(Innocent, though perhaps to me
Fatal) Error made a Charitable
(but wide) Construction. Your
Tongue pursued the Victory of your
Eyes, and you did not give me time
to rally my poor Disordered Senses,
so as to make a tolerable Retreat.
Pardon, Madam, the Continuation
of the Deceipt, and call it not so,
that I appear'd to be other than my
self; for Heaven knows. I was not
then my self, nor am I now my own.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61573:39"/>
You told me something that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
me nearly, as to a Marriage
my Father design'd me, and much
more nearly in being told by you.
For Heaven's sake, disclose not to
any Body your Knowledge of me,
that I may not be forced to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Act of Disobedience; for
if my future Services and inviolate
Love, cannot recommend me to
your Favour, I shall find more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the cold Embraces of a
Grave, than in the Arms of the
never so much admired (but by
me dreaded) <hi>Juliana.</hi> Think,
Madam, of those severe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
I lie under; and withal I beg
you, think it is in your Power, and
only in your Power, to make them
happy as my Wishes, or much more
miserable than I am able to imagine.
That dear, inestimable (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>design'd)
Favour which I receiv'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61573:39"/>
from you, shall this Day distinguish
me from the Crowd of your Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
that which I really applied
to my inward bleeding Wound, the
welcom Wound which you have
made, and which, unless from you,
does wish no Cure; then pardon and
have pity on, O Adored <hi>Leonora,</hi>
him, who is your's by Creation as
he is Heavens, though never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.

            <p>She read the Letter over and over,
then flung it by, then read it again;
the Novelty of the Adventure made
her repeat her Curiosity, and take
more than ordinary Pains to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. At last her Familiarity with
the Expressions grew to an Intimacy,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61573:40"/>
and what she at first permitted she
now began to like. She thought there
was something in it a little more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
than to be barely Gallantry.
She wondred at her own Blindness,
and fancy'd she could remember some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a more becoming Air in the
Stranger than was usual to <hi>Lorenzo.</hi>
This thought was parent to another
of the same kind, till a long Chain
successively had Birth, and every one
somewhat more than other, in Favour
of the supposed <hi>Aurelian.</hi> She reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his Discretion, in deferring
the Discovery of himself, till a little
time had, as it were, weaned her
from her perswasion, and by removing
her farther from her Mistake, had
prepared her for a full and determinate
Convincement. She thought his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
in personating a Sick Man
so readily, upon the first hint was not
amiss, and smil'd to think of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
to procure her Handkerchief;
and last of all, his sifting out the
Means to write to her, which he
had done with that Modesty and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61573:40"/>
Respect, she could not tell how to find
fault with it.</p>
            <p>She had proceeded thus far in a maze
of Thought, when she started to find
her self so lost to her Reason, and
would have trod back again that path
of deluding Fancy; accusing her self
of Fondness, and inconsiderate Easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in giving Credit to the Letter of
a Person whose Face she never saw,
and whose first Acquaintance with her
was a Treachery, and he who could
so readily deliver his Tongue of a Lye
upon a Surprize, was scarce to be
trusted when he had sufficient Time
allow'd him to beget a Fiction, and
Means to perfect the Birth.</p>
            <p>How did she know this to be <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
if he were? Nay farther, put it
to the Extremity, What if she should
upon farther Conversation with him
proceed to Love him? What Hopes
were there for her? Or how could
she consent to Marry a Man already
Destined for another Woman? nay,
a Woman that was her Friend, whose
Marrying with him was to compleat
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61573:41"/>
the happy Reconciliation of Two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Families, and which might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Effusion of much Blood likely
to be shed in that Quarrel: Besides,
she should incurr share of the Guilt,
which he would draw upon him by
Disobedience to his Father, whom
she was sure would not be consenting
to it.</p>
            <p>'Tis strange now, but all Accounts
agree, that just here <hi>Leonora,</hi> who
had run like a violent Stream against
<hi>Aurelian</hi> hitherto, now retorted with
as much precipitation in his Favour.
I could never get any Body to give me
a satisfactory Reason, for her suddain
and dextrous Change of Opinion just
at that stop, which made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
she could not help it; and that
Nature boil'd over in her at that time
when it had so fair an Opportunity
to show it self: For <hi>Leonora</hi> it seems
was a Woman Beautiful, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of an excellent Disposition; but
in the Bottom a very Woman. This
last Objection, this Opportunity of
perswading Man to Disobedience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61573:41"/>
the Matter in Favour of
<hi>Aurelian,</hi> more than all his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Qualifications, take him as
<hi>Aurelian,</hi> or <hi>Hippolito,</hi> or both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Well, the Spirit of Contradiction
and of <hi>Eve</hi> was strong in her; and
she was in a fair Way to Love <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
for she lik'd him already; that
it was <hi>Aurelian</hi> she no longer doubted,
for had it been a Villain, who had
only taken his Name upon him for
any ill Designs, he would never have
slip'd so favourable an Opportunity as
when they were alone, and in the
Night coming through the Garden and
broad Space before the Piazza. In
short, thus much she resolv'd, at least
to conceal the Knowledge she had of
him, as he had entreated her in his
Letter, and to make particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
of his Behaviour that Day in
the Lists, which should it happen to
Charm her with an absolute liking of
his Person, she resolv'd to dress her
self to the best Advantage, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering
up all her Graces, out of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61573:42"/>
pure Revenge to kill him down
right.</p>
            <p>I would not have the Reader now
be impertinent, and look upon this
to be force, or a whim of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's,
that a Woman should proceed
so far in her Approbation of a Man
whom she never saw, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
therefore ridiculous to suppose
it. Let me tell such a Critick, that
he knows nothing of the Sex, if he
does not know that a Woman may be
taken with the Character and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of a Man, when general and
extraordinary, that she may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd
with an agreeable Idea of his
Person and Conversation; and though
she cannot imagine his real Features,
or manner of Wit, yet she has a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Notion of what is call'd a fine
Gentleman, and is prepar'd to like
such a one who does not disagree with
that Character. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as he bore
a very fair Character, so was he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
deserving to make it good,
which otherways might have been to
his prejudice; for oftentimes, through
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61573:42"/>
an imprudent Indulgence to our
Friends merit, we give so large a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of his excellencies, that
People make more room in their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
than the Intrinsick worth of
the Man will fill, which renders him so
much the more despicable as there is
emptyness to spare. 'Tis certain,
though the Women seldom find
that out; for though they do not see
so much in a Man as was promised,
yet they will be so kind to imagine
he has some hidden excellencies which
time may discover to them, so are
content to allow him a considerable
share of their esteem, and take him
into Favour upon Tick. <hi>Aurelian</hi> as
he had good Credit, so he had a good
Stock to support it, and his Person
was a good promising Security for the
payment of any Obligation he could
lie under to the Fair Sex. <hi>Hippolito,</hi>
who at this time was our <hi>Aurelian,</hi> did
not at all lessen him in appearing for
him: So that although <hi>Leonora</hi> was
indeed mistaken, she could not be said
to be much in the wrong. I could
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61573:43"/>
find in my Heart to beg the Reader's
pardon for this Digression, if I
thought he would be sensible of the
Civility; for I promise him, I do not
intend to do it again throughout the
Story, though I make never so many,
and though he take them never so ill.
But because I began this upon a bare
Supposition of his Impertinence, which
might be somewhat impertinent in
me to suppose I do, and hope to make
him amends by telling him, that by the
time <hi>Leonora</hi> was dress'd, several La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of her acquaintance came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
her to the place designed for
the Tilting, where we will leave them
drinking Chocholate till 'tis time for
them to go.</p>
            <p>Our Cavaliers had by good Fortune
provided themselves of two curious
Suits of light Armour, finely enammel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and gilt. <hi>Hippolito</hi> had sent to
<hi>Poggio Imperiale</hi> for a couple of fine
led Horses which he had left there
with the rest of his Train at his
entrance into <hi>Florence.</hi> Mounted on
these and every way well Equipt, they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61573:43"/>
took their way, attended only by two
Lacqueys, toward the Church <hi>di Santa
Croce,</hi> before which they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Exercises of Chivalry.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> wore upon his Helm a large
Plume of Crimson Feathers, in the
midst of which was artificially placed
<hi>Leonora</hi>'s Handkerchief. His Armour
was gilt, and enammell'd with Green
and Crimson. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was not so
happy as to wear any token to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him to the notice of his
Mistress, so had only a Plume of Sky-colour
and White Feathers, suitable
to his Armour, which was Silver en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammelled
with Azure. I shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the Habits of any other Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
or of the Ladies; let it suffice
to tell the Reader they were all very
Fine and very Glorious, and let him
dress them in what is most agreeable
to his own Fancy.</p>
            <p>Our Gallants entred the Lists, and
having made their Obeysance to his
Highness, turned round to salute and
view the Company. The Scaffold
was circular, so that there was no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61573:44"/>
end of the Delightful Prospect. It
seem'd a Glory of Beauty which shone
around the admiring Beholders. Our
Lovers soon perceived the Stars which
were to Rule their Destiny, which
sparkled a lustre beyond all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Constellations, and seem'd like
two Suns to distribute Light to all
the Planets in that Heavenly Sphere.
<hi>Leonora</hi> knew her Slave by his Badge
and blushed till the Lilies and Roses
in her Cheeks had resemblance to the
Plume of Crimson and White Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
in <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Crest. He
made her a low bow, and reined his
Horse back with an extraordinary
Grace, into a respectful retreat. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>
saw his Angel, his beautiful <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita,</hi>
and had no other way to
make himself known to her, but by
saluting and bowing to her after the
<hi>Spanish</hi> mode; she guess'd him by it
to be her new Servant <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and
signified her apprehension, by making
him a more particular and obliging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
than to any of the Cavaliers
who had saluted her before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61573:44"/>The Exercise that was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
was in general a running at
the Ring; and afterwards two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
undertook to defend the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Donna Catharina,</hi> against all
who would not allow her prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of their Mistresses. This thing
was only designed for show and form,
none presuming that any body would
put so great an affront upon the
Bride and Duke's Kinswoman, as to
dispute her pretentions to the first
place in the Court of <hi>Venus.</hi> But
here our Cavaliers were under a
mistake; for seeing a large Shield car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
before two Knights, with a Lady
painted upon it; not knowing who,
but reading the Inscription which was
(in large Gold Letters) <hi>Above the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
of Competition.</hi> They thought
themselves obliged, especially in the
presence of their Mistresses, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
their Beauty; and were just
spurring on to engage the Champions,
when a Gentleman stopping them, told
them their mistake, that it was the
Picture of <hi>Donna Catharina,</hi> and a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61573:45"/>
particular Honour done to her by his
Highness's Commands, and not to
be disputed. Upon this they would
have returned to their Post, much
concerned for their mistake; but
notice being taken by <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>
of some Show of Opposition that
was made, he would have begged leave
of the Duke, to have maintained his
Lady's Honour against the Insolence
of those Cavaliers; but the Duke
would by no means permit it. They
were arguing about it when one of
them came up, before whom the
Shield was born, and demanded his
Highness's Permission, to inform those
Gentlemen better of their mistake, by
giving them the Foyl. By the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> leave was
given them; whereupon a Civil
Challenge was sent to the two
Strangers, informing them of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and withal telling them they
must either maintain it by force of
Arms, or make a publick acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by riding bare headed before the
Picture once round the Lists. The
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61573:45"/>
Stranger-Cavaliers remonstrated to
the Duke how sensible they were
of their Error, and though they
would not justifie it, yet they could
not decline the Combate, being pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to it beyond an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal.
To the Bride they sent a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
wherein, having first begg'd
her pardon for not knowing her
Picture, they gave her to understand,
that now they were not about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
her undoubted right to the
Crown of Beauty, but the honour
of being her Champions was the
Prize they sought for, which they
thought themselves as able to maintain
as any other Pretenders. Wherefore
they pray'd her, that if fortune so
far befriended their endeavours as to
make them Victors, that they might
receive no other Reward, but to be
crown'd with the Titles of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
and be ever after esteem'd
as her most humble Servants. The
excuse was so handsomely designed,
and much better express'd than it is
here, that it took effect. The Duke
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61573:46"/>
               <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> and his Lady were so
well satisfied with it as to grant their
Request.</p>
            <p>While the running at the Ring
lasted, our Cavaliers alternately bore
away great share of the Honour. That
Sport ended, Marshals were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Field, and every thing in
great form settled for the Combat.
The Cavaliers were all in good
earnest, but orders were given to
bring 'em blunted Lances, and to
forbid the drawing of a Sword upon
pain of his Highness's Displeasure. The
Trumpets sounded and they began
their Course: The Ladies Hearts,
particularly the <hi>Incognita</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi>'s,
beat time to the Horses Hoofs, and
hope and fear made a mock Fight
within their tender Breasts, each
wishing and doubting success where
she lik'd: But as the generality of their
Prayers were for the graceful Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
they accordingly succeeded.
<hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Adversary was unhorsed in
the first Encounter, and <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s
lost both his Stirrups and dropt his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61573:46"/>
Lance to save himself. The Honour
of the Field was immediately granted
to them, and <hi>Donna Catharina</hi> sent them
both Favours, which she pray'd them
to wear as her Knights. The Crowd
breaking up, our Cavaliers made a
shift to steal off unmarked, save by the
watchful <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Incognita,</hi> whose
Eyes were never off from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Servants. There was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
made for them, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
for they to prevent their being
discovered had prepared another
House, distant from their Lodging,
where a Servant attended to disarm
them, and another carried back their
Horses to the <hi>Villa,</hi> while they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unsuspected to their Lodging; but
<hi>Incognita</hi> had given command to a
Page to dog 'em till the Evening, at
a distance, and bring her word where
they were latest housed.</p>
            <p>While several Conjectures pass'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Company, who were all
gone to Dinner at the Palace, who
those Cavaliers should be, <hi>Don Fabio</hi>
thought himself the only Man able to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61573:47"/>
guess; for he knew for certain that
his Son and <hi>Hippolito</hi> were both in
Town, and was well enough pleased
with his humour of remaining <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito</hi>
till the Diversions should be
over, believing then that the surprize
of his Discovery would add much to
the Gallantry he had shown in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade;
but hearing the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
liking that every body express'd,
and in a particular manner, the great
Duke himself, to the Persons and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of the unknown Cavaliers,
the Old Gentleman could not forbear
the Vanity to tell his Highness, that
he believed he had an interest in one of
the Gentlemen, whom he was pleased
to honour with so favourable a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
and told him what reason
he had to believe the one to be his Son,
and the other a <hi>Spanish</hi> Nobleman, his
Friend.</p>
            <p>This discovery having thus got
vent, was diffused like Air; every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
suck'd it in, and let it out again
with their Breath to the next they met
withal; and in half an hours time it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61573:47"/>
was talked of in the House where our
Adventures wer lodged. <hi>Aurelian</hi>
was shark mad at the News, and knew
what search would be immediately
made for him. <hi>Hippolito,</hi> had he not
been desperately in Love, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have taken Horse and rid out
of Town just then; for he could make
no longer doubt of being discovered,
and he was afraid of the just Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<hi>Leonora</hi> might make to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who had now deceived her twice.
Well, we will leave them both fretting
and contriving to no purpose, to look
about and see what was done at the
Palace, where their doom was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
much quicker than they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
            <p>Dinner ended, the Duke retired
with some chosen Friends to a Glass of
Wine; among whom were the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
of <hi>Viterbo</hi> and <hi>Don Fabio.</hi> His
Highness was no Stranger to the long
Fewd that had been between the two
Families, and also understood what
Overtures of Reconciliation had been
lately made, with the Proposals of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61573:48"/>
Marriage between <hi>Aurelian</hi> and the
Marquess's Daughter. Having waited
till the Wine had taken the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and the Company were raised
to an uncommon pitch of Chearfulness,
which he also encouraged by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Freedom and Good Humour,
he took an opportunity of rallying the
two grave Signiors into an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
That was seconded with the
praises of the young Couple, and
the whole Company joined in a large
Encomium upon the Graces of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
and the Beauties of <hi>Iuliana.</hi> The
old Fellows were tickled with Delight
to hear their Darlings so admired,
which the Duke perceiving, out of a
Principle of Generosity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
urged the present Consummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Marriage; telling them
there was yet one day of publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
to come, and how glad he
should be to have it improved by so
acceptable an Alliance; and what an
honour it would be to have his Cousin's
Marriage attended by the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of so extraordinary a Pair, the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61573:48"/>
performance of which Ceremony
would crown the Joy that was then in
Agitation, and make the last day vie
for equal Glory and Happiness with
the first. In short, by the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and Perswasive Authority of the
Duke, the <hi>Dons</hi> were wrought into a
Compliance, and accordingly embraced
and shook Hands upon the Matter.
This News was dispersed like the
former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Don Fabio</hi> gave orders
for the enquiring out his Son's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Marquess and he might
make him a Visit, as soon as he had
acquainted <hi>Iuliana</hi> with his purpose,
that she might prepare her self. He
found her very chearful with <hi>Donna
Catharina</hi> and several other Ladies;
whereupon the old Gentleman, pretty
well warmed with the Duke's Good-fellowship,
told her aloud he was
come to crown their Mirth with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Wedding; that his Highness
had been pleased to provide a Husband
for his Daughter, and he would have
her provide her self to receive him to
morrow. All the Company at first, as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61573:49"/>
well as <hi>Iuliana</hi> her self, thought he
had rally'd, till the Duke coming in
confirmed the serious part of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
<hi>Iuliana</hi> was confounded at
the haste that was imposed on her,
and desired a little time to consider
what she was about. But the Marquess
told her, she should have all the rest
of her Life to consider in; that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>
should come and consider with
her in the Morning, if she pleased;
but in the mean time, he advised her
to go home and call her Maids to
Counsel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuliana</hi> took her leave of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
very gravely, as if not much
delighted with her Father's Rallery.
<hi>Leonora</hi> happened to be by, and heard
all that passed; she was ready to swoon,
and found her self seized with a more
violent Passion than ever for <hi>Aurelian:</hi>
Now upon her apprehensions of losing
him, her active fancy had brought
him before her with all the advantages
imaginable, and though she had before
found great tenderness in her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
toward him, yet was she some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61573:49"/>
surprized to find she really lov'd
him. She was so uneasie at what she
had heard, that she thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to steal out of the presence and
retire to her Closet, to bemoan her
unhappy helpless Condition.</p>
            <p>Our Two Cavalier-Lovers had
rack'd their Invention till it was
quite disabled, and could not make
discovery of one Contrivance more for
their Relief. Both sat silent, each
depending upon his Friend, and still
expecting when t'other should speak.
Night came upon them while they sate
thus thoughtless, or rather drowned
in Thought; but a Servant bringing
Lights into the Room awakened them:
And <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Speech, usher'd by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Sigh, broke Silence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well! (said he) what must we
do, <hi>Aurelian?</hi> We must suffer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Aurelian</hi> faintly.</q> When imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
raising his Voice, he cry'd out,
<q>Oh ye unequal Powers, why do ye
urge us to desire what ye doom us to
forbear; give us a Will to chuse,
then curb us with a Duty to restrain
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61573:50"/>
that Choice! Cruel Father, Will
nothing else suffice! Am I to be the
Sacrifice to expiate your Offences
past; past ere I was born? Were I
to lose my Life, I'd gladly Seal
your Reconcilement with my Blood.
But Oh my Soul is free, you have no
Title to my Immortal Being, that
has Existence independent of your
Power; and must I lose my Love,
the Extract of that Being, the Joy,
Light, Life, and Darling of my
Soul? No, I'll own my Flame, and
plead my Title too.—But hold,
wretched <hi>Aurelian,</hi> hold, whither
does thy Passion hurry thee? Alas!
the cruel fair <hi>Incognita</hi> Loves thee
not! She knows not of thy Love! If
she did, what Merit hast thou to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend?
—Only Love.—Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Love. And all the World
has that. All that have seen her. Yet
I had only seen her once, and in that
once I lov'd above the World; nay,
lov'd beyond my self, such vigorous
Flame, so strong, so quick she dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at my Breast; it must rebound,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61573:50"/>
and by Reflection, warm her self.
Ah! welcome Thought, lovely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
Fancy, hang still upon my
Soul, let me but think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that once
she Loves and perish my Despair.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here a suddain in stop gave a Period
also to <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Expectation, and he
hoped now that his Friend had given
his Passion so free a vent, he might
recollect and bethink himself of what
was convenient to be done; but <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian;</hi>
as if he had mustered up all
his Spirits purely to acquit himself of
that passionate Harangue, stood mute
and insensible like an Alarum Clock,
that had spent all its force in one vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Emotion. <hi>Hippolito</hi> shook him by
the Arm to rouze him from his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy,
when his Lacquey coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Room, out of Breath, told
him there was a Coach just stopp'd at
the Door, but he did not take time to
see who came in it. <hi>Aurelian</hi> concluded
immediately it was his Father in quest
of him; and without saying any more
to <hi>Hippolito,</hi> than that he was Ruined
if discovered, took his Sword and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61573:51"/>
slipp'd down a back pair of Stairs into
the Garden, from whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
himself into the Street. <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito</hi>
had not bethought himself what to
do, before he perceiv'd a Lady come
into the Chamber close veil'd, and
make toward him. At the first Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a Woman, his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
flattered him with a Thought
of <hi>Leonora;</hi> but that was quickly over
upon nearer Approach to the Lady,
who had much the Advantage in Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Mistress. He very civilly
accosted her, and asked, if he were
the Person to whom the Honour of
that Visit was intended. She said,
her Business was with <hi>Don Hippolito di
Saviolina,</hi> to whom she had Matter of
Concern to import, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
haste. He had like to have
told her, That he was the Man, but
by good Chance reflecting upon his
Friend's Adventure, who had taken his
name, he made Answer, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<hi>Don Hippolito</hi> not far off, and if
she had a Moments Patience he would
enquire for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61573:51"/>He went out, leaving the Lady in
the Room, and made search all round
the House and Garden for <hi>Aurelian,</hi>
but to no purpose. The Lady impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of his long stay took a Pen and
Ink and some Paper which she found
upon the Table, and had just made
an End of her Letter, when hearing a
Noise of more than one coming up
Stairs, she concluded his Friend had
found him, and that her Letter would
be to no purpose, so tore it in, pieces,
which she repented; when turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
she found her Mistake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.
<hi>Don Fabio</hi> and the Marquess of
<hi>Viterbo</hi> just entring at the Door. She
gave a Shriek at the Surprize of their
Appearance, which much troubled
the Old Gentlemen, and made them
retire in Confusion for putting a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
into such a Fright. The
Marquess thinking they had been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed,
or had mistaken the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
came forward again, and made
an Apology to the Lady for their
Errour; but she making no reply,
walk'd directly by him down Stairs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61573:52"/>
and went into her Coach, which hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her away as speedily as the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were able to draw.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dons</hi> were at a loss what to
think, when, <hi>Hippolito</hi> coming into the
Room to give the Lady an Account of
his Errant, was no less astonished to
find she was departed, and had left
Two Old Signiors in her stead. He
knew <hi>Don Fabio</hi>'s Face, for <hi>Aurelian</hi>
had shewn him his Father at the Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but being confident he was not
known to him, he ventur'd to ask
him concerning a Lady whom just
now he had left in that Chamber.
<hi>Don Fabio</hi> told him, she was just gone
down, and doubted they had been
Guilty of a Mistake, in coming to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
for a Couple of Gentlemen
whom they were informed were Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that House; he begg'd his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
if he had any Relation to that
Lady, and desired to know if he could
give them any Account of the Persons
they sought for. <hi>Hippolito</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
He was a Stranger in the Place,
and only a Servant to that Lady whom
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61573:52"/>
they had disturb'd, and whom he must
go and seek out. And in this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
he left them, going again in
Search of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> to inform him of
what had passed.</p>
            <p>The Old Gentlemen at last meeting
with a Servant of the House, were
directed to Signior <hi>Claudio</hi>'s Chamber,
where they were no sooner entered
but <hi>Aurelian</hi> came into the House. A
Servant who had skulk'd for him by
<hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Order, followed him up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chamber, and told him who
was with <hi>Claudio</hi> then making Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for him. He thought that to be
no Place for him, since <hi>Claudio</hi> must
needs discover all the Truth to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
wherefore he left Directions
with the Servant, where <hi>Hippolito</hi>
should meet him in the Morning. As
he was going out of the Room he
espied the torn Paper, which the
Lady had thrown upon the Floor:
The first piece he took up had <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita</hi>
written upon it; the sight of
which so Alarum'd him, he scarce
knew what he was about; but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61573:53"/>
a Noise of a Door opening over
Head, with as much Care as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the haste he was then in,
he gathered up the scattered pieces of
Paper, and betook himself to a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Coming by a Light which hung at
the Corner of a Street, he join'd the
torn Papers and collected thus much,
that his <hi>Incognita</hi> had Written the
Note, and earnestly desired him (if
there were any reality in what he
pretended to her) to meet her at
Twelve a Clock that Night at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Gate; but unluckily the Bit of
Paper which should have mentioned
what Convent, was broken off and
lost.</p>
            <p>Here was a large Subject for <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s
Passion, which he did not spare
to pour forth in Abundance of Curses
on his Stars. So earnest was he in the
Contemplation of his Misfortunes,
that he walk'd on unwittingly; till at
length a Silence (and such as was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be found in that part of the
Town, whither his unguided Steps
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61573:53"/>
had carried him) surpriz'd his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I say, a profound Silence rouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him from his Thought; and a clap
of Thunder could have done no
more.</p>
            <p>Now because it is possible this at some
time or other may happen to be read
by some Malicious or Ignorant Person,
(no Reflection upon the present
Reader) who will not admit, or does
not understand that Silence should
make a Man start; and have the same
Effect, in provoking his Attention,
with its opposite Noise; I will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
this Matter, to such a diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Critick, by a Parallel Instance of
Light; which though it does chiefly
entertain the Eyes, and is indeed the
prime Object of the Sight, yet should
it immediately cease, to have a Man
left in the Dark by a suddain defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of it, would make him stare with
his Eyes, and though he could not see,
endeavour to look about him. Why
just thus did it fare with our Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer;
who seeming to have wandred
both into the Dominions of Silence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61573:54"/>
and of Night, began to have some
tender for his own Safety, and would
willingly have groped his Way back
again; when he heard a Voice, as
from a Person whose Breath had been
stopp'd by some forcible Oppression,
and just then, by a violent Effort,
was broke through the Restraint.—
<q>Yet— Yet—(again reply'd
the Voice, still struggling for Air;)
Forbear—and I'll forgive what's
past—I have done nothing yet
that needs a Pardon, (says another)
and what is to come, will admit of
none.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Person who seemed to be
the Oppressed, made several Attempts
to speak, but they were only inarticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Sounds, being all interrupted
and choaked in their Passage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was sufficiently astonish'd,
and would have crept nearer to the
Place whence he guessed the Voice
to come; but he was got among the
Ruines of an Old Monastery, and
could not stir so silently, but some
loose Stones he met with made a rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61573:54"/>
The Noise alarm'd both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and as it gave Comfort to the
one, it so Terrified the t'other, that
he could not hinder the Oppressed
from calling for help. <hi>Aurelian</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd
it was a Womans Voice, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
drawing his Sword, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
what was the Matter; he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with the Appearance of a Man,
who had opened a Dark Lanthorn
which he had by him, and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him with a Pistol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his Hand
ready cock'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> seeing the irresistable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
his Adversary had over him,
would fain have retired; and, by the
greatest Providence in the World,
going backwards fell down over some
loose Stones that lay in his Way, just
in that Instant of Time when the
Villain fired his Pistol, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him fall, concluded he had Shot
him. The Crys of the afflicted Person
were redoubled at the Tragical Sight,
which made the Murderer, drawing a
Poniard, to threaten-him, that the
next Murmur should be his last. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:61573:55"/>
who was scarce assured that he
was unhurt, got softly up; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
near enough to perceive the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
that was used to stop the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Man's Mouth; (for now he saw
plainly it was a Man) cry'd out,
—Turn, Villain, and look upon thy
Death.—The Fellow amazed at
the Voice, turn'd about to have
snatch'd up the Lanthorn from the
Ground; either to have given Light
only to himself, or to have put out
the Candle, that he might have made
his Escape; but which of the Two he
designed, no Body could tell but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
And if the Reader have a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
to know, he must blame <hi>Aurelian;</hi>
who thinking there could be no foul
Play offered to such a Villain, ran him
immediately through the Heart, so
that he drop'd down Dead at his
Feet, without speaking a Word. He
would have seen who the Person was
he had thus happily delivered, but
the Dead Body had fallen upon the
Lanthorn, which put out the Candle:
However, coming up toward him, he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61573:55"/>
ask'd him how he did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bid him
be of good Heart; he was answered
with nothing but Prayers, Blessings
and Thanks, called a Thousand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers,
good Genius's and Guardian
Angels. And the Rescued would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have gone upon his Knees to
have worshipped him, had he not
been bound Hand and Foot; which
<hi>Aurelian</hi> understanding, groped for
the Knots, and either untied them or
cut them asunder; but 'tis more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
the latter, because more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious.</p>
            <p>They took little heed what became
of the Body which they left behind
them, and <hi>Aurelian</hi> was conducted
from out the Ruins by the Hand of
him he had delivered. By a faint light
issuing from the just rising Moon, he
could discern that it was a Youth; but
coming into a more frequented part
of the Town, where several Lights
were hung out, he was amaz'd at the
extream Beauty which appeared in his
Face, though a little pale and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
with his late fright. <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61573:56"/>
longed to hear the Story of so odd
an adventure, and entreated his
Charge to tell it him by the way; but
he desired him to forbear till they
were come into some House or other,
where he might rest and recover his
tired Spirits, for yet he was so faint
he was unable to look up. <hi>Aurelian</hi>
thought these last words were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Voice, whose accent was not
new to him. That thought made
him look earnestly in the Youth's
Face, which he now was sure he had
somewhere seen before, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
asked him if he had never been at
<hi>Siena?</hi> That Question made the
young Gentleman look up, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a Joy appeared in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which yet he endeavoured to
smother; so praying <hi>Aurelian</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him to his Lodging, he promised
him that as soon as they should
come thither, he would acquaint
him with any thing he desired to
know. <hi>Aurelian</hi> would rather have
gone any where else than to his own
Lodging; but being so very late he was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61573:56"/>
at a loss, and so forced to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
            <p>As soon as they were come into his
Chamber, and that Lights were
brought them and the Servant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed,
the paleness which so visibly
before had usurped the sweet Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the afflicted Youth vanished,
and gave place to a more lively Flood
of Crimson, which with a modest
heat glow'd freshly on his Cheeks.
<hi>Aurelian</hi> waited with a pleasing Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the discovery promised him,
when the Youth still struggling with
his Resolution, with a timorous haste,
pulled off a Peruke which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
the most beautiful abundance
of Hair that ever graced one Female
Head; those dishevelled spreading
Tresses, as at first they made a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of, so at last they served for
a veil to the modest lovely blushes of
the fair <hi>Incognita;</hi> for she it was and
none other. But Oh! the inexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
inconceivable joy and amazement
of <hi>Aurelian!</hi> As soon as he durst ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to think, he concluded it to be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61573:57"/>
all vision, and never doubted so much
of any thing in his Life as of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then awake. But she taking him
by the Hand, and desiring him to sit
down by her, partly convinced him
of the reality of her presence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This is the second time, <hi>Don Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito,</hi>
(said she to him) that I have
been here this Night. What the
occasion was of my seeking you out,
and how by miracle you preserved
me, would add too much to the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
I perceive you to be already in
should I tell you: Nor will I make
any further discovery, till I know
what censure you pass upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
which I have put in you, and
the strange Circumstances in which
you find me at this time. I am sensible
they are such, that I shall not blame
your severest Conjectures; but I
hope to convince you, when you shall
hear what I have to say in justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my Vertue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Justification! (cry'd <hi>Aurelian</hi>)
what Infidel dares doubt it! Then
kneeling down, and taking her Hand,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61573:57"/>
               <q>Ah Madam (says he) would Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
would no other ways look upon,
than I behold your Perfections—
Wrong not your Creature with a
Thought, he can be guilty of that
horrid Impiety as once to doubt your
Vertue.—Heavens! (cry'd he,
starting up) am I so really blessed to
see you once again! May I trust my
Sight?—Or does my fancy now
only more strongly work?—
For still I did preserve your Image
in my Heart, and you were ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to my dearest Thoughts.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Enough <hi>Hippolito,</hi> enough of
Rapture (said she) you cannot much
accuse me of Ingratitude; for you
see I have not been unmindful of
you; but moderate your Joy till I
have told you my Condition, and
if for my sake you are raised to this
Delight, it is not of a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>At that (as <hi>Aurelian</hi> tells the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
a Sigh diffused a mournful sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
through the Air, and liquid
grief fell gently from her Eyes, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61573:58"/>
sadness sat upon her Brow,
and even sorrow seem'd delighted
with the Conquest he had made.
See what a change <hi>Aurelian</hi> felt! His
Heart bled Tears, and trembled in his
Breast; Sighs struggling for a vent had
choaked each others passage up: His
Floods of Joys were all supprest; cold
doubts and fears had chill'd 'em with
a sudden Frost, and he was troubled to
excess; yet knew not why. Well, the
Learned say it was Sympathy; and I
am always of the Opinion with the
Learned, if they speak first.</p>
            <p>After a World of Condoleance had
passed between them, he prevailed
with her to tell him her Story. So
having put all her Sighs into one great
Sigh, she discharged her self of 'em
all at once, and formed the Relation
you are just about to Read.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Having been in my Infancy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
to a Man I could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and now by my Parents being
likely to be forced to Marry him, is
in short, the great occasion of my
grief. I fansy'd (continued she)
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61573:58"/>
something so Generous in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and uncommon in your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
while you were diverting
your self, and rallying me with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Gallantry, at the Ball,
as induced me to hold Conference
with you. I now freely confess to
you, out of design, That if things
should happen as I then feared, and
as now they are come to pass, I
might rely upon your assistance in
a matter of Concern; and in which
I would sooner chuse to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a generous Stranger, than any
Acquaintance I have. What Mirth
and Freedom I then put on, were, I
can assure you, far distant from my
Heart; but I did violence to my self
out of Complaisance to your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.—
I knew you at the Tilting,
and wished you might come off as
you did; though I do not doubt,
but you would have had as good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
had it been opposite to my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
Not to detain you by too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
a Relation, every day my Friends
urged me to the Match they had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61573:59"/>
agreed upon for me, before I was
capable of Consenting; at last their
importunities grew to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that I found I must either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
which would make me misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or be miserable by perpetually
enduring to be baited by my Father,
Brother and other Relations. I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
yesterday, on a suddain, to give
firm Faith to the Opinion I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of you; and accordingly came
in the Evening to request your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
in delivering me from my
Tormentors, by a safe and private
conveyance of me to a Monastry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four Leagues hence, where I
have an Aunt who would receive me,
and is the only Relation I have averse
to the Match. I was surprized at
the appearance of some Company I
did not expect at your Lodgings;
which made me in haste tear a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
which I had written to you with
Directions where to find me, and get
speedily away in my Coach to an old
Servant's House, whom I acquainted
with my purpose: By my Order she
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61573:59"/>
provided me of this Habit which I
now wear; I ventured to trust my
self with her Brother, and resolved
to go under his Conduct to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery;
he proved to be a Villain,
and pretending to take me a short
and private way to the place where
he was to take up a Hackney Coach
(for that which I came in was broke
some where or other, with the haste it
made to carry me from your Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
led me into an old ruined Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
where it pleased Heaven, by
what Accident I know not, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
you. I need not tell you how
you saved my Life and my Honour,
by revenging me with the Death of
my Persidious Guide. This is the
summ of my present Condition,
bating the apprehensions I am in of
being taken by some of my Relations,
and forced to a thing so quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to my Inclinations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was confounded at the
Relation she had made, and began to
fear his own Estate to be more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
than ever he had imagined. He
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61573:60"/>
made her a very Passionate and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Speech in behalf of himself
(much better than I intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
here) and expressed a mighty
concern that she should look upon his
ardent Affection to be only Rallery
or Gallantry. He was very free of
his Oaths to confirm the Truth of
what he pretended, nor I believe did
she doubt it, or at least was unwilling
so to do: For I would Caution the
Reader by the bye, not to believe
every word which she told him, nor
that admirable sorrow which she coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terseited
to be accurately true. It
was indeed truth so cunningly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with Fiction, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
no less Wit and Presence of
Mind than she was endowed with so to
acquit her self on the suddain. She
had entrusted her self indeed with a
Fellow who proved a Villain, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
her to a Monastery; but one
which was in the Town, and where
she intended only to lie concealed for
his sake; as the Reader shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
ere long: For we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61573:60"/>
Discovery to make to him, if
he have not found it out of himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Aurelian</hi> had said what he was
able upon the Subject in hand, with a
mournful tone and dejected look, he
demanded his Doom. She asked him
if he would endeavour to convey
her to the Monastery she had told him
of? <q>Your commands, Madam, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
he) are Sacred to me; and
were they to lay down my Life I
would obey them.</q> With that he would
have gone out of the Room, to have
given order for his Horses to be got
ready immediately; but with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
so full of sorrow as moved
Compassion in the tender hearted <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita.</hi>
               <q>Stay a little <hi>Don Hippolito</hi>
(said she) I fear I shall not be able to
undergo the Fatigue of a Journey
this Night.—Stay and give me
your Advice how I shall conceal my
my self if I continue to morrow in
this Town.</q> 
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> could have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
her she was not then in a
place to avoid discovery: But he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61573:61"/>
must also have told her then the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> whom he was, and
who were in quest of him, which he
did not think convenient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
till necessity should urge him;
for he feared least her knowledge of
those designs which were in agitation
between him and <hi>Iuliana,</hi> might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her more from giving her consent.
At last he resolved to try his utmost
perswasions to gain her, and told her
accordingly, he was afraid she would
be disturbed there in the Morning,
and he knew no other way (if she
had not as great an aversion for
him as the Man whom she now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to avoid) than by making
him happy to make her self secure.
He demonstrated to her, that the
disobligation to her Parents would be
greater by going to a Monastery, since
it was only to avoid a choice which
they had made for her, and which
she could not have so just a pretence
to do till she had made one for her
self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61573:61"/>A World of other Arguments he
used, which she contradicted as long
as she was able, or at least willing. At
last she told him, she would consult her
Pillow, and in the Morning conclude
what was fit to be done. He thought
it convenient to leave her to her rest,
and having lock'd her up in his Room,
went himself to repose upon a Pallat
by Signior <hi>Claudio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, it may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to enquire what became of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito.</hi>
He had wandered much in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> though <hi>Leonora</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
took up his Thoughts; He was
reflecting upon the oddness and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
of his Circumstances, the
Continuation of which had doubtless
created in him a great uneasmess,
when it was interrupted with the
noise of opening the Gates of the
Convent of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> whither he was
arrived sooner than he thought for,
being the place <hi>Aurelian</hi> had appointed
by the Lacquey to meet him in.
He wondered to see the Gates opened
at so unseasonable an hour, and went
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61573:62"/>
to enquire the reason of it from them
who were employ'd; but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be Novices, and made him
signs to go in, where he might meet
with some body allow'd to answer
him. He found the Religious Men all
up, and Tapers lighting every where:
at last he follow'd a Friar who was
going into the Garden, and asking
him the cause of these Preparations,
he was answered, That they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to pray for the Soul of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,
who was just departing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this Life, and whom upon far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
talk with him, he found to be
the same <hi>Lorenzo</hi> so often mentioned.
<hi>Don Mario,</hi> it seems Uncle to <hi>Lorenzo</hi>
and Father to <hi>Leonora,</hi> had a private
Door out of the Garden belonging to
his House into that of the Convent,
which Door this Father was now a
going to open, that he and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
might come and offer up their
Oraisons for the Soul of their Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> having informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of as much as he could ask without
suspicion, took his leave of the Friar,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61573:62"/>
not a little joyful at the Hopes he had
by such unexpected Means, of seeing
his Beautiful <hi>Leonora:</hi> As soon as he
was got at convenient Distance from
the Friar, (who 'tis like thought he
had return'd into the Convent to his
Devotion) he turned back through a
close Walk which led him with a little
Compass, to the same private Door,
where just before he had left the
Friar, who now he saw was gone, and
the Door open.</p>
            <p>He went into <hi>Don Mario</hi>'s Garden,
and walk'd round with much Caution
and Circumspection; for the Moon
was then about to rise, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
diffused a glimmering Light,
sufficient to distinguish a Man from a
Tree. By Computation now (which
is a very remarkable Circumstance)
<hi>Hippolito</hi> entred this Garden near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Instant, when <hi>Aurelian</hi>
wandred into the Old Monastery and
found his <hi>Incognita</hi> in Distress. He
was pretty well acquainted with the
Platform, and Sight of the Garden;
for he had formerly surveyed the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61573:63"/>
and knew what part to make to if
he should be surpriz'd and driven to a
precipitate Escape. He took his Stand
behind a well-grown Bush of Myrtle,
which, should the Moon shine brighter
than was required, had the Advantage
to be shaded by the Indulgent Boughs
of an ancient Bay-Tree. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with the Choice he had made,
for he found a Hallow in the Myrtle,
as if purposely contriv'd for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of one Person, who might
undiscovered perceive all about him.
He looked upon it as a good Omen,
that the Tree Consecrated to <hi>Venus</hi>
was so propitious to him in his Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Distress. The Consideration of
that, together with the Obligation he
lay under to the Muses, for sheltering
him also with so large a Crown of
Bays, had like to have set him a Rhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>He was, to tell the Truth, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
addicted to <hi>Madrigal,</hi> and we
should undoubtedily have had a small
desert of Numbers to have pick'd
and Criticiz'd upon, had he not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61573:63"/>
been interrupted just upon his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
nay, after the Preliminary
Sigh had made Way for his Utterance.
But so was his Fortune, <hi>Don Mario</hi>
was coming towards the Door at that
very nick of Time, where he met
with a Priest just out of Breath, who
told him that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was just brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
his last, and desired to know if
he would come and take his final
Leave before they were to administer
the Extream Unction. <hi>Don Mario,</hi>
who had been at some Difference
with his Nephew, now thought it
his Duty to be reconciled to him;
so calling to <hi>Leonora,</hi> who was
coming after him, he bid her go
to her Devotions in the Chappel,
and told her where he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>He went on with the Priest, while
<hi>Hippolito</hi> saw <hi>Leonora</hi> come forward,
only accompanied by her Woman.
She was in an undress, and by reason
of a Melancholy visible in her Face,
more Careless than usual in her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
which he thought added as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61573:64"/>
much as was possible to the abundance
of her Charms. He had not much
Time to Contemplate this Beauteous
Vision, for she soon passed into the
Garden of the Convent, leaving him
Confounded with Love, Admiration,
Joy, Hope, Fear, and all the Train
of Passions, which seize upon Men in
his Condition, all at once. He was
so teazed with this Variety of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he never missed the Two
Hours that had slipped away during
his Automachy and Intestine Conflict.
<hi>Leonora</hi>'s Return settled his Spirits,
at least united them, and he had now
no other Thought but how he should
present himself before her. When
she calling her Woman, bid her bolt
the Garden Door on the Inside, that
she might not be Surpriz'd by her
Father, if he returned through the
Convent; which done, she ordered
her to bring down her Lute, and
leave her to her self in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61573:64"/>All this <hi>Hippolito</hi> saw and heard to
his inexpressible Content, yet had he
much to do to smother his Joy, and
hinder it from taking a Vent, which
would have ruined the only Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of his Life. <hi>Leonora</hi> withdrew
into an Arbour so near him, that he
could distinctly hear her if she Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or Sung: Having tuned her Lute,
with a Voice soft as the Breath of
Angels, she sung to it this following
Air:
<q>
                  <lg n="1">

            <p>The Song ended grieved <hi>Hippolito</hi>
that it was so soon ended; and in
the Ecstacy he was then rapt, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he would have been satisfied to
have expired with it. He could not
help Flattering himself, (though at
the same Time he checked his own
Vanity) that he was the Person meant
in the Song. While he was indulging
which thought, to his happy Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
he heard it encouraged by
these Words:</p>

<hi>Aurelian</hi> False!—False! alass, I
know not what I say; How can he
be False, or True, or any Thing to

am mad, and fansie it to be Love;
Foolish Girl, recal thy banish'd
Reason.—Ah! would it were no
more, would I could rave, sure that
would give me Ease, and rob me of
the Sense of Pain; at least, among
my wandring Thoughts, I should at
sometime light upon <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and

would flatter my poor feeble

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> could hear no more, he
had not Room for half his Transport.
When <hi>Leonora</hi> perceived a Man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
toward her, she fell a trembling,
and could not speak. <hi>Hippolito</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with Reverence, as to a
Sacred Shrine; when coming near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to see her Consternation, he
fell upon his Knees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:61573:66"/>
               <q>Behold, O Adored <hi>Leonora</hi> (said
he) your ravished <hi>Aurelian,</hi> behold
at your feet the Happiest of Men,
be not disturb'd at my Appearance,
but think that Heaven conducted
me to hear my Bliss pronounced by
that dear Mouth alone, whose breath
could fill me with new Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here he would have come nearer,
but <hi>Leonora</hi> (scarce come to her self)
was getting up in haste to have gone
away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he catch'd her Hand, and with
all the Endearments of Love and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport
pressed her stay; she was a long
time in great Confusion, at last, with
many Blushes, she entreated him to let
her go where she might hide her Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Head, and not expose her shame
before his Eyes, since his Ears had
been sufficient Witnesses of her Crime.
He begg'd pardon for his Treachery
in over-hearing, and confessed it to
be a Crime he had now repeated.
With a Thousand Submissions, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
Prayers, Praises, Blessings,
and passionate Expressions he wrought
upon her to stay and hear him. Here
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61573:67"/>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> made use of his Rhetorick,
and it proved prevailing: 'Twere te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to tell the many ingenious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he used, with all her Nice Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
and Objections. In short,
he convinced her of his Passion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to her the necessity they
were under, of being speedy in their
Resolves: That his Father (for still
he was <hi>Aurelian</hi>) would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find him in the Morning, and then
it would be too late to Repent. She
on the other Hand, knew it was in
vain to deny a Passion, which he had
heard her so frankly own; (and no
doubt was very glad it was past and
done;) besides apprehending the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of delay, and having some little
Jealousies and Fears of what Effect
might be produced between the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of his Father and the Beauties
of <hi>Iuiliana;</hi> after some decent Denials,
she consented to be Conducted by him
through the Garden into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
where she would prevail with
her Confessor to Marry them. He
was a scrupulous Old Father whom
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61573:67"/>
they had to deal withal, insomuch
that ere they had perswaded him,
<hi>Don Mario</hi> was returned by the Way
of his own House, where missing
his Daughter, and her Woman not
being able to give any farther Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of her, than that she left her
in the Garden; he concluded she was
gone again to her Devotions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he found her in the Chappel
upon her Knees with <hi>Hippolito</hi> in her
Hand, receiving the Father's Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
upon Conclusion of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>It would have asked a very skilful
Hand, to have depicted to the Life
the Faces of those Three Persons, at
<hi>Don Mario</hi>'s Appearance. He that
has seen some admirable Piece of
Transmutation by a Gorgon's Head,
may form to himself the most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Idea of the Prototype. The Old
Gentleman was himself in a sort of
a Wood, to find his Daughter with a
Young Fellow and a Priest, but as yet
he did not know the Worst, till <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
and <hi>Leonora</hi> came, and kneeling
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61573:68"/>
at his Feet, begg'd his Forgiveness
and Blessing as his Son and Daughter.
<hi>Don Mario,</hi> instead of that, fell into
a most violent Passion, and would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
have committed some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Action, had he not been
restrained, more by the Sanctity of the
Place, than the Perswasions of all
the Religious, who were now come
about him. <hi>Leonora</hi> stirr'd not off
her Knees all this time, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
begging of him that he would
hear her.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah! Ungrateful and Undutiful
Wretch (cry'd he) how hast thou
requited all my Care and Tenderness
of thee? Now when I might have
expected some return of Comfort,
to throw thy self away upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know
Person, and, for ought I
know, a Villain; to me I'm sure he
is a Villain, who has robb'd me of
my Treasure, my Darling Joy, and
all the future Happiness of my Life
prevented. Go—go, thou now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-be-forgotten
<hi>Leonora,</hi> go and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
thy unprosperous Choice; you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61573:68"/>
who wanted not a Father's Counsel,
cannot need, or else will slight his
Blessing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These last Words were spoken with
so much Passion and feeling Concern,
that <hi>Levnora,</hi> moved with Excess of
Grief, fainted at his Feet, just as she
had caught hold to Embrace his Knees.
The Old Man would have shook her
off, but Compassion and Fatherly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
came upon him in the midst
of his Resolve, and melted him into
Tears; he Embraced his Daughter
in his Arms, and wept over her,
while they endeavoured to restore her
Senses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> was in such Concern he
could not speak, but was busily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in rubbing and chafing her
Temples; when she opening her Eyes
laid hold of his Arm, and cry'd
out—<hi>Oh my</hi> Aurelian—<hi>how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
have you made me!</hi> With that she
had again like to have fainted away,
but he shook her in his Arms, and
begg'd <hi>Don Mario</hi> to have some pity
on his Daughter, since by his Severity
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61573:69"/>
she was reduced to that Condition.
The Old Man hearing his Daughter
name <hi>Aurelian,</hi> was a little revived,
and began to hope Things were in a
pretty good Condition, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to comfort her; and having
brought her wholly to her self, was
content to hear her Excuse, and in a
little time was so far wrought upon
as to beg <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Pardon for the Ill
Opinion he had conceived of him, and
not long after gave his Consent.</p>
            <p>The Night was spent in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
and it was now clear Day, when
<hi>Don Mario</hi> Conducting his new Son and
Daughter through the Garden, was
met by some Servants of the Marquess
of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> who had been enquiring for
<hi>Donna Leonona;</hi> to know if <hi>Iuliana</hi> had
lately been with her; for that she was
missing from her Father's House, and
no conjectures could be made of what
might become of her. <hi>Don Mario</hi>
and <hi>Leonora</hi> were surprized at the
News, for he knew well enough of
the Match that was design'd for <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana;</hi>
and having enquired where the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61573:69"/>
Marquess was, it was told him, That
he was gone with <hi>Don Fabio</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britio</hi>
toward <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Lodgings.
<hi>Don Mario</hi> having assured the Servants
that <hi>Iuliana</hi> had not been there, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
them, and advised with his
Son and Daughter how they should
undeceive the Marquess and <hi>Don Fabio</hi>
in their Expectations of <hi>Aurelian.
Hippolito</hi> could oftentimes scarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
smiling at the old Man's Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
who was most deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
he at length advised them to go
all down together to his Lodging,
where he would present himself before
his Father, and ingenuously confess
to him the truth, and he did not questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his approving of his Choice.</p>
            <p>This was agreed to, and the Coach
made ready. While they were upon
their way, <hi>Hippolito</hi> pray'd heartily
that his Friend <hi>Aurelian</hi> might be at
the Lodging, to satisfie <hi>Don Mario</hi>
and <hi>Leonora</hi> of his Circumstances and
Quality, when he should be obliged
to discover himself. His Petitions were
granted; for <hi>Don Fabio</hi> had beset the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61573:70"/>
House long before his Son was up or
<hi>Incognita</hi> awake.</p>
            <p>Upon the arrival of <hi>Don Mario</hi> and
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> they heard a great Noise and
Hubbub above Stairs, which <hi>Don Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>
concluded was occasioned by their
not finding <hi>Aurelian,</hi> whom he thought
he could give the best account of: So
that it was not in <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s power to
disswade him from going up before to
prepare his Father to receive and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him. While <hi>Hippolito</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi>
were left in the Coach at the
Door, he made himself known to her,
and begg'd her pardon a thousand
times for continuing the deceit. She
was under some concern at first to find
she was still mistaken; but his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and the Reasons he gave, soon
reconciled him to her; his Person was
altogether as agreeable, his Estate and
Quality not at all inferiour to <hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s;
in the mean time, the true <hi>Aurelian</hi>
who had seen his Father, begg'd leave
of him to withdraw for a moment; in
which time he went into the Chamber
where his <hi>Incognita</hi> was dressing her
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61573:70"/>
self, by his design, in Woman's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
while he was consulting with
her how they should break the
matter to his Father; it happened
that <hi>Don Mario</hi> came up Stairs where
the Marquess and <hi>Don Fabio</hi> were;
they undoubtedly concluded him Mad,
to hear him making Apologies and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
for <hi>Aurelian,</hi> whom he told them
if they would promise to forgive he
would present before them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.
The Marquess asked him if his
Daughter had lain with <hi>Leonora</hi> that
Night; he answered him with another
question in behalf of <hi>Aurelian.</hi> In
short, they could not understand one
another, but each thought 'tother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
himself. <hi>Don Mario</hi> was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
that they would not believe
him, that he ran down Stairs and
came to the Door out of Breath, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
<hi>Hippolito</hi> that he would come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the House quickly, for that he
could not perswade his Father but
that he had already seen and spoke to
him. <hi>Hippolito</hi> by that understood
that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was in the House; so
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61573:71"/>
taking <hi>Leonora</hi> by the Hand, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>Don Mario,</hi> who led him up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Dining-Room, where they
found <hi>Aurelian</hi> upon his Knees, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his Father to forgive him, that
he could not agree to the Choice he
had made for him, since he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
disposed of himself, and that
before he understood the designs he
had for him, which was the reason
that he had hitherto concealed himself.
<hi>Don Fabio</hi> knew not how to answer
him, but look'd upon the Marquess,
and the Marquess upon him, as if the
Cement had been cool'd which was
to have united their Families.</p>
            <p>All was silent, and <hi>Don Mario</hi> for
his part took it to be all Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he was coming forward to
present <hi>Hippolito</hi> to them, when <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>
spying his Friend, started from
his Knees and ran to embrace him—
My dear <hi>Hippolito</hi> (said he) what
happy chance has brought you
hither, just at my Necessity? <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
pointed to <hi>Don Mario</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora,</hi>
and told him upon what terms
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61573:71"/>
he came. <hi>Don Mario</hi> was ready to run
mad, hearing him called <hi>Hippolito,</hi>
and went again to examine his
Daughter. While she was informing
him of the truth, the Marquess's
Servants returned with the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
News that his Daughter was no
where to be found. While the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
and <hi>Don Fabritio</hi> were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at, and lamenting the Misfortune
of her loss, <hi>Hippolito</hi> came towards
<hi>Don Fabio</hi> and interceded for his Son,
since the Lady perhaps had withdrawn
her self out of an Aversion to the
Match. <hi>Don Fabio,</hi> though very much
incens'd, yet forgot not the Respect
due to <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Quality; and by his
perswasion spoke to <hi>Aurelian,</hi> though
with a stern Look and angry Voice,
and asked him where he had disposed
the cause of his Disobedience, if he
were worthy to see her or no; <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>
made answer, That he desired
no more than for him to see her; and
he did not doubt a Consequence of
his Approbation and Forgiveness—
Well (said <hi>Don Fabio</hi>) you are very
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61573:72"/>
conceited of your own Discretion, let
us see this Rarety. While <hi>Aurelian</hi>
was gone in for <hi>Incognita,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
of <hi>Viterbo</hi> and <hi>Don Fabritio</hi>
were taking their leaves in great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for their loss and disappointment;
but <hi>Don Fabio</hi> entreated their stay a
moment longer till the return of his
Son. <hi>Aurelian</hi> led <hi>Incognita</hi> into the
Room veil'd, who seeing some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
there which he had not told her
of, would have gone back again. But
<hi>Don Fabio</hi> came bluntly forwards, and
ere she was aware, lifted up her Veil
and beheld the Fair <hi>Incognita,</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing from <hi>Iuliana,</hi> but in her
Name. This discovery was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
surprizing and welcome, that
either Joy or Amazement had tied up
the Tongues of the whole Company.
<hi>Aurelian</hi> here was most at a loss, for
he knew not of his Happiness; and
that which all along prevented <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>'s
confessing her self to him, was
her knowing <hi>Hippolito</hi> (for whom she
took him) to be <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Friend,
and she feared if he had known her,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61573:72"/>
that he would never have consented
to have deprived him of her. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liana</hi>
was the first that spoke, falling
upon her Knees to her Father, who
was not enough himself to take her
up. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> ran to her, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
the Marquess, who then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
her, but could not yet speak.
<hi>Fabritio</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> strove who should
first take her in their Arms; for <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>
he was out of his wits for Joy,
and <hi>Iuliana</hi> was not much behind him,
to see how happily their Loves and
Duties were reconciled. <hi>Don Fabio</hi>
embraced his Son and forgave him:
The Marquess and <hi>Fabritio</hi> gave <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
into his hands, he received the
Blessing upon his Knees; all were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-joy'd,
and <hi>Don Mario</hi> not a little
proud at the discovery of his Son-in-Law,
whom <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not fail to
set forth with all the ardent Zeal and
Eloquence of Friendship. <hi>Iuliana</hi>
and <hi>Leonora</hi> had pleasant Discourse
about their unknown and mistaken
Rivalship, and it was the Subject of
a great deal of Mirth to hear <hi>Iuliana</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:61573:73"/>
relate the several Contrivances which
she had to avoid <hi>Aurelian</hi> for the sake
of <hi>Hippolito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having diverted themselves with
many Remarks upon the pleasing sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
they all thought it proper to
attend upon the Great Duke that
Morning at the Palace, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the Novelty of what
had pass'd; while, by the way, the
two Young Couple entertained the
Company with the Relation of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Particulars of their Three Days
Adventures.</p>
