            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sleights which this Grand cunning Master of mischiefe doth use, to bring us to destruction with all, there is no one policy of his that is more prevalent and advantagious to him, than is the sowing of discord and debate betwixt Man and Wife; and although he hath a thousand innumerable wayes for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of his damnable projects and purposes, yet Jealousie is the chiefe and maine Engine to bring it so to passe, that modesty shall be turn'd into mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, peace into strife, and love into hatred and mischiefe, as shall be shewed in this short following Treatise.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of <hi>August</hi> last, 1638. this hellish fire of Jealousie did most strangely inflame five Women, whom my Pen should not name, nor should they be knowne by any writing of mine, but that they and their mad and barbarous proceedings are too much true, and too many wayes scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and spread abroad by sundry Pens and Tongues, some of them making the matter that was (and is) bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23174:4"/>
already, worse; some min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it, to make it better; some for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, some for malice; some for flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and some as their idle and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours please, doe report it as they list to frame it, not caring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they speake or write truth or false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The matter hath beene Rim'd upon beyond Reason, and therefore I hold it Reason it should be related with truth, and thus it was.</p>
            <p>At the time, or neare the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, one Master <hi>Evans,</hi> a Barber in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> did chance to meete with one <hi>Ioane Ilsley</hi> in the Streete, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the woman had formerly kept the said <hi>Evans</hi> his wife when shee lay in Child-bed, in which season (of Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-month or Wander-month) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the suspicious woman began to be a little inkindled with the sparkles of jealousie: but suspicion is no proofe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23174:5"/>
               <hi>Ioane</hi> that her anger was past against her, so that agreement was made, that a Pigge should be eaten at Mistris <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi> her house at night, and that in a faire seeming way <hi>Ioane Ilsly</hi> should be sent for as a loving guest invited to the Pigge.</p>
            <p>At the time appointed the Pigge was roasted, and the women dissembled, were assembled, and simple <hi>Ioane</hi> was sent for, who (poore wench) not sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the sharpnesse or sowernesse of the Feast, suspecting nothing, went to them, and being come amongst them, they seemed very friendly and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to entertaine and bid her wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: to whom Mistris <hi>Evans</hi> said, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

wrong or injury: in a word, there is nothing can grieve or torment the heart either of a good man or woman, than to finde their truth, constancy, loyalty, and honest integrity suspected or question'd; for let it be truely weighed and considered, what hurt or occasion of suspicion can be for a man to give a woman a part of one Pint of wine, in an open low roome in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Taverne? it is not to bee doubted but such accidents doe happen dayly, at the least a thousand, and yet for all that there is not one Whoore or Cuckold the more: but when as rashnesse addes waxen wings (like those of <hi>Icarus</hi>) of indiscretion and inconsideration, and that either the man or the woman are mounted or soar'd aloft to the height of Love-killing hell-borne jealousie, then doth the furious heate and flame of rage melt those deceitfull and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wings, wings whereby the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous party drops and tumbles downe headlong into the bottomelesse Ocean
