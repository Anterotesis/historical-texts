         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

reade: I had rather sayd he, haue my bookes which are toyes, for that I know their meaning, then these which are true, for that I vnderstand not their manners. Another taking <hi>Ciceroes</hi> Pen, and beginning to write, drew foolish sentences, and mishape<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayings: why? said he, this is sutch a mans Pen, and yet see how disorderly it hath written?

So, this simple Author must lie in <hi>Diogenes</hi> Tub, before his writing like his owne fantasye, and put on <hi>Socrates</hi> Gowne, before his dooings please all fauours. There was brought vnto <hi>Appelles</hi> the head of a Noble man, being slaine, to haue his counterfayte drawen, and the fauour that his face then retayned to be deuised: which he promised to do effectually, and to end it speedely: then wiping his face, being a little bloudy, perceiued him to be a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly personage, when before he liued, though now (dead) he looked not so louely: then behoulding it better, sawe in his cheeke a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cut with some blowe, whereout so fast as he wiped issued a drop of bloud: then he drew the fauour of his face, and the drop of bloud on his cheeke: said the other, wherefore hast thou made
<pb facs="tcp:1777:3"/>
his face so white, and his lips so wan, and yet that drop of bloud so on his cheeke? For (sayd he) were that spot away, they would thinke he lost all his bloud when he left his life, but now they may see, he inioyeth that dead, which he possessed liuing: If then <hi>Appelles</hi> had controulers, beeing so perfect a Painter, I surely shall finde cauillers for this vnperfect posie: the simplicitie of this work I know will cause it be liked but of few, yet some no doubt wyll reed it though but for a fashion: for though <hi>Narbonus</hi> were in his youth allured to many wanton lustes, yet once hauing felt the force of Fortune, was seduced to an honest lyfe. But as the Crow thinketh they are not her owne birdes, vnlesse they looke as blacke as her self, and the Eagle imagineth they are not her owne brood vnles they looke against the Sunne: so this youth would not be reformed vntyll he sawe his owne follyes before his face, nor be reclaimed tyll he had tasted some purging Pilles for his mad maladyes. But some (happely) will imagine me to haue beene in loue, for putting heere this name Lust, but rather they may think me to haue liued by the losse, that haue ben lured so mutch to my own liberty: yet I am like him in this respect that putteth vp a Supplication to his Prince, who regardeth not who dislike him so it please his person: So, first wil I way your proofe, and then regarde others propertye: He must I know arise earlye that shall like all men, and he must write well that shall please all mindes: but he that planteth trees in a Forest, knoweth not how many shall taste the Fruite, and he that soweth in his garden di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Seedes, knoweth not who shall eate of his Sallets. He that planteth a Vine, knoweth not who shall taste his Wine: and he that putteth any thing in Print, must thinke that all will peruse it: If then amongst many blossoms, some prooue blastes, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if amongst many Readers, some prooue Riders: but let them laugh, to see if I will lowre: for who so accepts not my good will shewes himselfe to haue but small wit: But as (all ready) my assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce

                     <hi>NArbonus</hi> hauinge read the Letter, and wayinge the effect of the contents, his eyes burst sodainely into a fountaine of teares, makinge a litle riuer, vpon his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery cheekes, looking vpon him selfe, as vncertaine whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Letter were presented him from his Unckle, or that it were but the flying fancy of some dreame: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuinge it to be true in déede, and no deceiuinge deuice that beguiled him, hée wept so bitterly, as a man may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine <hi>Peeter</hi> did for his Maister: so fast the teares ran from him, and the gréefe was greater then the anguish of him that receiueth iudgement, or hath his condemnacion pronounced against him to yéeld to the torments of death,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1777:20"/>
or to pay his life a ransom for all wicked dooings: his hart did so languish his yll hap, and lewde life, and his soule lamented his froward fate, &amp; daungerous destiny, as if no pardon should acquited him, or any raunsome set him frée: his soule for a season in an extasie, and his minde so amazed, as if in lamenting, hee should haue died, and in dyinge, made some attonement for his sinnes: such was the extremitie of his passion, and so greate the gréefe of this new receaued Letter: for his conscience was guilty, and therfore yeelded to the force of his fancy, ledde as it were by a legion of resolucions, which way to take, or what was best be done: but in the end, perceiuing his own folly, and musing at his madnes, in that children doo cry, and Women wéepe: not men to complaine in such order, or lament with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> léesing of a few teares, but should bridle vp their affections, and moderate their maladies in such order, as their wéepinge will neither auayle in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes, nor teares bée any testimony of their trecherous toyes: his thoughtes altogeather inflamed with fury, and his minde mooued with the measure of his malady, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these wordes to himselfe, and spoke as foloweth.</p>
                  <p>And is it true <hi>Narbonus,</hi> that thy Unckle hath dealt with thee after thy dooings, and rewarded thee according to thy workes? and if hee doe so, is it more then I merit, or other then my desertes are? no trust mée, nor so much: for were it so, how could I euer looke vpon him agayne? could my heart haue power, or my lippes bee so bolde, to craue a thinge so vnreasonable? or to aske that, which in conscience I cannot desire, his pardon to bee graunted, which will not be denyed, durst I attempt it, or put it in practise, whose care hath beene so comfortable and ayde fo assistaunt, in all these my doubtfull dealinges and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate desasters: how shall I vtter one sweet word? no it will bee so sowre, as he will hardly digest it: can I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any collusion to cloake my craft withal, or frame any excuse to hide my folly: Why had I not been called? I had staied in the Countrey, and not come to <hi>Vienna</hi>: but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1777:21"/>
my callinge was for commoditie, and willed for my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: but being informed of my wanton life, was wished to spende my time more honestly: but I was sente to <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> to learne the Law, and to profite my selfe in learninge: but my sendinge was not to learne wit of a Woodcocke, or wisedome of him that knoweth not what it meaneth: but I was sente like a Trauailer, therfore my expences the greater, but my lyuing should haue bin like a Cittizen, and so my credite beene made larger: but had I not beene caused, I had consented: but the choyce was mine owne, and the refusall was in my making: but had I not bin exhorted, I had stayed at home in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: and had I stayed at home, my lyuing had not béene lost: but mine was the consente, and mine the motion: mine the demaundinge, and mine the requestinge: mine the wishing to obtaine, therfore mine must be the blame, and mine the shame, and mine the repentaunce, for none shall smart but my selfe, nor any feele the foyle, but hee that began the battaile. The spending of my lyuinge, hath prooued mee a lewde loyterer, and the losing of my lands a right Abbey lubber: first I should haue gotten, and then fréely spent: first spare, then vsed: first gayned, and then gratified: first found franckely, and then laid on liberally. But caitiffe that I am, and most wretched, amongst other infortunate: now I speake what I should done, nowe what my pretence might haue béene, nowe I speake my minde, that it is to late, and vtter what before was to bee remedied: And why could not my estate be stayed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? and my dooing dealt in so good order as before they were? now shall my owne rod, bee the remedy for such a royster: and my owne staffe my stale for so foolish a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger, the stay of my simple state stolen away, how shal my life be prolonged? what shall I but morne in misery, and pine in perplexitie? But were these Letters sowre? and were they not also sweete? if they were bitter, yet were they tooth some? and though they were sharpe, yet were they comfortable: hée began roughly, but ended

you, and will not cause you stay vpon any matter, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long any time about any thing, whatsoeuer: which if you purpose to goe, or haue set downe with your selfe to put in execution, I beséech you let it be with speede, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hast the greatest that may be, for the sooner wée are going, with more spéede will be our ariuall, and the longer we stay, the more will be our charge.</p>
                  <p>Gramercies, good <hi>Eubulanus,</hi> answered <hi>Narbonus,</hi> for thy dutifull diligence in doing me this pleasure: and I thanke thée for the secret care thou hadst in the deliuerie of these my Letters: as for my good Unckle, I finde this his goodnesse so great, and his kindnesse so much, that so farre as my life shall reach, and the vttermost boundes of my health permitte howsoeuer, I shall be found ready to die at his féete, and to offer my soule a sacrifice, to do him such small pleasure, as my little life will permitte: as for thy great paines and carefull diligence, shall be referred till some other time, and driuen off for a more gratefull good turne, till God graunt me somewhat more liberally to bestow on thee, and send me to requite the vttermost of thy good wil: meanewhile, take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forfaiture of my faith, &amp; the troth plighted of one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will not deale double, as a most iust gage, and a perfect pledge to pleasure thée howsoeuer.</p>
                  <p>Sir, reanswered <hi>Eubulanus,</hi> these small deserts &amp; little gratulations which I dutifully haue done, and obediently fulfilled, were forced by feare, and constreyned by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement by your Unckle, and my Maister, which of dutie extended so farre, and therefore could do no lesse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I should haue shewed my selfe vndutifull, or restrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my seruice: this therfore, neither meriteth praise, nor deserueth any fauour: but if fortune be so friendly, or my hap so happie, that in matters of magnanimitie, or works of waight, my simple seruice might be sene, or my willing mind made manifest, the dutie to my maister reserued, and my obedience towards him excepted, you should not find any want of good will, or my duty worthy blame, so farre as my smal power were limited, or within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe

of my life whatsoeuer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Narbonus</hi> giuing him the choyce of a thousand thankes, and offering him any courtesie for his great good will, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the effect of his hastie letters, and the posting spéede that they required: that his Unckles pleasure was, hée should with speede come to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and not to make longer tariance, than necessitie required, or the cause of the stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would permitte: they therefore causing their Horsses to be in readinesse, and trussing vp such trinckets as they could, departed the morning ensuing, almost without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leaue of any, or giuing a friendly farewell to his old friends, and auntient companions.</p>
                  <p>These wayfaring trauellers, &amp; rancke riders, on their way towards <hi>Vienna,</hi> &amp; some part of their iourney passed, discoursed of su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry maters, &amp; the estates of diuers townes, so of their owne Weale publike, and of the Towne of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> then of the Father of <hi>Narbonus,</hi> &amp; so of his Unckle.</p>
                  <p>Sir said <hi>Eubulanus,</hi> this youre iourney was framed in hast, and furnished in post: no sooner determined, than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and no sooner thought on, then put in practise: but had you knowen before the law to haue bin so laxatiue to your pursse, and so peruerse to your purpose, I thinke you would eyther haue constreyned the countrey to kept you, or bin content your Unckles house should haue holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Eubulanus,</hi> had <hi>Alexander</hi> knowen after his valiant victories, &amp; great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quests of the third part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, he shuld haue left his life so soone, or bin poysoned in <hi>Babylon,</hi> he would neuer haue entred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walls, or come within the gates: and had <hi>Narbonus</hi> knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

full of wiles, or this studie any thing so tedious, he would neuer haue tarried the turning ouer of three leaues, or the reading of one Author.</p>
                  <p>Truth Sir, but you haue bought your witte before it was taughte, and payde for your learning more than is woorth: but the coult must be vsed to the bitte before he come to the saddle, and the wanton whelp must be taught to carrie a gloue, before he diue at a Ducke.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Eubulanus,</hi> had I beene restrained like a Coult, I had not prooued my selfe such an asse: and had my liberty bene lackinge, as wisedome would it should: my dooinges had not prooued so foolishe, nor my pretences so vaine: but as I pay deare for my learning, so is my sorrow the greater: and as my coste was chargeable, so is my minde mooued with the spending of my lyuing: but time already passed cannot bée called backe, and the Tide tarieth not the ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of any man.</p>
                  <p>Well quoth <hi>Eubulanus,</hi> your fall wil prooue your feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and better now bee taught your tricke of training, then hereafter haue prooued your painefull repenting.</p>
                  <p>In déede answered <hi>Narbonus,</hi> first wit, and then wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to haue is good hap, and to hold fast a great vertue: for <hi>Narbonus</hi> could haue sayd thou hast it: but now he can not say thou holdest it.</p>
                  <p>Truely Sir replied the other: Your Unckles careful consideracion, will be the cause of your consolation: and to submitte your selfe duetifully, will both purchase you pardon, and make you bee deemed of, as your selfe will desire.</p>
                  <p>In déede answered <hi>Narbonus,</hi> hée that yéeldeth, is often saued: but I will not onely submit my selfe, but also due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully doo whatsoeuer my good Unckle shall commaund mee.</p>
                  <p>With these prety propoundings, and pleasant replies, their iourney seemed shorter, and their trauaile not so te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious: but when they ariued at their iourneyes end and came into the house of <hi>Henricus, Narbonus</hi> was doubtfull
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1777:23"/>
what to say, how to frame his wordes, or in what order to vtter them, in what manner to submit him selfe, and how his Unckle would take the matter: but spying in the end his Unckle comming towards him, could not hold his eyes from weeping, and his hearte from throbbing, to whome he spake.</p>

My merites déere Uncle deserue no lesse than for euer to be reiected out of your fauour: and my doings if right were rewarded with iustice, haue gayned me your euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting displeasure: but presuming vpon youre patience, and suing my pardon before so mercifull a Iudge, I néede no solicitor to moue my case, or any Atturney to answere but my selfe, but that your goodnesse hath gayned me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deseruedly, that my vngratiousnes shoulde neuer haue merited: and with those words, the teares trickled so fast downe his chéekes, and his thoughts so troubled his giltie conscience, as he could not speake any more, or vtter the effect of his meaning.</p>
                  <p>His good Unckle at the sight whereof was so moued with compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and touched at the quicke, as his inward griefe did counteruayle <hi>Narbonus</hi> outwarde teares, hée therefore embracing him, and holding him betwéene his armes? saide:</p>
                  <p>Déere Nephew, that which is passed already, can not now be called backe to bee amended: and that whiche is done, can not be vndone againe: to record them therefore in order, or turne them ouer from poynt to parcel, would

be a great gréefe to you, &amp; not any pleasure to me: My selfe I know was sometimes yong as thy selfe, and no doubt those pleasures then liked me, which now do delight thee: but let herafter my wisdome rule thée being vnresonable, and my instructions perswade thée being holesom for thy health: for that which is past, I drowne it in the floud of forgetfulnesse, and neuer pretend to make rehearsal of it again: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort therfore thy wéery spirits &amp; be careful of thy own safegard, so shalt thou find me a faithful freend, and one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> séeketh thy wished desires as wel as thy self: Thus was his good Unckle pacified with his humble submissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and him selfe contented to heare his pardon pronounced.</p>
                  <p>Thus is <hi>Narbonus</hi> now in <hi>Vienna</hi> againe, free from the checkes of any, and cleare of the penalties done to his creditours: where hee turneth ouer his time, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth some of equall disposition to his owne, and some contrary his callinge, yet some flatterers, some foysters, some coggers, some cauellers, some brablers, some braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, some dissemblers, some daungerous, some Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers, some courteous, some faithfull, some faithlesse, some honestly disposed, some maliciously minded, some sure fréends, some rancke rebels: There resorted to him as well the Droane, as the Bée: as well the Spider, as the Flie: as well the Kyte, as the Dooue: but <hi>Narbonus</hi> had learned his stop Galiarde, and could as satiably sooth, as soberly solace, for hée payd for his practise, and lent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, for small vsury: Among the rest of the fragrant flowers and sweet Uiolets that folowed <hi>Narbonus,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him alwaies: there was a Gentleman named <hi>Phemocles,</hi> of behauiour honest, and of grace grateful, for Parentage one of the best, and for wit sufficiently stored: with lyuinge well furnished and with good qualities very well indued: These two Youths grew into acquaintance and familiarity, and so into lykinge and loue: and from well lykinge to such amity, and confederacy of fidelity, as they missed not one daye where there was not some gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation or a litle feruency of fidelity demonstrated from

After this lawlesse life ledde by the space of certaine moneths, and that he waxed wéerie of this diet, he fell in loue with a manerly mayden, as he thoughte, but in déede such a one as was hired for euery mans siluer, and set to sale at a certaine price, and long it was ere he could get graunt of hir consent, or winne hir to his Wife, yet another man might haue borowed hir good cheape, or at the least of an easie price: she so flattered him to the will of his fancie, and so bragged alwayes of hir honestie, which he thought to be most true, and that he had found some singuler péece: and to make him beléeue the better of hir honestie, and to thinke that she could not be but good, she would hit him in the teeth with some one man of his profession, or some woman so honest as hir selfe, that had bin plagued for their wickednes, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for their sinnes.

their boasting in brauery: their sumptuousnes of appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and the lauishnes of their Purses: their pleasaunt sportes, and their excellent exercises: then their gallant Instrumentes, and their good musicke: the congregation of their Curtizans, &amp; the fellowship of their faire Dames: their Iewels, and their Ringes: their Ruffes, and their Robes: their Lawnes, and their loose attires: their nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in goinge, and their coynes in speaking: their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous behauiour, and their comely graces: their painted faces, and their inticinge toyes: then their protestations in their prayers, and their deuout humility: their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippinges of their Sainctes, and their guilded Crosses: their pratlinge Préestes, and their costly Copes: their Crucifixes, and their Wafer breade: their holly water stockes, and their Dirges for their deade.

that he should not be the first. This was the maner of his riding, and this the vsage of his trauelling: these the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of his thoughtes, these the sayings of his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: this the effect of the bestowing of his loue: this the thought of a faithfull fréend: this the certaintie of his vncertaintie, and this the liking of his seconde mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge.</p>
                  <p>As he was thus led in the lust of his desires, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the deapth of their remembrance, his fathers man desirous to heare him discourse of the order of his liuing, and the estate of the Countrey, beganne to boult forth these words, and spake as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Sir, the tediousnesse of your toyling iourney is so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, and your company so small, as with the one your witte is wéeried, and with the other your minde is moued, so as you can not frame your selfe to be merrie, nor dispose your passance to be pleasant.</p>
                  <p>Truly, replyed he, the toyle is tedious, and the iourney nothing ioyfull, with the memorie of the one I can not be refreshed, nor to forget the other any thing comforted: yet my heart is heauenly, and my mind inwardly moued with melodie, though my forces foulter outwardly, and my senses make no shew of iolitie.</p>
                  <p>Indéede, where the inwarde affections are framed so farre vnlike the outwarde cogitations: where the heart harboureth happinesse, yet the outward senses seduced to shamefastnesse, the soule sobbed with sorowes, and assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with sullennesse: it séemes very vnlikely the open ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péerances, or outward motions, to import any signe of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, or to make shew of any pleasant melodie: so secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hath nature hidden these things, and so closely conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in our thoughts: yet the outwarde sights souced in sadnesse, or the face making a shew of heauinesse, the interiour instigations may swimme in securitie, or the heart moued with delight, may flow in felicitie.</p>
                  <p>Trust me, said the other, for the secretnesse of nature, my iudgement is small, and my knowledge lesse: but this

I know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the heart moued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some sorow, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind can not be merie: but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> face may séeme frowardly to frowne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart is eleuated to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest tipe of fortunate felicitie.</p>
                  <p>Sir (said he) let him that is happie, not hide it, and he that is merily disposed not prolong his pleasure: for in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the one, he may happe neuer to find the like againe, and in not declaring the other, neuer come to such a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine whilest he liueth.</p>
                  <p>Why then saide <hi>Phemocles,</hi> for that it séemes good to tarrie no mo tides for triall, nor to make any moe dayes of parleance, let thy talke tende to trifling toyes, and my witte shall be as wanton to reply to foolish follies.</p>
                  <p>Then I beséech you to manifest vnto me, and lay flatly before me the maners of that Countrey, and the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Neapolitane Nation, where you haue lente some little parcell of liberalitie, and spent some trifling time, to find out their feate phrases, and to be acquaynted with their rules of Rhetorike: And to begin of their fine fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To shew you prestrictly the dayntines of their diet, and the finenesse of their féedinge: their appetites are wel applyed to their tender stomackes, and wel bestowed to the health of their bodyes. Their meate is not much, nor their fare great, but that little that the yeate, holpen with the company of fine hearbes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pleasaunt Oyles: with Lemmons and Pomgranats: Oringes and Oliues: as for their Wynes they wante none that wee haue, neyther haue wee any, but they haue so good. They eate but twice in a day, and banquet often after supper. Their drincking not so immoderate as oures, and their quaffing not so common. And in my minde, the order of their diet is excellent, &amp; such as I could very well like of.</p>
                  <p>Then replyed he, trust me sir, they are greatly to be commended, and deserue muche praise: for druncken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with vs is iested at, and gluttonie is no matter of conscience, the one infecteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body with diseases, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other

                  <p>The offices of their Magistrates, and duties of their Iustices, is executed in so good order, &amp; so seuerely punished as I sée no one thing woorthy faulte, or any other that can be amended. A man may put his money to the greatest gaine, so it be priuelie, and take what interest he can get so it be not knowen. Murther there is death, and Fellonies very seldome escape. Treason executed with terrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and offending the Magistrates prestrictly punished. The Laitie deale nothing with the Spiritualtie, nor at any time meddle with their matters: for the Spiritualtie are greatly honoured, and dutifully reuerenced.</p>
                  <p>Replied the other, these vices of whoredome are great, and this sinne of Usurie is not tollerable: but let vs search our owne consciences, and examine our thoughts, and we shal be found farre more culpable, and much more enclined to wicked desires. As for the Priests, they are the elect people of God, or the graund Captaines of their Maister the Diuell: they may lie by authoritie, and steale without checke, robbe without rigour of the law, &amp; commit Uenerie by the Statute.

                  <p>Trust me replyed the other, you haue diuined like a Doctour, and hitte the nayle full on the head, shotte as streight as a thréede, and leuelled as with a line: for when I was in surest safetie, and no danger to be dreaded: when feare might haue fledde, and no malice was meant me, yet my heart séemed heauie, and my senses were not frée from suspition: so that for a season, after my arriuall, my boulster, the procurer of my sléepe, and my bedde, my only resting place, so filled my eares with franticke fits, and beguiled so my thoughts with vaine imaginations, that my couche of sléepe, was my Cabin of care, and my meanes of rest, my author of disquietnesse.</p>
                  <p>Truly said the other, my mind doth meditate no lesse,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1777:70"/>
and my senses would be seduced into those opinions: the absence is not so gréeuous, nor the tract of time so intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, as the fraile feare conceyued from the sincke of suspition, and the troubled thoughts, which come of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie cogitations: which if a man once haue gained some good companyons, or honest disposed persons to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him, yet a man loueth, but freesed in feare, and liketh but to please their fancies: these are the doubts a man conceyueth: these are the maner of his diuinations: thus is he fearefull to offend: thus is he carefull to contente: thus is he alwayes redoubling his danger, and so is he neuer frée from suspition.</p>

                  <p>But he missed his marke, and was deceyued of his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for the man was away, and that place not as he y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined.</p>

The Théefe hath his deserued hire, and the Traytour for his treacherie punished with payne &amp; would God I were the one, or could not escape the other.

                     <hi>Narbonus</hi> who perceiued the cause of this sodaine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare, and knew the euente of all this matter, fell to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading them, and shewing them the occasion of this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine noyse, some beleeued him, and others denyed it: then takinge the Candle, and shewinge them the place where hée fell, and the Bullettes not yet taken vp, they beleeued that which was so manifest, and doubted not of the matter when they sawe the truth before their faces: When all was pacified, and euery thinge quiet, they fell in a great laughter to see their owne folly, and iested out the matter merily: for <hi>Narbonus</hi> was in all the faulte, and hee had taken the greatest hurte: afterwardes they slept soundly till it was day light, and were not troubled with any moe such false alaromes: so soone as it was day, and that the sunne began to shine, they marched towards the Campe, and came home in good time, but their gaines were small, sauing they had filled their hungry paunches: Not long after, <hi>Narbonus</hi> wente foorth agayne, beeinge requested by some his freendes, who was better conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to goe abroade, then to stay steruinge in the Campe: where they trauailed all the day, but found iust nothinge: When it drewe towardes night, they approched to a Castell not farre from them, which they thought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious place for them to lodge in, and good for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: This Castell was Moated, and in the Dikes they found very good Fish: and findinge Nettes in the house, they drew great plentie out of the Moate: beeing busied about the dressing of this fish, and wearied with their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile beefore: it grew late in the eueninge, and by their imagination about tenne of the clocke: It happened the night beefore, there lodged other in the same place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the number of fortye, and all of their owne Campe, who repaired thither, thinkinge to lodge as beefore: they had lefte a Gate open, and this company came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court: where perceyuinge great lightes within the house, knew not what to imagine: one perceiued them that was within the house, and shot a peece ouer

them, at the discharging whereof, all this company lay close: Comming into the Court, they shutte the gate after them, and left one of their company without, who romed vp and downe he knew not whither: they within the house concluded to put out all the lightes, and to goe out closely at a backe gate.</p>
                  <p>There left they their Fish hanging ouer the fire, and wente closelie out at a posterne gate, where hard by the house they layde them selues close in ambush, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to sette vpon them at aduantage when they came foorth.</p>
                  <p>Lying thus closely that they could not be perceyued, the fellow running vp and downe, came iust amongst them where they lay: which perceyued by one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, ranne towards him, saying, <hi>Rendera vou viliaco.</hi> The fellow amazed, and thinking of no suche matter, yéelded himselfe, thinking he should die no other death: whome after they had long examined, founde him to bée one of their owne Camp, who told them the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and how those within were of their owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: then went they all in, and feasted themselues with the Fish that hung ouer the fire.</p>
                  <p>The day following, they marched all towardes the Camp, where they founde small-chéere, and woorse lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Not long after, <hi>Narbonus</hi> gote a pasport of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for himselfe, and other companie: the firste day they lost their labour, but for a little rotten fruite that hung vpon the trées, the next day they came into a Uil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, where they founde two Calues, which they made readie, and thought to make good chéere withall, but their meate was not halfe rosted, nor their feast begun, when one of their companie espyed by chance a greate number at the Townes ende, which he thought were the Enimies, hée therefore ranne in, and tolde it to his companie, some tooke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1777:94"/>
followed, but they were but a little out of the Towne, when they saw the other hard at their héeles.</p>
                  <p>Héere beganne a prettie Skirmishe, and the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed enimies were halfe so many agayne as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: they therefore pursued botelye, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mainteyned still their Shotte, marching on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace: thus they followed by the space of two miles, till in the ende they recouered a Woodde, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of the others, they retired backe, and this good companye hadde no hurte, but one man shotte into the legge, whiche was without danger: there they ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted their meate againe, and there ended their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</p>
                  <p>The nexte daye repairinge towardes the Campe, they passed through a Woodde, and as they wente a long, they perceyued some companye: then one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a Péece, to knowe whether they were the Enimies, or not: then repairinge the one companye néere the other, there beganne a hote Skirmishe, and continued a certayne space: they hadde the trées to defende them, and so foughte a long space, withoute any slaine: in the ende, there was a Prisoner taken, and they likewise had taken one, whiche examined, they were founde to bee fréendes, then they lefte off with hurte on eyther side, and laughed well at the matter.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards they departed to the Camp, and <hi>Narbonus</hi> neuer after went abroade, for he grew shortly so sicke, as he doubted greatly his recouerie: which his Captaine séeing, and suspecting that hée could not liue, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to let him goe home, if hée would, for that there went a great number besides himselfe very sicke, and maruellous weake: he made no refusall, but departed straight towardes the Sea: when hée came there, the Shippe was alreadie prouided for the sicke Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oures, and hée was appoynted one amongst them: and séeing the companie, some sicke of the Plague, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1777:94"/>
the sores running on them, thought with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that those smelles woulde kill him, and if hée went with them, hée coulde not liue till hee came to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi>: therefore determined rather to die there, than to ende hys lyfe amongst suche loathsome creatures: and then hee remembred, that to dye amongst them, and to bee cast ouer boorde, his Unckle shoulde neuer héere of his deathe, nor anye of his fréendes knowe where hée was become, and dying in that place, and laying there his bones, it mighte bee knowen to his Unckle, and notifyed to the rest of hys friendes: but better happe came to him than hee looked for, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune nowe beganne to bee fauourable, that long had ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.</p>
                  <p>After the departure of these Sicke Creatures, there came to the house where <hi>Narbonus</hi> lay, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunte, who was readye to take Shippe fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and stayde but euen for the nexte Tyde.</p>
                  <p>Talking of some matters, <hi>Narbonus</hi> vnderstoode that hee was of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and also knewe his Unckle, and therefore offered willingly if hee woulde, to goe in hys Shippe, to whiche greate courtesie <hi>Narbonus</hi> made no denyall, but séemed the best contented man liuing.

Then he maruelled that <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocles</hi> neyther sente letter to him, nor certified him by any messenger, doubting him to be but fickle, and fréend in felicitie, vnstedfast, and vnstayed, fléeting from him in this vnfortunate time, and giuing him ouer, when hée most néeded his help, doubting their former procéedings, and mutuall amitie, to be drowned in the floud of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and put into euerlasting obliuion, he being in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, and the other in calamitie, mistrusting those faithfull vowes, and entire embracings, woulde be left without liking, and conueyed into curiousnesse: Then blamed he himselfe for iudging so hardly of his fréend, and condemning him without any proofe that had not yet falsifyed his fidelitie, nor violated his honestie: Then remembred hée the imbracings at their méetings, that should enterchangeably passe from one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the pretie phrases that shoulde bée vsed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them, would burne their boyling breastes, and enflame their frying fancies, to possesse that place of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, possessed before by them: musing whether <hi>Phemocles</hi> woulde most reioyce, or he bée most glad: for that the one was forced by his father, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned not with his owne consente: then he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how they shoulde dyet their affections, and vse their amitie, so as they might neuer be wéerie of their loue, but make it séeme fresh, as at the first.</p>
                  <p>Amongst other his cauilling cogitations, and fonde fancies that thus assayled him, <hi>Fidelia</hi> was neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,

nor out of the number: But if the truth were knowen, her name called first in question, happilie whither absence had procured dislikinge, and choyce had beene made of such as were no flinchers, but would sticke to their tacklinges, and fade like euery frost, but bide all bruntes, and haue a shade for euery showre, and a salue for euery sore: then feared hee her secrecie, and doubted shée was so close as a Siue, that it was knowen to her Father, and so mighte hinder their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: the inconuenience that might bee gotten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and the preiudicialitie it might procure: for as it was hote with one hande, so might it bée cooled with one Carde: then he mused on the mariage day, and the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing therof, the courtous crue that should bee inuited, and their passaunces in pleasure, with the celebration of their fortunate fidelitie, lincked in the bandes of amitie, determined the time, and the place: drowned almost in these cogitations, and wallowing in the fits of his fancy, new supplyes alwayes assayled him, and contrary came in their places, like the water bubble in a raynie day, or when the weather is setled to raine, one dieth and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riseth in that place: or like the Moone in a winters night, when the weather is warme, when the Clowdes rocke a pace, and passe fast ouer her: now is she hidden, and then sheweth her selfe againe: Or like as when an armie marcheth by, or passeth a longe: some goe alwaies bie, and others possesse their places: or like to the running of a softe Riuer, or the passinge of a narrow floud that runneth swifte: or like the wallowing waters, tumbling and roulinge, one straight after the other, neuer stayinge till they beate on the Beache, or hit against the harde Rockes: Or like a great flocke of shéepe runninge through a narrow Lane, or passinge foorth of some gate, so fast as some runne bie, others are in their places: so fared his fancies, and so wauered they: so ranne they forward, and so neuer stayed they longe vpon one poynte: but by how much the more his sences were eleuated with these

contrary cogitations, by so much the more was the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of that toyling trauaile shortned: swimming thus as well in the waues of his will, as in the waters of his wishes: in the floudes of his conceyued felicitie, as in the Sea of securitie, and in the affections of his fancies, as in his shakinge Ship: hee espied at length the shoare of his safegarde, and the Hauen of his happinesse: the Porte of his pride, and the arriuinge place of his reste: Now hée behelde <hi>Vienna</hi> at the full, and discerned the sight of the whole Towne: then lookinge on his vile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, and his torne ragges: the vncleanesse of his cloathes, and the filthines of his face: the chaunge of his countenaunce, and the complexion conceiued of his yll dyet: knew not whether to goe presently into the towne or stay till the shadowie night approched: or if he should so goe to his Unckles house, to put a Uisour before his face: if hée should not finde his Unckle at home, to make him knowen to the seruauntes or not: if hee should make him selfe knowen, his Unckle not there, they would bée sorowfull, not knowing how to helpe him: and if not tell who hee were, they would not receiue him béeinge so ragged a coult, &amp; so like a roge: duringe the counterbuffe of these crosse cogitations, and abidinge the méetinge of these flowing fancies, the Ship thrust to the shoare, and came to the landinge place: by this time the Sunne had seduced him selfe to the inferiour partes of the earth, and cleane out of their sight an houre beefore. <hi>Narbonus</hi> then treadinge his steppes on more firme ground, than not longe béefore hee could, came directly to his Unckles house, where entering in, found the Tables couered, &amp; his Unckle ready to sit down, to whom he did his duetiful obedience, and vsed such courtesie as hee best thought.</p>

                     <hi>Henricus</hi> stared earnestly on him, and looked longe béefore hee knew him: but perceiuinge it to bee his Nephew, and not any other man, imbraced him so hard, as if hee should neuer haue séene him agayne, saying:</p>

The sory shéepe depriued of her flouncinge fleece, is subiect to the scorchinge of the Sunne, and the bitinge of flyes, seeking the shades, and couetinge the couertes, till the waighty wooll haue couered her bare backe, and her fleece growen in such order as before.

                  <p>Small penaltie Sir replyed she, but such as it is hath bin long sithence pronounced, and it is neyther better nor worse, but that from henceforth you neuer offer to moue one motion of such matter, nor follow the pursuite of this your frustrate purpose any farther: you know <hi>Narbonus,</hi> the Eyas Hauke is soone reclaymed, but if she be not fedde, she will quickly away: the Colte béeing well handled, will be made to the Saddle, but vse him not well, and he will haue the tricke of a iade: the bricke must be firste made before the house bee built: and the Taylour must haue his cloath, before he fashion the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente: the Shomaker must haue his leather, before hée can fashion his lachet: and the Apothecarie his confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before hee make his drugges: you recken without your hostes, therefore you are like to pay déere for your pennyworth: you fishe before the nette, and you haue found a Frogge: you shotte your shaft before you set your marke, therefore you were best to leuell againe: Doth not the Sunne make the grasse grow? and doth it not also drie vp the water? the rayne breaketh the sprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eares of Corne, yet maketh the Béeche freshe and

Where he had not lyen long in this troublesome traunce, nor spent (as he thought) aboue two houres in sléeping, but he dreamed, and saw that sight, the straungenesse wherof made him to muse a lyttle, and the rarenes of the matter, made him hope well for a tyme.

                  <p>Not long after, his Father was moued to frame a ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Cullen,</hi> and <hi>Phemocles</hi> must make vp the messe: not onely to sée the Countrey, but also to renew acquaintaunce with some of his fréendes, which he had not séene long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: where he purposed to spend the Summer, and to make his returne towardes Winter: But before he went, he made a feast to his fréendes, and inuited his neyghbours to a bancquet, which he spéedily performed, and the day follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing he tooke his iorney: There were certayne of his fréendes accompanied him in this iorney, and other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes, who had businesse to <hi>Cullen.

He was before but touched, but nowe infected: before his loue lay smothering lyke wet strawe, but nowe it burned so bright as a bauen: who still imagined, that time would feare away these fancies, and the distaunce of his iourney put her out of his minde, but he blew the coales, and kindled the fire him selfe: and thinking by lyttle, and so more to put out that blaze, he encreased the flame, that it burnt out: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes when they came to their Innes, and alighted at their resting places, he went to his solitary Chamber, and vsed no other place of solace, musing on his malicious Fortune, and blaming his aduerse happe: that first he was depriued of his faithfull fréend, and nowe had séene her for whome he was thus sorrowfull: alwaies imagining, that had he but spoken, he had bene sufficiently satisfied: and had he but moued the matter, his desire had bene the lesse: He neuer could rest, these thoughts so troubled him, nor neuer stayed any where, but so he was assayled.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1777:114"/>
and yet doubted dispaire: Spending thus the time of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, and wearing out the tract of his absence: he alwayes vnder some coulored pretence repaired to his Chamber, and vnder the cloake of his collusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he remained thus in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation: yet not knowen to any, nor apparant to one: for all that he was watched by some, and marked by others: for he was busied with some Booke, though his minde were not there: and wryting some tryfle, though his heart was farre of: and though he helde a Booke in one hand, yet with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would wyllingly haue helde a Candle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shryne of his Mistresse: and if his lyps mumbled these wordes, and then stayed at that letter, yet his imagination was how to compasse his desired wish, and his thought how to obtayne his will: and if his tongue bewrayed him to be at Euensong, yet in minde he was scarce at Morrowmasse: worne with musing, and pined with the prolonging of his penaunce, his trauayle séemed so tedious, and the time so troublesome, as he hasted more then was néedefull, vnlesse he had come a lyttle sooner.

                     <hi>NArbonus</hi> had continued a season at the Emperours Court, and worne away the best parte of a yéere, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profite to him selfe, or possibilitie to gette any for his fréendes. He sawe the brauerie of that noble Court, and viewed at full, the lyues of the Courtiers: and I trust, had his Purse bene answerable to his noble minde, none should excéeded him in braue apparell, nor any gone beyonde him, in setting foorth of his beautie:</p>
                  <p>He that was of late so carefull a Souldiour, is nowe growen a statelie Courtier: and he that not long since, pyned in perplexitie, begynneth nowe to excéede in braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and that body that of late bare so poore a pore, hath nowe forsaken his seruilitie, and is wedded to awayte on fréendlie felycitie: Of late drowned in dispayre, nowe standing alofte in disdayne: not long sithence, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to all corasiues and cares, nowe marcheth in the féelde of Fortune, holding out his Flagge of defiaunce, against all daungerous demeanes: who of late was at Deathes doore, and ready to goe to the Graue, is nowe in prowde Paradize, walking amongst the swéete shades of securitie.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Narbonus,</hi> hast thou so soone forgotten thy myserie, and already put in obliuion thy perplexitie, that thou begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to wallowe in the myre of thy minde, and to tumble in the dyrt of thy desires? Hast thou so soone forgotten
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1777:118"/>
thy pyninges and sharpe showers, that thou flatterest thy selfe, this thy pride wyll neuer be troden downe: hath the procuring of thy felicitie, béene the occasion of the léesing thy honestie? <hi>Esopes</hi> Snake, that was layde by the fyre, stung the man for his paynes: and after this lyfe, thou goest the way to infect thy Uncle against thy folly: The Trée that bloweth fayre at the first, may so be blasted, that it neuer beare Apple, and thou that findest so swéete a shewe in thy Uncles house, wylt léese thy credite in thy Maisters seruice: Hast thou touched Pitche, that thou must néedes be defyled: or eaten poyson, that thou art so infected? thou suckest hurt, where thou shouldest gather hony. And because there are Frogges in the water, canst thou therfore finde no fish? the Cherrie is ripe, before it be rotten: but thou art brused before thou art ready to gather. Remember <hi>Narbonus,</hi> that when the Trée is at the best, it will growe to nothing againe, and when thy brauerie is at the best, thou shalt sinke for shame: The Infant learneth to créepe, and then afterwarde to goe: but thou goest so fast in the beginning, as shortly thou wylt neither stande nor styrre. But happely thou wylt reply: the Court bounseth in brauerie, and why should not I be painted with Pride? Because there are some Ruffians, thou must be a Royster: and because some are wicked, thou must be mischéeuous: because they swymme in sinne, thou wylt be drowned in thy desires: And because <hi>Cayne</hi> slue <hi>Abell,</hi> thou wylt be <hi>Saule</hi> and kyll <hi>Dauid</hi>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Tarquin</hi> was proude, thou wylt be Prodigall: and because <hi>Iudas</hi> was a Traytor, thou wylt be rebellious. No, better for thée to leaue the Court, and followe the Cart, then to forsake thy substance, &amp; forgoe thy fréends. Dooth not the Ryuer <hi>Nile,</hi> yéeld Golde in the bottome, and bring foorth Crocodiles in the bancke? Dooth not the best ground aswell yéelde Thistles to pricke, as giue Corne to sustayne? Hath not the Holme trée pricking leaues, as berries for Byrdes?

Because the Court is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to pleasure, must thou therfore be vnthryftie? thou knowest the Emperour is good, can his Lawes then be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll? But thou wylt say, his Lawes are good, but the Iudges are not righteous: the house is well gouerned, yet there are euyll Officers. Hath not the cleanest house, some Spyders? and the fayrest Well, some Frogges? the goodliest blowen Trée, some blastes: and the best Corne, some Poppey: the finest Flower, some faulte, and the fayrest Garden, some Nettles? And in what place will the Serpent lurk, but in the gréene grasse? and where will the Snake make her nest, but in the rytchest dunge?</p>

The next way for a man to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is to follow that thing, which is vsed amongst the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test number: but hee that is ledde with euerie facion, and won with euerie winde, shall neuer be loued with the most, nor lyked of the least: Wordes prouooke a man to anger, but they drawe no blood: and who so cannot beare a worde, must not lyue in a common wealth: The little Playsse, liueth by the Whale, and the Lambe by the Lyon, the Ape by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant, and the Kydde by the Tiger: euerie man may lyue by his Superiours, behauing him selfe as an Inferiour: as the olde saying is: The Catte liueth by the King, &amp; a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wyll is nothing woorth, without the consent of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: Hath not the woorme as well her hole, as the Foxe his burrowe? the Moule her hyll, so well as the Lyon her den? and the Hen her roust, so well as the Phesant her perch? and the Birde her nest, so wel as the Hauke her Mue? But who loueth not to clime higher, and who more often falleth? The Court is curious, and I careles: one catcheth a fléece, and another findeth a farewell: one gapeth after gayne, and another péereth after pleasure: one after pride, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after paltrie: one after rytches, and another after ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otousnes: As for my selfe, I haue béene infected, but wil not be defyled, tasted with the touch, but not tried to the lacke: searched to the vttermost, but not founde giltie at al: though I ran like a coult, yet now so ientle as a lambe, and though so wylde as a Bucke, yet now so tame as a Dogge: and though so hungrie as a Tyger, yet now gorged so full as a Hauke: and though praying vpon euery carion, yet now so choyce as may: bee though won to euery lust, yet now wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to none in lyking: and though pind to euery sléeue, yet now not paynted to the picture of any.

Thou hast spent a yeare in seruice, and hast gained thée so much the more knowledge: to tarryed with thy Unckle, thy wit would béene weryed, where now thy behauiour is answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable any, or inferiour to none: Hadst thou not come to the Court, thou hadst wanted this wisdome, and in séeing these sleights that are vsed, thou wylt bee more wary at thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home. Thy profit (indéede) might haue bene more, and thy pleasure lesse painfull: but héere thou hast conceiued more vnderstandinge, and learned to holde fast when thou hast it: And though thy yeares are younge, yet thy experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is proued: thy head vnstayed, yet thy knowledge suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: thy nurture good, and thy grauitie better: In spending thy time longer thou shalt profit litle, and thinking to win much, mayst héere léese all: He that studieth any language, when hée hath learned it, forgetteth it not agayne. Thou hast learned the lyfe of a Courtier, and what wouldest thou more? The Coult once broken, is put into the Stable: and thy affections brydled, thou must kéepe them vnder. The Booke read ouer is layd vp agayne in the studie: Thou hast bought thy learning, and now maist vse it as thou lust.

I replie, that experience, maketh perfectnesse: but he that is a foole at thy yéeres, will neuer be wyse, whylst he lyueth: Doost thou not see the young Trée hath more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of lycquor, then the olde Stocke of iuyce? and is not the gréene grasse swéeter, then the olde hey? and the young Calfe more tender, then the olde Oxe is toathsome? Dooth not strength decrease, as Nature decayeth? and as Nature wareth féeble? dooth not the Witte growe faint? Euery Trée hath his tyme, and euerie séede his season: euerie grafte their growing, and euerie grayne the sowing: euerie Childe the nourishing, and euerie wytte the tyme of perfection: The Golde is earth in the Myne, before it be purified, and the Siluer maketh no shewe, before it be tryed from the sande: The Orrenge not beautifull, before it be ripe: and the knowledge of a man, nothing before it come to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Is not the Ceder trée, more goodly to beholde, then the Uine that runneth along vpon the grounde? and is not the Popler, more liuelie to looke on then the Figge?

If then in thinges that make no outwarde shewe, there be hydden such inwarde vertue: howe much more is that commendable in him, who beareth a fayre face, and is endued with honest condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

For to sowe the séede of thy youth in the Court, thou art like in age to reape but payne and trauayle. And for that I know thou wilt not alwayes be a Courtier, nor euermore a Seruitor: for wouldest thou that way leade thy life, I could say somewhat woorthy thy lyking: Or haddest thou sette downe to spende thy dayes in seruice, I coulde better hereafter satisfie thée, then now make thée aunswer. I know when thou commest to <hi>Vienna,</hi> thou wilt follow the Merchaunts, the better lyked shalt thou be of others, and the more loued of mee: If thou be ritch in thy young yéeres, thy age is like to be replenished with substaunce: and if well disposed in thy infancie, a signe of honesty in thy gray heaires: if thy <hi>Inuentus,</hi> shew some wisdome, thy <hi>Senectus</hi> likelie to be honourable. If the trade of a Merchaunt like thée not, thy busie Bookes will delight thée: tosse them well about, and they will comfort thée in thy heauinesse: tumble them vp and downe, and they shall make thée wiser, and shyne more bright in vertue. Thou wast sometimes a Scholler, the more fyt to be nowe a Studient: thou once begannest the Lawe, the more lykelie nowe to proue a Counsellor: thou wast sometimes earnest at thy studie, why shouldest thou not in time proue a Doctour. Leaue not off at the best, &amp; draw not thy head out of the coller: Now thou hast entred the lystes of learning, let not goe thy holde. Thou marueylest that I tell thée this, yet I knowe it, and not by any but thy fréendes, neyther woulde I vtter it to any thy foes: And in that I tell thée

so playnely, it is a signe that I hate thée not: Therefore in my minde to perseuer in thy learning shall bee most for thy profyt, and greatest for thy gaine. Thou knowest hee that beginneth a good woorke, and goeth not forwarde withall, séeketh his owne disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, &amp; the preferment of no other. The Dogge is made ientle with féedinge, and the Ape kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishe being taught: If then these sencelesse things wyl bee made ientle with teaching, and profitable with compulsion, how much more we learne for our owne vtilytie, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge for our owne commodytie? Knowledge is the heauenlyest thing in this worlde, and hee that hath wisdome cannot want any good thinge. Whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall dooth longer endure, whose fame further reach, and whose glory blowne foorth abroade, then the vertues of the wisest, and then their doings put downe in wryting? Dyd not the wisdome of <hi>Salomon</hi> make a greater shewe, then his riches or braue buildings? Did not the workes of <hi>Virgill</hi> longer endure, then the Conquests of <hi>Caesar</hi> last. Great Princes are thought happy, in that they are victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and riche, but vertue shineth when the ritches with the man are buried. The Conquest of <hi>Alexander</hi> were al lost within a litle time after his death: but the workes of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> are fresh and flourish at this day. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Dogge for barking at the vices that they vsed: But are not his workes now more famous, then his déeds were disdayned: <hi>Stilpo</hi> saide, he lost nothing, when all his goods were burnt, for that he retayned his vertue and learnyng. The grounde of other matters may in time be attayned, but the depth of wysdome can neuer be reached. All handy labours are wrought by the industrye of man: But the roote of wysdome could neuer by any bee vndermined. Is not learning the flowre of felicitie, and happy is hée that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth it: For in what doe we excéede the brute beastes, but by those heauenly motions which wee attaine by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge?</p>

How doe the degrées of Princes first rise, and howe doe they encrease their dignities, eleuate their houses to the Skies, and theyr fame ouer the world? Is not wisdom the fyrst ground, and then pollicy ensueth? And how shall a man bee wise, if vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned? Can Nature of it selfe, yéelde a man that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or geue a man wisdome, without learning? Can the vngrafted trée, bringe foorth good fruite? And dooth not the fattest ground, bring foorth Thistles? The better Horse, the more wilde of Nature, and the better wit, the more geuen to vice: for of our selues we are the least, &amp; not so bad as ill disposed. The Elephant, greatest of al fower footed beastes, and who more ferce, or who more stronge? but once reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, so ientle as a Lamb, and so necessary as a Horse: Wyl not the Crab stock be made to bring foorth pleasaunt frute? and the stonie ground be made fertill: The ouerflowinge Riuers be turned to run quietly: and the haggard Haukes manned as they will stoupe at euery lure: The great Oxe wyll be made to take the yoke: but the litle Mouse wyll neuer be made ientle: And the Beare sooner follow a man, then the Fox.

                  <p>Before he had fully accomplished the ende of his tale, or furnished the perfection of his talke, cited he was by one of his Gentlemen, to repaire to dinner, which taried for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable leysure: who so soone as his tale was ended, &amp; those wordes spoken, went his way, and stayed not to heare his reply: Leauing <hi>Narbonus</hi> hoouering betwéene heauen and earth, as if he could not attayned the one, nor touched the other: standing like one newlie raysed out of the graue, or latelie reuiued out of a swound, wauering which way to take, and wandring which pathe to treade: Who had séene the sayles of a Shippe, wauering with a soft winde, leaning first to one side, &amp; then bending to the other: Or like a shéepe sick of some disease, leaneth first to one side, &amp; then falleth on the other: Or like the méeting of two viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t waters, the one parteth one way, &amp; the other retyreth back againe. So stoode <hi>Narbonus,</hi> first thinking to take this way, and then thought that other better: If to leaue his Chamber, his Lord might come, &amp; he not there to make aunswer, then to tary &amp; make a reply not looked for, were but a saucie part: Then thinking that to stay there, he might looke long and neuer the better: and if his Lord would haue heard his reply, he would haue leant him the hearing. Going therfore downe to dinner, he met, with some of his fellowes &amp; fréendes, who were more glad of his company, then he willing to stay any longer: the dinner time they passed more honestly, then merely: and yet so well disposed, as the one was not hated, nor the other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyked: where <hi>Narbonus</hi> vttred at large, the cause of his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; the effect of his departure. Whereat, they sorrowfull, beyond measure, but he glad in minde, yet would not vtter it: they fell to intreating him, to make a longer time of his abode, and he as fast perswaded them, not to request a thing so much against his profit: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they requested him to spend

but one yéere more amongst that honest company. Then he aunswered, that the losse of a yéeres study, was more then the gayne of two yéeres seruice: and to hinder himselfe of the one, he would not abide the brunt of the other. Then they replyed: that (as yet) there was time inough, &amp; so small space would hinder but a lyttle, but his staying might benefit him much: Then he aunswered, that to driue dayes, and make delayes, a man should be farther of in the ende, then he was néere in the beginning. To auoyde which inconuenience, I wil not linger in hope of the one, nor stay, being sure to misse the other. Then an honest Gentleman, and one that loued him déerelie, vsed these wordes to him.</p>
                  <p>Syr, the Merchaunt maketh his Mart, but how? not in a day, nor in a wéeke: not in a moneth, nor happely in a yéere: he looketh long for his Ship, and stayeth the returne: which once come safe, and arriued sound, the gayne dooth counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle the payne, and the long time of absence make amends with the profite that ensueth.</p>
                  <p>Indéede syr (replied he) the Merchaunt stayeth the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge, and abydeth the fraughting: but my Shippe, will neyther beare sayle, nor brooke the Seas: therfore, better it is to returne with a lyttle losse, then stay the repenting, and léese bothe Ship and burden.</p>
                  <p>Then replyed the other, syr <hi>Narbonus,</hi> seruices are not so swéete, nor Maisters so lauish of their Purse? but they will make a man bake his flower, before he eate any breade, and sowe his séede before he reape any fruite.</p>

                  <p>Indéede (sayde the other) the ground must be good, and the plotte profitable: but howe shall a man be acquaynted with the one, or haue experience of the other? He must stay

                  <p>Indéede, replyed the other, the profyt is but small, and the gaine as lytle: but the companye may cause you stay, for that they lyke you, and our fellowship fynde you fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in that wee loue you, for if wee liked you not, wee woulde not lust after you: and, but that you are in our hartes, wee coulde easely put you out of our mindes.

                  <p>Indéede, aunswered <hi>Narbonus,</hi> your company shal cause me do much, and your curtesy so great as I know not how to requite it: For, looke by howe mutch the more you loue mée, by so mutch the more am I bounde to you: and by howe mutch the more I doo dutifullye loue you, by so mutch the more ought you not of dutie to hate mée: and in that you loue mée so well, I am the more bould to vtter my mynde so playnelye vnto you: Yet as you loue me, so must you not lust after by losse: and as you lyke mee, so must you not wish mée liue, but for my welfare: being not preiudiciall to your healthes and prosperitie, but very gratefull to my wealth and safetie.</p>

                  <p>And hath my hap béene so harde, to contend this daye in argument, and to make such seuerall replyes agaynst my deare <hi>Narbonus,</hi> my best beloued fréend, and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whom my harte hath so longe desired?
