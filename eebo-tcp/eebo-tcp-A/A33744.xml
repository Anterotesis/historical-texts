            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A New Method of <hi>ROBERT COLEPEPYR,</hi> Gent. For ſpeedy and effectual Preſervation of the Navigation on the River <hi>THAMES;</hi> and to Repair the WATER-BREACH in to <hi>Havering</hi> and <hi>Dagenham</hi> Levels, in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">This Proponent having many Years ſpent Thoughts on the Tendancies of Tides, Ebbs, and Sands, for the Benefit of Navigation: Humbly propoſes (To the Right Honourable the <hi>BRITISH HOUSE of COMMONS</hi> in Parliament Aſſembled, that ſome New Cutts be made in the <hi>Thames</hi> Bank, as the cheapeſt and ſpeedyeſt Way to perform the Works aforeſaid, which if approved of as the beſt Method, he hopes to be enabled by Your Authority, to proceed on the ſame, notwithſtanding any Statute to the contrary.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Damages to the ſaid Navigation, Your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent apprehends are theſe following,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Water received by the Inundation or Baſon, is thereby cut off from the upper Part of the ſame River; this makes ſome abatement in Water-depth there, but it muſt be inconſiderable; ſince taken from ſo many Miles of Length, and the Breadth of Water that flows above the Baſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Sand from the Baſon damnifies Navigation, by ſubſiding in the <hi>Thames,</hi> near the Breach.</p>
            <p>And it is true, the <hi>Thames</hi> firſt entered this Baſon by Failure of a Sluice, and in time, enlarged that Paſſage to 100 Yards broad; and alſo to the <hi>Thames</hi> depth, <hi>(viz.</hi> where the Baſon's Water falls into that River.) But as it was impoſſible the Tides could ever make high Water in the Baſon, before it was ſo in the <hi>Thames,</hi> they could not do it till long after that Time; before the Breach was much widened, becauſe the Baſon was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame to receive Tides; but ſoon after the Innundation, the Breach gave far leſs Paſſage into the Baſon than afterwards the Water made; therefore we may conclude, that ſoon after the Inundation, the Water remained flowing into the Baſon, a good part of the time the <hi>Thames</hi> was Ebbing; before thoſe Waters could come to a Par, and that the <hi>Thames</hi> muſt be the lower, before any Water could ebb out of the Baſon.</p>
            <p>From the Reaſons above, a great quantity of Water muſt remain in the Baſon, after the next Tide began to flow in the <hi>Thames:</hi> Yet this quantity did abate as the Breach grew wider, however may not all be abated; therefore the Time that remaining Water ebbs out of the Baſon, and meets the firſt part of the next Tide; thoſe Waters ſtop, and ſwell up one againſt the other, and drop Sullage, till the Tide prevails, and gives them a new Motion. For whatever doth cauſe Loſs of Motion in Water, gives it a Tendency to drop Sullage; and the Sand of this Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage will ſubſide where it drops, and will encreaſe till want of Room for Tides and Ebbs, will ſuffer it to riſe no higher. For Storms there can diſperſe little, if any Sand, though very uſeful at the Mouths of our Rivers, where Winds have more Power. Yet to provide againſt this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52933:2"/>
Second, and much greater Damage to the <hi>Thames</hi> Navigation; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent prays leave to obſerve as follows, to wit, that</p>
            <p>Four Miles of Bank were maintained, to keep the <hi>Thames</hi> from drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Levell, therefore while not Imbanked, the flowing Water had four Miles to enter this Levell; whereon it roſe in heighth ſlowly, as the <hi>Thames</hi> Water did, and ſo abated at Ebb; therefore it muſt then be high Water at the ſame time in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and on that then un-imbank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Land; and all Water would go off from the latter, long before Low-Ebb: Therefore no Sand could then drop through long Conteſts between Tides and Ebbs, when no Conteſt was. When at Ebb, the Water was a Foot deep on the un-imbanked Marſh, that ſmall quantity of Water was as long in Ebbing off through its four Miles Paſſage, as the <hi>Thames</hi> was in abating a Foot in heighth; therefore the little Speed the Water made to drown and drain the Land laſt mentioned, bore a very ſmall Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the Running of Tides and Ebbs in the <hi>Thames;</hi> but if a Bank had been made gradually on that four Miles Paſſage, it would as gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have given more Motion to the Water that flowed on, and ebbed off from that Land, to bring them to the ſame Swiftneſs of running they had in the <hi>Thames;</hi> and ſince Low-VVater at the ſame time in the Deep VVater-frett of the Baſon and <hi>Thames,</hi> is neceſſary to prevent Subſidence of Sand in the latter; therefore your Proponent would now make four new Cutts in the <hi>Thames</hi> Bank for that benefit, and each of them as wide as the Breach, though only cut down as low as Marſh Surface.</p>
            <p>If the ſame Cutts, and the Breach, give as much room in proportion to the Baſon's Water, as the <hi>Thames</hi> Channel gives to the Water that flows above the Baſon, then we muſt have high and low. Water in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and deep Water frett of the Baſon at the ſame times; and little, if any part of an Ebb will be leſt in the Baſon to meet the next Tide. So this Cutting of Banks is an effectual Way to obviate ſuch ſubſiding of Sand in the <hi>Thames,</hi> for it takes away the Cauſe thereof. The Proponent would not cutt ſo much Bank if leſs will ſerve. However, theſe or wider Cutts he hopes appear able to anſwer his End aforeſaid, in few Days, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Navigation, and alſo abate Rapture in the main Water-frett, that Materials for Reparation may be kept there, and Benefits obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by cutting of Banks, are without Riſque of Failure, ſince Water builds no Banks.</p>
            <p>The Proponent would raiſe Stops of ſmall Wood in the new Cutts a Foot high; and when Tides riſe to the Marſh Surface, the Water will run in through theſe Stops, and when riſen a Foot higher, it will flow freely in over the ſame Stops, till high Water, and much help the Breach to fill the Baſon He can alſo make a ſtrong Wood Pile, and place the ſame about 40 Rods within the Mouth of the Breach, to ſtand in all the deep Water there; and the ſhallower Water, between the Wood Pile and Shoars, he can fill with ſinking Faggots, to be made as long as the Wood Pile ſhall be broad.</p>
            <p>Over the ſaid Wood Pile and Faggots, the Water ſhall flow ſeveral Foot more or leſs, every Tide. And when it is Ebbed down to the Head of the Wood Pile, the Water to the <hi>Thames,</hi> ward will have nothing in it's Way, ſo will run as faſt as the <hi>Thames</hi> Ebbs; but the Water to Landwards of the Wood Pile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will have the ſame to get through, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Water hath a Thouſand Millions of ſmall Paſſages out, through, and by the Wood Pile, and other Stops, yet thoſe Stops will make Sullage ſubſide within them every Tide; for all Sullage that ſinks
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52933:2"/>
below the Heads of the Stops, muſt go down to the Ground, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide there, for want of Water ſtrength, to drive it through, or to the Stops; and the ſame Sullage will in reaſonable Time, fill all Water-fretts, and raiſe the ſame fit for Imbankment, as has been done elſewhere by this Proponent's means; and where all the difficult Parts of that Work were avoided: The ſaid Precedent was about 200 Acres, being the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of a Water-frett, had been made by a Baſon of 3000 Acres, and was given for Loſt by thoſe who regained the reſt of it, by Fighting againſt the Tendency of Tides and Ebbs.</p>
            <p>No cutting of Banks was wanted for the Work above, for the Breach remained 500 Yards wide, with the Baſon but 200 Acres; but if a Wood Pile be ſet in <hi>Dagenham</hi> Water-fret, without Cutts, the Water will fret Soyl from bottom and ſides of the Water-frett, where the Wood Pile ſhall ſtand, to make good the room it ſtands in, becauſe that Baſon is 2000 Acres, or thereabouts, and but 100 Yards wide.</p>
            <p>The Cutts are alſo extreamly ſerviceable for Repair of the Breach, and by the laſt Quarter of a Tide, the Water may riſe as high within the Baſon, againſt the back part of the Work, as it ſhall riſe againſt the Front thereof, by entering at the Breach. And after theſe two Parts of a Tide come to a Par, by riſing within and without the Wood Pile in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fret, the Wood Pile has no Water-weight againſt it, during the reſt of the Tide; and it is the latter part of a Tide (as higheſt) that preſſes hardeſt againſt Works that contend with it.</p>
            <p>The Ebbs far exceed Tides, in being Deſtructive to Works that fight againſt them; however their Waters on each ſide the Wood Pile ebb to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and keep to a Parr, ſo as one Ounce of Water-weight lies not againſt the Wood Pile all the Ebb, and thus the Works in <hi>Dagenham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs liable to Riſque, than the Precedent, or Work before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; for Preſervation whereof, no Cutts were made; but any great Water Paſſages may be left in this Wood Pile, or between the ſame and the Earth, yet they cannot wear wider, while the Water is on a Par on both Sides, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Till <hi>Dagenham</hi> Breach is well repaired, the VVorks there ſhall lie under the ſaid Guard and Protection of Tides and Ebbs, for Wood-ſtops in the Cutts ſhall be raiſed a little ſlower than that in the Breach, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of new Banks in the Cutts, on a good Foundation, ſhall be the laſt work for Draining the ſame Levels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> your Proponent is unwilling good Inventions ſhould die as idle Projects, and hopes he has explained his Methods for Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Navigation, and Repair of the Breach aforeſaid, ſo far as may ſhew him able to perform both, and much Cheaper than in the old Way of fighting againſt VVater Powers. If this Method ſucceed, as well in <hi>Eſſex</hi> as elſewhere, the ſame will be an Eſtabliſhed Way for all great Water-Breaches for the future, and many Work-Men will be made able to do it, whence no more Families will be ruined by Water-Breaches: Beſides, the Security to all Marſh-Land hereby, will conſiderably raiſe their Value; and the leſs Money ſhall be ſpent on Repair of your VVater-Breach, the more Serviceable will this New Method be to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The Cutts do appear as neceſſary to do the ſaid Services with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exceſſive Charge, as the Loſs of a Leg to ſave a Life, which Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is often ventur'd by thoſe who only hope to ſurvive it on a Wooden Leg, but here ſhall be good Banks again, when the Cutts have done their Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52933:3"/>
Some Objections will be made againſt the Cutts, which are propoſed in this manner, and anſwered as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> I. That the new Cuts will become as deep as the Breach.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer, the Proponent ſays, That the Breach did gain neither Depth nor Breadth, for ſome Years before the laſt Stop failed, becauſe it had gained Paſſage enough, to fill and empty the Baſon, by the moderate running Marſh-Channels will bear, without enlargement.</p>
            <p>For a further Precedent, when <hi>Weſt Thorack</hi> Level was under Inundation, the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly Winds that cauſe the higheſt Tides in the <hi>Thames,</hi> did deſtroy and carry off ſeveral Parts of the Eaſterly Bank of the Level laſt mentioned, but made thoſe new Breaches little, if any lower than that Marſh Surface; becauſe all the Breaches there abated the Water's Reſtraint and Tendency to carry out more Earth for a wider Paſſage. This Precedent is on the <hi>Thames,</hi> but few Miles lower than <hi>Dagenham,</hi> and well in Memory.</p>
            <p>In each new Cutt may be two Rows of Boards driven into the Ground edge-way, till only the upper edge appears, and theſe Rows to ſtand 8 Foot aſunder; the Water will run over the edges of theſe Boards without fretting them lower; nor can it in running 8 Foot frett a Boards breadth into the Ground, becauſe there it muſt mount again, to paſs over the ſecond Row of Boards. Theſe Boards may eaſe doubtful Minds, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſeem needleſs.</p>
            <p>A further Objection againſt Cutts is, That the Water entering only at the Breach, did, at, and ſince the firſt Inundation, break a Bank three Times, and drown a large adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Level, becauſe Soil fit for Banks is wanting there, and the Breach with Cutts may raiſe Tides a little higher againſt that feeble Bank, and deſtroy the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Baſon has four Mile of Bank againſt the <hi>Thames,</hi> whoſe Repair has been much neglected ſince the Inundation, and the Weſterly Winds blow the higheſt Tides from the feeble Bank, full againſt the Eaſterly Bank of the Baſon: however no new Breach is yet made quite through any part of that Eaſterly Bank; and the Feeble Bank ought to have the Heighth and Strength of the <hi>Thames</hi> Bank, ſince Tides flow as high againſt it; and then the Cutts may make high Water in the Baſon, juſt when it is ſo in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and damage no Man thereby.</p>
            <p>As to want of good Soile for the feeble Bank; the Earth, or rather Mudd uſed for it, is much ſoaked every Tide, the ſame being taken out of the Baſon: So the ſaid Bank when new repaired, is at leaſt one third Part of it Water, as the Proponent apprehends: For Water ſwells the Particles of Earth according to the Quantity of Water that is in them. And as ſuch a Bank dries, the Water is Exhaled by Sun and Wind; and the Parts of Earth ſhrink one from the other in drying, till the Bank cleaves and parts, or cones in many places, and receives as much Air, as it formerly contained Water. A few Months after the laſt Repair of this Bank, the Proponent was thereon, and ſound very many Cones in it, ſome of which Cones lying croſs the Bank and Deep: And when a Tide riſes high enough to enter through theſe Cones, a Breach is ſoon made in ſuch Bank. And beyond <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Winds the ſame Bank will hardly ſtand, if not better repaired than Mudd will do it.</p>
            <p>Near the new Cutts, (and the better to repair the ſame,) the Proponent intends to lay ſome of the Earth which comes out of the Old Banks and Forelands in high Heaps, that the Sun and Wind may make it as dry and fit to be well Rammed, as the upper two Foot of an Old Bank is. And the ſame way ought to be taken to Secure the Level now in danger; either by its Owners, or the Government, otherwiſe that Land will probably be added to the Inundation. <hi>Note,</hi> the Work laſt mentioned will anſwer the Objection againſt Bank-cutting laſt made; <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no Earth fit to repair the ſame Cutts. Therefore when the ſaid feeble Bank is well repaired, and Cutts in the <hi>Thames</hi> Bank made lawful as aforeſaid; then this Proponent hopes Water may faſter, or in a greater quantity be let into the Baſon, without Danger to himſelf, or any Perſon.</p>
