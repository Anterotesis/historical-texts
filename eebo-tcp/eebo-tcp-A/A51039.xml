         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>A New Method of War, an improvement no doubt,</l>
               <l>Our Generals of late have ſo wiſely found out;</l>
               <l>To conquer our Foes is to put them in Fright,</l>
               <l>For by this if they fly, there's no occaſion to fight,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Derry down,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our late Expedition this fully implies,</l>
               <l>The beſt waging of War, is the ſaving of Lives;</l>
               <l>An old Woman or two, that were frighten'd ſince dead,</l>
               <l>Or elſe to their Honour no Blood there was ſhed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whether <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> no great ſtudy 'twill coſt,</l>
               <l>To determine it who was frighten'd the moſt;</l>
               <l>Have perhaps this Excuſe for not landing courag'ous,</l>
               <l>As Pannicks are catching they might think them contag'ous.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For not landing, beſides other Reaſons, excuſe 'em,</l>
               <l>(Wou'd the World but conſider, they wou'd not abuſe 'em)</l>
               <l>Were told, by Report, they'd be by Water ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,</l>
               <l>And landmen, by nature, don't like to be drowned.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So quick-ſighted by night, ſaw it raſhneſs to land,</l>
               <l>But more clearly convinc'd when the day was at hand</l>
               <l>There's many do ſay, if we credit their ſpeeches,</l>
               <l>That womens red petticoats they took for mens breeches.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If their courage going out was but tardy and ſlack,</l>
               <l>They ſeem'd not to want it at returning all back:</l>
               <l>Tho' this myſt'ry ſo dark an odd thought may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten,</l>
               <l>Cocks crowing, 'tis ſaid, will lions much frighten.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To call it an action on each ſide's not right;</l>
               <l>We may call it much better a <hi>fright</hi> than a <hi>fight:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of our land force one thing we may certainly ſay,</l>
               <l>The feats they perform'd was next running away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Well knowing what dangers attend on the brave,</l>

               <l>Not forgetting the maxim to take their plea,</l>
               <l>That a prudent retreat is oft winning the day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our commanders ſome blunder muſt ſurely have made</l>
               <l>And made a miſtake in the choice of their trade·</l>
               <l>A ſervice that's ſofter may pleaſe them much more,</l>
               <l>Not ſo fitted for <hi>Mars</hi> as for <hi>Venus's Core.</hi>

               <l>The winds as in anger againſt them long blew,</l>
               <l>As if but prophetick of what they wou'd do:</l>
               <l>Such an ominous hint if they wou'd but have read it,</l>
               <l>Might have ſav'd much Expence, and the Nation its credit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The genius of Britons had for fighting a paſſion,</l>
               <l>More civiliz'd now 'tis grown quite out of faſhion.</l>
               <l>Fine cloaths, ſmock looks, and the care of the ladies,</l>
               <l>Their heads and their hearts more for this than their trade is.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tho' Briton's, tis ſaid, were not Mollies of old,</l>
               <l>Were for dealing of blows, and were manly and bold</l>
               <l>And if out-number'd to fear they were ſtrangers,</l>
               <l>No councils of war reſtrain'd them from dangers.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The women, 'tis ſaid, intend to petition,</l>
               <l>That they may go out on the next Expedition:</l>
               <l>If ſucceſsful in war, and its dangers they dare,</l>
               <l>They expect for the future the Breeches to wear.</l>
