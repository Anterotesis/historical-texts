            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

J was doubtfull left some ill construction might have bin made of my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and simple meaning: and therefore unwilling to be taxed with over bold presumption, J thought it better to reflect my eye upon a more familiar object, and to present the dedication of these poore labours to such a man, of whose goodnesse, and worth, J have had sufficient tryall by the testimony of many yeeres acquaintance: and the more imboldned thereunto by that conjugall affinity which hath more strongly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited me to anindeered, and in violable obligation If

For although I have had an Idaea in my minde, which hath presented me with a better forme, yet my produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I must confesse, are lame, and imperfect, and come farre short of the extentions of my wishes, and imaginations. Let your better judgment rather allow of my intentions, then of my unpolisht expressions: and what I am not able to delineate in words, let my well-meaning endeavours be supplied out of the treasure of your more judicious apprehension. So shall I have a further tryall of your favours, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a sacrifice which I owe unto the graces, and you: and shall alwaies rest,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving beene many monthes a prisoner in the Fleete, and overwearyed with the teadious length of idle time, glad of the least occasion of imployment, as well to put the thoughts of my distracted fortunes out of my head, as also to helpe waste, and bring to an end the wearisome day. It was my fortune walking one day solitarily on the Leads, being on the top of an high Tower adjoyning unto my Chamber, and looking over the battlements into the Fleete-lane, I espied in one of the Houses right opposite against me, a young Gentlewoman, of a comely feature, and sweete grace, apparelled very richly, and attired according to the fashion then most in use, she was looking out at a window into the streete, and I standing on the toppe of the Tower, being almost
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19519:5"/>
two stories higher then her chamber window, could easily discerne her, without being seene my selfe, where after she had looked a while into the street, she retires into her chamber, and shuts the case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I thinking she had beene a stranger, and came to visit some friend or kinsman in that house, tooke little regard of her for that time. But afterwards walking many times upon the Leads looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the Lane, I by chance cast mine eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same window, out of the which I did first see the Gentlewoman to looke, where I might dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive through the Glasse (the casement being then shut) the same Gentlewoman stand, busy about something which I could not discerne, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her to be the same woman which I had there formerly seene, I began to thinke that she might perchance lodge in the same house, and knowing her to be a stranger, and not inhabitant there, and that it was no fit place for a Gentlewoman of her fashion (as she seemed to be) to lodge in such a place, whereas every house almost in the Lane was filled with prisoners, I began to enquire if she were wife of any prisoner, or if she were a prisoner herselfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such women as are prisoners, doe for the most part lie in the Lane: upon enquiry I understood that she was neyther prisoner, nor prisoners wife, but a stranger, newly come out of the City, and that she had no acquaintance there, but what she had gotten since her first comming thither. To be briefe, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that she was a woman apt to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement to any that desired her company, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof her honesty was much suspected, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19519:5"/>
the generall report about the street was, that she was no better then a whore: having understood thus much of her, I often attended to see what company resorted to the house, thinking thereby I should the better conceive whether report had wronged her or not: At the last I perceived that divers Gentlemen, and men of great fashion and worth had daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course thither, but more especially, I noted one man to resort unto her more then any of the rest; &amp; when that man was in the house there could be no admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for any other that desired to come unto her, for by one frivolous excuse or other they would send them away without the sight of the Gentlewoman: at other times if they came, when that Gentleman was not with her, they had free accesse to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where they might stay, and be merry with her at their pleasure, this I observed, &amp; this made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that if she were not common unto them all, yet at the least she was nought with one, but desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be satisfied of the truth, and not to be lead either by my owne conjecture, or the report of others I determined to write unto her. Long it was before I could resolve in what manner I should write, for considering that I was a stranger unto her, and not knowne, eyther by person or name, and herselfe as little knowne unto me, I was in doubt whether she would receive any such letters or not, againe I thought, if I should write unto her in the nature of a Lover, if she should happily receive the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and reade the same, having no acquaintance at all with me, she would imagine that I went about to entrap her, and of purpose to finde out the nature of her inclination, thereby to question
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19519:6"/>
her manner of life. I therefore resolved to write unto her in a carelesse, and bold manner, so as she might neyther understand me to be one of the assaylants of her love, nor yet a despiser of her acquaintance, therefore so neere as I could, without any insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting flattery, or course harshnesse, I adventured to write in this familiar manner.</p>
            <l>LAdy though I am a stranger,</l>
            <l>Yet because I am your neighbour,</l>
            <l>I doe hope there is no danger,</l>

            <l>Lonely wasting tedious times,</l>
            <l>To salute you with my rimes.</l>
            <l>Pardon, if I be too bold,</l>
            <l>I intend no hurt unto you,</l>

            <l>When I first did write, my pen</l>

            <l>If you had not come so nigh me,</l>
            <l>I had kept my papers by me.</l>

            <p>When I had written these Letters, I knew not how to have them conveyed to her hands, neyther could I direct them by superscription, because I knew not her name, nor had any acquaintance with any person in the house; at the length having some speeches with a friend of mine concerning her, I told him that I had a Letter to be sent to her, and I knew not how to have it delivered, whereupon he offered himselfe to be the messenger, and to use his best endeavour to deliver it to her, and if he could not have admittance himselfe, yet at the least to take such course as it should come unto her hands, hereupon I put my name to the Letter, and sealed it, and gave it to my friend, and withall intreated him that if it were possible he would get me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to it, he vowing to doe his best, tooke my letters, and departed, and wayting his opportunity, when as he thought she was all alone, went to the house, and desired that he might speake with her, he was examined presently by the Mistris of the house, from whence he came, he told her, from a friend of the Gentlewomans, naming such a one as he had before seene to resort to her, and that his busines was onely to deliver a Letter from him into her hands, with that she bid him follow her, and she
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19519:8"/>
would bring him to her Chamber, hee glad of his successe followed her untill shee came to the Chamber dore, and there the Mistris of the house leaving of him, bid him goe in, so he entring into the Chamber found the Gentlewoman writing at her window, he saluting of her told her that he was requested by a Gentleman to deliver a Letter unto her, and withall gave the Letter into her hands, she never examining what the Gentlemans name was, or where he dwelt, tooke the Letters, and opening of them, perceived the same to be in verse, stood still, as it were wondring whence it should come: at length after she had pawsed a while, she began to read, and in the reading she would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times smile to her selfe, and sometimes set her countenance as if shee had bin angry: but having read the Letter to the end, and perceiving a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans name thereto, whom she knew not, she asked my friend if he knew the Gentleman that sent the Letter, he told her he did, and that he lay in the high Tower over against her Chamber, how doe you know sayd she, this Letter was sent to me, for there is no direction upon it to shew to whom it should be carryed, I know very well, quoth he, that you are the party it was intended unto, because the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though he knew not your name, shewed me the house, and in what Chamber in the house you were lodged in, well sayd she it is noe great matter, to whom it was sent, it seemes that he that writ it had not much to doe, and, because he shall advise better upon it, there take it, and carry it to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and tell him this from me, that if he can
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19519:9"/>
exercise his wit to noe better purpose I would wish him to spare his paynes hereafter, and to employ his Muse about matter of more moment, that may be more profitable to himselfe, and lesse prejudiciall to others. With that, delivering the Letter unto him she turnes towards her window, and he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further stay or reply left her, and comming to my Chamber, told me of all that had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, I was glad that she had read it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereby she had occasion to take notice of my name, and although she seemed to be a little angry, yet I knew there was nothing in the Letter that she could justly tax me for, but onely my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in sending, having noe acquayntance at all with her, and that I thought she would quickely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, when her anger was a little qualified, and if it were not extreame, I thought it might be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that I should more often see her at her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: for women are not alwayes angry when they seeme so to be, and indeede so it fell out, for after that time I should see her window often times standing open, and her selfe shewing her selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and sometimes I should perceive her looke up towards the Tower, where I used to be, which made me conjecture that she would bestow the reading of another Letter, if I could use the meanes to have it conveyed cunningly unto her: whereupon resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with my selfe to make a further tryall of her, and not to give her over upon one single repulse, I determyned to try her once more by writing, but my greatest feare was how I should have it convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into her hands, for I thought if I should send it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19519:9"/>
by my first messenger, he should scarce have accesse againe unto her, or if he had, she would hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing from him being soe much vexed at the other, at the length as I was walking late one night on the top of the Tower, the Moone shining very bright, and looking towards her Chamber, I espyed the casement of her window to be open, and perceiving noe light to be in the roome, I thought how I might convey my Letter in at her window, where shee finding such a thing to ly, could not chuse but open the same, not suspecting but that some of the same house having continuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course into her Chamber, might eyther forget it behind them, or leave it for her to reade over, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore following this opportunity, I tooke my Pen, and wrote certaine Verses unto her, and onely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up the paper, without any Seale or direction upon it, with the helpe of a long Pole which I had in my Chamber, I made such shift that I put the Letter in at her window, and with the end of the Pole shut the casement lest she should suspect which way the Letter should come, the Verses which I wrote were these.</p>

            <p>The casement being shut, and the Letter left in the window, I attended three or foure dayes to see whether I should heare from her or not, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing in all that time, I began to doubt whether my Letters were come to her hands, at the length taking my usuall recreation on the top of the Tower, the roome over her chamber being a place where Embroyderers did use to worke, and opposite against the Tower where I was walking, the windowes of the roome lay open, I perceived her sitting at a Frame whereon was a faire Waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19519:11"/>
which she was richly Embroydering with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored Silks, and Gold, and being very diligent at her worke, I observed whether she did at any time cast her eye up to the Tower, supposing that she came thither, as well to give an occasion to be seene as for the eagernesse of the worke, she had then in hand, because I had never seene her in that roome before: I had not stayed long, but I perceived her many times to looke up towards the Tower, with such earnestnesse, as if she had beene desirous to have seene some body, which made me conjecture that her comming thither was of purpose to see the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that had so boldly wrote unto her, therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the place where I was I stood directly against the roome where she sate at worke, that if she hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily looked that way againe, she should not chuse but perceive me, I had not stayd there long, but she tooke notice of me, and blushing exceedingly upon the first view, me thought she lookt like <hi>Niobe</hi> when she contended with <hi>Latona</hi> for the prize, I must confesse I had so long played with the bayte, that I had almost swallowed the hooke, being so surprized with the amiable prospect of so sweete a countenance, yet unwilling to be caught by those faire allurements considering that under the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Grasse lyeth the most venemous serpent. I was sorry that so sweet a face should be set to sale to every amorous passenger, and where so much beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was placed, that there should want vertue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne it, and make it truely love-worthy: and having a setled determination to know of what coyne she was stamped, whether Gold or Copper, and if I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19519:11"/>
should finde her to be of the worst, which I did much suspect, that then I would use the best art, and skill I could, to have her cast in a new mould, and to purge the drosse out of her, that she might be refyned to purer mettall. Willing therefore to enter into some discourse with her, no person being in the roome but her selfe, I began in this manner to salute her:</p>
            <p>Fayre Lady, I have upon no acquaintance at all beene bold to trouble you with my writing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I feare I have much offended, yet am glad that I have so good an opportunity to crave pardon for my errours, which I now doe, intreating you not to conceive any wrong thereby intended, but to impute my fault rather to want of imployment, and to the present troubles that I endure, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my imprisonment, then to the least intent of distaste, that I would willingly give to your selfe. Sir, sayd she, are you the Gentleman that wrote those pleasant verses to me not long since, and sent them to my chamber by I know not whom: I am the same, sayd I, and am sorry if eyther the messenger, or the sender have displeased you; no great displeasure, sayd she, but I thought it strange to receive Letters from one that I knew not, and written in such a fashion as I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, in what sense to consture them; and now I know you are the same that so lately conveyed another Letter written in verse likewise into my chamber window, I have often wondred how it should come thither, pray let me crave so much of you as to tell me truely what meanes you used
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19519:12"/>
to have it layd there, and who brought it thither, I will tell you truely, sayd I, upon this condition, first that you will pardon my boldnesse therein, then whether it were delivered unto you by another, or found by your selfe in the window, for the first, sayd she, I doe freely forgive, and for the later, I confesse truely that I found it my selfe in the window, but knew not how it came thither, then, sayd I, I will tell you, and so I acquainted her with the manner of it as before is expressed. Here upon we entred into further discourse, and having knowne each others name, and all former offences absolutely forgiven, we agreed to be better acquainted, and that she would come once every afternoone into the same roome of purpose to talke with me, and to spend the time in some pleasant discourse, wherein she was many daies as good as her word, where we talked of those things which best pleased us, and one day among the rest talking of some amorous discourse, she began thus. Sir, sayd she, you are one that can make verses, and have skill in poetry, and I make no question but some things lie by you of your owne invention, eyther to try what your owne art can do, or to entertaine such Gentlewomen withall as you shall be best affected unto, and therefore let me intreat you to bring some of your odde papers with you, and sit with me, eyther here or in my chamber, for I doe like your veine in writing so well, that I am perswaded I shall take great delight in reading some of your owne workes, I make no question but though you are a prisoner, you may come so farre, because I see daily such as are priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19519:12"/>
passe freely into any part of the Lane, and if you please to take that paynes you shall not finde me unwilling to requite it, if it lyeth in my power. I was glad to heare her say thus much, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring nothing more then to have such an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to conferre privately with her at her chamber, yet alwaies resolved not to doe or attempt any thing but what should be fit an honest man, onely I had such a compassionate love to those sweete lookes, that I thought it was pity they should not be accompanied with a due measure of grace, and therefore I thanked her greatly that she would shew me so high a favour, and promised to attend her at her chamber within a day or two after, and so we parted for that time. The next day perceiving her alone at her window, I called to her, and told her, that if she were at leasure; if it pleased her, I would come over the way to her: she told me I should be welcome, and desired me to come. With that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Study, and taking some idle pamphlets that I had there, I went unto the house where she lay, she kindly met me at the doore, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me to her chamber, where with reading sometimes, and sometimes with talking, we spent a good part of the afternoone, and after many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions asked her, I perceived that a little siege would batter the fortresse of her honesty, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by her that her meanes was small, and her friends not many, and her selfe, as she seemed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take any honest course that should sute with the credite of a Gentlewoman, with many other speeches to that purpose, but taking leave of her for

that time she intreated me that I would be no stranger at her Chamber, for that she should take it very kindly if I would come and sit with her at my leasure times when I had nothing else to doe, which I promised her to performe. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards considering with my selfe, if I should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten resort thither, it might be a cause that some malignant tongue would speake worse of me then I deserved, and thereby draw a scandall upon my selfe, which once gotten; would not be easily shaken off. I did therefore forbeare going to her chamber, yet every day, she sitting in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyderers roome, we had conference together, and so continued our acquayntance, where often talking with her, at length she told me she was to goe from thence, and to lie in the Towne, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me, if I did not goe sometimes abroad in the City, I answered her, I did: and desired that if she pleased to tell me where she lay in the Towne, I would make bold to visit her at her lodging: she told me where I should finde her, who shortly after going from the place where she then lay, sent a note in writing, intreating me not to forget my promise to visit her at her lodging, and therein set downe the place where I should enquire for her. It was not long after but I had occasion to goe into <hi>London</hi> in company of another Gentleman, and passing neere the place where she lay, determined to goe visit her, and so enquiring for her at her lodging we were told that she lay there, but she was that day abroad at dinner with certaine Gentlemen, but where, or with whom they knew not: whereupon we retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19519:13"/>
thence, it came in our minds to goe to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne not farre off, to drinke a pint of Wine, and if occasion served to enquire whether such a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman did lie in the streete, and what she was, where comming in, we were brought into a little roome sitting our company, where, as we were drinking of our Wine, we heard musicke, and much mirth, in the next roome unto us, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what company was there, we understood that there were two or three Gentlewomen, with divers gallants in their company that dyned there that day, but what they were, we could by no meanes understand, whereupon I intreated one of the drawers to helpe me privately to a sight of them, for I thought I did heare the voyce of one that I knew, he presently brings me to a secret place where I might discover the whole company, and amongst them all, I perceived the same Gentlewoman that I came that day to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, and noteing her carriage with the rest of her associats, she seemed to me more jocund, merry, and familiar than any woman respecting her honesty, and her credit would have beene, I desired the Gentleman that was with me, that we might stay, and see the conclusion, and parting of that company, who was contented and thereupon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that they intended to sup there, we resolved to sup there also, by our selves in the little roome, where we were at the first placed, by which meanes we both heard and saw most of their conversation, presently after supper they dismissed their musicke, and having all of them well steeped their braines in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19519:14"/>
Wine, they then began to shew of what metall they were made, where after much rude, and unseemely behaviour, they discharged the house, and went their way: my friend, and I having likewise payd our reckoning followed after them, to see the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most event of this meeting: they had not gone farre from the Taverne but the company parted, and onely one Gentleman conducted my acquaintance to her lodging, where so soone as we saw them to enter the house, we betooke our selves likewise to our lodgings, having by that daies worke sounded more of her disposition, then I had done in all the time of my acquaintance before. For whereas I was till then led by report, and some suspition which I drew from my owne conjecture, I now saw so much of her carriage that I could not conceive that her former report had wronged her. Not many daies after, I tooke an occasion to write unto her, and the effect of my Letters was this, That I had lately bin at her lodging to have seene her, but could not be so happy as to finde her within, therefore I desired, in regard that I had not the priviledge to goe often abroad, that she would give me leave to write unto her, and withall, that liberty in writing, that she would not take any thing distastefully, but to read it over with patience, and deliberation, and desired likewise her answer in writing. This Letter I sent unto her, and received an answer in writing, that she was sorry that she was not at home at the time of my being there, which if she had knowne of, she would have remedyed, and desired she might see me, if I could coveniently, otherwise if I would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19519:14"/>
take the paines to write unto her, she would be so farre from taking offence at any thing that I should write of, that she would thinke her selfe much bound unto me for the same, and did faithfully promise to reade it with patience, and due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and withall desired me that I would write unto her in verse, because it was a thing she much affected, and would be pleasing unto her in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Having understood thus much by her answer, I determined to use the strongest arguments that I could for her reformation, hoping that my writing might perchance worke so much with her as it might bring her into a loathing of her former life, and perswade her to such courses as might be more profitable both to her soule, and body. Wherefore taking some paines for her conversion, I wrote these lines following, and making them up in a little booke, sent the same unto her, the successe whereof you shall afterwards heare.</p>

            <p>When I had written these lines, I made them up in a little booke, and by a friend which I had, sent them unto her lodging, with a letter likewise to be delivered unto her, both which my friend presented to her owne hands, and she receiving of them thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, read over the letter presently in his sight, and told him, that so soone as she had perused the booke, which should not be long, she would send her answer unto me: and so my friend taking a courteous fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, left her, and returned telling me of the kinde welcome both of the letter, and the booke, which I was glad to heare of, and therefore hoped in a short time to receive her answer, which I did wish might be according as I both expected, and desired. I way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for her answer about ten daies, and not hearing from her, well knowing in that time she might at her leisure have read it over, I began to wonder what the reason should be, imagining, that eyther she was loath to bestow so much paynes as to reade it, or else having read it, she was offended at it, and being willing to be satisfied herein, yet unwilling that she should take any notice of my desire, I sent another friend, not to her lodging, but neere unto it, to the

end that I might be assured whether she still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there, or whether she were removed to any other place: my friend taking occasion secretly to enquire of her, understood by one of the neighbours, that she kept her old lodging, and that she had lately beene very sicke, and was not then recovered. Of which her sicknes, when I understood, I was in some hope that she had considered seriously on the contents of the booke, and that it had wrought so farre with her, that she had layd the same to her heart, and was thereby drawne to a strict examination of her owne life, which might be the meanes of troubling her conscience, so farre, as that it might breede a distemper in her body, and so be the cause of impay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her health: desirous therefore to understand how she digested it, &amp; whether there were any other cause of her disease, I sent my friend to her lodging to see how she did, not taking any notice that I had knowne of her sicknesse, and withall, to excuse my not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming unto her all that time: whither when he came, he was willingly conducted into her chamber, where she then lay in her bed, and delivering his message unto her, she told him that she had beene very ill, and wonderfull desirous to see me, and entreated him to signifie so much unto me, and that she was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to send a messenger unto me, but that by reason of her sicknesse she knew not how conveniently to doe it (not speaking one word unto him concerning the booke.) My friend not staying long with her, and promisig to acquaint me with her desire, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and telling me what her request was, and in vvhat case he found her, I resolved vvithin fevv daies

to visit her, and accordingly within a day or two after, I came unto her chamber, where being entred, I found her sitting in her chaire by the fire, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping exceedingly. I comming in so suddenly, and she turning her head espying of me, presently leapt out of her chaire, and comming towards me, tooke me by the hand, and looking earnestly in my face, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speake to me to this effect, the substance whereof for memory sake I have set downe in verse, as followeth, viz.</p>

            <head>A Meditation upon Death.</head>
            <l>NOthing more wisht then wealth, yet that must leave us</l>
            <l>Nothing more sweete then love,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nothing</hi>
               </note> that lasts not ever.</l>
            <l>Nothing more kinde then friends, yet theyl deceive us.</l>
            <l>Nothing more fast then wedlocke, yet they sever.</l>
            <l>The world must end, all things away must fly,</l>
            <l>Nothing more sure then death, for all must dy.</l>
            <l>More honours may be got, but they'l away.</l>
            <l>More beauty may be had,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>More</hi>
               </note> but twill not last.</l>
            <l>More wealth may be obtain'd, but twill decay.</l>
            <l>More joyes may follow, but those soone are past.</l>
            <l>For long continuance tis in vaine to try,</l>
            <l>Nothing more sure then death, for all must dy.</l>
            <l>Sure love must dy though rooted in the heart.</l>

            <l>Nor two, nor one may scape, nor thou, nor I,</l>
            <l>Nothing more sure then death, for all must dy.</l>
            <l>Then let the rich, no longer covet wealth.</l>
            <l>Then let the proud,<note place="margin">
