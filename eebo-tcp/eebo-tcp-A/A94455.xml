            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> in this preſent <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> Aſſembled. The humble Petition of the Company of <hi>Stationers</hi> of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Committee for Printing appointed by this Honourable Houſe, was pleaſed to direct the Printing of a new Impreſſion of the Bible, of the laſt Tranſlation, with Notes in the Margent, for the better expoſition of hard places, and cleerer underſtanding of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>That diverſe Reverend and Learned Divines of this Kingdome, were by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Edward Dearing</hi> (then in the Chaire of the ſaid Committee) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the making of the ſaid Notes, and have now very neare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the ſame for the Preſſe;</p>
            <p>Yet ſo it is, may it pleaſe this Honourable Houſe, that a very few Perſons of the ſaid Company, but Eleven in Number, (whereas the Company conſiſteth of many hundred Families) labouring to acquier the Printing and profit thereof to themſelves, have privately gained ſome promiſe from ſome of the ſaid Divines, intending to exclude all others of the Company, from having any benefit thereby.</p>
            <p>And your Petitioners doe further ſhew, that they have not any common Stock (wherewith to pay the Subſidies charged upon their ſaid Company by Parliament; nor to provide Armes or Corne, for the ſafety and proviſion of this City as they are aſſeſſed; neither to maintaine their owne Poore, which are very many: and hath coſt them <hi>Communibus Annis,</hi> above 200<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>. <hi>per Annum,</hi> neare upon 40 Yeares laſt paſt) excepting the benefit of Printing a few ſmall Bookes, which now alſo by means of irregular Printing, they are almoſt quite deprived of: And that all the Free-hold they have, belonging to their Corporation, together with their Common Seale, lies now ingaged for 1500<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>. which was borrowed at Intereſt, for the uſe and ſervice of this preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>And their poverty is yet the greater, in that they have not ſo much as a Common Hall of their owne to aſſemble in; And that theſe Eleven men, who now labour to gaine to themſelves the ſole Printing of this Bible and Notes; are now, and have bin, (many of them) Pattentees, and Monopolizers of Printing the moſt vendable Bookes of worth and quantity now in uſe; To the great detriment of the Kingdome, and to the ruine and deſtruction of this poore Company.</p>
            <p>THESE PREMISES CONSIDERED; and for as much as this is a publick worke, and was firſt moved from a Committee of this Honourable Houſe; that therefore you would be pleaſed to Order that it may be Printed for the common benefit of the whole Company, which will much revive their languiſhing and miſerable condition; wherein they (the aforeſaid Eleven Parties) together with the many hundreds others of the ſaid Corporation, may equally partake, both in the Charge and Profit thereof: Which will be a means, that the ſame will be Printed with the greater care and circumſpection.</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>And your Petitioners ſhall ever pray.</signed>
