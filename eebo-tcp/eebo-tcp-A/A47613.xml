         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To all Sincere Chriſtians that were the Hearers
of this Sermon, but more eſpecially to that
poor, afflicted, and ſorrowful Congregation,
which is in God the Father, and in our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, meeting in Old Gravel-Lane,
near Wapping, London.</head>
            <p>WHEN I think of that Separation Death
hath made between you and your beloved
Paſtor (my dear Brother) it cauſes ſadneſs
to ſeiz my ſpirit; Sure, ſuch Stroaks of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
ſhould bring us upon our Knees; I wiſh
you are not hereafter made more ſenſible of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of theſe ſore Rebukes, then at preſent you can
be; however let us learn this Leſſon by it, not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verprize
or value any thing or Perſon ſhort of Jeſus
Chriſt; 'Tis good in all things to labour againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinateneſs
of affection; We can't, 'tis true, love
God too much; nor Chriſt too much, but we may
love Miniſters too much, nay, idolize them, eſteem
them above what is meet, as many in former times
have done, or we may eſteem them not enough; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any of you have bin guilty herein or no, will
now I am perſwaded be diſcovered; if duty to God,
<pb facs="tcp:46869:3"/>
our ſolemn Vow and Covenant with God and the
Church, and our Love to Jeſus Chriſt, will not make
us to know and keep our Places, what may we judge
of our ſelves, or others judge of us: I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fears I ſpeak of ſome in reſpect of temptations of
this kind, I pray God deliver them from it, leſt they
bring up a reproach upon the good ways of God;
You had or would be looked upon all of you, to have
a real and cordial love for him that is now taken from
you, O then do nothing after his death that would
have grieved his ſoul were he alive; Labour to live
in love, and ſtrive to keep the unity of the Spirit in
the Bond of Peace; I having this opportunity, thought
it not amiſs to give a hint or two of this Nature</p>
            <p>And now beloved, as concerning this Sermon, had
it not been Preached in part to fulfil the deſire of the
deceaſed, I ſhould not have preſumed to have taken ſo
weighty a work upon me, eſpecially in the Preſence
of ſo many able and worthy Miniſters, as I am not ſo,
(the Lord knows, I look upon my ſelf no ways meet,
or fitly qualified and capacitated for ſuch a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
work I am called to) And truly, brethren, 'tis not
any excellency and worth that is in this broken Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that is the cauſe of its Publication, 'tis the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and importunity of ſeveral amongſt you, and
ſome others, that hath brought it forth; I do think,
nevertheleſs, for the ſake of him at whoſe Deſire and
at who'e Funeral it was Preached, you will entertain
it though never ſo poor and mean a work.</p>
            <p>I told you what ſorrow had ſeized my ſpirit, I
<pb facs="tcp:46869:3"/>
Preached with a heavy heart, and with a
mournful ſpirit, I know you fate under the
hearing of it; alas, I cannot blame you for your
mourning, he was a moſt ſweet and choice
Preacher, moſt excellent skill had he to dive into
Goſpel-Myſteries; he ſaw, if I may ſay without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
as far into a Text of Scripture, as moſt men
now ſurviving, and as careful in dividing of the Word
that every one might have a portion in ſeaſon; O
how ſweetly has this Trumpet ſounded in your ears,
what ſpiritual joy hath it raiſed in your hearts! O
how powerful in Prayer hath he been! Hath not his
prayers and Tears over ſinking ſinners, tended to melt
their Adamant hearts! O the thronging there hath
been about him, no marvel he had precious bread al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to break unto the children; he knew how to
feed with milk, and how and when to feed with
ſtrong meat; It was his delight, I am ſatisfied, to do
his Maſters work, and in doing of it, I may ſay, he
loved not his life unto the death.</p>
            <p>He is gone to eat the fruit of his labour, and I
wiſh, that all thoſe Choice Sermons you have heard
from his lips may not be buried with him, I hope the
fruit of them will be ſeen in your lives; and could
ſome of them be made publick, they might be very
ſerviceable unto the People of God and others in
general. I ſhall at preſent ſay no more, but earneſtly
deſiring the Lord to continue the Labourer you
have, and ſend ſome other in due time amongſt you,
to the making up that great loſs which at preſent you
<pb facs="tcp:46869:4"/>
do ſuſtain, ſo that ſinners may be in the midſt of you
converted, and true believers ſtrengthned, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and comforted, and all built up together in love,
to the end that you may be found without blemiſh
in the day of Jeſus Chriſt, and that it may be ſo, is the
deſire, and ſhall be the Prayer of him</p>

            <p>SVppoſing thee to be One that was not at this late
<hi>Funeral;</hi> or if thou wert there, could'ſt not have
the opportunity to hear the Sermon (by reaſon of the
ſtraightneſs of the place, and the multitude of
People) and perceiving it is partly for thy ſake, the
Printing of it has bin ſo much deſired, I thought it
might not be unneceſſary to offer a word or two briefly
unto thee, whether it deſerves ſuch a Publication or
not, it will come now under thy Cenſure; however, if
thou knowest the Perſon that taught it, <hi>I</hi> am ſatisfied,
thou wilt not loſe thy expectation, nothing excellent thou
doſt expect, conſidering the weakneſs and ſhallowneſs of
the Preacher, how ſhouldst thou; yet if thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Prejudice in thy heart againſt him, from that
contemnable apprehenſions thou and others have of that
he is not wholly without hopes, but that ſome ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
thou mayſt gain hereby; Let the conſideration of
the ſubject prevail upon thee, however to give it the
reading; 'tis, you hear, a Summons to the Grave:
thou canſt never hear too often of death; and ſure this
Sermon will not offend thee, if thou art one that doſt live,
<pb facs="tcp:46869:5"/>
I mean, live indeed, in the ſight and ſtedfaſt belief of a
future life, an eternity of happineſs or miſery; I have
read, that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> commanded one of
his Pages to awake him every Morning and call aloud
to him, <hi>Sir, remember you are a man:</hi> This great
Monarch did not diſdain to be rouzed every day from
ſleep with the News of death, though it was but by the
Mouth of his poor ſorry Page, and ſhall any of us ſlight
the Meſſage, through want of affection to the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but perhaps, thou mayſt be one that likes neither,
may be thou doſt not care to hear of the tidings of dying,
and art ready to judge them melancholy fools that break
their ſleep about it; Theſe who are indeed prepared for
it, have no cauſe to be diſquieted in thoughts of it; but
what wilt thou do when death comes, that haſt a guilty
conſcience; have you not heard of that poor ſoul, who
cried out in horrour and diſtreſs of ſpirit upon his
death-bed, <hi>O what ſhall I do, I am ſo ſick that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live, and yet ſo unprepared that I dare not die:</hi>
Remember, that the thoughts of death, when it comes,
will abate thy courage, 'twill make the proudeſt heart to
ſtoop; 'Tis a pretty Paſſage that I remember of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who being on a time very ſad,
his Brother (a Jolly Courtier) would needs know what
ailed him, <hi>O Brother</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I have bin a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
againſt God and I know not how to die, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before God in Judgment;</hi> Theſe are (ſaid his
Brother) melancholy thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>, and withal made a Jeſt
at them; the King replied nothing for the preſent
but the cuſtom of the Countrey was, that if the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
<pb facs="tcp:46869:5"/>
came and ſounded his Trumpet before any mans
door, he was preſently to be led out to the Place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
the King in the dead time of the Night, ſends
the Headſman to ſound his Trumpet before his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
door, who hearing it, and ſeeing the Meſſenger of
death, ſprings in pale and trembling into the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
beſeeching him to tell him wherein he had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
O Brother (replied the King) you have never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
me, and is this Executioner ſo dreadful, and
ſhall not I that have greatly and grievouſly offended
God, fear to be brought before the Judgement Seat of
Chriſt; Death amazes none more when it comes, as it
doth them who think not of it; the <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſed to
carry about the Table a Deaths Head at their Feaſts;
'tis good in the midſt of all our delights and enjoyments,
to be put in minde of the Grave; And if this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſpake no more power fully to thee then a Deaths-Head
to awaken thee, it may be worth thy Pains to
read it, God may bleſs weak endeavors to great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
Jeſus Chriſt could make five Barley leaves and
two Fiſhes to feed five thouſand men, and yet the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that were left might ſaetiſfie many a poor hungry
ſoul: what though thou art afterly ſerved, God can heat
it by his Spirit, God can make it wholeſom food for thy
ſoul: if thou haſt but an appetite I do not much fear
thy reliſhing of it, for though the full ſtomack loaths the
Honey-comb, yet to the hungry ſoul every bitter thing
is ſweet.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I would not weary thee, I ſhall only now
give thee a ſummary Account of the particular things
<pb facs="tcp:46869:6"/>
inſiſted upon, and then commit thee to God.</p>
            <p>1. Thou haſt the certainty of Death amplified, or
brieftly enlarged upon.</p>
            <p>2. Some awaking Conſiderations and Motives to a
ſpeedy and effectual Preparation for it.</p>
            <p>3. Several Directions and Cautions in order to it.</p>
            <p>4. You have dying Miniſters lamented, or ſeveral
ſad grounds of Lamentation upon that account.</p>
            <p>5. Then fifthly and laſtly, you have comfort againſt
Death, or how true Chriſtians may ſtay and ſupport
themſelves in the hour of death, or in parting with godly
relations: and becauſe nothing is more effectual in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this, then that comfortable aſſurance of preſent
enjoyment, or being with Chriſt at that very inſtant,
when the breath leaves us; ſomthing was offered to
confirm the ſouls immortality, it was but a little which
was ſaid, had it been more it would not have bin too
much: It was not delivered as it is matter of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
to grieve any who are differently perſwaded: but
as 'tis matter of comfort, ſuiting with the occaſion, that
ſo ſorrowful ſpirits might be conſolated, having for
ſeveral years found the uſefulneſs and ſweetneſs of the
doctrine under the like diſpenſation my ſelf: What is
more plainly laid down in holy Scripture then this: and
thoſe Arguments that ſo much eſtabliſh me in the
beleef hereof are many, one is taken from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
own words, Becauſe man cannot kill the ſoul <hi>Mat.
10. 28.</hi> If men cannot kill it then 'tis not mortal: As alſo
the conſideration of its nature being ſpirit, might I not
reaſon thus, If the noble part of man ſomtimes called
<pb facs="tcp:46869:6"/>
ſoul be ſpirit, then 'tis immortal: but 'tis called ſpirit
in ſeveral places: and again, doth not the name of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
declare its nature: a ſpirit in its nature is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and its very eſſence is life, if it ſhould ceaſe to
live, if would be ſpirit no more. Thirdly, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſhews, that at death the body goes one way, and
the ſpirit goes another, namely, to God that gave it:
we may judge alſo of the nature of the ſpirit or ſoul of
man, if we conſider how nothing but God himſelf can
ſatisfie it, lives upon divine and immortal food, and
therefore ſure muſt be of like nature: what does ſhew
more clearly that our bodies are earthly, or made of earth,
as the conſideration of their being fed, and ſuſtained
from the earth, ſo ſay I on the contrary hand in reſpect
of the ſoul; 'tis ſed with ſpiritual and immortal food,
<hi>ergo</hi> ſuch is its nature; but not to trouble you with

            </head>
            <p>I Need not tell you the ground
and occaſion of this preſent
Meeting; Certain I am this is
a ſorrowful Aſſembly: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I am fit to preach or no I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, but ſure I am ripe to
mourn. May I not on this occaſion
uſe the words of <hi>David</hi> upon <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s
death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 38. <hi>Know ye
not that there is a Prince and a great
man fallen this day in Iſrael?</hi> Who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46869:13"/>
more worthy of honour than thoſe
God confers honour upon (and to
be employed as Chriſts Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors)
to treat in his ſtead with poor
ſinners about their eternal eſtate
and condition, is no ſmall dignity;
and to be deprived of ſuch a one,
what greater ground for grief and
mourning? But not to take up
your time in a way of Introduction,
I ſhall commend to you that portion
of holy Scripture, which ſhall be
the ground of my preſent diſcourſe;</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Pſal. 89. 48.</bibl> What man is he
that liveth, and ſhall not ſee
death? Shall he deliver his
ſoul from the hand of the
grave? Selah.</q>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt in the verſes that
doth precede is pleading with God
under great afflictions and the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of Gods face, upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the ſhortneſs of his dayes:
<hi>How long wilt thou hide thy ſelf? for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46869:13"/>
ever ſhall thy wrath burn like fire?</hi> and
ver. 47. <hi>Remember how ſhort my time
is;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Lord I have
but a little while to live, my time
on earth is ſhort; let me therefore
enjoy thy favor: let the remainder
of my dayes (the days of my pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage)
be good dayes: Let me ſee
thy face, have the light of thy
countenance; let them not be dayes
of ſorrow and darkneſs. From hence
note this, That a gracious ſoul,
whilſt on earth, deſires nothing
more than the enjoyment of Gods
favor. Communion with God is the
onely thing his ſoul longs and
breaths after. They having a ſenſe
of the ſhortneſs of their dayes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to live well and to make good
improvement of their time: They
would not onely have the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God hereafter, but a ſight
of his preſence and favour whilſt
here. And indeed thoſe who would
live with God in heaven, muſt firſt
live to God on earth. Now it is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46869:14"/>
not thus with the unregenerate, if
wicked men have a ſight of the
ſhortneſs of their lives, it hath not
this effect upon their hearts; they
many times the more purſue their
luſts: they endeavor to get as much
pleaſure as they can, and to gratifie
their covetous, ambitious, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
appetites, and ſuck out what
ſweetneſs they can out out of this
periſhing world; they reſolve to have
it as ſweet as outward enjoyments
can make it; they know no higher
or better good then what is earthly
and ſenſual. Oh miſerable decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Creatures, how is their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
darkened, having never
attained a ſaving knowledge of
God, nor ſpiritual reliſh of his grace
and love, nor a ſight of his favour
and kindneſs towards them. They
are dreadfully involved in Egyptian
darkneſs, they are ignorant of the
ſatisfaction, joy and ſweetneſs that
is in him; hence they cry not after
God, nor ſeek after him here, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46869:14"/>
they might be made happy with
him hereafter.</p>
            <p>But that I may come to the
words that I have read to you, in
the Text you have a twofold Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
or Negative Queſtions.</p>
            <p>1. What man is he that liveth and
ſhall not ſee death?</p>
            <p>2. Can he deliver his ſoul from
the power of the grave? Selah.</p>
            <p>The meaning is no man can avoid
it, none can eſcape the grave, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be. Many ſuch kind of
queſtions are put forth and thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in Holy Scripture. Here are
two terms, before I proceed to any
obſervation, that I judge needful to
ſpeak to by way of Exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ication:</p>
            <p>Firſt, What is meant by the word
<hi>ſoul</hi> in this place? Doth the ſoul go
to the grave? I anſwer, <hi>Soul</hi> in
holy Scripture bears divers accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
ſometimes by it is intended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46869:15"/>
one thing, ſometimes another; and
from hence I judge it is, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſons miſs in their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
about the noble and ſuperiour
part of the Creature.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By it is intended the whole
man,</hi> Gen. 46. 27. And the ſons of
<hi>Joſeph</hi> which were born him in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
were two ſouls; all the ſouls of the
houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which came into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
were threeſcore and ten ſouls;
<hi>the like you have in</hi> Acts 7. 14. And
<hi>Joſeph</hi> called his father <hi>Jacob</hi> to
him and all his kindred, threeſcore and
fifteen ſouls; <hi>that is ſo many perſons:
in</hi> Acts <hi>27. 37. all that were with</hi>
Paul <hi>in the ſhip, are ſaid to be</hi> two
hundred and threeſcore and ſixteen
ſouls.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>It is taken for the life of the
body,</hi> Pſal. 7. 5. Let the wicked
perſecute my ſoul and take it, yea let
him tread down my life upon the
earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:46869:15"/>
3. It is taken for the affections,
deſire, or heart of the Creature,
<hi>1 Sam. 1. 15. And</hi> Hannah <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſaid, no my Lord, I am a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of a ſorrowful ſpirit; I have
drunk neither wine nor ſtrong drink,
but have poured out my ſoul before the
Lord.</hi> And in chap. 18. it is ſaid,
<hi>the ſoul of</hi> Jonathan <hi>was knit to the
ſoul of</hi> David; that is, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were ſet and faſtened upon him.
In many other places, by ſoul we
find ſome one or more faculty of the
ſoul is intended.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>It is taken for the ſtomach,</hi>
Prov. 27. 7. The full ſoul loatheth
an honey-comb, but to the hungry ſoul
every bitter thing is ſweet.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>By it is meant oftentimes the
noble and ſuperiour part of man, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the body; for this ſee</hi>
Pſal. 19. 7. The law of the Lord is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
converting the ſoul; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28.
Fear not them which can kill the body,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46869:16"/>
               <hi>but are not able to kill the ſoul.</hi> But
probably ſome may ſay, if the word
ſoul hath ſo many various acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how may we know when the
ſpirit or principal part is in Scripture
meant hereby. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay down three or four Rules,
whereby you may know:</p>
            <p>1. When you read of ſoul, as
that wherein couverſion is wrought,
it can intend nothing elſe ſave the
noble or immortal part; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
is a change onely of the evil
qualities of man's better or ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
part; <hi>Pſal. 19. 7. The law of the
Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul.</hi>
Converſion to God changes not the
defects and qualities of the outward
man. If a man be attended with
ſuch and ſuch a diſeaſe, or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
before Converſion, he may be
truly converted, and yet retain the
ſame diſeaſes; the ſame lameneſs,
blindneſs, deafneſs, crookedneſs,
or what ever other blemiſh he may
have of the like nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46869:16"/>
2. When you read of ſoul as that
which rejoyceth in God, delights in
God, longs and thirſts after God,
lives and feeds upon God and Chriſt,
and united to and hath communion
with God, cloathed and adorned with
the holy Spirit; it alwayes holds forth
the glorious ſpirit or ſoul of man: let
me onely direct you to one or two
Scriptures upon this account, <hi>Luke
1. 46. My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord
and my ſpirit rejoyceth in God my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
Pſal. 94. 19. <hi>In the multitude
of my thoughts within me, thy comforts
delight my ſoul.</hi> Pſal. 42. 1, 2. <hi>As the
hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo
panteth my ſoul after thee, O God; my
ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living
God; when ſhall I come and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</hi> Pſal. 73. 26. <hi>My heart and
my fleſh faileth me, but God is the
ſtrength of my ſoul, and my portion for
ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When you read of ſoul, as that
which men cannot kill or deſtroy, is
alwayes intended this excellent part;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46869:17"/>
ſee <hi>Matth. 10. 28. Fear not them that
kill the body but cannot kill the ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Laſtly, When you read of ſoul,
as that which lives when the body
dies, or is commended into the hands
of God at death; you muſt alwayes
take it in thoſe Scriptures for the
ſame.</p>
            <p>6. By ſoul ſometimes is meant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the body diſtinct from the ſpirit or
immortal part; ſee <hi>Joſh. 10. 28, 37.
And the king thereof he utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all the ſouls that were therein;
and they ſmote the king thereof and all
the ſouls that were therein;</hi> and in this
ſenſe ſoul is to be taken in this place.
But that I may proceed, a word to
explain the other term, to wit, <hi>the
hand of the grave.</hi> By hand, beloved,
often in Scripture is meant power,
<hi>Iſa. 50. 2. Is my hand ſhortned, that it
cannot redeem?</hi> that is, Have I loſt
my power to redeem? ſo <hi>Acts 4. 3.</hi>
My Text thus briefly opened, I ſhall
proceed as moſt ſuiting with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46869:17"/>
occaſion, to take notice of one
Doctrinal Truth from the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which take as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That all men muſt die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or thus,</hi> That no man whatſoever,
can eſcape the power of the grave.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, God aſſiſting, endeavor to
demonſtrate and confirm the truth of
this Propoſition. The holy Spirit
doth not ſlightly paſs it by, but puts
a <hi>Remora</hi> to it; <hi>viz.</hi> that Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſignal word <hi>Selah,</hi> which ſhews
us that this word calls for meditation
and our diligent attention; it doth
lay a kind of an arreſt upon our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
not paſſing from it till we have
ſeriouſly weighed the matter. <hi>What
man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee
death?</hi> Death will be too hard for
him, and too powerful to reſiſt; there
is no withſtanding the ſtrength of this
King, he will bring all into ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
he is ſaid in <hi>Rom. 5. 12, 14.</hi> to
reign over all, and ſo he is called the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46869:18"/>
terror of Kings as well as King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
he is ſo to the wicked; and
what King hath as many ſubjects as
Death hath? And that I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
it, conſider Age cannot
reſcue any man from the hand of
Death; the oldeſt man muſt die. All
thoſe that lived before the Flood are
dead. <hi>Methuſelah</hi> lived nine hundred
ſixty nine years, <hi>Gen. 5. 27.</hi> but alaſs
at laſt the words tell you, <hi>and he died;</hi>
he lived near a thouſand years, but at
laſt was forced to ſubject to the
grave.</p>
            <p>2. As the oldeſt man muſt die, ſo
muſt the ſtrongeſt. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was a
mighty man, yet <hi>Sampſon</hi> muſt die.
Death will make the ſtouteſt hearts
to faint, and the ſtrongeſt legs to
tremble. One dieth in his full
ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and
quiet; his breaſts are full of milk
and his bones are moiſtned with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<hi>Job 21. 23, 24.</hi> If any were
likely to encounter or grapple with
Death, we may ſuppoſe that this is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46869:18"/>
the man; he who is in his perfect
ſtrength, free from diſtempers; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by that word, <hi>wholly at eaſe
and quiet:</hi> yet alaſs all will not do,
this man was forced to yield, he is
made Deaths Captive.</p>
            <p>3. The wiſdom and policy of man
cannot deliver from the power of the
grave. The wiſeſt prince that ever
late upon a Throne was forced to
ſtoop to the ſovereign hand of Death.
<hi>Wiſe men die,</hi> faith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the fool,</hi> Pſal. 49. 10. <hi>In death
there is no remembrance of the wiſe
more than the fool,</hi> Eccl. 2. 16. The
moſt grave and politick in all ages of
the world, after all their famous and
deep contrivances, have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by death.</p>
            <p>4. Riches cannot deliver from
Death, if it could we ſhould have
few rich men die; doubtleſs they
would give their all to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the grave: they would
leave but little to Friends or Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
could they but bribe Death
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46869:19"/>
with their Silver and Gold. I have
read of one who would make a tryal,
and ſo called for a Bag of Gold,
when on a Sick-bed, and laid it to
his trembling heart; but preſently
cried out, <hi>Away, away with it; it will
not do.</hi> Oh my Beloved, Riches
will not avail you in the day of wrath,
<hi>Prov. 11. 4.</hi> and as it will not in the
Day of Judgement, ſo it will not in
the hour of Death. The brutiſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
dies and leaves his wealth behind
him, <hi>Pſal. 49. 10.</hi> The Cardinal of
<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who procured the death
of the good Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> in the
Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was
ſhortly after taken with a grievous
Diſeaſe; who underſtanding by his
Phyſicians that he could not live,
murmurring and repining thereat, he
cried out, <hi>(Fie) will not Death be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
Will money do nothing, muſt I
die, that have ſo great riches? If the
whole, Realm would ſave my life, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by policy I can get it, or by riches I
can buy it.</hi> But yet all would not do,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46869:19"/>
the proud Cardinal muſt ſubmit to
death.</p>
            <p>5. As Riches will not deliver from
the power of the grave, ſo likewiſe
earthly power and worldly ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and greatneſs, cannot do it; all
the mighty Potentates and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
the holy Scripture and ancient
Hiſtories acquaint us of, where are
they? hath not Death ſubdued them
all? After all their grandeur and pomp
they were all cut down by Deaths
all-conquering hand, and now their
glory lies in the duſt. <hi>Auguſtus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
one day triumphs in the greatneſs
of his ſtrength, the next day is
ſtabbed to death with Bodkins
<hi>Herod</hi> King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> one hour
is admired as a God, the next hour is
made a Feaſt for Worms, <hi>Acts. 12.
22, 23.</hi> The great Conqueror <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander.</hi>
who ſubdued he greateſt
part of the World, is at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by Death. Death makes no
difference between the King in his
Royalty on the Throne, and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46869:20"/>
Begger in Rags upon the Dunghill
<hi>Alexander</hi> having received 2 wounds
at the ſiege of great City in <hi>India,</hi>
finding himſelf to be ſore wounded,
was in ſome meaſure made ſenſible
of his own fragillty; and cried out
to his <hi>flattering</hi> followers, <hi>You call
me the Son of</hi> Jupi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, but I perceive
<hi>I am ſubject to wounds and death as
well as other men.</hi> Death bringeth
down the loftieſt looks of man. I
have read that in the Library of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
there is a Globe at the one end
and at the other end the picture of
Death, to ſhew that though man
was Lord of the whole Univerſe, i.e
muſt ſubmit to Death. Thus you
ſee that all the pomp and glory of
the world hath been cut down by
the power of the grave. But again,</p>
            <p>6. As Worldly Dignities cannot
deliver from the power of the
Grave, ſo glorious Titles will not
do it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Worthies that God confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
glorious Titles upon, yea ſo far
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46869:20"/>
as to give his own name unto them;
to be called gods. One would think
that this, if any were the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
to exempt a man from the grave,
and yet it will not do, <hi>Pſal. 82. 6, 7.
I have ſaid ye are gods,</hi> but with the
ſame breath adds, <hi>ye ſhall die like
men, and fall like one of the princes.</hi>
But,</p>
            <p>7. Eminency in grace and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
endowments, or divine qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
will not be able to reſcue a
ſoul from the power of the grave.
All the Patriarchs of old they are
gone; where are all thoſe choice and
renowned in grace that we read of,
who ſhined in their day like the ſtars
in the firmament? Oh! where are
thoſe Troops of Iſraelites that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in patience, chaſtity, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
holineſs and humility? theſe
could not deliver themſelves from
death. <hi>The righteous periſh, and no
man layeth it to heart; and merciful
men are taken away: none conſidering
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46869:21"/>
that the righteous are taken away from
the evil to come,</hi> Iſa. 57. 1.</p>
            <p>8. Laſtly, No ſpiritual Dignity,
Office, or Place, can deliver from
the hand of the grave; though a
perſon be never ſo much in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, and honoured by Chriſt
Jeſus; though never ſo laborious for
the good of ſouls, as to be an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
of Peace and Miniſter of the
Goſpel, yet theſe will not exempt
from death: your Fathers where are
they and the Prophets, do they live
for ever? <hi>Zech. 1. 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the Doctrine
made good and confirmed, <hi>That
there is no man living that ſhall not ſee
death, or be able to deliver himſelf
from the power of the grave.</hi> I ſhall
onely give you two or three reaſons
of the point, and ſo proceed to the
Application. If you queſtion why
all muſt die, take two or three things

1. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe all have ſinned.
Sin and Death came into the world
together. Death came by the fall in
the Garden, 'tis part of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to us for that tranſgreſſion;
<hi>Rom. 5. 12. Wherefore as by one man
ſin entred into the world, and death
by ſin, ſo death paſſed upon all men;
for that all have ſinned; the wages of
ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. We may
cry out in the words of a holy man,
<hi>O ſin, ſin, 'tis thou, which by thy juſt
deſerts haſt cauſed all the funerals
that ever have been.</hi> Thus you ſee all
muſt die, becauſe all have ſinned.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that all men muſt die, <hi>Heb. 9.
27. And as it is appointed for men
once to die, and after that to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Though death be natural and
the puniſhment of our ſins, yet we
die by Gods appointment. We let
in death by our ſin, and God cauſeth
death to proceed upon us, to make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46869:22"/>
good the juſtice and ſeverity of his
own threatning. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,
thou wilt bring me to death, to the
houſe appointed for all living,</hi> Job 30.
23. <hi>On the day thou eateſt thereof thou
ſhalt ſurely die; duſt thou art, and to
duſt ſhalt thou return;</hi> Gen. 2. 17.
3. 19.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Laſtly, Why God will
bring all men to the grave; and I
ſhall add no more, Becauſe he would
thereby magnifie his glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;
as firſt out of infinite grace,
commiſeration and goodneſs, he
brings his own children to the grave,
knowing the miſeries, ſad afflictions
and troubles that doth attend them in
this life. Here moſt times poor
Saints, with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> have their
evil things; many are their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and this way God takes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them out of them all. Death
opens a door to glory to every graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſoul; and ſecondly God by death
prepares the bodies of his Saints for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46869:22"/>
eternal bliſs and happineſs. He
brings the body to the grave, that it
may be purified and made a glorious
and moſt amiable body; 'tis ſown,
that it might be raiſed more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43, 44. God
doth with the bodies of his Saints,
with reverence be it ſpoken, as they
do with their Earthen Veſſels in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
they bury them in the earth for
many years, and when they take
them out, the nature and worth of
them is far tranſcendent. 2. The
ungodly muſt die, that God may
magnifie on them his own infinite
Juſtice. Death having ſeized their
body, their ſouls muſt go to its
place, to ſuffer the intollerable pains
and incenſed wrath of the Almighty;
and that their bodies alſo, with their
ſouls, when they ſhall hereafter meet
together again, might he made fit
fuel for eternal flames to kindle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for now as they are in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ſtate they cannot endure the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wrath of God, but would ſoon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46869:23"/>
be freed of all bodily pain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
were they caſt into that
Lake that burns with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Reaſons of the
Point; more might be ſaid, but I
muſt haſten to the application.</p>
            <p>I have onely four Uſes to make of
it, as firſt an Uſe of Exhortation,
ſecondly an Uſe of Direction, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Uſe of Lamentation, fourthly
an Uſe of Conſolation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Exhortation, Is
it ſo Beloved, muſt all men die?
Can none deliver his own ſoul from
the power of the grave? Muſt every
Mothers child of us take up our
Lodging there? Is the dark grave
the appointed houſe for all living?
Shall the proudeſt and loftieſt be
brought down to the duſt? Muſt
that little cool houſe under ground
hold us all? Then poor ſinners ſhall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46869:23"/>
I prevail with you to prepare for
death? Let me exhort you to look
about you and get ready. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
when the Prophet came to good
King <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa. 38. 1.</hi> with that
doleful tidings (as upon ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and circumſtances it might
then appear to that holy man) he
bids him ſet his houſe in order, make
proviſion for eternity: and this is the
meſſage that is brought to you this
day: You muſt die and not live.
And that I might enforce this word
upon you, let me lay before you a
few Motives and awakening Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider what a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and mercy it is that God hath
let you and I live ſo long. Others
are long ago cut down and ſent to
the grave; he hath not it may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
many half of thoſe dayes which
thou haſt had: Look upon this as a
mercy indeed, conſidering thy life
was forfeited before thou wert born.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46869:24"/>
Sirs we came into the World with
the Sentence of death upon us; and if
<hi>Jehovah</hi> had cut us down in our ſins
many years ago, it would have been
but a piece of Juſtice. And what is
the end of God in ſparing of us, but
that we might be fitted for the place
whither we are going. Oh how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
is God to ſtrike the fatal
blow, to cut men down before they
are prepared for death. He is not
willing they ſhould periſh, and that
is the reason of his patience, long-suffering,
and forbearance, ſinners lay it to heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
provocations you and I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him to take us away, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
death in his name to arreſt us.
Have we not grieved, burdened, yea
even wearied him with our iniquities?
Nay, have we not pierced him? May
he not cry out, as being preſſed as a
Cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaves,
<hi>Amos 2. 13.</hi> Is it not a ſad and moſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46869:24"/>
lamentable thing, thus to deal with
a loving and gracious God?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, How often hath the
Lord called you, and yet you have
rebelled? Hath not he ſtretched
out his hand all the day long, and
yet you have not hearkned; but
have rejected his counſel and caſt
his word and reproofs behind you;
yea, and often reſiſted his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the common motions and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
thereof? Have you not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you refuſed his Grace, Son,
and divers ſweet and precious Calls
and Offers of Love. And certain
I am, you have had many of theſe
in this place, Nay, how many
warnings have you had of the near
approach of death? Nay, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
ſummons to prepare for the
grave, as you would anſwer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the dreadful Judge of Heaven
and Earth; by my dear Brother
that is fallen aſleep; whom we ſhall
hear no more? Oh what pains did
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46869:25"/>
he take with ſome of you, that ſo
you might be ready? Have not you
and I notwithſtanding all this hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to a baſe deceitful heart, and
inticeing and tempting Devil? Have
you ſtouted it out againſt all Pains
and Endeavours uſed for Spiritual
awakenings, and are you yet alive?
Then conſider how much this calls
upon you to be ready to die? Will
any dare, that are ſenſible of the
worth of their Immortal Souls, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
this concern any longer?</p>
            <p>4. Conſider, That the abuſe
of Mercy and Goodneſs will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aggravate thy miſery in the day
of wrath: Oh remember what it is
to ſin againſt Light, Love, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Shall the goodneſs of God,
that ſhould lead to repentance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and harden thee in thy ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity?
How doſt thou think to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
the Judgement of God? Or
<hi>deſpiſeſt thou,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle,
<hi>the rich's of his goodneſs, forbearance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46869:25"/>
and long-ſuffering, not knowing that
the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
but aftey thy hardneſs and
impenitent heart treaſureſt up wrath
againſt the day of wrath and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the righteous judgment of God;
who will render to every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his deeds,</hi> Rom. 2. 4. 5, 6.
<hi>Sentence is paſt againſt a ſinner, but
becauſe it is not ſpeedily executed,
therefore the hearts of men are fully
ſet within them to do wickedly,</hi> Eccl.
8. 11. Chriſt knocks at the door
and yet ſinners will not hear. Chriſt
may ſpeak of ſinners as God ſpeaks
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>My people will
have none of me,</hi> Pſal. 81. 11.
Oh what have you to anſwer for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
mercy and favour! What
What will you do hereafter, when
Chriſt, who waits upon you now
to ſave you, will then turn his face
from you in the day of your calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and plead againſt you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
you? ſee <hi>Prov. 1. 28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:46869:26"/>
5. Consider for Chriſts ſake of
thoſe advantages you have had and
ſtill have: If ſome had the like, we
may conclude they would have made
better uſe and improvement of them
then ſome of you have done. Hath
not God afforded you the Goſpel
beyond what he hath to divers parts
of the world? Nay, what a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and powerful miniſtration of it
hath there been continued for ſome
time in this place? You have had
helps above thouſands, God hath
taken much pains with you that
have attended upon the word here.
Where God gives many talents, he
requires the improvement of them;
what will become of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and
<hi>Capernaum</hi> in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And hath not Gods ſpirit
ſtriven with you alſo? Nay, and
hath not Conſcience endeavoured
to awaken you? Have you not
had Summons and Calls from
thence? Hath not that often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46869:26"/>
you for neglect of Seaſons,
flighting of Sermons, and indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your ſelves in iniquity and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
luſts and omiſſions of duty?
Oh! how many ſharp checks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
have you had from within?
Nay, and beſides all this, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening
Judgements to prepare
for the grave, have you and I had;
dreadful Plague, Fire and Sword:
and what further means could God
make uſe of in an ordinary way for
allarming and ſtirring of us up to
prepare for our change, aud turning
of our ſouls to himſelf, and fitting
of us for Eternity? And ſhall none
of theſe work upon you? Shall all
means fail? Shall the Goſpel be
preached in vain? Shall Miniſters
ſpend their ſtudy, their breath, nay
their ſtrength, to no purpoſe:
what will you do then in the end?</p>
            <p>6. Do you know that you ſhall
have all theſe helps continued to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46869:27"/>
you? Will God ſtill ſuffer his holy
Spirit to ſtrive with you? Alaſs,
Death may ſoon have Commiſſion
to ſeize you and carry you into the
other world; but ſhould you live,
are you ſure God will ſtill wait upon
you: upon ſuch rebels, who have
ſlighted and undervalued his Grace,
Son, and Goſpel? Sirs, I muſt tell
you, alluding to that in <hi>Geneſis 6.</hi>
which hath often been upon my
heart; that the bleſſed Spirit ſhall
not alwayes ſtrive with man: Means
and advantages are like to be taken
away. God ere long may ſay to
Conſcience, Be ſtill, reprove that
man, that woman no more: You
may be left to commit wickedneſs
without remorſe or trouble. God
may give you up to a hardened and
ſordid heart, to a ſeared and filthy
Conſcience, yea, and refuſe in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to afflict you any more; ſee <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea
4. 14.</hi> May not he that hath
taken away a Miniſter, an able one,
a ſweet and precious Labourer, take
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46869:27"/>
away ere long a ſweet and precious
Goſpel; and what will become of
your ſouls then?</p>
            <p>7. Do you know for certain the
Goſpel ſhall be continued to this
Land? Be you ſure you ſhall hear
the joyful ſound? Let me tell you
my thoughts freely, though I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to a ſpirit of Propheſie;
yet mark what follows: I tremble
to think what is coming upon us as
a puniſhment of our ſins. I fear,
Beloved, the Goſpel is a going.
<hi>Ephraim</hi> hath grey hairs here and
there, though he know it not; and
grey hairs are a ſign that our morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or beſt days are gone; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they commonly bring a wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
face, or a decay of Beauty;
our goodneſs, like <hi>Ephraims,</hi> are
even like the morning dew: thirdly,
they bring feebleneſs, or a decay of
ſtrength: fourthly, they ſhew that
death and mortality draws near.
We have heard, ſome of us, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46869:28"/>
he was grey a great while ago; I
doubt he is white, by this time.
There are ſad ſymptomes upon us,
I know not how ſoon we may have
cauſe to cry <hi>Ichabod,</hi> becauſe the
glory is departed. Are we not in
danger to be over-ſpread with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
Confuſion, and Darkneſs; for
if the Goſpel ſhould continue, and
Gods people reſolve to do their
beſt, by their prayers and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of it, to hold it faſt; yet are
you ſure you ſhall have Miniſters to
prcach unto you? Many have been
taken of late away, and one at this
time before your eyes is gone, a
faithful and able one; whom now
you ſhall hear no more. But ſhould
there be Miniſters and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
yet you may be left to your
ſelves, to ripen for Hell and ruin?
Nay, Is not Chriſt already crying
over you, as he did over <hi>Jeruſalem;
Oh that thou hadſt known in this thy
day the things that belongeth to thy
peace; but now they are hid from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46869:28"/>
eyes;</hi> Luke 19. 42. Oh that theſe
things might take hold and touch
your Conſcicnces.</p>
            <p>8. Conſider of the ſhortneſſ and
uncertainty of your dayes? Alas,
what is your life, you know not
how ſoon death may come and
knock at your doors, or look in at
your windows? It may be ſome of
you have had many years, but this
conſider of, you know not how few
the reſt may be behind; you have no
promiſe from God, no leaſe or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that you have one year more;
where hath God told you that you
ſhall? nay one half year? You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
aſſure your ſelf you ſhall have
one month, no not one week, no
not one day. You may be ſtricken
by death before you return home.
<hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of too morrow, for
thou knoweſt not what a day may bring
forth,</hi> Pro. 27. 1. Many that are
young, hope that they may have
many years; the child thinks to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46869:29"/>
a youth, and the youth to be a
man, and a man till he is full of
dayes: But alaſs, they conſider
not how brittle they are; they do
not lay to heart the uncertainty of
their lives. <hi>David</hi> deſired to know
his end and the meaſure of his days,
<hi>that he might know how frail he
was,</hi> Pſal. 39. 4, 5. Many do not
take a right meaſure of their dayes,
they meaſure not by a lawful Rule.
What ſay ſome, my Father and
Grandfather lived to a good old
age, and I hope to attain to their
years. Others meaſure by their
preſent health; they are not diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
nor ſickly; but of a good health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Conſtitution: but alaſs, this is
no ſure Rule, thou mayeſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this be quickly in
the grave; ſuch ſometimes death
makes to ſtoop on a ſudden, they
go many times before ſickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Others meaſure their dayes
by their preſent ſtrength, they fear
not death upon that account; yet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46869:29"/>
they die as you have heard; though
wholly at eaſe: theſe do not go by
the Kings Standard neither. Let
me tell you what is a right and true
meaſure for your dayes, account
them then by the morning dew and
flower of the field. <hi>Man that is born
of a woman,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>Job, is but
of few dayes; he cometh forth like a
flower and is cut down: and flieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
like a ſhadow and continueth not.</hi>
Job 14. 12. Naturaliſts tells us of
a plant that laſts but for a day, this
plant thou or I may be. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
hath obſerved that the Roſe
grows old in its very budding. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, that
came up in a night and periſhed in
a night. Nothing fades ſooner than
a flower, oh meaſure thy dayes by
that and by the vapour that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for a little while and then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
away; the Spiders Web,
the Swift Poſt, the Weavers Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or a Ship under ſail. Perſons
never ſo rich or great, never ſo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46869:30"/>
beautiful, never ſo weak of ſtrong,
wiſe or fooliſh, vertuous or vicious,
as thou haſt heard muſt die. May
not the thoughts of this move thee
to a preparedneſs for the grave?</p>
            <p>9. Conſider how you have loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
hitherto and loſt much of
your precious time which God hath
lent you to prepare for the grave.
Upon the improvement of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
time doth your eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
depend, and if it be ſquander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away, what will become of your
immortal and never dying ſouls?
If a man hath much work to do,
work of the weightieſt concern that
muſt be done, or the man undone:
buſineſs that would take up all his
day, and it ſhould ſo fall out that
he had loſt the morning, nay above
half his day; would it not concern
him to ſet about the work with all
his might, ſo as if poſſible to do
two hours works in one; leſt the
Sun go down before the work is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46869:30"/>
               <hi>Redeem the time, becauſe
the days are evil,</hi> Eph. 5. 16. Alas
Sirs, are not the ſhadows of the
evening upon ſome of you? the
Lord help you to lay it to heart.
Do not think the whole work of
your lives can be done upon a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bed. Oh conſider Old age is
unfit for labour, and it is folly with
a witneſs to think 'tis time enough
to ſow when thou ſhouldeſt reap.
Delays proves the ruin of many
thouſands; <hi>The night cometh,</hi> ſaith
Chriſt, <hi>when no man can work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. And laſtly, Conſider what
will become of your precious ſouls,
if death takes you before you are
ready; for it will not ſtay for you:
Will he be bribed or perſwaded to
come another time? I remember a
young Maid in the Countrey that
was ſick, and as ſhe grew near her
end, ſhe cried out to be ſpared one
quarter of a year, one month; but
when that would not be granted;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46869:31"/>
rather than fail, one week: but die
ſhe did, greedy death will have no
denial. Oh what a ſad ſight is it
to ſee a Chriſtleſs ſoul a dying!
When death ſits upon your trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
lips, and you not prepared,
what would you give for peace and
pardon then? When pale death
comes upon thee like a ſturdy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant,
and doth arreſt thee in the
name of the great King of Heaven
and Earth, he will hale you along;
to priſon you muſt go. Death
comes upon a wicked man like a
hungry Lyon, tearing their ſouls
from their bodies; to ſuch he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the King of Terrors: He
comes on them like a fiery Serpent,
with his venomous ſting; with
which he wounds them and lays
them a bleeding to all Eternity.
Oh to have the ſoul dragged out
of the body and caſt into hell, is
of a dreadful and amazing Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
With this I ſhall conclude
the Uſe of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:46869:31"/>
The next is an uſe of Direction
to poor ſinners and all others that
would be prepared for the grave, if
this be ſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Doth not ſome poor ſoul
hear ſay, Oh what ſhall I do that
I may be prepared for the grave?
Have you a heart, a mind, a deſire
indeed to be fitted for that hour?
Then in the firſt place labour to get
a full ſight and ſenſe of your ſins,
and of your loſt and undone conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by nature. Oh what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creature hath ſin made man,
or rather man by ſin made himſelf?
That muſt needs be the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
that deprives man of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
good. God is mans chief good,
ſin deprives man of this good; ſin
makes man hated or God, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
man to reſemble Satan; who
is the oppoſite of God. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mind is enmity againſt God,
this enmity muſt be removed, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46869:32"/>
a man be born again, he cannot
ſee the Kingdom of God, John 3. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Labour to get Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
of heart, oh ſtrive to melt
in the ſight and ſenſe of your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Sinner what haſt thou done,
wilt thou ſin away thy mercies, ſin
away thy Miniſters? Gods hand is
lifted up, we are under ſore rebukes
of the Almighty, though I fear
few are ſenſible that it is the fruit of
their tranſgreſſions. May we not ſay
with the Prophet, <hi>No man repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him of his wickedneſs, ſaying,
What have I done?</hi> Jer. 8. 6. God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
and looks for tears of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>A broken and a contrite heart
is a ſacrifice that he will not deſpiſe.</hi>
If you are not broken in the ſenſe
of the odious and abominable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſin, broken into pieces now,
you are like to be broken with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
under the weight of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereafter. Oh! Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be ſmitten and broken in a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46869:32"/>
way of mercy, in order to healing;
then to be broken in a way of
wrath and judgement, when there
will be no help nor cure for you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Labour so get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in Jeſus Chriſt. Oh that this
opportunity might have ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
this way! <hi>Unleſs ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that I am he,</hi>ſaith <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt, you ſhall die in your ſins.</hi>
Soul never reſt and be ſatisfied, till
thou canſt ſay with <hi>Thomas, My
Lord and my God,</hi> John 20. 28.
Can you ſtill ſtand it out againſt
ſuch precious patience and offers of
grace? Will you not yet open to
Chriſt? Shall he call and cry to
you and will you give him no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment?
Can you cloſe in
with a better friend? How long
hath he ſtood knocking at the doors
of your hearts? Was he not graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
calling upon you the laſt
Lords day? and now in mercy he is
giving you another knock. Oh
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46869:33"/>
fear leſt he depart! Is he not ready
to take his farewell of you? Have
you not let him ſtand till his <hi>head
was wet with the dew, and his locks
with the drops of the night?</hi> Sinner,
ſinner, haſten to him, and open
the door, do'ſt not hear that love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
voice that was ſpoken to the
blind man, <hi>Be of good comfort, riſe,
he calleth thee,</hi> Mark 10. 49. It
may be you will ask where? I'll
tell thee, if thou art a weary and
burdened ſoul, that feeleſt the
weight of thy ſin, there is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
word ſpoken for thy ſake, take
hold of it; <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come
unto me all you that are weary and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
laden, and I will give you reſt;
take my yoke upon you, and learn of
me, for I am meek and lowly in
heart; and you ſhall find reſt for your
ſouls.</hi> Oh the ſweetneſs of that
word, take it and receive it down.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Labour in the ſtrength
of Chriſt to oppoſe every ſin. See
that there be no ſweet morſel hid,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46869:33"/>
no <hi>Dalilah,</hi> no pleaſant nor profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
luſt ſpared. O cry with <hi>David,
Search me, O Lord, and try my heart;
prove me, and know my thoughts;
Pſal. 139. 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Take heed you do not
ſin againſt Light. Neglect no
Conviction either of Sin or Duty,
if you would be prepared for the
grave: <hi>Then ſhall I not, ſaith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
be aſhamed, when I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to all thy commandments;</hi>
Pſal. 119. 6.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Never be ſatisfied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
you have all your ſins ſubdued.
Sin muſt be crucified, or the ſoul
muſt die, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. To this I
might add (for I cannot enlarge)
make it your buſineſs alſo to get
your ſins pardoned; ſo that you
may have the feeling ſenſe of the
forgiveneſs of them in your own
hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:46869:34"/>
Seventhly, Labour after a pure
Conſcience. What will ſtand your
ſouls in greater ſtead, when you
come to die than this? <hi>Paul</hi>'s great
care and endeavour was, to keep a
<hi>Conſcience void of offence towards
God and toward men,</hi> Acts 24. 16.
I muſt tell you, An accuſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
will be a bad Death-bed
Companion. I remember what
our dear Friend ſpake to me in the
time of his Sickneſs. <hi>Oh Brother,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>a good conſcience is the beſt
refuge.</hi> That was his rejoycing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
to that Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.
<hi>the teſtimony of his conſcience, that
in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity; not
with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace
of God he had his converſation in the
world.</hi> It matters not who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us, if Conſcience doth not?
Conſcience, as I told ſome of you
lately, will be your beſt friend; if
a friend, a friend indeed, a friend in
adverſity; a friend at death, and a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46869:34"/>
friend in the day of judgement. Oh
what would ſome men give for ſuch
a friend? But if Conſtience be an
enemy, he is the worſt of enemies.
Conſcience is a ſecret enemy, an
enemy that is privy to all we have
done; he knows all our thoughts,
yea thoſe ſecret luſts and evils, that
lie in our hearts; and he will not be
flattered. He will tell the truth
and all the truth. Conſcience will lay
all open in the dreadful day of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
before Angels and Men, <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 15. Holy <hi>Job</hi> reſolved to hold
his integrity faſt and not to let it
go; his heart ſhould not reproach
him as long as he lived, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 5,
6. Sincerity of heart and a good
conſcience will be a good ſanctuary
at the hour of death. The Lord
help you to lay theſe things to
heart. I might give you more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
which I am forced to omit,
becauſe of time. Onely this, if
thou wouldſt be prepared for the
grave, take this one, which was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46869:35"/>
not then delivered; which I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
I did omit.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Beware of reſting in the form of
godlineſs without the power. 'Tis an eaſie thing
to conform to the outward part of Religion; to
take up Ordinances and come into Churches: but
oh what will become of the fooliſh Virgins. Sinners
in <hi>Zion</hi> ere long will be afraid, and fearfulneſs will
ſurprize the hypocrites. Many of you heard thoſe
excellent ſoal-ſearching Sermons of your dear Paſtor
now deceaſed on 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that you would labour to call them to mind!
and thoſe upon a well-ordered Converſation; from
<hi>Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>50.</hi> and the laſt verſe. What pains did he
take with you, that you might not deceive your
ſelves and miſs at laſt of eternal life? I think there
was never more formality amongſt Chriſtians and
carnality amongſt Profeſſors in the Churches, than
in theſe dayes: No marvel if God bring a day of
dreadful tryals and afflictions upon us, that thoſe
that are approved, may be made manifeſt. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſranners, for God is a coming forth to refine his
people; <hi>he will ſearch</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with candles;</hi>
Zeph. 1. 12. And woe to them that are at eaſe in
Zion; however you appear now to men, your ſins ere
long will find you out.</p>
            <p>I now muſt come to the third
Uſe, which muſt be an Uſe of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
and indeed I know not
well how to enter upon it, my heart
is full. Is it ſo? Muſt all die? Can
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46869:35"/>
none deliver their own ſouls from
the power of the grave? Muſt
Husbands die, dear Husbands?
Muſt Fathers die, yea tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Muſt Friends, our deareſt
Friends die? Miniſters, nay, our
choice and godly Paſtors, muſt they
die too? Oh greedy Death! oh
cruel Tirant! Oh that ever we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned!
This may well be for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.
<hi>Samuel</hi> died, and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
made great Lamentations for
him. Your <hi>Samuel</hi> is gone, but
no asking for him again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come. In <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 2. it is ſaid
<hi>Devout men carried</hi> Stephen <hi>to his
burial, and made great lamentation
over him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O ſpare me a little, you have
loſt one who laboured to do the
work of his generations in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Let me lay down ſome
grounds that we have for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:46869:36"/>
1. Oh it's grievous to looſe a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Preacher, a Paſtor, a faithful
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer. 'Tis a day of Mourning,
my ſoul as well as yours is full. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
there is but few of them! We
have need of more, and Lord do'ſt
thou take away theſe we have?</p>
            <p>2. But if any ſhould ſay we have
many yet left behind, I muſt ſay
not many ſuch, who make it their
main work and buſineſs to bring
ſouls to Jeſus Chriſt. There are
but few who naturally care for the
Flock: Few preach Chriſt for
Chriſts ſake, that are willing to
ſpend and be ſpent for his Name
ſake; like our dear Brother, now
with the Lord. May I not ſay with
<hi>Paul,</hi> ſome preach Chriſt out of
envy, and ſome of ſtrife; onely
with this variation, Are there not
many who preach Jeſus Chriſt not
ſincerely, but have ſelf and ſiniſter
ends at the bottom. But to leave
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46869:36"/>
that, however, if God proceed and
go on after this rate to take our
Preachers away, there will be few
enough ere long.</p>
            <p>3. You have not onely loſt a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
a Shepherd, a tender one,
but you have loſt a Father. Many
of you muſt follow your Father this
day to the grave. You have many
Inſtructors in Chriſt, yet not many
Fathers. He hath been an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
through the Word and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of the Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
to beget many of you to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. May you not cry out
with <hi>Eliſha</hi> when <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken
up from him, <hi>My father, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the horſemen of Iſrael and the
chariots thereof; and he ſaw him no
more,</hi> 2 Kings 2. 12. He is now
gone, you will hear him no more,
ſee him no more. This golden
Trumpet is now ſtopped, you will
hear it ſound no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:46869:37"/>
4. Conſider the time in which
God hath taken him away, when the
harveſt is white, or when the fields
are ripe to harveſt; when many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are ready to be brought in to
Jeſus Chriſt. The loſs is great, oh
how ſhall it be repaired? How ſhall
the harveſt be gathered in, when
the chief Labourer in this field is
gone?</p>
            <p>5. Miniſters are and fitly may be
compared to Pilots; the Church to
a Ship paſſing through a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Ocean, amongſt many Rocks
and Sands; and when ſuch die, how
ſhall the poor Marriners ſteer, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
conſidering the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and grievous ſtormes that do
now appear: is not this a ground
of lamentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>6. Miniſters are compared to
Shepheards, that are to keep the
flock and watch over them to take
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46869:37"/>
care of the tender lambs; and let
me tell you, ravenous wolves are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
yea and the cunning Fox,
nay as crafty Foxes as ever were in
the world; and the Shepherd being
gone, may we not fear that which
will follow; is not the flock in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be ſcattered.</p>
            <p>7. Miniſters of the Goſpel may
be compared to Captains, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us in our ſpiritual warfare, and
now alas your Leader is gone, he
is taken from you, and are we not
ſurrounded with enemies? May we
not ſay with <hi>Leah</hi> in another caſe,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 11. <hi>a troop cometh;</hi> a troop
of troubles, a troop of afflictions, a
troop of temptations, a troop of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
and persecutions; I wiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
not a troop of diviſion to the
ſcattering of us: the Lord I hope
will prevent it.</p>
            <p>8. Miniſters of the Goſpel are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to Trees, <hi>the trees of the Lord
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46869:38"/>
are full of ſap.</hi> Pſal. 104. 16. <hi>the
lip of the righteous feed many</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Solomon;</hi> and this was a fruitful
tree. Oh the ſweet fruit it did
bear, moſt precious fruit it yielded
us for many years. Oh what good
have many gathered out of the
branches thereof. But now alas it
is (<hi>cut down</hi>) it will bear fruit for
you no more; you ſhall hear him
pray no more, preach no more,
and is not this a ground of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>9. Saints and Miniſters of the
Goſpel are the intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
City, or Place where they
live. Was not <hi>Lot</hi> the intereſt of
<hi>Sodom? I cannot do any thing till
thou be come thither,</hi> Gen. 19. 22.
Till <hi>Lot</hi> was gone, fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
could not come upon that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
City. Oh what love hath
God to the poor Preachers of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.
But again, Was not
<hi>Jacob</hi> the intereſt of <hi>Labans</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46869:38"/>
How did God bleſs him for
<hi>Jacobs</hi> ſake? The like might be
minded of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the <hi>Egyptians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Ye,</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>are the
light of the world and the ſalt of the
earth.</hi> To whom did he ſpeak but
to his Diſciples, his holy Apoſtles,
that he ſent forth to preach glad
tydings of great joy unto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
I might ſhew you wherein
they are the intereſt of the place
where they are, but I muſt haſten:
Take onely two or three brief
hints.</p>
            <p>1. They ſtand in the gap or in
the breach. Ours is a great one,
the Lord look upon us. They
plead with God: When <hi>Moſes</hi>
hands are up <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevails, and
when he lets down his hands <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi>
Prevails, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11. Oh
how doth he cry out for a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
generation. When <hi>Jehovah</hi>
cries, <hi>Let me alone, that I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them, Exod.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46869:39"/>
               <hi>Joſhua, what wilt thou do for thy
great name? If thou wilt not forgive
their ſin, ſaith Moſes, blot me out of
thy Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to make of him a great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet he ſtill lifts up a cry for
them, <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 32. 10, 11, 32.</p>
            <p>2. They are the intereſt of the
Nation where they are, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling,
warning, and admoniſhing.</p>
            <p>3. By their holy and exemplary
converſations. <hi>Except the Lord of
hoſts had left unto us a very ſmall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
we ſhould have been as</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<hi>and ſhould have been like unto</hi>
Gomorrah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>10. Ground of Lamentation, is
becauſe ſin uſually is the cauſe why
God removes his faithful Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.
He ſends to treat with ſinners
about the concerns of their ſouls.
I wish this ſtroke be not in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſome of your ſouls. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46869:39"/>
Meſſage they bring is often ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and thereby ſinners ſlight and
reject the King himſelf. They cry
and lift up their voice like a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
fore-warning of danger; but
none lays it to heart. They ſpend
their ſtrenght and weaken their
bodies for the good of ſinners ſouls;
but ſinners ſlight it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, if
they ſhould ſweat drops of blood
it would not do, it would not work
in them remorſe of Conſcience and
repentance unto life. Well, ſaith
God, now I'll wait upon thee no
more, him that you deſpiſed and
contemned, or neglected to hear,
or whoſe counſel you did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
you ſhall hear no more. The

               </gap> of faithful Preachers is
one of the greateſt judgement that

ſinners, but a punishment upon
Professors and Church Members<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
their inquiry; they may not prize
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46869:40"/>
the mercy nor walk worthy of the
bleſſing. They may not carry it
as they ought to do to the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
that is amongſt them: They may
grieve and wound his heart by their
diſorderly walking; and God may
from hence be provoked to take him
a way. Nay they may on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand overvalue him, they may
idolize their Teachers and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them above what is meet;
though ſinful, yet 'tis poſſible to
eye man more than God by man.
God may remove them. Upon this
account the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome
that had mens perſons in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I am ſatisfied there is too
great extreams in the world. We
ſhould have a care we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Truth for the ſake of a
man, or to pleaſe men, becauſe
ſuch and ſuch ſays it; but out of
Love to Jeſus Chriſt, and becauſe
God hath commanded it. Beloved,
it may not be amiſs to lay theſe
things to heart, 'tis good to hear
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46869:40"/>
the Rod and to know who it is, and
for what it is appointed. I do not
charge any in particular.</p>
            <p>11. And laſtly, Here is cauſe of
lamentation, becauſe evil and dark
dayes many times follows the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of Gods Worthies. When God
take away ſo many faithful ones,
what may we expect to look for. I
might give
divers inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the ſad
effects, or
what hath
followed the
taking god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſons &amp;
ſincere La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> gives us ſeveral inſtances how the death of the righteous hath been the Fore-runner of ſad and lamentable Judgements: Begins with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſelah</hi> before the Flood, whoſe very name was very ſignificant upon this account. Alſo I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met with a Sermon of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſter in <hi>New England</hi> that was preached ſometimes before their late calamities and miſeries broke forth there, and amongſt their other ſigns of approaching judgement, that he ſeemed to be very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of, he minds that of the dropping away of many holy and godly perſons. Oh how many able and godly preachers and others have we loſt in a ſhort ſpace? We may look upon it as one ſad ſign or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of approaching evil.</note>. But
I am afraid I
have been
too tedious
already, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46869:41"/>
               <hi>Prophet ſaith,</hi> The righteous peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,
and no man layeth it to heart;
Merciful men are taken away; and
none conſidering that the righteous is
taken away from the evil to come.
Iſa. <hi>57. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much by way of Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Conſolation.</p>
            <p>I have onely one Uſe more, which
ſhall be in the fourth place by way
of Comfort and Conſolation.</p>
            <p>1. Muſt all dye, the godly as
well as the wicked? Is the Grave
the place prepared for all Living?
Muſt Fathers, Husbands, Wives,
Children, Miniſtres, and the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Friends we have dye? How ſhall
we then comfort our ſelves againſt
death? If thou art a Beleiver, I
I have a word of comfort for thee;
there is none I am ſure for Chriſtleſs
Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:46869:41"/>
2. Conſider death cannot hurt
thee; it cannot hurt thoſe that are
Believers, becauſe it hath loſt his
ſting. Death may hiſs but cannot
hurt: Nothing makes death terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to an ungodly man but it's
Sting. <hi>The ſting of death is ſin,</hi>
but this is taken away from Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Oh death
where is thy ſting? O grave where
is thy victory?</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 55, 56.</p>
            <p>2. Death cannot hurt a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
becauſe it cannot bring an
annihilation of the body, though
it bring an alteration upon the ſtare
and condition of the body, yea and
though the body be diſſolved to
duſt, yet it ſhall not be loſt, it ſhall
riſe to life again.</p>
            <p>3. Death cannot diſſolve or
break that bleſſed union there is
between Jeſus Chriſt and believers.
Though it may ſeparate ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet it cannot ſeparate either
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46869:42"/>
from Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſoul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
will be in a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enjoyment of Chriſt; and
though the body for a while muſt
lie in the grave, yet that duſt is
precious duſt in Chriſts ſight.</p>
            <p>4. Conſider Death cannot keep
the body long under its power, nor
keep ſoul and body apart; 'tis but
a little while and they will meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Death and the Grave are
conquered enemies. Saints by faith
can now, through Jeſus Chriſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over them, and ſhall have a
compleat, a full Conqueſt, over a
ſhort ſpace.</p>
            <p>5. Death has not power to caſt
into hell, if Conſcience condemns
thee not, if the Word convicts thee
not, if God paſſeth not the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon thee, Death has no
power to do it. Death can but
bring to the grave, 'tis ſin that caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ſoul into hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:46869:42"/>
6. Conſider Death is thine, that
is, 'twill be for thy profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
every way. Remember
that ſweet word of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
1. Cor. 3. 22. <hi>Whether</hi>
Paul <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or
life, or death, or things preſent, or
things to come, all are yours;</hi> it will
be every way for thy good. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what freedom thou wilt gain
thereby. 1. It will free thee from a
body of ſin and death, that often
makes thee go with a ſorrowful
heart. Oh! hath it not oft made
thee to cry out with St. <hi>Paul, Oh
wretched man that I am, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from this body of ſin and
death?</hi> Oh what is a greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a Child of God than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
ſin? He cannot do the
things he would do. But now
comes death and frees thee of all
theſe ſoul perplexities and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Sin makes a Saint to groan,
being burthened; but now thou
ſhalt grieve Chriſt and his ſpirit,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46869:43"/>
nor thy own ſoul no more. Is not
this that a poor Saint longs for?</p>
            <p>2. 'Twill free thee from a poor
crazy, diſeaſed, or diſtempered Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
There will then be no crying
out of back or bone, nor head not
heart any more; 'twill be with thee
as with the Church in the glorious
day to come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 4. <hi>There ſhall
be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor
crying, neither ſhall there be any more
pain; for the former things are paſſed
away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It will free thee from an evil
and wicked world. Oh what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing,
enſnaring, and bewitching
world is this? What hinders us of
our joy and peace in Chriſt more
than it? What greater vexation
to us? Oh how many precious
Saints are clogged and impriſoned by
the cares of the world, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times is ready to choak the ſeed
of holy deſires after Chriſt: But
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46869:43"/>
by Death thou ſhalt be delivered.</p>
            <p>4. It will free thee out of the
hands of preſecutors. Thou wilt,
(with our dear Brother) be out of
their reach then: they ſhall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
thee, impriſon thee, nor tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thee any more. <hi>There,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Job</hi> (ſpeaking of the grave) <hi>the
wicked ceaſe from troubling; and there
the weary be at reſt; there the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
reſt together, they hear not
the voice of the oppreſſor,</hi> Job 3.
17, 18.</p>
            <p>5. Death will free thee from an
envious raging and tempting Devil.
He will have not more power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
thee, accuſe thee, nor by his
curſed ſuggeſtions, to vex and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
thy ſoul; no, nor any other
ways to hurt or annoy thee. O
will not this be to thy great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?
Who would be unwilling to
die, that hath an intereſt in Jeſus
Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:46869:44"/>
6. Thou wilt hereby alſo be
freed from all the diſcords and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that riſe amongſt Brethren.
The unworthy and diſorderly lives
of Profeſſors ſhall ſadden thy heart
then no more. This was that which
worried and grieved the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18. Our dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is ſet at liberty from all theſe
things, diſorders in the Church, no
looſe walking of Members thereof,
will burden nor trouble him again.</p>
            <p>7. Nay and Death will free thee
of all that trouble that riſeth from
thoſe inward becloudings and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of God's face. It will never be
night with the ſoul any more; thou
wilt then be with Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his face with joy for ever.</p>
            <p>8. And laſtly, Thou wilt alſo be
freed of all thy toilſome pains and
labour, of what nature ſoever it be.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46869:44"/>
O how good is reſt to a weary ſoul?
<hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in
the Lord, yea, ſaith the Spirit, that
they may reſt from their labours, and
their works do follow them,</hi> Rev.
14. 13.</p>
            <p>But then once again, Conſider
what a bleſſed ſtate thy ſoul will be
in at death. If thou art a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
thou ſhalt not onely have
hereby a negative good, it will not
ſimply a freedom from all thoſe
ſorrows and troubles thou haſt
heard, but thy ſoul ſhall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
receive tranſcendent joy with
Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>For me to live,
ſaith Paul, is Chriſt, and to die
is gain.</hi> The advantage the
ſoul receives upon this account,
made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
and be with Chriſt; which
he ſays is far better, <hi>Phil. 1.</hi>
21. Pray obſerve his words, he
doth not ſay it will be gain to him
when he riſes again, no, but <hi>to die
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46869:45"/>
is gain</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Some probably may object the dead are not ſenſible of time, 'tis but as a ſleep to them; they die and their reſurrection to them immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; no diſtance of time between Death and Judgement the dead, and ſo <hi>Paul</hi>'s gain he ſpeaks of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> might not be till the reſurrection?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aaſw.</hi> Though it be granted death to the body is but as a ſleep, yet 'tis not ſo to the ſoul. But that this is not the intent or meaning of the Apoſtle, is plain; which I make out thus: <hi>Paul</hi> Plainly ſhews that if he did preſently depart or die, it would be gain to him; now if that which you ſay were true, he would have loſt by death, 'tis eaſie to ſee how, Suppoſe he might live twenty or thirty years longer on earth, would not thirty years ſweet enjoyment of Jeſus Chriſt be worth nothing? Is not one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> day with God, beholding his lovely face, better than a thouſand? All know, that if he died preſently, he ſhould never the ſooner obtain the reſurrection, of this body, than if he had lived a hundred years lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; this being well weighed, to die preſently would have been his great loſs, were not the ſoul in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyment of Chriſt at death.</p>
               </note>. I ſhall receive more joy,
more conſolation, more of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God and Chriſt (as if he
ſhould ſay) when I die, then I can
whileſt I am in this body.</p>
            <p>Mind that paſſage in <hi>2 Cor. 5.
1. For we know that if our earthly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46869:45"/>
houſe of this tabernacle were diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
we have a building of God, a
houſe not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.</hi> Compare this with
ver. 6. <hi>Therefore we are always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
knowing that whilſt we are at
home in the body, we are abſent from
the Lord.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not
say we know when this earthly
houſe is broken down and raiſed up
again, we have a building with
God, eternal in the heavens. (Pray
conſider it) but plainly when it is
diſſolved, when it is turned to its
duſty crums: (<hi>We have</hi>) that is
our ſouls, he can intend nothing
elſe. By (<hi>we</hi>) he means their better
part, which he compares to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiter,
and the body to the houſe
or tabernacle in which it dwels. Oh
what an excellent thing is the ſoul
of man over the body.</p>
            <p>And now beloved, That the ſoul
or better part is capable of being
ſeparated from the body, and in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46869:46"/>
its ſeperate ſtate from the body,
capable of glorious enjoyments of
God and high raptures of joy with
Jeſus Christ, doth appear moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
from that paſſsage of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. <hi>It is not
expendient for me doubtleſs, to glory,
I will come to viſsions and revelations
of the Lord. I knew a man in Chriſt
above fourteen years ago, whether in
the body, I cannot tell; God knoweth:
ſuch a one caught up to the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
ver. 4. <hi>ſays, he was caught up
into paradiſe, and heard unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
words, which is not lawful for a
man to utter.</hi> The ſoul or ſpirit
then it appears may be ſeperate
from the body. I from this place
thus argue,</p>
            <p>1. If the ſoul or ſpirit of man be
not capable of being ſeperated
from the houſe of clay or earthly
tabernacle, then <hi>Paul</hi> might have
boldly and ſafely have ſaid the
whole man was taken up, a ſoul and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46869:46"/>
body together, and not one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the other, becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to ſeperate them: but ſince
<hi>Paul</hi> ſays he knows not whether in
the body or out of the body, he
plainly ſhews what opinion he was
of.</p>
            <p>And then ſecondly, I may from
what he ſays, reaſon after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>viz.</hi> If the ſoul in its ſeperated
ſtate from the body, be not able or
capable to enjoy or take in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforts or conſolations of Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> might boldly and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
have ſaid he was taken up
in the body, becauſe however he
was caught up, whether within or
without the body, he heard and
ſaw unexpreſſible things; he had
high and ſoul-filling raptures of joy.
The Lord Jeſus promiſed the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
Thief that he ſhould (that
is his chief or better part) be that
day with him in Paradice. <hi>Lord
Jeſus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Stephen) receive my
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46869:47"/>
ſpirit.</hi> O what a bleſſed thing it is
to die in Chriſt? O what a happy
eſtate is our friend in, the gain
is exceeding great. Some may ſay
what doth a godly man gain by
death?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, They gain a
glorious place, heaven, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Paradice of God, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of glory that are in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Houſe! Who is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what a glorious place heaven
is? But then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſhall enjoy
glorious company too. They ſhall
be with Jeſus Chriſt, have his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<hi>in whoſe preſence there is
fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right
hand there be pleaſures for evermore;</hi>
be with Chriſt, holy Angels, and
glorious ſpirits of juſt men made
perfect. O what a bleſſed ſtate
and condition of ſoul have they
gained that are gone thither!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:46869:47"/>
Thirdly, we ſhall gain ſweet
peace. 'Tis not onely peace in
Chriſt (that Gods people have as
their portion here) but it ſhall be
peace with Chriſt. A Woman
that has a dear Husband who is
gone to Sea, he is it may be in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Countrey, yet ſhe hears from
him, receives tokens of love, ſhe
has much ſatisfaction of the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſteneſs
of his love, cordialneſs of
his affection; in this ſhe has peace
and comfort, but alas what is this
peace to that when he comes
home, when ſhe has him, enjoys
his company? O we ſhall ſee
Chriſt, enjoy him, yea lie in his
arms to all eternity. <hi>Enter thou,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt,  <hi>into the joy of thy
Lord.</hi> That joy is too much to
enter into us, therefore we muſt
enter into that. <hi>Mark the perfect
man and behold the upright, for the
end of that man is peace.</hi> He has
peace In death, peace beyond
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46869:48"/>
death, yea and peace to all etrer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>And now one word more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to you that have loſt your
Paſtor: Your loſs I muſt confeſs is
great (though he hath gained here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by)
and it may be ſome of you are
crying out, What ſhall we do?
Beloved, you muſt labour for a quiet
frame, ſtrive for contentedneſs of
heart; 'tis the Lords hand upon
you, 'tis what he has done; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>David, I was dumb, I
opened not my mouth, becauſe thou
didſt it,</hi> Pſal. 39. 9.</p>
            <p>2. Conſider alſo your loſs is
not ſo great, but God is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
it and make it up to you,
though you may not ſee which way
it can be done, let it be your care
to wait upon God; cry to him, look
up to the Lord of the Harveſt, and
patiently wait to ſee what he will
do for you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:46869:48"/>
3. To ſupport you under this
ſore affliction, Conſider the great
Shepherd of the Sheep never dyes,
he lives for ever; and ſure he that
dyed for the Sheep whoſe own
Sheep they are, will take care of
them; he will feed them and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them from danger, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.
1, 2, 3. <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd,</hi>
ſaith <hi>David, I ſhall not want: He
maketh me to lie down in green Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures:
he leadeth me beſides the ſtill
waters: he reſtoreth my Soul: he
leadeth me in the paths of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſs,
for his Names ſake.</hi> And
from hence he takes courage, <hi>Yea,
though I walk thorow the valley of
the ſhadow of death, I will fear no
evil.</hi> Oh what a bleſſed thing
it is to have confidence in God,
and to have ſuch a Shepherd;
the keeper of <hi>Iſrael</hi> never ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
nor ſleepeth.</p>
            <div type="conclusion">

               <p>1. <hi>Conſider death ſhall not

would not have you to be ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
Brethren, concerning
them which are aſleep, that
ye ſorrow not, even as others
which have no hope; for if
we believe that Jeſus died, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46869:49"/>
roſe again; even ſo them which
ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring
with him: for this we ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you by the word of the Lord,
that we which are alive, and
remain unto the coming of the
<hi>Lord,</hi> ſhall not prevent them
which are aſleep: for the Lord
himſelf ſhall deſcend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with a ſhout, with the
voice of the Arch-angel, and
with the trumpet of God: and
the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe
firſt, then we which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
and remain, ſhall be
caught up together with them
in the clouds, to meet the Lord
in the air: and ſo ſhall we
ever be with the Lord: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
comfort one another with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46869:50"/>
theſe words. <hi>What can I ſpeak

               <p>O therefore be quieted,
conſider what you have

               <p>Shall not our Friend go
