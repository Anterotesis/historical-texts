            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ANd fellow Spinsters, (for the weakest of us is no worse, and the best no better) it is the Character under which all our Sexe is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; I lovingly salute you all hoping you are in as good health of body, and in quiet

of minde, as I was at the writing hereof: These are further to let you understand, that it is come to my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; how by the course car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of some amongst our Sexe; others, whose mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties are no way guilty of the like misdemeanour, are not privately bated, but (even in Print) publickly branded: &amp; by such who consider not, that as there was a <hi>Maechael Helena,</hi> so there was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron-like <hi>Hecuba</hi>; and as a loose <hi>Lais,</hi> so a loyall <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crese.</hi> Nor that we might as well retort upon them, that as there was an <hi>Hercules,</hi> so there was an <hi>Herostratus</hi>; and as a <hi>Salemon,</hi> so a <hi>Sinon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this is to little or no purpose: you know my

               <p>THey are much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken who call these two dayes, in the beginning of the first weeke of <hi>Lent,</hi> Shrove-Munday
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13338:7"/>
and Shrove-Tuesday, for wee have no word either from the old <hi>Brittish, Danish,</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, neither from any other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed language signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to that purpose, proper to the dayes, or suiting with the time. But if the Reader desire to bee instructed in the truth from the Originall. Know that the words are mis-written, and mis-sounded, and mistaken, for they should be read and voyc'd Shrewes-Munday, and Shrewes-Tuesday; and the reason why they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13338:7"/>
ought to bee so, I have beene instructed thus.</p>
               <p>It is by ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome held to be the only season for Collops and Egges, Fritters, and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes: and as in the City, so both in the Court and Countrey: But the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent following, which I am now to relate, first hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>

               <head>Of a Farmers Wife.</head>
               <p>AN honest plaine simple Farmer, on this leading day of the weeke, comming hungry from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13338:8"/>
the Plough, found his Wife busily making Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes for him and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: The good man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous than needed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to be very capci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at every thing, taking unjust exceptions at the coursenesse of the flower, the taste of the Suite, the thicknesse of the Batter, and the like. At which the good woman, though shee smothered it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, yet vexing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to bee so crost and troubled in her busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as knowing he was better experienced in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13338:8"/>
Plough, than the Panne, and to eate Pancakes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to make them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to sit downe and be patient, and shee would presently shew him a new tricke for his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>The simple Novice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of novelty, beganne more calmly to listen to her, and asked her what it was? who readily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered againe: Sweete Husband you see this Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake I am now turning: marke it well: now take this platter in your hand, and goe into the yard, bending with your Backe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13338:9"/>
against the doore, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king straight forward, not stirring from where I shall place you, and when it is ready, I will tosse it from the fire out of the toppe of the Chimney, &amp; it shall fall directly into your dish, and bee ready at the watch-word when I shall say <hi>Now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The silly man thinking shee had spoke seriously was soone perswaded, and kept his place (with his face from the doore) stil<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At which words the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13338:10"/>
husband rubbing his Browes, well basted with the fat of the Panne, said unto her; Now a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe take thee for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Shrew: this wil make me think on this Shrewes Munday (for thy sake) whilst I live: and from thence, it is thought, the day had its first denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion upon the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent done by some curst Shrew or other came the next day following to bee cald Shrewes Tuesday, &amp; so weeping Wednesday, terrible Thursday, frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Friday, and sullen

Saturday, especially when her husband denyes her to goe amongst her Gossips on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Hence comes it also that if any one hath crost another in a businesse, or done him a bad Office, which mny prove to his dammage or hinderance, the phrase that is still most in custome, is to say, that such, or such a man, did purpose, or hath done me a shrewd turne.</p>

               <p>NOW Good-man <hi>Simpleton,</hi> we shall have you grow so proud now you have got
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13338:11"/>
an office, that you thinke none is good enough to bee your fellow: I had thought your owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in your profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion had beene trouble e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to you, and not to have sought for an Office, and made friends for it likewise: Now I see you are troubled with the Simples, you had not need to goe a simpling every yeare as you doe, God knowes you have so little wit already: I would you would goe the next time &amp; get some Compounds to furnish your seife with, &amp; to concoct your Brains,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13338:12"/>
for you have now but a shallow wit, and are glad to weare a Sattin Cappe to keepe that in too: you had need keepe home, and learn to know something more in your profession, than what is already prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in bookes. When a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not well, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires your advice, then you can prescribe them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little <hi>Stybium</hi>; then when another comes, <hi>Stybium</hi>; this is all you can doe, onely a little <hi>Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium.</hi> Goe, thou art a stupified Asse, and knowes better how to purge thy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13338:12"/>
Patients money out of his pocket, than to remove any disease from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: you wil come to them, and aske them how they doe, this is all, and bid them be of comfort, when there is a great deale of danger, and pretend to feele their pulse, when your minde is to filtch their purse. I would there were a meanes how to have your Braines taken out, and braid in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they may bee a little better compounded, for as they be, thou wilt never be able to discharge thy brave Office, asse thou
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13338:13"/>
calst it, of a Scavenger, for thou canst not cast up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accompt, nor reckon up any summe above twenty shillings; I hope thou wilt lose by it, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after be jeered for thy folly; you imagine your selfe a brave fellow, doe you not, because you are met by some who knowes you, with a money bagge in the one hand, and a Rowle of the parishioners names in the other: you thinke your selfe not a little graced to bee called to this preferment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you would be taken notice of in the Parish:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13338:13"/>
and now you have got a great many of Titles by your Office, the better to honour your person with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and these are some of them, which your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cannot beare: first you are Duke of the Dung-Cart, then Earle of the Channell, Lord of the Soyle, Vicount Rubbish, Commander of the Sea-coale Ashes, and Master of the Dung-hill, a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly company are they not: It is no marvaile indeede you must make you a new suite of Apparrell to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this Office in, and to goe up and downe the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13338:14"/>
street and from doore to doore, to gather your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in, as if you were to beg an Almes; and goe twice or thrice before you can be paid your due: you had better never had served this base stinking office, and have given so much money out of your purse, because you loose so much time, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is in danger of every raskally knave or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouters complaint to one Justice or other, if a little durt bee left, unlesse you give them a Fee, as you often have done to hold their tongues; or else you

               <p>
                  <hi>Husb.</hi> I prethee good wife have patience, it is but a little while longer; I have served it hitherto with commendations &amp; I hope I shal come off with credit, though it be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time lost and money spent, I will get it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for that is the first Office that every man must serve, and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees come higher and higher, and at length to be Church-warden, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13338:15"/>
then let me alone to helpe my selfe, for all my losse of time and expence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; I will then beg hard for the poore, but chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie begins at home; it is but when I receive money from the others that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, be a little close fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, or hold it betweene my fingers with the palme of my hand down-wards, and make as though I had a louse in my necke, and shrug a little of one side, and then of the other, and so thrust it downe into my necke where I have a list of cloath about my waste that it cannot fall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13338:15"/>
downe or drop out: let me alone, I will be cunning enough for them I will warrant you, and though thou count me but a shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low brain'd, &amp; simple fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, because I am an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie and use simples; yet thou shall know I am not such an ideot or foole to loose all and be laughed at too, but I will make some body pay for it; and so good wife doe not any way disparage me in my profession or judgement any more to any of my patients; and though some of our owne trade call me at their pleasures and say I

looke like an Asse, yet I am not one, let those terme me foolish and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if I fall into any of their hands to take Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke. I thinke those are the greatest simplisians that use Physicke most, and so I hope good wife I have given you satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for this time, desiring you to have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in saying little, and doing no more, and in so doing, we shall remaine alwaies friends and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>

and when she was shaven, because the cocke was dry, we were forc'd to carrie her to the pumpe and wash her, and there had beene a goodly sight if your rogue-ship had beene there to have seene it; you went to sea with a goodly haire of your head, &amp; now you are come home againe as bald as a birds-arse, and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse have you for this? when any man taxeth thee of it, thou biddest them everie night looke to the sweeping of thy shop, and there went the haire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and is this a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13338:25"/>
little difference, as betwixt him that I named last and a Broker) married a young wife, (a pretty modest slut she was) and had spleene in her, (as ill women have) but never shewed it, and like a flint had concealed fire, but till hee with his steele strook too hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, there never appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any sparkle; but when the Tinder once takes, you may light a Candle for any merchants Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne, to shew al the street over: and so it fared with these, for he having temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her beyond all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, her breast swelling

till shee had almost burst her lace, she fell into these Tearmes. An Horse-courser, an hang-dogge, for Hangman is too good a name for thee, who wouldest ride more Gills than thou dost Jades: (for an honest wife is too good for thee, or any of thy generation) thou for thy cheating in horses better deservest to bee burnt in Smithfield than any women for poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her Husband: but the Devill shall poyson thee before I wil: for none of all your spurre-galling Rascalls shall make an

               <p>Gladly he would have interrupted her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to say something to small purpose: but the Jacke was woond up, and downe it must, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be meddled with till it was ready to be woond up againe: For she had vowed to <hi>Doe</hi> out her <hi>Doe</hi>; and that she would see done, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pursu'd her discourse in this manner.</p>

occasion his wife seeing shee could not come at the other to have her wil, she falls about her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands eares, and he againe at her, and hard it was to judge betwixt them who was likely to have the better: In which Interim the Glasiers wife ranne to call the Constable, and brought him, desiring him, least there should be man-slaughter, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-slaughter commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to command them to keepe the Kings Peace, and to part them: but he, out of his great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, made answer:

no not I by any meanes, nor any one for mee: Cursed be he that parts man and wife: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them fight on and spare not: so that what the Constable would not doe wearinesse did: but how the businesse was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reconcield, when I understand more, you shall heare further.</p>
               <p>The poore Farrier li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this life seven yeares together; and to please her oftentimes hee was forced to lose many a heate at the Anvill to to come at her call to kisse and humour her:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13338:48"/>
and still being used to this kinde of language, it bred in him that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome that he could well endure it: sometimes, onely to ease himselfe, &amp; his minde, complaining to some of his friends o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a cup of Beere, telling them, how in stead of Lord and Master, she cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him Rogue and Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and was ne're at quiet with her at bed or board; only when she was abroad or asleepe: and for stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now a little longer than I promised her, said he, I dare warrant you, my good neighbour,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13338:48"/>
when I come home I shall have a dish of maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Broath, thickned with a few small Reasons, kept hot upon a chafing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish and coales, so that when I come in, I shall bee constrained to sup it up scoulding hot.</p>

are thicke fowne, but they come up but thinne, and there is show of a great harvest when there is but little corn, and that I have found to my cost; for (said the Pewterers wife if I were to marry againe twenty times over, I would never have an hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whilst I liv'd, nor I (said the other) a Poulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, hee is one of the most slovinglist fellowes, and deales so much in fowle, that I can make him keep nothing clean about him, nay when he should come to bed to me, me thinks hee smells like his stale

poultry, and what woman of fashion (for you know sister I was a choice peece when you knew me first) is able to endure it, there she paused, and then the other began, and said, and you know I might have had matches, and good ones too, before I met with this Dromedary to live in a Pewterers house, where there is such rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and knocking early and late, one had better dwell in Crooked-lane or amongst the Brasiers in Loath-bery; nay it loathes my very stomack to think on it, and the rather when
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13338:66"/>
I find by proofe, that these who deale altogether in mettall, have no mettall at all in them; for he hath beene this two yeeres and upward, to beate out a boy, or hammer out a girle and cannot: troth my poultry ware is even cookt with the same sauce (saith the other:) but I pray you what words of Art have you for him when he angers you: who answered, because hee is somewhat purblind, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I call him Owle, and Booby, and now and then saucer-ey'd slave and platter-fac'd rascall, aske
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13338:67"/>
him if the great baby meanes still to bee fed with spoone meat, and the like, nay I never greatly studdy for his words, I cut his livery out of the next cloath that comes to hand: and I (saith the Poulterers wife) follow the same course to an heire, there goes but a bare paire of sheeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them: to give him his stile, I need goe no further then his stall; for if he vexe me, I call him Goose, and Widging, and Dotrell, and Woodcock, (no other then he brings with him) nay if he moves
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13338:67"/>
me much (as that which angereth him most) I call him Capon; but said the other, never Cocke of the game I warrant you; to which was replyd, no I will see him in the pit first, which word may carry a double meaning: at which the drawer came in and asked them what do you lack? when both spake at once and said, either of us a good husband: the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er made answer, if you have not good husbands, I would you had such as you like good Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; God a mercy honest drawer, for that word I

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13338:68"/>
at such times when my husband is foxed, that I borrow a shilling or two out of his pocket that he doth not once thinke of, for by my troth, hee will not give me a penny extra ordinarie to drinke a pint of wine with a friend, nor have I any way to get any money but what I have told you, nor doe I stirre out of doores from one weeks end to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unlesse to market and so backe againe: introth said the Poulterers wife I will not be mewed up like a hawke, for I will both have money at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

and goe abroad when I please, and never give an account where I have beene; I marry said the Pewterers wife you spend the week merrily: I must confesse I do, said the Poulterers wife, did you never heere the merry say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good old women; and how they spend the week about: no indeed said the Pewterers wife; then I will tell you, said the Poulterers wife how; thus you must spend the weeke, and every day in the week.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13338:77"/>
gramarcy, this stout heart of mine: and I doe thanke the Fates that they decreed hee should have no courage in him at this time that I tooke him to taske: for had he but offered to have made resistance, or strove with me, he might have very easily wrung this Crab-tree Ladle out of my hands, and have basted me with it, as I have done him: I see it is good sometimes to put on a bold face, and a resolute courage, though in a desperate and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full action: For who
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13338:78"/>
would have imagined that I should be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, had they seene thy Master and my selfe stand together: now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe is very true; the gray mare is the better horse; for indeede I was very angry, and full of wrath, and wrath is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is just, as it was now on my side; for wee little women are soone hot, and our hearts are neare our mouthes, and speake our mindes, and doe our does, and then we have done; for anger is no infirmity, nor is it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13338:78"/>
to bee held a capitall Crime: but for a woman to persevere in her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that is an infirmity, and subject to the censure of the Law. This Act of mine may prove advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to mee, and may worke much upon my Husbands thoughts, and him make somewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then ever he was since his mother bound his head: for he findes now at the first what hee shall trust to alwaies, if hee once crosse mee in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: it is a notable good thing, and worth your observation, Hussy,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13338:79"/>
to know how to provide a remedy for a calamity, I should never have ridde thy Master from that course of ill-husbandry, but by this meanes: and I must still threaten him, and keepe him in awe; for that body which is accustomed to patience, or to his kinde of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, will never forsake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place for paine or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile whatsoever. I have heard many men say, that a woman and a Spannell, the more thy are beaten, the better they will love their Masters: I have now tryed conclusions,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13338:79"/>
and have once crost that Proverbe; and will try whether my husband will love mee the better yea or no: and now Ile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him, that the more a man is beaten, and a Wall-nut-tree, the better and larger fruite may bee expected from the one, and the more obedience and love from the other: for doe but hang a dogge in a Crabbe-tree, and hee will never love verjuce af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: so let every woman fall upon her husband, not onely in bare railing words, but doe it in action, and say it on to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13338:80"/>
the purpose, he will ever after bee afraid of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home so late drunk, I will warrant you: a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath such a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ought rather to be a Shrew than a sheepe: for when they finde that a woman is of a milde dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and will not talke to them, and tell them of their faults roundly, they doe but make Asses and Coxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combes of them, and laugh at them behinde their backs, and bragge to their companions, that they can perswade their wives to any thing; and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13338:80"/>
tell them a tale of a Tub, and make them beleeve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing as they say to bee true: Therefore judge you now, Hussy, whether I doe not deserve praise for this daies worke yea or no.</p>

               <p>DEare and loving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I have long time beheld your uncivill carriage, and past it over with modesty and silence: when the wine hath got possession of the chiefest part of man, I meane the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13338:81"/>
braine, that then you are not your own keeper, nor have power neither of your words or actions; I know very well, that you are a man, that (when you are not intoxicated) is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and understanding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in many worldly affaires, and know how to behave your selfe in all companies whatsoever: you have a good voluable tongue of your owne, and can tell how to order or arbitrate any difference or matter of consequence when you are requested thereto; but when you are in this veine of drinking,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13338:82"/>
you are not then the same man for sobriety that the whole City and parish where you dwell takes you to be: you know your owne discretion, but you doe not know your owne indiscretion: for words without good effects, is like a great water which drowneth the people, and doth it selfe no profit; so you that will punish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for being drunke, and make them pay a Fee to the poore, are in like case not to bee borne withall: for hee that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth measure in drinking; is no more master of his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13338:82"/>
owne thoughts, or of his tongue; and without shame he speaketh of all dishonest things, and such as are unseemely: and in this case a man becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a Child: it is a thing of exceeding great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, for a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale and hide his owne ignorance: but much more difficult it is for a man to conceale any thing when hee hath drunke well: you must not be too forward to speake in the Vestry when you have bin a drinking store of wine, for then you lispe, and clip the Kings English;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13338:83"/>
for at that time every man takes notice of your weaknesse, for then you make that little member your tongue the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of your owne folly; for when you have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the words that you have utter'd and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, are no longer yours, but those that observe them; nor are they left to your construction and meaning, though you thinke no harme, but to their interpretation that heare them: Good spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are the image of the minde; therefore the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of the tongue and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13338:83"/>
silence ought to be great, and men ought to use and imploy their eares oftner than their tongues: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my good husband, observe but this, that it is not good to bee too prompt and forwards in speaking, unlesse you be called to it: my reason is, because many words and much speech, is an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant signe of folly; for neither words nor winde will fill a Bushell. I have observed it divers times, and I have much mused, that when you have drunk a cup of strong Beere in the morning next your
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13338:84"/>
heart, that you have sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked your head, and made a sowre face: when you have had it in your sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke; you have said that it made you heart-burn'd, and it is nothing else but your drinking of Wine that doth so inflame your stomacke, that if you doe drinke any other cooler liquor, then it qualifies the former heate, and washes and cleanses the slime from off your stomacke, which makes it as it were raw and hear-burning, so that nothing will agree with your stomacke, but wine; and I have noted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13338:84"/>
it, that it meales you are sicke, and cannot digest your meate, unlesse you drinke some wine every meale, and this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but custome and ill Company that hath brought this desire of drinking wine upon you. At any time when you are in this case, you have no power of your selfe, but the wine makes you its slave and servant, to doe, and worke what it lists in your braine: it may perchance so intoxicate your sences, that you may receive such an injury, or doe such an accident, that

you may repent for it all the daies of your life: when you have drunke so much what good doth it you? it makes you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any thing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of quarrelling, and gaming; and too much Wine doth provoke lust, and when that abounds, then some ill act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continencie followes; for there is nothing in man more able to make him lose his humanitie with more facilitie, than by his tongue, and too much Wine: Wine is the Rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane of our land, and I am fully perswaded that

more dye by surfeits of Wine, than by the sword, or any other disease: where have there beene more hurts and injuries done, than by Wine? for that is the chiefe cause and ground of all despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate attempts and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, for when the Wine is in, the wit is out: for the excesse of Wine bringeth forth three sorts of Grapes, the first of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the second of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenesse, and the third of sorrow: One thing more, my sweete-heart, and I have done; you know I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver twitted you in the

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13338:87"/>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13338:88"/>
when thou dost weare thy Cloth Cloake, it is the very same case with thee; in Dock, out Nettle; while one is at home, the other is in Lavender in Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13338:88"/>
you are in your Cups, like a Lion, but abroad amongst your compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you seeme to bee as meeke as a Lambe: but indeede you are a meere Sheepes head, or rather a Rams head in a Wolfes Skinne: a flye youth, a jeering double-lookt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Two pretty young to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Girles, newly come into their Teenes, not Sisters, but Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Children, and of acquaintance from their Cradles, and no doubt but the forwardest Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren their Father had: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day invited (with their Parents) to a Feast: Dinner being done, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13338:104"/>
the Guests being severally imployed, either in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or other exercise of game or drinking, they two retired themselves from the rest into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and chusing out a private (but pleasant) walke, they began their discourse as followeth:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Maid.</hi> And I pray you how old are you? Lord, how are you grown of late since the last Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! Doe you weare no Corkes, nor no Polonie-heeles? why <hi>you</hi> shew as if <hi>you</hi> walk't upon chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peenes, nay, <hi>you</hi> grow not onely tall, but proper
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13338:105"/>
withall, so that me-thinks it is high time <hi>you</hi> look't after an Husband. The second made answer, Ill weeds grow apace, and for Husbands wee may looke long enough after them, ere they will cast an eye upon us, I meane any that are worth the having. But what a foole am I to speake <hi>us,</hi> in the Plurall number, that for ought I see, shall be forc't to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Singular whilst I live. Indeed said the other, <hi>Ego &amp; tu</hi> are more frequent than <hi>Nos</hi> and <hi>Vos</hi> amongst us Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins: we may say, A lacke
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13338:105"/>
the while, for wee both know what is wanting; for what doe wee all this while but loose time, which might bee better imploy'd (I wis) than to dreame of shadows, and never know what the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance meanes: it will bee long enough ere our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will provide for us, therefore me-thinks it is time at these yeares that wee looke out for our selves. She reply'd, and truely Sister I am of your minde; but I pray you, had you never any Suiters yet? Suiters (answered shee) O yes, but simple
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13338:106"/>
ones, Heaven knowes: There comes to mee last day a dapper Tailer, and would faine have beene doing; hee would have tooke measure of mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was stuffe to make me a gowne; a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty little Hopper me thumb it was, but I quickly gave him his answer, having vow'd to make choice of a Man, or never to marry. And then there was a sweete Youth, a Comfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, that came to court me with a paper of Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plummes, but him I could not relish because of his rotten Teeth. And
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13338:106"/>
for a Scrivener, there shall never any Indentures be drawne betwixt him and me drunke nor sober, for in all his Leases (if you have observ'd it) where you shall once read <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes provided,</hi> you shall finde at the least twenty times <hi>Notwithstanding:</hi> Nor I an Haberdasher of small wares said the other; I will have one that deales by whole-sale, or none.</p>
               <p>Another of my Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearts came to me the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and said, Sweete Mistris, one word in your eare: Nay said I, speake it openly, I am not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13338:107"/>
of what you can say: no good sweet-heart said he, let me tell it you pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately; then I gave him the hearing, because I hoped the sooner to be rid of the fooles company: and what was it, but hee told me, he would tell me such a Tale in my eare that would doe mee good at the heart, and what was it, but of an old pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage betweene <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis,</hi> and that was all he did: onely hee presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me with a Coppy of Verses, and many Letters of Complements in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which I tooke on
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:13338:107"/>
purpose to laugh at, and withall he intreated me to accept of them, for they were of his owne inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And when I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used them, I remember'd that I had read them in Print, for hee stole them out of divers bookes of Complements on my knowledge, thinking thereby that I should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him witty, and the sooner to get my love: but I sent him away with such a flout, that I think he will scarce come againe this Weeke: for in troth if ever I marry, I'le have a proper man, and one that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:13338:108"/>
I can fancy well, or else I will never consent to wed. Introth Sister, said the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I would I had never any one that did aske mee the question; I doe think I was borne under an evill or melancholly Planet, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one can get sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearts but I: I am now sixteene yeares old, it cost me a Groat to the Knave the Clarke for searching the Booke; for my Father told mee that I was but fifteene yeares old, but I found it that I was above sixteene yeares, in troth I cannot lie any longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. I doe so bite the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:13338:108"/>
sheets, and tosse up and downe in the bed like a Cat when shee is pinched by the taile. I have heard that in former times the <hi>Roman</hi> Law was, that they did allow that a Man might marry at eighteene, and a Maide at twelve yeares of age, I would it were in use with us in our Countrey: But men now a daies are growne faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and dare not presume to aske the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but let Maids alone till wee pine, and wrong our selves, and make our moanes, for women are not perfect without men,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13338:109"/>
though men are without women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But sister, pray tell me, what thinke you of a Grocer? <hi>An.</hi> That as Hogges are frank't with Pease and Akornes, so he would fat mee up with Figges and Raisons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What thinke you of a Fishmonger? <hi>A.</hi> That of the contrary hee would make me as leane as Lent, and looke all the yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a Good Friday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. <hi>Qu.</hi> What of a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith? <hi>An.</hi> The Gold I like well, but for the Smith, I care not if hee were packt amongst the

other mettall-men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What then of a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller? <hi>An.</hi> Ey marry now you speake to some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for plaine dealing is a Jewell, howsoever many a one that useth it, may die a begger. <hi>Q.</hi> What of an Upholster? <hi>A.</hi> That his Wife, though she fare hard, shall bee sure to lye soft, and if shee be wise, shee'l finde how to feather her Nest I warrant her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What thinke you of a Draper? <hi>An.</hi> As of an honest conscionable man, for they allow to every Yard the over-plus of <hi>London</hi> measure. <hi>Q.</hi> What
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13338:110"/>
of a Silke-man? <hi>An.</hi> As of a Silke-worme; if his Wife proove too fine for his finger, he may say, he hath spunne a faire thread, and so he turne Butterfly, and shee Spinster. <hi>Q.</hi> What of a Merchant? <hi>An.</hi> Of Eele-skinnes doe you meane? <hi>Q.</hi> No, I meane the noble Trade of the Merchant adventurers. <hi>An.</hi> When hee goeth a wooing, God send him good shipping, and that his Vessell leake not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Winde and Water. <hi>Qu.</hi> And what think you of a Clarke? <hi>An.</hi> How, of a Church? <hi>Qu.</hi> No,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13338:110"/>
nor of a Chappel. <hi>A.</hi> Then I guesse your meaning; I would not have a Clarke of the Chancery, because he might trouble my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; nor a Clarke of the Arches, for he would rather make my will, than give me my will: nor a Clarke of the Check-her, for hee would be alwayes crossing me: but if any, a Clarke of the peaces Clarke, a Clarke of the Rolles, or of the Pipe-office. At this the Guests came into the Garden, and they were forc't to breake off their discourse.</p>

               <p>TWo nigh neighbours, that had beene long brothers in affliction, as being sicke of one disease, had many times made complaints the one to the other (but all in vaine) of the churlish and crabbish disposition of their wives, what Shrewes they were, and themselves were made no better than Subjects to the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13338:111"/>
Smock: but at the length, one of them having the better Spirit, vowed to himselfe that he would never give over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, untill he had got the Conquest; and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it happened. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, spying his friend and neighbour in the fields a farre off, he cryed unto him aloud, <hi>Victory, victory:</hi> the other not knowing what hee meant by it, drew neare unto him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that joyfull accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? who told him, that after many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13338:112"/>
conflicts, at length he was Conquerour: and Bold-face his wife, was compeld to cease all claim to the breeches: which his friend would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, till having fac'd it out with some small Oathes: who when hee had both heard, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, he was desirous to know all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: then he proceeded thus.</p>
               <p>Comming home some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late according to my custome, my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beganne to mander; to which I said but little at first; but note what
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13338:112"/>
followed after. When presuming on my wonted patience, the Hen (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth beganne to Cackle, and I set out a throate to crow; and loud I was indeede, and shee got no advantage on me that way: and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether I was in jest, or earnest, she scornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smild upon me, and cald me old Coxecombe: to which I answered; Most surely if I have a Combe on my head, I have Spurs on my heeles; and still as shee spurd me a question, I kickt her an answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:13338:113"/>I like the beginning well (saith his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) but the end tries all things: But I pray you tell mee; did you not learne this at a play? Who replyed, a play? I scorne it; what I have done, I found out by my owne practise, and am able of my selfe to set out a Grammer with rules to prove, that the Gray mare is no more the better horse.</p>
               <p>Well, when she beganne to raile, I fell to rage, insomuch, that any wise man would have thought us both mad; and then
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:13338:113"/>
shee said I was drunke; but shee after found by proofe, that what I did was in sober sadnesse; and as shee skreekt out, so still shee scratcht behind, where I am sure it itch't not, for I had applyed too much Arsmart alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Then I bade her come to bed, who no sooner said she would not, but I swore shee should not, and withall lockt her out of the Chamber, and there she lay all a cold frosty night on the bare boords; I having before prickt her posteriours, that she had as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:13338:114"/>
good to have laine upon Thornes.</p>
               <p>Then said his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but how could you have the heart to use her so hardly? The heart (quoth hee) marry hang her Brocke; being over shooes, I car'd not to be over Bootes; and once wet to the Ankles, to wade up to the Chin: Vp I got in the Morning, shee lay along in my way grunting and groaning; when I making as if I had stumbled at a blocke, gave her a sound spurnne upon the Buttocks, and never cryed her mercy:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:13338:114"/>
O my <hi>what doe you call't,</hi> said shee. What ailes Mistris Miniver, quoth I. I am sicke and would have a Posser, said shee. A Posset with a poxe to you, said I; you would have a Cawdle made of Calves Egges, would you not? Vp you lazy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, wee shall have you fall into the scurvy, and then there is no cure for you but a Cudgell.</p>
               <p>Next she cald her maid to fetch her some hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: then I stept downe, and finding a Kettle-full seething on the fire, fild a Bowle, and brought it
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13338:115"/>
up to her making her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it was warme for her stomacke, and if shee would not drinke it off, I would powre it downe her bosome: That done, I bid her get downe the staires, or I would set her downe with her head first, and her heeles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>But (said the other) had shee the patience to endure it? Who answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yes, patience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force: such as debtors have, to bee hurried to prison, or theeves to bee drawne to the Gallowes: I had never begunne the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:13338:115"/>
worke, but that I meant to goe through stich with it; that morning I turnd away her madnesse, and then she was no more a Mistresse, which I knew vext her not a little, and that which most angered her, seemed but to please me: For I vow'd, since shee would bee a Divell shee should be her owne drudge: yes, and though his Damme said against it.</p>
               <p>Said his neighbour, said shee nothing all this while? had I us'd my wife so, all the streete should have wrung, as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:13338:116"/>
the bells of it, for I am most sure shee hath as loud a Clapper. To which he answered, what should any thing be spoke, where nothing would be heard? and that she knew well enough; for I had drown'd her Cannon with my Thunder: But shee bent her Browes, Glouted with her eyes, first bit her lippes, and then her Tongue; sometimes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her foote, and then her sist, but durst fall foule with neither; If she had, I threatned to bind her hand and foote and so leave her. Then I lockt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:13338:116"/>
up her Gownes, least she should gadde abroad to complaine to her Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips; and the Divell a Cloth did I leave to put about her necke, but a Dish-clout. Sometimes I set her to spinne, till shee thought the world runne upon wheeles, and made her say within her selfe, (as shee hath since confest) I have spun a faire thread, have I not? I made her wash till shee was glad to wring her hands, and rubbe the Pewter and Brasse till not a skellet scapt a scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Then I would find
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:13338:117"/>
fault with every thing, and be pleased with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: nor could shee sweepe so cleane, but I would finde a sluts cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: nay, I left her not so much rule, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the roast, and the weapons that I awed her with, were the spit and the Jackeline; insomuch, that shee beganne at the length to be a little more plyant and tractable, and beganne to change her perverse obstinacy, into a kinde of peevish obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for she would turn her frowne into a sowre smile, and in the stead
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:13338:117"/>
of a double, expresse a doubtfull duty, (syrreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence) in a kind of a jeering and mockng courtesie.</p>
               <p>By my faith, said his Neighbour, I should be glad of so much, and be very thankfull too; but I can compasse no such matter, unlesse I meant to buy it with stroakes: No (said the Shrew-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) but I would bee a man or a Mouse; a <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar aut nullus:</hi> this was no submission to give me sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; but I pursu'd it further: for what good would the knee without
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:13338:118"/>
the heart have done mee? But I followed the scent whilst it was hot. Shee could not come at a shooe to her foote, nor a hat to her head, nor a band to her necke, nor a Coate to her backe; so that she was in a perplexity to be ever kept in Prison, which she fearing, was at length content to doe any thing; and if I commanded her to light her Candles at the wrong end: and till then I could never tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crye victory, and boast of the Conquest.
