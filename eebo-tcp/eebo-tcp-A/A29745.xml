            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <abbr>Esq</abbr> amounting to 15000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
Even for which the said <hi>Pergens,</hi> by his own Covenant had contracted to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to the said <hi>Courten,</hi> or his Assigns.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> was born at <hi>Cologne</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> bred up in <hi>London,</hi> and made a free
Denizon of <hi>England,</hi> then, upon his marriage with the Sister of <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> became a
Burgher of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> afterwards an Inhabitant at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and one of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the <hi>West-India</hi> Company there, who claims sometimes the priviledge of an <hi>English</hi>-man,
at other times of a <hi>German;</hi> and, as occasion offers, he claims the priviledge of a
<hi>Zealander,</hi> and often times of a Citizen and Free-Burger of <hi>Amsterdam:</hi> and when he is
impleaded at any other place, his Exceptions are, That he ought not to be sued in any
place, but only before his Competent Judges of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> where the Courts of Justice
are closed up against all <hi>English</hi>-men that prosecute their rights against him.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> in his particular Trade (distinct from the Company) having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
several wrongs and injuries by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> procured Letters of <hi>Mart</hi> or <hi>Reprizals,</hi>
in the second year of the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> to do himself Right and Justic; and sent forth
Captain <hi>Iohn Powel,</hi> and <hi>Henry Powel</hi> his Brother, with two Frigats, well fitted aud equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
into the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> who having discovered the <hi>Island of Barbadoes</hi> not inhabited by
any people whatsoever, landed there, and made a survey of the Soil and Scituation; and
at their return perswaded Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> to fortifie and settle Plantations upon the said
Island; who did, at his own proper Costs and Charges, expend the Sum of 28000 <hi>l.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in Building,<note place="margin">An. 1632.</note> Plantations, and Transporting Men, Women, and Servants. And being in
quiet possession for the space of two years, he procured a Grant under the Great Seal of
<hi>England, Tertio Caroli primi,</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and his certain Deputies; for the
Government thereof according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which subjected the same to the
Dominion of the King, but the Freehold and Soil, by the Law and Original of all Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
was rested in Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and his Heirs for ever. Nevertheless, <hi>Iames</hi> late
Earl of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> by colour of a pretended Grant, as Lord Proprietor of the <hi>Caribee</hi> Islands,
in the year 1628, with his Complices, Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> enters the said Island by force
of Arms, and dispossessed the said Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> his Servants and Planters of their
Fortifications, Houses, and Plantations, and do still continue the possession thereof,
against all Justice and common Right; many Families having raised themselves by the
Fruits and profits of the said Island, out of the ruins of Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and his Creditors:</p>
            <p>In the year 1632 Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> having procured several Fishermen and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
out of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> as also Net-makers and Ship-Carpenters, for building
Herring-Busses and Dogger-Boats. They were made free Denizens of <hi>England,</hi> and
dwelt in divers Towns adjacent to the Sea. Then several joynt Stocks were raised, for
incouraging the Herring-Fishing and Cod-Fishing upon the <hi>English</hi> Coasts. Whereupon
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders,</hi> under hand, got Letters of <hi>Mart</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44046:4"/>
and took the said <hi>English</hi> Busses and Doggers, and procur'd them to be confiscated at <hi>Oast-End</hi>
and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> under pretence they were <hi>Dutch</hi> Effects: And oftentimes fishing in
company with the <hi>English,</hi> would in the Night time cast great Stones into their Nets, and
spoil their whole Voyages for that season; by which indirect practices the <hi>English</hi> were
so discouraged, that after the loss of above 50000 l. Sterling and upwards in the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
(as appears by the Accompts of Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and the other Treasurers)
the whole undertaking was laid aside in Companies, to the great Damage and Dishonour
of the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That the late King <hi>Charles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An. 1635.</note> in the <hi>11th.</hi> year of his Reign, together with several Lords
of the Council, perswaded the said Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> to undertake Trading Voyages to
<hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan;</hi> and for that purpose, granted him, and others in Company with him,
a new Charter for an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, in the year 1635. Then Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> being a
man of a publick Spirit, was moved by the King to furnish and advance the Sum of
36000 <hi>l.</hi> to Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> in the first Expedition; for which he had assignments upon
several Ships. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> then finding that it might hinder their Commerce, obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in the said Voyages, under pretence that they traded with the <hi>Portugals,</hi> their Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
But before any of the said Ships returned, Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> died, upon whose
Foundation the <hi>East-India</hi> Company of <hi>England</hi> afterwards take their times, steps, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Trade, and Correspondence.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> in his Life-time, having contracted many great Debts, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his several undertakings and ways of Traffick aforesaid; left his only Son and Heir
<hi>William Courten,</hi> his sole Executor, obliging him upon his Death-bed to preserve his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
at home and abroad, especially to prosecute the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade; But soon after the
News of Sir <hi>William Courten</hi>'s Death was spread in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> the <hi>East-India</hi>
Company of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> by Force and Fraud used all the Stratagems possible to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Mr. <hi>Courten</hi>'s Trading Voyages. And after the loss of the two Ships, <hi>Dragon</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi>
richly Laden from <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan.</hi> The Officers of the <hi>Dutch East-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany
in the beginning of the year 1643, and in the midst of the disorders in <hi>England</hi> took
advantage, when the King could not protect his Subjects abroad, to spoil Mr <hi>Courten</hi> and
his Partners of other Ships, Goods, and Merchandize in those remote parts of <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Constitutions of these times, for the space of 20 years, from 1640. to 1660.
rendred Mr. <hi>Courten,</hi> Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> and their Associates, so obnoxious to the Powers
in being, that Mr. <hi>Courten</hi> was forced out of <hi>England,</hi> and died in his Exile; The others
remained passive until the King's most happy Restauration, who then for 4 years together,
earnestly sollicited, both at home and abroad, upon the Kings Recommendation, and Order
of the Council-Table for restitution and reparation for the spoyls and depredations of the
two Ships, <hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> and <hi>Henry Bonadventura,</hi> without effect. Notwithstanding a
Worthy Member of the Commons in Parliament had a considerable Sum of Money depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
in his hands, in trust to be placed in <hi>Holland,</hi> to procure an honourable Composition
from the <hi>States,</hi> or the <hi>East-India</hi> Company of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which was not done. <hi>(yet
this worthy Member does not only refuse to refund the Mony, but being sued in Chancery for it,
sometimes insists upon the Priviledge of a Parliament; and at other times pleads the Statuts of
Limitations.)</hi> Then a Grant passed under the Seal of <hi>England,</hi> of common Right, in due
form of Law, for Satisfaction and Indempnity of the persons interested and injured. An

<hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> and of her Tackle, Apparel and Furniture, and all the Goods and Lading in her,
upon a very hopeful Trading Uoyage to <hi>China,</hi> which were carried to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and there all <hi>de facto</hi>
without due Process of Law confiscated; And that also in the same Year another Ship of our said
Subject, called the <hi>Henry Bonadventura</hi> being come on ground near the Island <hi>Mauritius,</hi> was there
both Ship and Goods seized upon by some of the Officers and Ministers, and others under the Command
of the said <hi>East-India</hi> Company, and utterly detained from the right Owners. <hi>And whereas</hi> the said
<hi>William Courten,</hi> and his Assigns in his Life time, used all possible endeavours to recover the said
Ships and Goods, and to procure further Iustice against the Malefactors, and yet could obtain no Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

and Credit: And that thereupon, and upon the most humble supplication and Adresses of <hi>Francis</hi> Earl

Baronett, and Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi> Knight deceased; that We would take their Case into Our Princely
Consideration. <hi>We out of a just Sense</hi> We then had, and still have of their <hi>unjust sufferings</hi> in that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
both by Our own Letters under Our <hi>Sign Manual</hi> to the <hi>States General</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi>
and by Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> Knight and Baronet Our Envoy Extraordinary, to whom We gave
special Command so to do; required satisfaction to be made according to the rules of Iustice, and the
Amity and good correspondence which We then desired to conserve with them firm and inviolable. <hi>And
whereas</hi> after several Addresses made to the said <hi>States General</hi> by Our said Envoy, and nothing
granted effectual for Relief of our said Subjects, (whom We take Our selves in Honour and Iustice,
concerned to be satisfied and repaid,) We lately commanded the said Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> to intimate
and signifie to the said States, that We expected their final Answer concerning satisfaction to be made
for the said Ships and Goods by a time then prefixed, and since elapsed; that We might so govern Our
selves thereupon, that Our aforesaid Subjects might be relieved according to Right and Iustice; And yet
no satisfactory Answer hath béen given, so that We cannot but apprehend it to be, not only a fruitless
endeavour, but a prostituting of Our Honour and Dignity, to make further Application after so many
denyals and flightings. <hi>And whereas John Exton</hi> Doctor of Laws, Iudge of our High Admiralty Court
of <hi>England,</hi> upon Our Command, to certify to Us the value of the Losses and Damages sustained by

It is to be considered, that upon some Spoyls and Depredations done by the <hi>West-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Holland,</hi> to the <hi>English,</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Guinny,</hi> whereby the <hi>Affrican</hi> Company suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
great Dammages and Affronts, (the King and His Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
having particular shares and proportions therein,) for want of Satisfaction, and Reparation. In
conclusion, General Reprizals were Proclaimed against the States and their Subjects, before this
grant aforesaid passed, for Particular and Special Reprizals in <hi>Courtens</hi> Case; although it was
in agitation some years before. Yet after all this, the Proprietors Applyed themselves respectively
to the States, and Directors of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, to accomodate that Affair, rather then
to put the said Grant into Execution, and when nothing would prevail; several Commissions in
the year 1666. were Assigned to Captain <hi>Edward Lucy, Nicholas Carew, Iohn Holmes, Edward
Manning, Tyrence Byrne,</hi> and other Captains and Commanders, who brought in several Ships
and their Ladings as Prize; but in regard the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Traded under the Colours and Trusts of the
<hi>Swedes, Hamburgers, Flemmings, Breamers, Dantzickers, Lubeckers,</hi> and other Nations in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amity with <hi>England;</hi> the Ships and Goods so brought in, were most of them claimed by
several Agents from the Subjects of those Nations, or the Residents of those Princes and States,
whereupon they were restored by the Judge of the Admiralty; so that there was not <hi>bona fide</hi>
Fifteen Hundred Pounds recovered, as by the Register in the Court of Admiralty appears, before a
Proclimation Issued forth on the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1666. to suspend the Execution of the said Letters
Patents, under pretence of Misdemeanours in the Captains, with an Order of the Councel Table
of the same Date, to Commit the said <hi>George Carew,</hi> who granted the said Commissions; although
neither of the said Captains, nor the said <hi>Carew</hi> were ever Summoned, or Questioned judicially, to
answer any charge against them.</p>
            <p>Then the Proprietors, and Persons interested, Presented their Petition to His Majestie, to have
some satisfaction for the present, out of the Prizes taken from the <hi>East-India</hi> Company of <hi>Holland,</hi>
and others by the Kings Ships; but answer was given, that they were to be disposed for other
Services; the War being Proclaimed for General Reprizals, and that the Petitionors might resort
to their own special Grant, in a more seasonable time, the Seamen being wanting for the Kings
Ships.</p>
            <p>Then some of the most considerable Creditors, made several inspections into His Majesties

                        <p>ANd you Gentlemen of the House of Commons, I know not whether it be worth My
pains, to endeavour to remove a vile Iealousie, which some ill Men scatter abroad,
and which I am sure will never sinck into the breast of any Man who is worthy to sit
upon your Benches; that when you have given me a Noble and proportionable Supply, for
the support of a War, I may be induced by some evil Councelors, (for they will be thought
to think very respectively of my own Person,) to make a suddain Peace, and get all that
Mony for my own private occasions.</p>
                        <p>But let me tell you, and you may be most confident of it, that when I am compelled to
enter into a War, for the Protection, Honour, and Benefit of my Subjects; I will (God
Willing) not make a Peace, but upon the obtaining and securing those ends, for which the
War is entred into; and when that can be done, no good Man will be sorry for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of it.</p>

WHereupon the Commons of <hi>England</hi> acknowledging, (in the Preamble of their
Acts) with all humility and thankfulness to His Majestie, for his abundant care
in their preservation at Sea, and of the great Charge necessary for the defence thereof,
Granted at several times, Five Millions, Four Hundred and Four Thousand Seven
Hundred and Fifty Pounds Eleven Shillings and Eight Pence; for Extraordinary
Supplies towards the Wars, out of which his Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> had
the Sum of One Hundred, and Twenty Thousand, Nine Hundred and Two Pounds,
Fiftéen Shillings and Eight Pence, a Months Tax, for his Heroick courage at Sea, against
the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this consideration, the said Creditors, and those intrested in the Letters Patents,
for the special Reprizals, applied themselves, again in season, and out of season, to His
Majestie and the Councel, for some Reparations, out of the Imbeazilments of the Prizes
taken by the Kings Ships, from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or out of the Monies given by Parliament;
but answer was made, that His Majestie had done for the Petitioners already, all what
the Law required, and so they might rest satisfi'd therewith, the Debt being stated and
ascertained by a Grant for reparation under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi>

the <hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> and <hi>Henry Bonadventura,</hi> applied themselves to the King, and
Ambassadors Extroardinary on both sides; as also unto the Directors of the <hi>East-India</hi>

Treaty in the World, nor mentioned in any Article of the other Treaties with <hi>France,</hi>
or <hi>Denmark,</hi> made at the same time in <hi>Breda,</hi> but were Couched in by <hi>John de Wit,</hi> as

Debts, Accounts, and sunis of Money of <hi>Englishmen;</hi> gotten into the Banks of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi>

            <p>The Treaty of Commerce, and Common Alliance being so concluded; It is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
and worthy of your Observation, what followed within few Years after;
upon the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>August Old stile.</hi> Behold the judgement of God Almighty, in his
Providence concerning the said <hi>Iohn de Wit,</hi> (that so worded and writ the Articles of
the said Treaty,) and <hi>Cornelius de Wit</hi> his Brother <hi>Burgomaster of Dort,</hi> Plenipotentiary
in the Surprize at <hi>Chattam,</hi> during the said Treaty.</p>
            <p>Their Tongues were cut out of their Heads,<note place="margin">10. August 1672. Old stile.</note> and their Fingers cut off their Hands, and
their Lungs pulled out of their Bodies by their own Subjects in the <hi>Hague;</hi> even
in the view and presence of the said <hi>George Carew,</hi> who was then a Prisoner there,
Committed by the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> under pretence of a Spie, but escaped the danger,
and had been formerly, (at the instance of some common claimers of <hi>Dutch</hi> Goods)
committed at <hi>London,</hi> by Order of the Councel, on the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1666. as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid;
and the Letters Patents for 151612 <hi>l.</hi> and Damages, on the same day or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be suspended.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1671. the Treary at <hi>Breda,</hi> being declared void by the King and Councel,
and another War Proclaimed for General Reprizals. The Proprietors of the <hi>Bona Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza</hi>
and <hi>Henry Bonadventura</hi> made fresh application to the King and Councel, for
publick relief against the <hi>States,</hi> (a Common Wealth sensible, neither of Conscience
nor Honour) in <hi>Courtens Case;</hi> whereupon it was referred to a select Commitee of the
Lords of the Councel, who reported their opinion, under their Hands <hi>in terminis,</hi> as
follows, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In obedience to your Majesties Order in Councel,<note place="margin">Referrees, Lord Arlington, Lord Ashley, Mr. Treasurer, Mr. Secretary Trevor, Sir John Duncomb,</note> on the 22. of <hi>March</hi> 1671. We Humbly
represent to your Majestie, that the Debt and Damages of those Petitioners, being stated
under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> whereby its granted by your Majesty, that 151612 <hi>l.</hi> with
all Costs and Charges shall be Reprized. We further humbly represent to your Majesty, that
by the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> all reparations were extinguished, and cut off. Yet since that time the
<hi>States General</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> have not only been refractory in the performance of any
agreement concluded on, but also have committed many violences and depredations, whereby
they have wholly cancel'd the obligations of all past Treaties and Agreements, and left your
Majestie and your Subjects as free in all Iustice and Equity, as if they never had been made.
And therefore we humbly presume, to report our opinions to your Majesty, that it is now but
just and seasonable, for your Majestie to insist upon reparations, for the Debt and Damages
aforesaid.</p>
            <p>In pursuance whereof, His Majestie on the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1672. sent his Lettes under
his Sign Manual (to omit no time) to his Plenipotentiaries then at <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> to require
intire and full satisfaction and reparations of the <hi>States General,</hi> in the singular Case of
<hi>Courten,</hi> expressing with great zeal and earnestness, that his care in that case, should
be to protect his Subjects in their just rights, as well as to Assist them in the recovery
thereof. Afterwards by express Order of the Councel Board, Instructions were given
to the Lords Ambassadors, and Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Cologne,</hi> to that end and purpose.</p>
            <p>The <hi>States</hi> then underhand appealed, by their Printed Papers, to the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi>
for a seperate Peace, in that juncture when they were almost brought upon their Knees,
and would not condescend to any agreement at <hi>Cologne,</hi> but sent a Letter to the King,
by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador, unto whom they had given a procuration, with instructions
to make up such a suddain Peace with the King; whereupon His Majestie made this
Speech following to both House of Parliament, on the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>Ianuary, 1673. Old stile.</hi>

                        <p>To avoid this Imputation, they have now sent Me a Letter by the

            <p>The Substance of the Overtures in the said Letter, being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated

            <p>THat the <hi>States General,</hi> and their Subjects, should acknowledge the

            <p>That a regulation of Trade should be settled and adjusted in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>

Seventh Article was Interlarded, concerning the Memorable Treaty at

This last Treaty being Concluded, Ratified, and Published, the Interested in the <hi>Bona
Esperanza,</hi> and <hi>Bonadventura,</hi> Addressed themselves, both to the King, and the <hi>States
General,</hi> respectively, to be paid and satisfied out of the <hi>Pattacoons,</hi> Protesting, otherwise
that they should be necessitated to put their Letters Patents into Execution, to Levy
and Reprize their Debt and Damages aforesaid.</p>
            <p>The Proprietors were in good hopes, they should not meet with any difficulty in
attaining their ends, when they found the Treaty Signed by five Principal Ministers
of State, on the Kings side, <hi>(viz.) H. Finch,</hi> C. S. <hi>Latimer, Ormond, Arlington,</hi> and
<hi>H. Coventry;</hi> For that the Warrant and Proceedings, concerning the said Patent passed
through the Lord <hi>Arlington's</hi> Office, when he was Secretary of State, and directed to
Sir <hi>Heneage Finch,</hi> to prepare the Bill when he was Sollicitor General, in the time that
the <hi>Lord Roberts</hi> kept the Privy-Seal, and had been debated by <hi>H. Coventry,</hi> when he
was Ambassador at <hi>Breda,</hi> and the <hi>Pattacoons</hi> left to the disposing of <hi>Latimer</hi> Lord
High Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> who knew the Kings Honour and Reputation lay at stake
with His Subjects, concerning that Affair.</p>
            <p>But yet nevertheless, a <hi>4th.</hi> Part of the said <hi>Pattacoons,</hi> were presently Assigned to
be paid to <hi>Alderman Backwel,</hi> for other Services, and the <hi>Six hundred thousand</hi>
remaining, were transferred by the said <hi>Latimers</hi> advice, (and another Minister of
State, much admired in <hi>Holland</hi>) to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for old Debts due to his

            <p>Wereupon Divers of the Creditors finding there Rights, Liberties, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Invaded; first, strictly Examined the several Treaties, and then reduced
their Case into two Questions, as follows, and took the Advice of several
most Learned Lawyers thereupon, (viz.)</p>
            <p>1: Whether the Letters Patents for Reprizals before-mentioned at large, in Folio 4, 5.
and the Powers and Authority thereby granted, can be Revoked, Repealed, or the Execution
thereof Suspended by Proclamation. <hi>Scire facias, Supersedeas,</hi> Articles of Peace, or any way
whatsoever, before Satisfaction and Reparation should be had or made, for the said 151612 <hi>l.</hi>
to the Persons Interested and Injured, or not.</p>
            <p>2 Whether any particular Debts, due from the Subjects of the <hi>States General,</hi> to Sir
<hi>William Courten,</hi> or Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> their Executors; Administrators, or Assigns, by
Bills of Exchange, Bonds, Accompts, Covenants, or other private Contracts in Trade, were
Released or Discharged, by the said Articles of the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> recited in <hi>Folio</hi> 7. or
were ever intended to be Comprized, or Comprehended, within the said Articles, or not.</p>
            <p>Answer to the First Question.</p>
            <p>OUR Forefathers were so careful of Merchants Rights and Properties, and so Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
for the Maintenance and Encouragement of Navigation, and Commerce;
that in all Cases of Spoyls and Depredations, whereupon any Offences, Injuries,
Damages, or Losses, at any time happened to the Subjects of <hi>England, at Sea,</hi> the Injured
applyed themselves for present Relief to the Writ;<note place="margin">Register of Writs 126.</note> 
               <hi>de arresto facto super bonis mercato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
alienigenium pro transgr. facta mercatoribus Angliae;</hi> and the words Recited in the
Writ, are for that the Offence is done, <hi>contra Legem &amp; Rationem,</hi> and not <hi>contra
pacem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In those days the Persons and Gods of Merchants Strangers, were Arrested in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for the Offences and Injuries committed, by the Subjects of the Prince or State,
unto whom they belonged that did the Damage. Whereupon the Subjects belonging
to the <hi>Maritine Provinces,</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Bourgundy,</hi> and divers parts of <hi>France,</hi>
comming to the <hi>Staple</hi> and <hi>Mart Towns</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> made great complaints to the King
and Councel, of grievous pressures upon them, by suffering in <hi>English Ports</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi>
for the Offences of other Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44046:8"/>
In consequence whereof an Act of Parliament, passed in their favour, 27. <hi>Edw. 3.
Statute 2 Chap.</hi> 17 That the Rigour of those Writs should be taken away, and in liew
thereof, in all Cases of Spoils, the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> should for their Relief have the
Law of <hi>Marque,</hi> without Fraud or Delay, therefore to prevent the failer of Iustice, such
Letters were to be granted Effectually; otherwise liberty would be taken to commit the
greatest Injuries and Offences whatsoever, unpunishable, to the prejudice of all Commerce,
and Humane Society.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Justinian</hi> agreeth herewith in his Book <hi>de jure Nat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Grotius</hi> sayes that the later Lawyers calls it the Right of Reprizals, the <hi>Saxons</hi>
and old <hi>English Withernam,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Letters of <hi>Marque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In several Countries they are asked of the Iudges, and by the Common Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they were used to be asked of the King, but the Subjects finding many Delays, and
great Expences in those proceedings, to their vast prejudice by Secretaries of State.</p>
            <p>Upon the Complaints of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament, an Act passed in the
<hi>4th.</hi> Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> whereby a remedy was provided, for their more speedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
in all Cases of Spoyls, and Depredations, against Leagues, Amities, Truces, and
safe Conducts, the parties grieved, having liberty thereby to Address themselves to the
Keeper of the Privy Seal for the time being, for Letters of Request, who (upon
Manifest proofs and Evidence, of the wrong appearing) shall grant Letters of Request,
in due form (if so required) for Restitution and Reparations, from the parties that
did the Injury, <hi>(that is to say, from the Prince, State, or Supream Power)</hi> which if not
made in a convenient time prefixed, that then the Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> shall
make to the party grieved, Letters of <hi>Marque</hi> or Reprizals, under the Great Seal of
<hi>England,</hi> in due form of Law; And by a Statute in the <hi>14th. Edw. 4th.</hi> It was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
Established, and Confirmed, that all Statutes, and Ordinances against Offences,
Injuries, Damages, and Losses, done by Breakers of Leagues, Amities, Truces, and safe
Conducts, shall be in full Force and Effect.</p>
            <p>By which Statute-Law (wherein every Subject of <hi>England</hi> hath an Interest,) the Lord
Privy Seal, and Lord Chancellour are bound to grant the said Letters Respectively.
<hi>Ex Officio,</hi> of Common right, they being upon their Oaths to do their Office Iustly;
otherwise it would be a Uiolation of their trust.</p>
            <p>And therefore without Satisfaction and Reparations first had, and obtained in the Case
of <hi>Courten</hi> for the Debt of 151612 l. and Damages, the Chancellour cannot legally
pass any Act, <hi>Supersedeas</hi> or Proclamation under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> to Revoke or
make void the said Letters Patents, or to suspend the Execution thereof, <hi>(being the
effect and fruit of several Acts of Parliament, for Relief of particular Subjects, that were
Spoyled and Injured, against Leagues of Common Amity and Truces.)</hi> Whereas in the
High Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> his Lordship cannot Relieve any Person whatsoever, Stranger
or Denizon against a Statute-Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grotius</hi> and the Learned <hi>Selden</hi> agree, that after a Depredation Committed by the
Subjects of one Nation, to those of another; and that the Damage hath been Stated,
and Letters of Request Issued forth, and Iustice denied or delayed, that Immediatly
such Damage becomes a National Debt, to the particular Persons Injured; and by the
Laws of Nations it ought to be recovered and Paid; therefore Remedy is provided, by the
Laws and Statutes of <hi>England</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>When an Authority passeth by the Kings Grant, to such injured Persons of Common
Right, coupled with an interest, to Levie and Recover the Debt and Damages, when once
the Power is Granted (as the Law directs,) the same cannot by any subsequent Act of the
King, be Bound or Suspended, without satisfaction to the Parties Grieved, and the reason
is plain, because such a Grant and Execution upon it, is no Breach of Peace, or common
Alliance, between Princes and States. And it's against the Honour and Interest of the King,
both at Home And Abroad; to diminish his own Prerogative, and Royal Grant, (before
satisfaction obtained) the Patent being published for a President, in several Languages
amongst all the Neighbouring Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44046:9"/>
Answer to the Second Question.</p>
            <p>THat the private Interest of the Subjects of either side, upon Debts, Accounts, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
or any civil Contract, in Merchandizing upon the Land, cannot be in
any Measure comprized, or comprehended within any Article of the Treaty at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
under the notion of Offences, Injuries, Damages and Losses. Therefore they cannot
fall under that Construction, or forced Interpretation of those Words; which were
intended naturally to Arise from Spoyls and Depredations, terms that ought to have
been used in the said Articles; but that the transgressors would Pallitate, Spoyls, and
Depredations, by the names of Losses, Injuries, and Damages; and the two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Articles being relative to the third, having a Dependance upon the said Offences,
Injuries, Damages, and Losses, no particular or private Debt, and Damage, can fall
under that construction; otherwise all <hi>English-mens Money</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and Consequently
all <hi>Dutch mens Money</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> gotten into the Hands of <hi>Bankers</hi> on either side,
might have been confiscated. But the Wars being Proclaimed for General Reprizals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and States; particular Men Traded each with other, notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>It was therefore an Apparent Breach of the Laws, of Common Amity, and of the
Alliance, with the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> for the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> on the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
1676. to send their Express Order in Writing to the ordinary Courts of Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and the <hi>Hague;</hi> interdicting, and Prohibiting the Iudges from
Granting any Process, or doing any Iustice against <hi>Jacob Pergens,</hi> at the Suit of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>English-men</hi> for Debts, due upon Bills, Bonds, and Covenants, for repayment of
Moneys gotten into his Hands, under several trusts.</p>
            <p>After this Solemn Debate and Resolution upon those two Points
in Question were over; a grand Objection was raised by the
Civil Lawyers then Present, which was Answered as follows
in Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> THat a Soveraign Prince having the power of Peace and War in his
Hands, being the <hi>Sole Arbiter</hi> thereof, may make use of a private
Interest, for the publique Necessity, as <hi>Sole Legislator</hi> in such Cases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> sayes, that all Humane Laws are Righteous Decrees, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Natural and Eternal Law, and that there is no Law Iust,
or Legitimate, except it agree with them both. All Power being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within the Bounds of Equity and Reason; there is no Plea or Bar to be allowed
against the Law of Nature, which is Immutable.</p>
            <p>It's Granted, that God Almighty having trusted Soveraign Princes with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the Protection and Preservation of their Subjects, in their Goods and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.
It if be just, the Supream Power, hath sufficient Authority to Restrain any
particular Mans Right, for every Mans Good; yet it was ever found most reasonable in
all Ages, that when a private Interest was Sacrifized for a Common good, a recompence
was made for the private Damages, out of the publick Purse.</p>
            <p>Cicero, Tertullian, <hi>and other most Learned Authors, do all agree in this point.</hi> Verum
etsi nostrae tempore necessitatis Patriae conferre debeamus, tamen jure naturae congrui ut Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis
salus, Communis utilitas periculum, non unius duntaxat aut alterius, sed Communibus
impensis, jacturis periculisque comparetur.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44046:9"/>
BY the Law of Nature, if a Soveraign Prince and State, enter into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
one with the other, upon certain Conditions; the Contract is viod,
if the Conditions are not performed.</p>
            <p>To clear this point, we need not go far for Presidents; the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
having declared both the former Treaties, (in the year 1662. and 1667.) With the
<hi>States General</hi> to be void upon that account: The <hi>States</hi> having been refractory in
the performance of Agreements concerning <hi>Poleroon,</hi> and in making reparation for
other matters; As even the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> was Pronounced null and void, upon
the like score about <hi>Surrinam, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereby it appears, that <hi>Carew's</hi> Right and Demand, was not abolished, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished;
(although seemingly suspended,) which was revived by the Supream Power,
and Legislator, the Original Grant remaining Extant upon Record in the Rolls, to be
put into Execution, when opportunity best serves; until satisfaction and reparation shall
be made, by the one means, or the other.</p>
            <p>Now I must Beg your Honours further Patience and Pardon; to
shew your Honours who are the most Competent Judges, that
the States General and their Subjects, have not only been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory,
in the Performance of the 8th. and 9th. Articles agreed
upon, in the last Treaty; but possitively Broke the first and
fifth Article of the Treaty Marine; Signed at London <date>the 1st. of
December 1674.</date> By the Commissioners following. (viz.)</p>

setting forth the Sinister Practices used by <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburgh</hi>
Merchant: Nephew and sole Executor of Sir <hi>Peter Courten,</hi> in
Possessing himself of the Estate, Real and Personal of the said Sir <hi>Peter;</hi>
avoiding to come to any Accompt for the same, and obstructing the ordinary
Court of Iustice during his life, as his Sons and Heirs have since done;
whereby the due Administration of Iustice hath been often denied, and the
Iudicial Acts and Decrees of the Prerogative Court, and High Court of
Chancery in this Kingdom, slighted and contemn'd in the ordinary Courts of
Iudicature in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand;</hi> Whereby Order from the <hi>States</hi> in the

of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds. And therefore praying that speedy
satisfaction may be required from the Embassadour Extraordinary of the
<hi>States General,</hi> or that Commissioners on either side may be forthwith named
to inspect the Accompts, between both Parties, and determine the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

of <hi>October</hi> next, for hearing the Petitioners at the Board, concerning this

AFter two of the Petitioners, with a Friend of theirs, Addressed themselves to
<hi>Mons. Van Beuninghen</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassador, at his House in <hi>Westminster,</hi> with
Authentique Copies of the said Orders, under the Seal of the Office; Desiring that his
Excellency would take notice thereof, and make any defence at the Council Table, by
his Advocates if he pleased; Whereupon after he and his Secretary had perused the
same, his Excellency toar the Orders in Pieces, and gave the Petitioners very Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Language, and so parted out of his Anti-chamber.</p>
            <p>Then some of the Creditors, who thought they had done a kindness to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
by sending him timely notice, caused the said Order of Councel to be Printed,
with the Embssadors Deportment underneath, and sent him the same in a Letter;
who thereupon gave in a long Memorial on the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1677. in <hi>French</hi>
to the King, Complaining that three Persons had highly Affronted him, by leaving a
Citation with him, to appear before the Council Table, on the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
Alledging in his said Memorial, that it was a proceeding of a very high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(the most Injurious violation of the Respects to the most Sacred Laws of Nations)
and prayed Reparations proportionable to the Grandeur of so outragious and publique
Offence; And moreover, that His Majesty would oblige the Interested Persons, to wave
all their said demands, as Mortified and Extinguished pretences,</p>
            <p>It was a grand Mistake in his Excellency, after all his <hi>Rodomontadoes</hi> to call Copies
of Orders of Council <hi>Citations,</hi> who should have understood better, (being bred an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,)
that the Council Board was no <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Iudicature;</hi> and that <hi>Citations</hi> could not
Issue from that Board.</p>
            <p>Yet without the least Summons, Sir <hi>Ioseph Williamson,</hi> one of the Principal Secretaries
of State for the time being, gave a warrant to a Messenger, who with a Constable
and a Smith, on the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1677. Broke open Mr. <hi>Carew's</hi> Chamber and
Study doors, in his absence, and took away what Papers and Writings they pleased;
and afterwards Seized upon Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> himself, who was Committed to the <hi>Gate House</hi>
by another Warrant, Signed by the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> Sir <hi>Ioseph Williamson</hi> and others, on
the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1677. and there detained from all his own private Affairs, all the
whole <hi>Michaelmas-Term;</hi> The Judges of the <hi>Kings-Bench Bar</hi> refusing to take Bail, which
was ready in Court, upon the return of several Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> but still the
said <hi>Carew</hi> was Re-manded back into Custody at the instance of the Kings Attorney
General, and Sollicitor General; until he should comply with the said Ambassador's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
who by his Secretary demanded, that the said <hi>Carew</hi> should acquit all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
whatsoever, in a most Solemn manner; as appeared by the <hi>Affidavit</hi> of Mr.
<hi>Robert Ayleway,</hi> the Copy whereof hereafter follows.</p>

                           <abbr>Esq</abbr> the Copies
whereof are hereunto annexed, and are true Copies, as he this Deponent believed,
the one to the King and Councel on the <hi>9th.</hi> Instant <hi>November,</hi> and the other to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Ambassador on the <hi>10th.</hi> Instant, both Importing the said <hi>Carew</hi>'s Liberty, out of his
Restraint in the <hi>Gate-House.</hi> And this Deponent as to the first, he delivered it into the
Kings own hand, at the Council Board; Whereupon it was Ordered the same Evening, that
Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> should be discharged upon the Ambassadors Certificate that he is satisfied, or
to that effect; then this Deponent delivered the other Petition to the said Ambassadors
Secretary the next day following, who Read the said Petition, and said it was well, and
told the Deponent that he would shew his Excellency the said Petition, and speak to him
about it, and this Deponent should receive his Answer thereupon the next day at <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
if this Deponent would meet him there, which he this Deponent accordingly did, and
after some Conference and Debate of the matter, the said Secretary told him, this Deponent,
in the presence of Mr. <hi>Robert Coke,</hi> and other Gentlemen, that his Excellency was not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
And now the said <hi>Carew</hi> must lye in Prison, untill he hath satisfied the World,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44046:12"/>
that he hath abused the <hi>States,</hi> and that he hath no Title to any such Pretentions; and that
his Excellency expected that Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> should quit his Pretentions in such an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and Solemn manner, that there should never be the least mention made of them again, and
repeated the same several times over, or words to that effect. And at last, said, I might be
assured that it was Expected, and would be insisted upon; so that it was in vain to make any
further application, unless he would, (<hi>meaning Mr. Carew</hi>) quit his Pretentions.</p>

            <p>SO the said <hi>Carew</hi> was continued in Prison, until he was forced to Subscribe a Paper
drawn by Mr. <hi>Secretary Williamson,</hi> worded to this Effect, that the said <hi>Carew</hi> had
caused the said Ambassador to be cited by two Orders of the Councel-Board, and also
caused the said Orders to be Printed without Licence, for which he asks his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
Pardon; upon which he was Discharged, paying Serjeant <hi>Dike</hi> his Fees.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the said Paper was caused to be Printed, and most Scandalously fixed upon
the <hi>Exchange</hi> and <hi>White-Hall-Gate,</hi> pretending to vindicate the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassador;
who got neither Credit nor Honour by this Transaction, from any Intelligible Persons,
either upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> or even amongst the <hi>Dutch Congregations</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and
elsewhere in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Juncture of time, the Creditors and Petitioners could not be heard at Councel-Board,
upon the said two Orders; A new Alliance by a Marriage being in agitation,
between the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> and the <hi>Lady Mary,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Daughter, which
was promoted and effected by the <hi>Earl of Danby's</hi> procurement, (as the Author of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
State of the <hi>Earl of Danby's</hi> Case Affirms) for Rooting out the <hi>French</hi> Interest
at Court, and securing the Protestant Religion.</p>
            <p>Then a small Memorial in writing, of the Services of Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> was delivered into His Majesties own Hand,
and several Lords of the Council-Table; but not to lay any stress upon that, (as to
the Merrits of the Forraign Causes, in the two Orders of Council) being Honorary
Ingagements upon the Crown, and Incumbant upon the King, his Heirs and Successors,
for Debts, contracted, for Diamonds, and other Jewels of the Crown; as also for vast
Sums of Money, after the return of Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi> from <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where he
had served <hi>King Iames,</hi> and the <hi>Turky</hi> Company, Eleven Years, as Ambassador to the
Grand <hi>Seigneur,</hi> and much improved the <hi>Levant</hi> Trade; which Debts are still owing,
yet nothing would procure so much as a Conference, or the least Overture of any
satisfaction or reparation for the <hi>Bona Esperanza, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>States General</hi> having made Peace with <hi>France,</hi> and in a Common Alliance with
their Confederats at <hi>Algiers;</hi> The Creditors and Proprietors concerned in the Letters
Patents for Reprizals aforesaid, in the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1680. Looking upon it then
a very seasonable opportunity to repair themselves, the <hi>Dutch</hi> being at Peace with all
the World, (a season that no Common Claymours could appear.) Whereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to Equipp, and set forth three several Ships and Pynaces, in pursuance of the
Authority granted, as aforesaid, and to that end and purpose concluded upon the Ships
Names, the Commanders, <hi>viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Compton, Gwyther,</hi> Captain <hi>Reger Hawkshead,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Thomas Wood,</hi> with their number of Men, Guns, and Victualling, and entered
the same in the Admiralty accordingly.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Tyrence Byrne,</hi> being appointed for one Ship; while he was fitting himself
with Men and Ammunition, the Sails were taken away by an Officer, pretending he
had a lawful Warrant for the same, from the Lords of the Admiralty; as also to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<hi>Richard Chappel</hi> Master of the Ship, who was forced to give Bayl, to answer a
Charge as a Criminal; And the said <hi>George Carew,</hi> having a Summons from Sir <hi>Lyonel
Ienkins</hi> to appear at the Councel-Board on the <hi>11th,</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1680. He appeared, and

                           <abbr>Esq</abbr> were Equipping and Arming a small Frigat called the

now is, and granted in favour of the Creditors of Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and others; And

the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1666. for divers great and notable Misdemeanors committed in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Letters and Commissions of Reprizal, are intirely Revoaked and Annulled. His Majesty

Letters of Countermarque against the said Subjects, and their Goods, to the hindring

have his Treaties duly executed, and that it be made known, and may appear of Record
to all his Loving Subjects, that the said Letters of Reprizal are Revoaked, and Declared
void; to the end also that none may hereafter presume to Act by vertue thereof; and if any
do that, they may be proceeded against as Pirats, acting without Commission, and as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractors

               <p>THe Ancient Laws of <hi>England,</hi> in the Case of Spoyls, were grounded upon right
reason; for that every <hi>English Man,</hi> living here in an <hi>Island,</hi> had not Moneys
to right himself against Forraigners, in their own Country, so often as they
would take advantage by Injuring them to make their own Markets; neither could an
<hi>English Man</hi> expect to find Iustice abroad without delay, where the Offenders (for the
most part) were Parties and, Iudges themselves.</p>
               <p>But when the Persons, or Goods of Merchants Strangers, were once Arrested, or
Attached here, they would find means suddainly to Retaliate their Dammages at home,
upon the Offenders: Even as at this time, if a <hi>Fisher Man</hi> should be attaqued at Sea,
for the <hi>East-India Companies</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> in the Towns of <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Zealand,</hi> would quickly make the <hi>East-India Companie,</hi> or their Directors in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and <hi>Middleburgh</hi> Refund their Dammages; or otherwise they would <hi>Dde
Wit</hi> them, or pull down their Houses in that Popular, and Tumultuous Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now I appeal to all unbiassed and impartial Men, whether Iudicial Grants under the
<hi>Great Seal of England,</hi> made pursuant to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, obtained
by such steps and measures mentioned in the body of the Grant, for Reprizing the 151612l.
with Damages, ought not to have the effect of the Law, by Seizing the value or by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
Notwithstanding any such Extrajudicial Acts or Proclamations, and pretended <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedeas.</hi>
The Laws of <hi>England</hi> having so secured the Distinct Rights, and Properties
of the Subjects, that it is not in the Kings Power, by any Act of State (unless by
Parliament) to dispose of His Subjects Goods.</p>
               <p>Or whether there was any necessity, (the <hi>Dutch Ambassador the Here Van Leuven
Affirming</hi> that the 800000 <hi>Pattacones</hi> were given, to take off the durable Grant for
Reprizals by which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were bound) That three parts of the <hi>Pattacones</hi> should be
Assigned to the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> for old Debts; and no part to the Proprietors of the <hi>Bona
Espranza;</hi> nor for the Great <hi>Diamonds,</hi> Sold to the late King by Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> (not
yet paid for) Pawned by the late <hi>Queen,</hi> for half the value in <hi>Amsterdam. Jure naturae
equam est neminem cum alterius detrimento &amp; injuria fieri locupletiorem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There lies a necessity upon the Creditors, to let the World know <hi>quod defertur non
auferter;</hi> and that both Nations concerned, may remember they did not only Smart, but
Bleed for the Iniquity and Ingratitude of the times, wherein the Grieved and Oppressed
could finde no Relief.</p>
               <p>It is necessary also to remember that Sir <hi>Albertus Joachimy the Dutch Ambassador,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
in Ordinary in <hi>England Anno.</hi> 1644. Had notice given him of the Monition out
of the <hi>High Court of Admiralty,</hi> fixed upon the <hi>Exchange;</hi> that several Persons were
upon Examination in <hi>perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> to prove the Spoyls and Dammages of
the <hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> with the loss of divers <hi>Marriners</hi> Lives; but the said Ambassador
would make no defence therein, but suffered Iudgment <hi>pro confesso</hi> by default.</p>
               <p>Although Fellony be Pardonable by the Prince, the Trover is not, even as in the Case
of Murther, but not the appeal; The Subject hath a natural liberty at his own Suit to take
his remedy, otherwise all Right and Propertie might be Destroyed.</p>
               <p>It's Granted, that the King may by His Prerogative, make a necessary Garrison in
time of War, in any of His Subjects Houses, Castles, and Lands, for the Common
Defence, and Protection of His People (making compensation.) But a great <hi>Lawyer</hi>
and <hi>Privy Councellor,</hi> would affirm, that the King having the Power, of Peace and War,
may Grant away a Subjects Castle, or other his Freeholds in a publick Treaty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Satisfaction or Price, which is against the Law of property; and not warrantable
by any Reason of State.</p>

               <head>The Case and unjust Sentence upon it.</head>
               <p>IN the Year 1665. Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> having taken an old <hi>Fly Boat,</hi> of 200. <hi>Tun, Dutch Built</hi> named the <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Bristol,</hi> belonging
to several Merchants of that City, bound homewards from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> with <hi>Sugars, Cotton, Indigo, &amp;c.</hi> The said Ship and Goods
so taken, were Condemned by the Admiralty Court in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> as free Prize to the <hi>States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1666. The said Ship being set forth from <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to Sea, by the name of the <hi>Godileive</hi> of <hi>Brugit;</hi> under the Colour
of <hi>Iacob Neitz, Andreas Vanden Bogaerd, Michael Vander Plancken,</hi> Merchants of <hi>Brugis,</hi> and others, as owners upon a Voyage to <hi>France</hi>
for Wine, Brandy, and Salt. Captain <hi>Tyrence Byrne</hi> Commander of a small Frigat named the <hi>Royal,</hi> having a Commission from the
said <hi>George Carew,</hi> persuant to the Letters Patents aforesaid, for Reprizals against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> Seized the said Ship near <hi>Port-land</hi> Bayin
the Month of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1666. Laden with Wine Salt and other Goods from <hi>France,</hi> bound for <hi>Amsterdam</hi> as by the Bills of Lading appeared.</p>
               <p>The Master and Seamen being Examined by Mr. <hi>Exton</hi> the Mayor, and other Magistrates of <hi>Chichester,</hi> upon a Commission sent by
Mr. <hi>Suckling,</hi> out of the Admiralty Court, at the instance of <hi>Ionathan Frost,</hi> part owner of the Royal Frigat, the whole Ships Company
confessed themselves to be <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> Born, that the Ship was taken by <hi>de Ruiter</hi> under the circumstances aforesaid, and
that they were bound for <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> the Goods being Assigned to Merchents there. Whereupon <hi>Sir Lyonell Ienkins</hi> decreed, that there
was good cause of Seizure, and condemned the pietended owners of the said Ship <hi>Godileive</hi> in Expences but in regard one <hi>Peter Gerrard</hi>
a <hi>French-man</hi> appeared by Mr. <hi>Francklin</hi> his Proctor, and claymed the said Ship and Goods, in the names of the said <hi>Iacob Neitz</hi>
and others, the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Subjects, the Judge Ordered and decreed, that upon payment of the Costs aforesaid, and giving Bayl
to abide the Sentence of the Court, upon hearing the Cause; that then the Ship and Goods should be delivered to the Claymors,
(unto which the Captors Consented;) But <hi>Gerrard</hi> refusing to do the same; Arrested the Captain in an Action of 1000<hi>l.</hi> Valuing the
Ship and Goods at that rate, and the Captain being committed thereupon to the Marshalsea, gave sufficient Bayl to the liking of the
said <hi>Gerrard,</hi> and his Proctor; who neglected to proceed thereupon; But upon new examinations of the Master and Seamen, <hi>Exparte,</hi>
procured a sentence for discharging the said Ship and Goods, and a Writ of Restitution, whereupon the Vicadmiral and the Custom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house-waitors,
(in whose Custody they were) delivered the same accordingly.</p>
               <p>Then finding some Imbezelements of the Salt and Wine in the Port of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and other Damages by lying so long in dispute

Arbitrary and unjust sentence against them all, for 1800<hi>l.</hi> Damages, in spoyling their Voyage; and Imbezealing their Goods; From
which Sentence Sir <hi>Edmond Turnor,</hi> and <hi>George Carew</hi> appealed by themselves to the King in the High Court of <hi>Chancery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the Lord <hi>Keeper Bridgeman,</hi> appointed the Lord <hi>Chief Iustice Rainsford, Iudge Wilde, Iudge Windham,</hi> and <hi>Baron Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton,</hi>
(as adjuncts) with Sir <hi>Richard Lloyd,</hi> Sir <hi>Timetly Baldwin,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Low,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pinfold,</hi> Dr. <hi>Trumbal,</hi> Dr. <hi>Digby,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Briggs,</hi>
or a Competent number of them by Commission to re-hear and determine the same; But the Judges upon several debates, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in their opinions, Concerning the Law of <hi>England,</hi> in Cases of Personal Injuries; and that <hi>Turnor</hi> and <hi>Carew</hi> ought not to suffer
for the Trespass of another; the Case depended undetermined until the Year 1678. Then one <hi>Peter Victorine</hi> appeared for the Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
(<hi>Peter Gerrard</hi> being run away,) and procured the Commission to be renewed by the Lord High Chancellor, who appointed the
Lord Chief <hi>Iustice North</hi> (who had denied a Prohibition in the Case) in the room of Justice <hi>Rainsford;</hi> And said the Cause of appeal
being appointed to be heard at <hi>Serjeants Inn</hi> in <hi>Chancery Lane,</hi> on the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1678.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Exton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thursby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Molloy,</hi> being of Council for the said <hi>Turnor</hi> and <hi>Carew,</hi> insisted (as the
truth was) that no proof appeared in all the Process transmitted against them; and that upon the said <hi>Neitz vander Plancken, &amp;c.</hi> Their
own shewing, the Imbezelements were done in the Port of <hi>Chichester</hi> after the Capture, which was in the body of the County of <hi>Sussex,</hi>
and therefore Tryable at the Common Law by Jury; the Admiralty having no Jurisdiction therein (several Statutes in the time of
King <hi>Ric. 2. Edw.</hi> 3. and <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. Expresly forbidding those Incroachments upon the Common Law of <hi>England.</hi>) Yet the Lord Chief
Justice <hi>North</hi> over-ruled all that was offered, and confirmed the said unjust and Arbitrary Sentence, and Signed the same; whereupon
Judge <hi>Wild</hi> and the rest followed, and did the like. The Sentence and Confirmation being brought ready drawn, and Ingrossed in
Parchment, by the said <hi>Francklin,</hi> for that end and purpose, who caused the said Judges to Admonish the said <hi>Carew,</hi> being then
present, to pay the said 1800<hi>l.Cum Expencis,</hi> before the first day of <hi>Easter Term</hi> following; against which Sentence, Confirmation,
and Admonition, the said <hi>Carew</hi> protested openly before the said Judges, as Erronious, Arbitrary, and unjust; and also appealed to
the last Parliament for a nullity thereof; As also for Caution for his Costs and Charges unjustly sustained and to be sustained therein,)
to be given by Mr. <hi>Foot</hi> a Merchant in <hi>Rood Lane,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hungerford,</hi> who after <hi>Victrine</hi> Died <hi>Insolvent,</hi> appeared for the said
Claymors; and Likewise for satisfaction of 500<hi>l.</hi> with Interest from Mr. <hi>William Walker</hi> a <hi>Gouldsmith,</hi> detained in his hands
from the said <hi>Carew,</hi> ever since the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> 1669. under pretence of being obliged to the said <hi>Peter Gerrard</hi> upon the
said <hi>Carews</hi> Appeal from the first Sentence. But the Parliament being Dissolved, the whole matter depends in <hi>statu quo,</hi> for Redress
according to the Judgment of Parliament, the Justice and Equity of the Nation.</p>
