         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Majesty;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO we come in the Rear of the Train of Mourners, to pay our Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary Tears for the unvaluable Loſs in the Death of your Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, and our moſt gracious Queen, yet our Reſentments of it are with as tender a Sympathy as are in the Breaſts of any of your Subjects. This gives the ſharpeſt Accent to our Paſſions, that the Conſiderations which are moſt proper and powerful to allay our Sorrows, exaſperate them: for while we remember what She was, how general and diffuſive a Bleſſing to three Kingdoms, the ſevere ſtroke of Providence in taking Her from us, is moſt afflicting. Such a Concurrence of high Perfection ſhin'd in Her Perſon and Actions that would have made Her Illuſtrious in a low Condition; and in Her exalted Station they were attractive of the Eyes and Admiration of all. Her Mind was above the Temptations that attend the Throne. Majeſty was mix'd with that condeſcending Humility. that tender and beneficent Goodneſs, that She was eaſily acceſſable to all for their Relief and Support. Her Piety and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were ſo conſpicuous, Her Affections were ſo compoſed and temperate, that the Court, that is uſually the Centre of Vanity and Voluptuouſneſs, became vertuous by the Impreſſion of Her Example. Her Converſation was ſo regular, that Her Enemies (if Goodneſs in ſuch a bright Eminency had any) could not faſten a Taint upon Her. Her Royal Endowments for Government, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Magnanimity, Vigilance and Care in managing Affairs of State (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the higheſt Princes are but civil Idols, uſeleſs and unprofitable to the World) theſe were in ſuch a degree of Excellency; that in your Majeſty's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Abſence, while you were defending the Intereſt of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> againſt a potent Enemy abroad, with the Sword of War, She ſweetly ordered all things at home with the Scepter of Peace. She is gone, and muſt return no more: O aſtoniſhing Grief! But it becomes us with humble Submiſſion to acquieſce in the Divine Diſpoſal. The Will of God is always directed by Infinite Wiſdom, and is the Rule of Goodneſs. We muſt refreſh our Sorrows with the hope that She is entered <hi>into her Saviours Joy,</hi> whom She imitated and honoured, and that She is made happy in the Love of God and the Light of his Countenance for ever.</p>
            <p>We humbly beſeech your Majeſty to accept the renewed Aſſurances of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable and conſtant Fidelity to your Perſon and Government; and that we ſhal influence all that are within our compas to perſevere in their Duty: We ſhall ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray to the bleſſed God to keep you in the beſt Protection, his encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Favours; to ſupport your Spirit with Divine Comforts, and to continue long your precious Life, ſo neceſſary for preſerving the pure Religion, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rights of this Kingdom.</p>
