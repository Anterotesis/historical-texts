            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE <hi>John Alexeiwitz</hi> and <hi>Peter Alexeiwitz,</hi> by the Grace of God, moſt Serene and Mighty Princes and Czaars, Sovereign Maſters of both <hi>Ruſſias,</hi> of <hi>Moskow, Kiow, Wlodimir,</hi> and <hi>Newgarden;</hi> Czaars of <hi>Caſan, Aſtracan,</hi> and <hi>Siberia;</hi> Lords of <hi>Pleskow;</hi> Great Dukes of <hi>Smolenkow, Twer, Jugoria, Perm, Wiathka, Bulgaria,</hi> and other Principalities: Great Dukes and Lords of the Low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Countries of <hi>Newgarden, Tzernigow, Reſan, Roſthow, Jeroſlaw, Berlowſery, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dory, Obdory,</hi> and <hi>Condiny;</hi> And Sovereign Princes of the Northern-Countries: Lords of the Countries of <hi>Twer;</hi> Czaars of the Countries of <hi>Carthaline</hi> and <hi>Gruſſene;</hi> And Princes of the Countries of <hi>Cabardine, Cirkaſſe,</hi> and <hi>Gorne,</hi> with many other Countries lying Eaſtward, Weſtward, or Northwards, which belong to Us as Heirs and Succeſſors of our Fathers and Grand-Fathers, who were Lords and Princes thereof. By Order of our Majeſties the Czaars, let it be known by theſe Preſents, to all whom it may concern, That our Majeſties the Czaars will and pleaſure is, to make ſeveral Perſons of ſeveral Qualities partakers of our Favours, according to the Tenor of theſe Letters Patents. In the beginning of this preſent Year 7197. the moſt Serene Prince and Lord <hi>Frideric</hi> III. Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and other Principalities, having deputed to our Majeſties the Czaars, <hi>John Reyer Chapliez,</hi> Privy Secretary and Counſellor of his Electoral Highneſs, and his Envoy Extraordinary in our Court; Who being in conference with our Majeſties the Czaars: Privy Boiars and their Collegues, has declared and propoſed unto them by writing from his Electoral Highneſs, That his Majeſty the <hi>French</hi> King, has begun in his Kingdom to force all that profeſſed the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion to abjure it, and has by ſeveral Torments driven them out of his Kingdom, or forced to turn <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> putting ſeveral of them to Death and parting Husbands from their Wives, and Children from their Parents, by keeping them in Priſon: But that thoſe amongſt them who were not thus detained, have made their eſcape out of the ſaid Kingdom and ſought for Shelter in the Neighbouring-Countries; and that great numbers of them are come into the Eſtates of his Electoral Highneſs, ſo that it is to be hoped many more will follow their example in making their eſcape. And as many amongſt them, who would endeavour to find ſome means of getting their Subſiſtance, are (by reaſon of their great numbers, and to fly from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution) deſirous to be entertained as our Subjects, and to ſettle amongſt Us, in our great Kingdom of <hi>Ruſſia:</hi> And that his Electoral Highneſs has very earneſtly deſired Us in their behalf, to receive them under our Sovereign Protection in the nature of Subjects, and to grant them free acceſs into our great Kingdom of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> We therefore upon the Advice and Requeſt of his Electoral Highneſs made unto Us by his Envoy Extraordinary, and according to the report made by the Privy Boiars of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties the Czaars; We great Lords the Czaars have willingly entertained, and do give our conſent to the Requeſt of his Electoral Highneſs: That the ſaid <hi>Proteſtants</hi> baniſhed by reaſon of their Religion, who deſire to come and live under the Protection, and in the Eſtates of our Majeſties the Czaars, may be aſſured of the favour and protection of our Majeſties the Czaars, come in and ſettle in the great <hi>Ruſſia</hi> of our Majeſties the Czaars with full aſſurance; in order whereunto our will and pleaſure is, That all our Frontiers ſhould lay open and free for them to come in. Moreover they ſhall be favourably entertained in the Service of our Majeſties the Czaars, and ſhall every one of them obtain a reaſonable Sallery, according to their Extraction, Condition, and Dignity. And in caſe any of the ſaid <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould deſire to return into their Country after they have ſerved our Majeſties the Czaars, they that deſire to do ſo, ſhall no ways be hindered, but ſhall have free liberty to go. Therefore we have cauſed by the favour of our Majeſties the Czaars, thoſe Letters Patents to be iſſued out by the Chancery of the Envoys of our Majeſties the Czaars.</p>
