         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

alwaies in a praying ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
having a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to resign our Wills
to God's in all things,
whether in Life or
Death. If this way of
applying all our Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

Religious sense were
made more generally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical,
the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
as well as the

Form, would so govern
us in all our actions, that
in this present Age nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Practicall Atheists
would dare with so much
impudence to shew their
faces, nor maintain their
detestable Principles so
horridly and dis-ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
as now they do;
the Age would then be
reformed, and we should
be good Company to our

never less alone then

that you are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
a Barbarian into
good manners, and make
a man of a reprobate
nature become a good
Christian. Your Example
I confess is easier to be
admired then imitated;
Your Precepts adequate

such Excellent Saints as

we should injoy a part of

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Lord God, I
confesse mine
iniquities, and
my sins are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before thee, secret as
well as known sins. Create
in me a new heart, and
renew a right spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me. Cleanse the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and damnable thoughts
of my heart by the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of thy Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
forgive my wicked
thoughts as well as my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51880:10"/>
evil vile words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Give me thy Grace,
that I may not onely leave
sin for a time, but that I
may loath sin; that I may
look upon <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ
not onely as a Saviour,
which the very worst of
men would be glad to do
at their Deaths, but as
a Sovereign to rule and
reign in my heart. It may
be in vain for me with
wicked <hi>Balaam</hi> to desire
to <hi>die the death of the
righteous,</hi> if I do not live
the life of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
While I live in the
World let me not be of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51880:10"/>
the World; but be pleased
to indue me with so great
a measure of thy Spirit,
that I may make it the
great pleasure of my life
to doe thee service, whose
<hi>service is perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
Make me humble,
charitable and obedient,
willing to doe good, not
onely to my friends, but
to my very enemies, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
forgiving them as I
desire to be forgiven, and
returning to them good
for evil: But, Lord, to
my Relations &amp; Friends,
return their kindness dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
into their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51880:11"/>
Take from me,
good Lord, both in my
health and sicknesse, all
that sinfull, misbecoming
Impatience which so much
prevails over me. Let
not the fear of Death so
much terrifie and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
my spirits; but so
moderate my Affections,
that I may willingly and
entirely submit to thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
will and pleasure,
whether in Life or Death,
natural or violent: But
I most humbly beseech
thee, Heavenly Father,
to prepare me for a better
World before thou takest
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51880:11"/>
me out of this: So pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
me, O Lord, by sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to me a Pardon for
all my sins past, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me such an assured
well-grounded Faith in
Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> and such an
application of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putative
Righteousnesse;
that when I come to die,
I may have nothing else
to doe but to die, and
to surrender, though a
sinful, yet a penitent Soul
into the hands of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Redeemer. While I
live here, give me Grace
that I may have dying
thoughts, that when I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51880:12"/>
come to die I may have
living hopes. Grant I
may live here in thy fear,
die in thy favour, and at
the end of my days attain
the end of my hopes, even
the Salvation of my Soul
in and through Christ
<hi>Jesus</hi> my blessed Saviour
and Redeemer.</p>

               <p>IT is reported in story
of a great Politician at
<hi>Rome,</hi> That he made it
his whole Design for
many years to secure the
election of his intimate
Friend to the Popedome
after the death of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Pope, who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
aged; and having for
some considerable time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51880:19"/>
impatiently expected an
happy issue to his so much
desired hopes, the Pope
dies, his Friend succeeds:
Now he accounts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a happy man; It is
but ask and have, of
what is within the Pope's
power; and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to him by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
promise from the
mouth of his Holinesse.
But mark the unhappy
issue: Whilst our Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
is considering what
places of Honour or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
will be most gratefull
to his Ambitious mind,
his Friend the Pope dies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51880:20"/>
too, and he finds all his
endeavours are rendred
fruitlesse. Upon the news
of his death he vainly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
his losse, and says
it was not in his power
to secure himself against
such a misfortune. Thus
it fares very often with
the men of the World,
who put their trust and
confidence in Princes, and
in <hi>the Son of man whose
breath is in his nostrils.</hi>
If we wholly rely upon
our earthly Friends, when
they die, we lose our
expectation of what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
their friendship

us: But if we rely upon
God, and secure him to
be our Friend, he will
comfort us when our
Friends fail, when they
die he can raise us new
ones; he will be our
Friend when we have
most need of him, not
onely in our lives, but at
our Deaths, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
so to all eternity. O
what an unspeakable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and happinesse is it
to gain God to be our
Friend! even the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

It is our greatest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

a discerning spirit when
our Souls are in danger

indanger the sinking our

God we may make a

not to repine that
God hath <hi>taken away</hi> their

love God, together,</hi> if not
singly, every individual

love God. And because
it was the will of the good
God, it was better so
then if it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
All good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
wisely acquiesce in
God's Providence; he

us. I hope God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
to them his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,

               <p>WE can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
thankfull
to God for his Mercies
to us, especially for that
Great transcendent one,
the Mercy of all Mercies,
in sending his Son to die
for us, to redeem us from
the Slavery of Sin, that
we may live and not die
eternally, that we may
live happily here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
In the Obedience
of his Commands is great
delight: They that are
of a contrary opinion, it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51880:48"/>
is because they are unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in his service, <hi>in
whose Service is perfect
Freedome.</hi> For to obey
Sin and the Lusts of the
Flesh, is the greatest Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salage
in the world; and
he is a greater man who
subdues his vile Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then if he were a
victorious Conqueror o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the World. For
God doth not account of
us by our outward Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but by our inward
Goodnesse: All humane
Greatnesse (however ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
by worldly men) is
a Pageantry and a mere
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51880:49"/>
Representation acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Theatre of the
World, which quickly
disappears, and the Scene
si changed and withdrawn
when the Play is done.
Farther to advance the
Mercies of God to us,
Let us consider, God
might have commanded
us to have sacrificed an
<hi>Isaac,</hi> to have lived all
the time of our lives in
painfull and vexatious
Trouble, exercising our
selves in Acts contrary to
our natural and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
appetites; and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an Obedience to such
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51880:49"/>
seeming severe commands
for an hundred years or
more, if he should give
us Heaven at last, we had
great reason to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
But now, on the
contrary, he onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to live chastly
and temperately; not to
deceive our Neighbours,
but to love them as our
selves; to keep up a good
report; to endeavour to
doe all the good we can,
and to refrain from evil;
to forgive our Enemies,
and not to be of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
natures, but, <hi>as
much as lies in us, to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51880:50"/>
live peaceably with all
men:</hi> which Commands
if we endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to, it will conduce
to a temporall as well
as an eternall Felicity.
When we digresse from
such Rules given us by
our great Law-giver, we
find sad effects, as conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential
Punishments of
our Disobedience; as,
Losse of Reputation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ill Casualties and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
many times haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our end by vicious
Excesses. These Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
to a rational

were sufficient (if there
were no higher) to deterre
him from evil practices.</p>

there should be such great
Dissensions and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51880:55"/>
amongst Christians,
who professe to believe
in the same Saviour, and
many times about Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials,
not Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
or Fundamentals, in
Religion, even to a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.
There are many pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
learned, well-dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
persons, who expresse
great zeal and fervency
of spirit to reconcile the
Differences in Christian
Religion, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meet with a severe
fate, (in stead of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
Reward) to be
abominated, or at least
disliked, by all Parties.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51880:56"/>

good men are but
men, and transported ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

passions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
Naturally men
have a great affection to
those of their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and Party, sometimes
either not discerning, or
conniving at their faults;
and too much prejudice
to those who differ from
them in opinion: though,
if we consider calmly and
rationally, no man differs
more in opinion from me
then I do from him, and
if I desire he should think
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51880:56"/>

in conscience to doe

with a design to disturb
the Kingdom's peace, and
by violence or Arms to
resist the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
God's Vice-gerent,
or is guilty of some noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Crime: such a man
I am bound to detect, and
no waies to countenance
or protect. It were an

Episcopal, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
Independents, (and
under that notion may be
comprehended Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
Quakers, and many
other new fanatick and

more put in practice those
Principles of Piety, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Morality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all or most of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
this would conduce
much to Union; for then
they would think better
one of another, and bear
with the frailties of their
brethren, (being there is
no Perfection in this life)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51880:57"/>
and by a gentle, mild and
unpassionate way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
would sooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
one another of their
Errours. Some can suffer
better then dispute, who
by calm disputation might
soon be convinced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to sobriety of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This would, I

which (if they

may with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
expresse towards

these Dissenters are ready
to plead for themselves,
<q>What I suffer, it is for

out of Faction or a spirit
of Contradiction; and
therefore in these cases
I must obey God, and

not Man,</q> (which is
highly true, when that

say they, <q>It appears

we must be under a

or suffer for them:
But God's will be done;

we should not think
our own Thoughts, nor

Scandal to many

any particular thing be
lawful or unlawful, 'tis
safest and best to resolve
on the Negative: for this
is an infallible Maxime,
They that in all things

will do the utmost that is
lawfull, will be tempted
in many cases to doe that
which is unlawfull.</p>

               <p>FRiendship is a noble

<hi>Hammond</hi> used to
say, he pitied him that

was destitute of a Friend,
as a very unhappy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
By conversing with
a Friend, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our secret affairs to
him, our Joyes are by
Sympathy increased, and
our Griefs lessened. Two
dear Friends seem to have
one Soul in two Bodies;
(they are like Twins,
when one dies, the other
pines away:) there is but
one Propriety between
them both, all their Goods
are in common.</p>

               <p>Some very curious

affirmatively, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

lest by any act of

should lessen her good
