            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sore eies, so do yll wordes / whiche trouthe returneth thyther as they came fro.</p>
            <p>Truely lyke as the northest wynde dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with cloudes towarde it / so doth yll lyuyng drawe yll speakynge vnto hit. Therfore Plato, as ofte as he sawe any do vncomly, to him selfe was wonte to say: Am I suche in any case?</p>
            <p>Ferthermore he that hath skolded with an other, if he forthwith beholde his owne life, and redresse it, chaungynge it in to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary / and correctynge hit: truely he shall take great profette by skoldynge, and other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyse it is bothe taken and also is a very fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisshe thyng. For so comonly men are wont to laugh at him, that is balde or croked, and blameth an other for the same vicis. But it is moste of al to be laughte at, one to cast a rebuke to an other / whiche maye haue some rebuke turned to hym selfe. As Leo of Byzantia, whan a foule croked felowe cast vnto hym the sorenes of his eies: It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ꝙ he, But thou dost cary thyne owne rebuke vpon thy backe.</p>
            <p>Therfore beware that thou caste not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie in ones tethe, if thou vse a more fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye flesshelye luste: nor attwite not one of wast / if thou be a nygarde.</p>

               </gap>meon layde hit to Adrastus / that he was cosyn to a woman / that slewe hir mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But what sayde he agayne? He laide to hym agayne not an others faute / but his owne, sayinge: Thou slewest thy mother thyne owne handes.</p>
            <p>Domitius iested with Crassꝰ on this wise: Dyddest thou not wepe, whan thy Lampray was deed, whiche thou haddest kepte in thy stewe? But Crassus returned the checke on this facion: Dyddest thou wepe at all / whan thou berydiste .iij. wyues?</p>
            <p>He that shulde checke an other / maye not be a iester, or a skolder, or a foole: But he muste be suche one / on whom no checke nor faute may cleue. For it semeth that god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande this, <hi>KnoWe thy selfe,</hi> to no man more than to hym, that shulde blame and checke an other: Lest, if they say what they wyll, they here that that they wolde not. For it is wonte to be as Sophocles sayth: Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast powred out wordes folisshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / &amp; sayd them with thy good wyll, againe thou shalte here the same agaynst thy wyll.</p>
            <p>And that is the profette and commoditie / that may be taken of chidyng with enmies: and no lesse profette cometh of the tother / that is, if one be yll spoken of / and rebuked
<pb facs="tcp:10961:8"/>
of his enmyes. Wherupon hit was well and truly spoken of Antisthenes: It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a man for the safegarde of his welthe and prosperitie, eyther to haue sure trustye frendes / or sharpe enmyes, bycause they in warnynge, tother in rebukynge, refrayne hym from vicis.</p>
            <p>But truely bycause that now adays frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyp hath loste hir speche to speake frelye, and flaterie hath tonge inough / warnynge is domme: it remayneth therfore, that we muste here the trouthe of our enmyes. For like as Telephus coulde not be heled of his wounde by no surgen of his owne felowes, and was heled by an other wounde, that Achilles his enmie gaue hym in the same place: so they that haue no frendly warner, muste suffre the wordes of an yll wyllynge enmy, wherby they may correcte &amp; amende their fautes. In whiche tyme the thynge it selfe oughte to be consydered, and not the mynde of the yll speaker. For lyke as he that thought to haue slayne Prometheus of Thessali, by chance strake so a wenne that he had / that he saued the man, and by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge the wenne rydde hym of the peryll: so hit is not selden sene, that a rebuke caste

out by enmyte and hatred, healeth a sore of the mynde, that was parauenture vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen or els vnregarded.</p>
            <p>But many that are touched with a rebuke, do not considre this, whether they be gyltie of the shame that is layde to them, but they loke rather, if he that layde hit, haue any thynge in hym, that may be caste agaynste hym. And lyke as wrestlers in the wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge place / do not brusshe away the duste / but one arayethe an other: so with rebukes whan they mete to gyther, one of them sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth an other. But it were more acording, that he that hath had a checke of his enmy, shall take that away that is layde agaynste hym, rather than a spotte that one sheweth hym in his gowne.</p>
            <p>Ye and also if one lay to thy charge a faute, that thou arte not gyltie in / yet hit is to be soughte, vpon what causes that yl spekynge dyd growe: and than it oughte to be taken hede of and fered / leste that vnware we do any thynge lyke that, that is layde agaynst vs. As Lacides kynge of Argyne, for his trymme busshe, and a lyttell more pyked apparell / was sklaunderde amonge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>So also it dyd hapen vnto Crassus, which to dye a propre ferme, ofte tymes resorted to a woman of religion, for to wynne hir good wyll.</p>
            <p>Truely Posthumia by reason of hir libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall laughyng and talkynge with men, was so sklaunderde, that she was accused of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie, altho hit was founde, that the faute was not trewe: Yet the bysshop Spurius Minutius at hir departynge warned hir / that she shulde talke with as great drede of shame, as she dyd lyue.</p>
            <p>And Themistocles whan he offended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge, yet he gatte by Pausanias to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte of treason / by cause he vsed hym so familiarly / and sent hym dayly lettres and messengers.

            <p>Truely if harde happe, that comethe by chance, teacheth some, what is best to do, as Meropa speakethe in a playe: Fortune in takynge awaye that, that was mooste dere vnto me, hath made me wyse, to my coste. Why shulde we nat aswel vse our enmye for a teacher lesse costly / that may profette vs, and teacheth vs some thyng, that we knewe not afore? For truelye many thynges an enmye perceyueth better than a frende, by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause that loue blyndeth in the thyng that is loued, as sayth Plato. But vnto hate is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bothe besye serche and bablynge.</p>
            <p>Whan Hieron had his stinkyng brethe cast agaynste hym of his enmye / he came home and chode his wyfe, sayinge: Why dyddest not thou shewe me this faute? But she that was chaste and symple, answered: I had wente, quod she, that all men had sauoured on the same fasshion. So that that, whiche may be sensiblely perceyued, &amp; those thinges that be in the body seene of euery man, thou shalte soner knowe them of thyn ennemyes, than of thy frendes or felowes.</p>
            <p>Put to this, that where it is no smal parte of vertue to haue a sobre tonge / alwayes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to reason: that thou canst not haue,
<pb facs="tcp:10961:10"/>
without thou by moche exercise, hede, and studie, subdue the yl motions of thy mynde, of whiche sorte anger is one. For as from fooles wordes do skape out, and as Homere saythe: The fleinge voyce forsakethe the closure of the mouthe, So is it most wonte to hapen to vnexercised myndes, that slippe and slyde, by vnmoderate anger, by vntem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratnes of mynde, and by smalle hede of lyuynge.</p>
            <p>More ouer, as saythe the godly Plato / the lyghtest thynge that is, bothe god and man punysshe with greattest payne. But a tother syde / sylence where as hit is alwaye gyltles / and not only not hurtfull, hit hath besydes in chydynge / a sauour of Socrates constance, or of Hercules force rather / for he also toke lesse hede of greuous wordes, than he dyd of flyes.</p>
            <p>Surely where as there is nothynge more graue or fayrer / than whan thy enmy chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, to holde thy peace, as one that sayleth by a great rocke, so also dothe suche an exer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cise sprede ferder. For if thou vse to suffre thyn enmyes chydynge, holdyng thy peace, thou shalte verye easelye suffre thye wyues skoldynge, whan she is angry, &amp; bere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble the cryenge of thy frende, and

the combre of thy brother. For of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; thy mother thou wilte suffre knockes and strokes, and be not moued with angre.</p>
            <p>And Socrates dydde suffre Xantippa his wyfe at home to chyde and combre hym, the more easely to kepe company with other / if he vsed to forbere hir. But it is moche bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in beinge exercised with checkes, rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes / &amp; hatredes of enmyes, to vse to subdue angre / and not to chaffe whan thou arte yll spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to. Therfore on this wyse one ought to vse sobrenes and suffrance, in enmytes. But symplenes, great mynde, and gentyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is more acordyng in frendshyppes. For it is not so honest to deserue well of a fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, as hit is shame not to do hit, as ofte as nede requireth. But yet it is taken for gentilnes, whan chaunce gyueth occasion / to let passe and not to be reuenged on thyn enmye.</p>
            <p>But he that receyueth not his good wyll, &amp; prayseth not his gentylnes, that soroweth the offence of his enmie, &amp; helpeth hym, if he desyre it / &amp; taketh some hede to his chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to his house / that is in peryll, truely he hath an herte of a dyamant, or els of yron.</p>
            <p>Whan Cesar had commanded the ymages of Pompei, that were cast downe, to be sette vp agayne: Thou hast, quod M. Tullius,
<pb facs="tcp:10961:11"/>
set vp Pompeis ymages, and stablysshed thyn owne. Wherfore an enmie is not to be dispraised, nor to be deceiued of his honour, whiche is to be praised, &amp; worthye, for by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a greatter prayse theron cometh vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that so do praise. Beside that, he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth one / that deserueth it, is better beleued, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he blameth, as one that hateth not the man, but that aloweth not his dede.</p>
            <p>And that that is moste goodly of all and moste profitable, he shall in no wyse enuye his fortunate frendes / nor his familiars, whan they do any thynge prayse worthye, who so euer vseth to praise his enmyes / and not to gnawe nor byte at theyr good fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

            <p>Scaurus was at debate with Domitius, and sewed hym: so a seruant of Domitius afore the matter was pleaded, came vnto Scaurus, and aduertised hym, that he had a secrete thynge to tell hym: but he wolde not suffre the felowe to speke, but toke hym and sente hym to his maister.</p>
            <p>Cato whan Murena dyd sewe hym, and

And truely that was a greatte token, that they had a good opinion of Cato.</p>
            <p>But this is yet fairest of al, that one wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are acustomed to do vprightly and iustly with our enmyes, we shall neuer medle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytefully or falselye with our frendes and familiars.

Whiche me thynketh Onomademus an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man perceyued, whiche was in Chio / whan there was a mutenyng there / on that parte that had the better, and warned them of his syde / not to chase them all out, that were of the contrary syde, lest, quod he, that

            <p>For truelye the potter shulde not enuie the potter, nor the synger the synger, as Hesio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus sayth: and hit is not mete, that a man shulde disdaine his neibour / or his cosyn / or his brother, if he waxe riche, and haue good fortune. But if there be none other way to ridde thy selfe from stryfe, enuie, &amp; disdaine, than vse thy selfe to be sory for thyn enmies good fortune, and sharpen the edge of angre agaynst them. For as these connynge gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners thynke to make rosis and violettis the better, if they sowe oynyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and garlyke nere by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that what so euer sower sauour be in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it may be purged in to the tother: so an enmye receyuynge in to hym our enuie and waywardnes, shal make vs better and lesse greuous to our frendis, that haue good fortune. Wherfore agaynst them muste be exercised the stryfe of glorie / of rule / and of good gaynynge, but not so moche, that we shuld tourme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our selfe, tho they haue more than we: But to marke al thinges by what meanes they passe vs, and let vs endeuour vs to passe them in diligence / endeuonr / so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenes,

            <p>For he that is brought to so lowe mynde, and fayntyng for enuie, by cause he thinketh hym selfe passed of his enmye, in gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or in obtaynyng of causis, or in fauoure, or auctoritie with frendes / or with noble men, and not rather endeuoureth and assayethe some thinge in dispite of hym / trewly he is holden with a folysshe and a vayne enuye.

And therwithal by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise sharpynge the takynge hede of passing hym, and the studye of honour / he shal shake of al ydlenes and false herte.

            <p>TO fylle vp the padges, that els wold haue ben voide, I thought it shuld nother hurt nor displese, to adde herevnto a fewe sayenges / howe a man shulde chose and cherysshe a frende.</p>
            <p>Cicero saith, that Scipio co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pleyned gretly / that men were more diligent in al thynges / than in frendshyppe: euery man knoweth howe many gotes and shepe he hath, but no man can telle howe many frendes he hath: And in the getting of other thinges men vse great care and diligence / but in chosynge of frendes they be verye negligent, nor they haue not as it were markes and tokens / by the which they may deme those that are fete to be receyued in to frendshyppe. The boke sayth / haue not frendshyppe with an yrefull man / nor with a fole: but as Cicero saythe, men firme, and stable, and constant / shulde be taken in to frendshyppe. Of the whiche sorte is great scarsite and lacke / and to iuge whiche they be, is a very harde thynge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we make a proffe, and we can not make
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10961:14"/>
a proffe therof tyll we be entred in to frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyp. So, frendshyp goth before iugement.</p>
            <p>Some there be, that a smal so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of money shal shewe how sure frendes they be. Some there are / whiche a littel thinge can not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue, &amp; yet they be knowen in a great nede.</p>
            <p>And if we happe to fynde a frende / that de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth it a foule and a shamfull thynge to set more by money than by fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dshyp: yet wher shal we finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that wyl not more esteme honours, rowmes, lordships, powers, and abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of riches, than frendship? But as the same Cicero saithe, nother profittes, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, riches, plesures / nor none other such like thinges, shulde be more set by than fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ships.

For the offence is not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, to say, thou dyddest it for thy frendes sake. And yet the same Cicero, as Gellius doth recite his wordis, saith, that where our frende standethe in ieopardye eyther of his life or of his good renowme / we may some what swarue a syde out of the waye. But what so euer Gellius saith, Cicero teacheth plainly, that we shulde require nothynge of our frende / but that that is honest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10961:15"/>And nowe concernynge the truste that we ought to haue in our frende, Seneca sayth: He that estemethe any man his frende, the which he can not trust so moche as him selfe, doth deceiue hym selfe. And he that maketh and proueth his frende festynge at the table doth fayle. It is vertue, say the Cicero, the whiche bothe wynneth and entertaynethe frendes. A man shulde reason and debate al thinges with his frende, but fyrst he shulde debate and reason with hym, whether he be a frende or no. No man nedeth to mystrust frendship / but fyrste let hym examyne and deme, whether it be frendshyp or not.</p>

do thus, if thou suppose hym to be sure and faythfull. For many shewe the maner and waye to deceiue, while they fere to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And some tell them that they mete by the way, &amp; blowe in euery mans eare, it that shulde only be opened &amp; shewed to frendes. Agayne some also drede so moche the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of their mooste dere frendes, that if they may, they woll kepe close within them all their secretenes, bycause they woll not put them in truste therwith. None of these two wayes is to be taken / for eche of them both is nought, to truste euery body / and to truste no man. Of whiche two fautes the fyrste is the more honest / and the other the more sure. And thoughe the wyse man be content with hym selfe / yet woll he haue a frende, and it be for none other cause, but to exercise frendshyppe / leste so great a vertue shulde lye asyde. Not for that that Epicure saythe / that he may haue one to tende hym whan he is sicke, or els that maye succoure hym, if he be cast in prison / or be poure and nedy, but that he may haue one / whom sicke and diseased he may tende vpon, and whom he may delyuer out of warde / if he happe to come in his enmyes handes. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth hym selfe / and for his owne sake
<pb facs="tcp:10961:16"/>
seketh frendshyppe, he intendeth yuell: and lyke as he begynneth, so shall he ende. He thynketh he hath got a frende to helpe hym out of prison, whiche, whan he hereth the chaynes rattel, goth his way. These frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyps, as the people sayth, dure for a tyme. He that is receyued into frendshyp for loue of profyte, as longe as he is profytable, he pleaseth. It is nedeful that the begynnyng and endynge of frendshyp, shulde agre. He that begynneth to be a frende, by cause it is expedient for hym, some price shall please hym agaynst frendshyp, if there be any price in it / that may please him aboue frendshyp. Thou sayste, To what intent shulde I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a frende? I answere, that thou maist haue one, whom thou mayste accompany, whan he is banisshed / for whom thou mayst put thy selfe in daunger of dethe. For the tother is rather a shapmanshyp than a frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyppe, whiche hath a respecte to profette, and considereth, what auayle he maye gette therby. There is nothynge, that so moche deliteth the mynde, as faythfull frendshyp. And he is well happy / that fyndeth a trewe frende, saythe the boke. O howe great is the goodnes / whan the breastis be prepared redye, in to the whiche all secretenes maye
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10961:16"/>
surely descende, whose conscience thou dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest lesse than thyne owne, whose talkynge easeth the grefe and heuynes of thy harte / the sentence gyueth redy and quicke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile / the chere dassheth the inwarde sorow, and the very regarde and beholdynge deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth? And bycause the vse of frendshyppe is variable and manyfolde, and there be many causes gyuen of suspicion and offence, the whiche is a wise mans parte to eschewe, to helpe / and to suffre. Frendes muste ofte be monisshed, and rebuked, and that muste be taken frendly / whan hit is done of good wyll. But for so moche as Terence saythe, Trouthe bredeth hate / whiche is as a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to frendshyppe / we must take hede, that our monition be not sowre, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke be without vile wordes. For vile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, as the boke sayth, for doth frendship.</p>
