            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Bleſſed be my God, who in the midſt of theſe wofull tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, hath vouchſafed to give me theſe calme, and holy thoughts; which I juſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he meant not to ſuggeſt, that they ſhould be ſmoothered in the breſt wherein they were conceived, but with a purpoſe to have the benefit communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto many; Who is there that needs not vehement exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and helps to Devotion? and when more then now? In a tempeſt the Mariners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves doe not onely cry every man to his God, but awaken <hi>Jonah,</hi> that is faſt aſleep under the hatches, and chide him to his prayers.

duyy, the neglect wherof is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our calamity, muſt in the effectuall performance of it, be the meanes of our recovery. Be but devout, and we cannot miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry under judgements; Woe is me, the teares of penitence, were more fit to quench the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique flame, then blood. How ſoon would it cleare up above head, if we were but holily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected within? Could we ſend our zealous Ambaſſadours up to heaven, we could not faile of an happy peace. I direct the way; God bring us to the end; For my own particular practice; God is witneſſe to my ſoule, that (as one, the ſenſe of whoſe private affliction is ſwallowed up of the publique) I ceaſe not dayly to ply the Father of mercies with my fervent prayers, that

he would, at laſt, be pleaſed, after ſo many ſtreames of blood, to paſſe an act of Pacification in heaven: And what good heart can doe otherwiſe? Brethren, all ye that love God, and his Church, and his Truth, and his Anointed, and your Country, and your ſelves, and yours, joyn your forces with mine, and let us by an holy violence make way to the gates of heaven with our Petition, for mercy and peace; and not ſuffer our ſelves to be beaten off from the threſhold of Grace, till we be anſwered with a condeſcent. He, whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is wont to prevent our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, will not give denials to our importunities.</p>

                     <p>There is a kind of Art of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion (if we can attain unto it) whereby the practice thereof may be much advanced: Wee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55180:5"/>
have known indeed ſome holy ſouls, which out of the generall precepts of piety, and their own happy experiments of Gods mercy, have, through the grace of God, grown to a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of perfection this way; which yet might have been much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, and compleated, by thoſe helps, which the greater illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and experience of others might have afforded them: Like as we ſee it in other faculties; there are thoſe, who out of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dexterity, and their own frequent practice, have got into a ſafe poſture of defence, and have handled their weapon with commendable skill, whom yet the Fence-ſchoole might have raiſed to an higher pitch of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: As nature is perfited, ſo grace is not a little furthered, by Art; ſince it pleaſeth the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, to work ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon the ſoul, not by the immediate power of miracle, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55180:5"/>
in ſuch methods, and by ſuch means, as may moſt conduce to his bleſſed ends. It is true, that our good motions come from the Spirit of God; neither is it leſſe true, that all the good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails of others proceed from the ſame Spirit; and that good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot be croſſe to itſelfe; he therefore that infuſes good thoughts into us, ſuggeſts alſo ſuch directions, as may render us apt both to receive and improve them: If God be bounteous, we may not be idle, and neglective of our ſpirituall aids.</p>

                     <p>II you tell me (by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a particular act of Devotion) that there is a gift of prayer, and that the Spirit of God is not tyed to rules; I yeeld both theſe; but withall, I muſt ſay there are alſo helps of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55180:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that we muſt not expect immediate inſpirations: I finde the world much miſtaken in both; They think that man hath the gift of prayer, that can ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the thoughts of his heart roundly unto God, that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelfe ſmoothly in the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt, and preſſe God with moſt proper words, and paſſionate vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence: And ſurely this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable faculty, whereſoever it is: but this is not the gift of prayer; you may call it, if you will, the gift of Elocution. Doe we ſay that man hath the gift of pleading, that can talk eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Barre, that can in good termes loud and earneſtly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the Judge for his Client; and not rather he that brings the ſtrongeſt reaſon, and quotes his books, and precedents with moſt truth, and cleareſt evidence, ſo as may convince the Jury, and perſwade the Judge? Doe we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55180:6"/>
ſay he hath the gift of preaching, that can deliver himſelfe in a flowing manner of ſpeech, to his hearers, that can cite Scriptures, or Fathers, that can pleaſe his auditory with the flowers of Rhetorick; or rather, he, that can divide the Word aright, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it ſoundly, apply it judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, put it home to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſpeaking in the evidence of the Spirit, powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the gainſayers, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the dejected, and drawing every ſoul nearer to heaven? The like muſt we ſay for prayer; the gift whereof he may be truly ſaid to have, not that hath the moſt rennible tongue, (for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not ſo much a matter of the lips, as of the heart) but he that hath the moſt illuminated appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the God to whom he ſpeaks, the deepeſt ſenſe of his own wants, the moſt eager long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after grace, the ferventeſt deſires of ſupplyes from heaven;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55180:7"/>
and in a word, whoſe heart ſends up the ſtrongeſt groans and cries to the Father of mercies.</p>
                     <p>Neither may we look for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſmes,</hi> and immediate inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; putting our ſelves upon Gods Spirit, in the ſolemn exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of our invocation, without heed, or meditation; the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inconvenience whereof hath been too often found in the raſh, and unwarrantable expreſſions, that have fallen from the mouths of unwary ſuppliants; but we muſt addreſſe our ſelves with due preparation, to that holy work; we muſt digeſt our ſuits; and fore-order our ſupplications to the Almighty; ſo that there may be excellent and neceſſary uſe of meet rules of our Devotion.</p>
                     <p>He, whoſe Spirit helps us to pray, and whoſe lips taught us how to pray, is an alſufficient example for us: all the skill of men, and Angels, cannot afford a more exquiſite modell of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory

Devotion, then that bleſſer Saviour of ours gave us in the mount; led in by a divine, and heart-raiſing preface, carried out with a ſtrong and heavenly enforcement; wherein an awfull compellation makes way for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; and petition makes way for thankſgiving; the petitions marſhalled in a moſt exact order, for ſpirituall bleſſings, which have an immediate concernment of God, in the firſt place; then for temporall favours, which concern ourſelves, in the ſecond; ſo punctuall a methode had not been obſerved by him that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth prayers, if it had been all one to him, to have had our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions confuſed, and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</p>

univerſally diffuſed through the ayre, and there is a particular recollection of light into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the ſun, and ſtarres; ſo it is in Devotion; There is a generall kind of Devotion that goes through the renewed heart and life of a Chriſtian, which we may term <hi>Habituall,</hi> and <hi>Virtuall;</hi> and there is a ſpeciall, and fixed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Devotion, which wee name <hi>Actuall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſoul that is rightly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, is never void of an holy Devotion; where ever it is, what ever it doth, it is ſtill lifted up to God, and faſtned upon him, and converſes with him; ever ſerving the Lord in feare, and rejoycing in him with trembling.</p>
                     <p>For the effectuall performance whereof, it is requiſite firſt, that the heart be ſetled in a right apprehenſion of our God; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, our Devotion is not thankleſſe only, but ſinfull: With
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55180:9"/>
much labour therefore, and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a mind illuminated from above, we muſt find our ſelves wrought to an high, aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, adorative, and conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of that incomprehenſible Majeſty, in whom we live, and move, and are; One God, in three moſt glorious Perſons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in wiſdome, in power, in juſtice, in mercy, in providence, in al that he is, in al that he hath, in all that he doth; dwelling in light inacceſſible, attended with thouſand thouſands of Angels; whom yet we neither can know, (neither would it avail us if we could) but in the face of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Son of his Love, our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mediatour God and Man; who ſits at the right hand of Majeſty in the higheſt heavens; from the ſight of whoſe glorious humanity, we comfortably riſe to the contemplation of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Deity, whereto it is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably united; in and by him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55180:10"/>
(made ours by a lively Faith) finding our perſons, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accepted, expecting our full redemption, and bleſſedneſſe. Here, here muſt our hearts be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removeably fixed; In his light muſt we ſee light: no cloudy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of this world, no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie imployments, no painfull ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings muſt hinder us from thus ſeeing him that is inviſible.</p>

God is to his ſoul; neither doe we move by him only, but in him: What a ſweet converſation therefore, hath the holy ſoule with his God? What heavenly conferences have they two, which the world is not privy to; whiles God entertaines the ſoule with the divine motions of his Spirit; the ſoul entertains God with gracious compliances? Is the heart heavy with the grievous preſſures of affliction? the ſoule goes in to his God, and pours out it ſelf before him in earneſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moanings, and ſupplications; the God of mercy anſers the ſoul again, with ſeaſonable refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of comfort: Is the heart ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wounded and bleeding with the conſcience of ſome ſin? it ſpeedily betakes it ſelf to the great Phyſitian of the ſoul, who forthwith applies the balme of Gilead for an unfailing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent cure: Is the heart diſtracted with doubts? the ſoul retires to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55180:11"/>
that inward Oracle of God for counſail, he returns to the ſoul an happy ſetlement of juſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: Is the heart deeply affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the ſenſe of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour from his God? the ſoul breaks forth into the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate voice of praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; God returns the pleaſing teſtimony of a cheerfull accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Oh bleſſed ſoul, that hath a God to go unto upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Oh infinite mercy of a God, that vouchſafes to ſtoop to ſuch intireneſſe with duſt and aſhes.

monition of duty, and occaſion of devout thoughts? Surely, I fear many of us Chriſtians, may juſtly accuſe our ſelves as too neglective of our duty this way; that having thus long ſpent our time in this great Academy of the world, we have not, by ſo many ſilent documents, learned to aſcribe more glory to our Creator; I doubt thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if they could exchangetheir brutality with our reaſon, being now ſo docible as to learn of us ſo far as their ſenſe can reach, would approve themſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſcholars to us, then we have been unto them.</p>

                     <p>AS the ſoul muſt bee clean from ſin, ſo it muſt be clear and free from diſtractions. The intent of our devotion is to welcome God to our hearts; now where ſhall we entertain him, if the rooms be full thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with cares, and turbulent paſſions?

it wil be requiſite to bend our eyes upon a threefold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; To look inward into our ſelves, upward to heaven, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to hell.

in the maintenance of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious preſumption, but when he ſaw himſelf turn'd <hi>Lazar,</hi> on the ſuddain, he is confounded in himſelf, and in a depth of ſhame haſtens away from the preſence of God to a ſad, and penitentiall retiredneſſe. Wee ſhould need no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to loath ourſelves, then the ſight of our own faces, ſo miſerably deformed with the naſty and hatefull ſcurfe of our iniquity: Neither onely muſt we be content to ſhame, and grieve our eyes with the foule nature and condition of our ſins, but we muſt repreſent them to our ſelves in all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that may aggravate their hainouſneſſe. Alas, Lord, any one ſin is able to damn a ſoul; I have committed many, yea numberleſſe: they have not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed me ſingle, but, as that evill ſpirit ſaid, their name is Legion; neither have I committed theſe

he that wrought it. Lord! what a tranſcendent, what an infinite love is this? what an object was this for thee to love? A world of ſinners?

It was thy great goodneſs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the acts of juſt vengeance to the ſinfull world of man, but to give unto it tokens of thy love, is a favour beyond all expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The leaſt gift from thee had been more then the world could hope for; but that thou ſhouldſt not ſtick to give thine onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, the Son of thy love, the Son of thine eſſence, thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, coeternall Son, who was more then ten thouſand worlds, to redeem this one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn

inward, publique or private, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive or privative, paſt or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, upon our ſelves or others.

                     <p>Now as there is infinite varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of bleſſings from the liberall hand of the Almighty, ſo there is great difference in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; For, whereas there are three ſubjects of all the good we are capable of; The Eſtate, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Soul; and each of theſe doe far ſurpaſſe other in value, (the ſoul being infinitely more worth then the body, and the body far more precious then the outward eſtate) ſo the bleſſings that appertain to them, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, differ in their true eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55180:35"/>
accordingly. If either we doe not highly magnifie Gods mercy for the leaſt, or ſhall ſet as high a price upon the bleſſings that concern our eſtate, as thoſe that pertain to the body, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bodily favours, as upon thoſe that belong to the ſoul, we ſhall ſhew our ſelves very unworthy, and unequall partakers of the Divine bounty. But it will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour too much of earth, if we be more affected with temporall bleſſings, then with ſpirituall and eternall. By how much nearer relation then, any favour hath to the Fountain of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by how much more it conduceth to the glory of God, and ours in him; ſo much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place ſhould it poſſeſſe in our affection and gratitude. No marvell therefore if the Devout Heart be raiſed above it ſelf and tranſported with heavenly rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when, with <hi>Stephens</hi> eyes, it beholds the Lord Jeſus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Unſpeakable is the advantage that the ſoul raiſes to it ſelf by this continuall exerciſe of thankſgiving; for the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgement of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, is the way to more; even amongſt men (whoſe hands are ſhort and ſtrait) this is the means to pull on further benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; how much more from the God of all Conſolation, whoſe largeſt bounty dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth nothing of his ſtore?

                        <hi>Every man is a Lyer.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we put our hand to this Sacred Volume, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to elevate our hearts to that God whoſe it is, for both his leave and his bleſſing: <hi>Open mine eyes,</hi> ſaith the ſweet Singer of <note place="margin">Pſ. 119. 8.</note> Iſrael, <hi>that I may behold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things of thy Lan.</hi> Lo, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> eyes were open before to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55180:37"/>
other objects; but when he comes to Gods Book, he can ſee nothing, without a new act of apertion: Letters he might ſee, but Wonders he could not ſee, till God did uncloſe his eyes, and enlighten them. It is not therefore for us, preſumptuouſly to break in upon God, and to think by our naturall abilities to wreſt open the precious Caskets of the Almighty; and to fetch out al his hidden treaſure thence, at pleaſure; but we muſt come tremblingly before him, and in all humility crave his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous admiſſion. I confeſſe I finde ſome kinde of envy in my ſelf, when I reade of thoſe ſcrupulous obſervances of high reſpects gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Jews to the Book of Gods Law: and when I reade of a Romiſh Saint, that never read the Scripture but upon his knees, <note place="margin">Carolus Borromaeus</note> and compare it with the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe neglect whereof I can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my ſelf, and perhaps ſome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55180:38"/>
others: Not that we would reſt in the formality of outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of reverence, wherein it were more eaſie to be ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious then devout; but that our outward deportment may teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and anſwer the awefull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our hearts: whereto we ſhall not need to be excited, if we be throughly perſwaded of the Divine Originall, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Sacred Word. It was motive enough to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> zealouſly to plead for, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly to adore the Image of their <hi>Diana,</hi> that it was <hi>the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that fell down from Jupiter.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 19. 35</note> Beleeve we, and know, that the Scripture is inſpired by God; and we can entertain it with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then an awefull addreſſe, and we cannot be Chriſtians if we doe not ſo beleeve.</p>
                     <p>Every clauſe therefore of that God-inſpired Volume, muſt be, as reverently received by us, ſo ſeriouſly weighed, and carefully
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55180:38"/>
laid up; as knowing, that there is no tittle therein without his uſe. What we reade, we muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to underſtand; what we cannot underſtand, we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire ſilently, and modeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of. There are plain Truths, and there are deep Myſteries. The bounty of God hath left this Well of Living-water open for all: what runnes over is for all commers; but every one hath not wherewith to draw. There is no Chriſtian that may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Gods Book, but every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may not interpret it; thoſe ſhallow Fords that are in it, may be waded by every Paſſenger, but there are deeps wherein he that cannot ſwim, may drown. <hi>How can I without a Guide?</hi> ſaid that Ethiopian Eunuch: Wherefore ſerves the tongue of the Learned, but to direct the Ignorant? Their modeſty is of no leſs uſe then the others skill. It is a wofull condition of a Church when no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55180:39"/>
man will bee ignorant.</p>
                     <p>What ſervice can our eyes do us in the ways of God without our thoughts? our diligent and frequent reading, therefore, muſt be attended with our holy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: we feed on what we read, but we digeſt only what we me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of: What is in our Bible, is Gods; but that which is in our hearts, is our own: By all which our care muſt be, not ſo much to become vviſer, as to become better, labouring ſtill to reduce all things to godly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
                     <p>Finally, as we enter into this task with the lifting up of our hearts for a bleſſing, ſo we ſhut it up in the ejaculations of our thankſgiving to that God, who hath bleſſed us with the free uſe of his Word.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55180:48"/>
are unreconciled; but (as ye love your ſouls) be reconciled that you may come.</p>
                     <p>Another Grace neceſſarily pre-required is charity to our brethren, and readineſſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; For this is a communion, as with Chriſt the head, ſo with all the members of his myſticall body: This is the true Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſt of God our Saviour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we profeſſe our ſelves inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united both to him &amp; his; If there be more hearts then one at Gods table, he will not own them; Theſe holy ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments give us an Embleme of our ſelves: This bread is made up of many grains, incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into one maſſe; and this wine is the confluent juice of many cluſters; neither doe we partake of ſeverall loaves, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of liquors, but all eat of one bread, and drink of one cup. Here is then no place for ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and malice; none for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

grudgings and heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; <hi>Therefore, if thou bring thy</hi>

                     <p>BEſides theſe graces there are certain holy pre-diſpoſitions ſo neceſſary that without them our ſouls can never hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55180:49"/>
true comfort in this bleſſed Sacrament; whereof the firſt is an hungring and thirſting deſire after theſe gracious means of our ſalvation: What good will our meat doe us without an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite? ſurely without it, there is no expectation of either reliſh, or digeſtion; as therefore thoſe that are invited to ſome great feaſt, care firſt to feed their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ere they feed their body; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring by exerciſe to get a ſtomach, ere they employ it; ſo it concerns us to do here: and, as thoſe thoſe that are liſtleſſe, and weak ſtomached, are wont to whet their appetite with ſharp ſawces, ſo muſt we by the tart applications of the law, quicken our deſires of our Saviour here exhibited.</p>
                     <p>Could we but ſee our ſins, and our miſeries by ſin; Could we ſee God frowning, and hell ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping wide to ſwallow us, we ſhould not need to be bidden to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55180:49"/>
long for our deliverer; and every pledge of his favour would be precious to us.</p>
                     <p>Upon the apprehenſion of our need of a Saviour and ſo happy a ſupply thereof preſented unto us, muſt needs follow a renued act of true thankfulneſſe of heart to our good God, that hath both given us his dear Son to work our redemption, and his bleſſed Sacrament to ſeal up unto us our redemption thus wrought and purchaſed; And with ſouls thus thankfully ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated unto God, we approach with all reverence, to that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly table, where God is both the Feaſt-maſter, and the Feaſt. What intention of holy thoughts, what fervour of ſpirit, what depth of Devotion muſt we now finde in our ſelves? Doubtleſſe, out of heaven no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can be ſo worthy to take up our hearts. What a clear repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation is here of the great
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55180:50"/>
work of our Redemption? How is my Saviour by all my ſenſes here brought home to my ſoul? How is his paſſion lively acted before mine eyes? For lo, my bodily eye doth not more truly ſee bread and wine, then the eye of my faith ſees the body and bloud of my dear Redeemer; Thus was his ſacred body torn and broken; Thus was his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud poured out for me; My ſins (wretched man that I am) helped thus to crucifie my Saviour; and for the diſcharge of my ſins would he be thus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: Neither did he onely give himſelf for me, upon the croſſe, but lo, he both offers and gives himſelf to me in this his bleſſed inſtitution; what had his generall gift been without this application? now my hand doth not more ſenſibly take, nor my mouth more really eat this bread, then my ſoul doth ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually receive, and feed on the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55180:50"/>
bread of life; O Saviour, thou art the living bread that came down from heaven; Thy fleſh is meat indeed, and thy bloud is drink indeed: Oh that I may ſo eat of this bread, that I may live for ever; He that commeth to thee, ſhall never hunger, he that beleeveth in thee, ſhall never thirſt: Oh that I could now ſo hunger, and ſo thirſt for thee, that my ſoul could be for ever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with thee; Thy people of old, were fed with Manna in the wilderneſſe, yet they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that food of Angels could not keep them from periſhing; but oh, for the hidden Manna, which giveth life to the world, even thy bleſſed ſelf, give me ever of this bread, and my ſoul ſhall not die but live: Oh the precious juice of the fruit of the Vine, wherewith thou refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt my ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is this the bloud of the grape? Is it not rather thy bloud of the New teſtament, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55180:51"/>
is poured out for me? Thou ſpeakeſt, O Saviour, of new wine that thou wouldeſt drink with thy Diſciples, in thy Fathers kingdome, can there be any more precious and pleaſant, then this, wherewith thou cheareſt the beleeving ſoul? our palate is now dull and earthly, which ſhall then be exquiſite and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall; but ſurely no liquor can be of equall price or ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with thy bloud; Oh how unſavoury are all earthly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies to this heavenly draught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O God, let not the ſweet taſte of this ſpirituall Nectar ever goe out of the mouth of my ſoul; Let the comfortable warmth of this bleſſed Cordiall ever work upon my ſoul, even till, and in, the laſt moment of my diſſolution.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55180:51"/>
thy unſpeakable mercy? Can I ſee thee thus crucified before my eies, &amp; for my ſake thus crucified, and not remember thee? Can I finde my ſins acceſſary to this thy death, and thy death meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly expiating all theſe my grievous ſins, and not remember thee? Can I hear thee freely offering thy ſelf to me, and feel thee graciouſly conveighing thy ſelf into my ſoul, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee?

                     <p>The devout ſoul hath thus ſup't in heaven, and returnes home, yet the work is not thus done: after the elements are out of eye and uſe, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a digeſtion of this celeſtial food, by holy meditation; and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55180:52"/>
now it thinks, Oh what a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing have I received to day! no leſſe then my Lord Jeſus, with all his merits; and in and with him, the aſſurance of the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all my ſins, and everlaſting ſalvation: How happy am I, if I be not wanting to God and my ſelf? How unworthy ſhall I be, if I doe not ſtrive to anſwer this love of my God and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in all hearty affection, and in all holy obedience?</p>
                     <p>And now after this heavenly repaſt, how doe I feel my ſelf? what ſtrength, what advantage hath my faith gotten? how much am I neerer to heaven then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? how much faſter hold have I taken of my bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer? how much more firm &amp; ſenſible is my intereſt in him?</p>

                     <p>THeſe are the generalities of our Devotion, which are of common uſe to all Chriſtians; There are beſides theſe certain ſpecialties of it, appliable to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall occaſions, times, places, perſons; For there are morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and evening Devotions; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions proper to our board, to our cloſet, to our bed, to Gods day, to our own; to health, to ſickneſſe, to ſeverall callings, to recreations; to the way, to the field, to the Church, to our home, to the ſtudent, to the ſouldier, to

the Magiſtrate, to the Miniſter, to the husband, wife, child, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; to our own perſons, to our families; The ſeveralties whereof, as they are ſcarce finite for number, ſo are moſt fit to be left to the judgement, and holy managing of every Chriſtian; neither is it to be imagined, that any ſoul which is taught of God, and hath any acquaintance with heaven, can be to ſeek in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application of common rules to his own neceſſity or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience.</p>
                     <p>The reſult of all, is,</p>
                     <p>A devout man is he that ever ſees the inviſible, and ever trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth before that God he ſees; that walks ever, here on earth, with the God of heaven; and ſtill adores that Majeſty with whom he converſes; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers hourely with the God of ſpirits in his own language; yet ſo, as no familiarity can abate of his aw, nor fear abate ought of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55180:54"/>
his love. To whom the gates of heaven are ever open, that he may goe in at pleaſure to the throne of grace, and none of the Angelicall ſpirits can offer to challenge him of too much boldneſſe: Whoſe eies are well acquainted with thoſe heavenly guardians, the preſence of whom he doth as truly acknowledge, as if they were his ſenſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. He is well known of the King of glory, for a daily ſuitor in the Court of heaven, &amp; none ſo welcome there, as he: He accounts all his time loſt that fals beſide his God; and can be no more weary of good thoughts, then of happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>His boſome is no harbour for any known evill; and it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether he more abhorres ſin, or hell; His care is to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain God in a clear, and free heart, and therefore he thruſts the world out of doors, and humbly beſeeches God to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55180:54"/>
himſelf to his own: He is truly dejected, and vile in his own eies: Nothing but hell is lower then he; every of his ſlips are hainous, every treſpaſſe is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated to rebellion; The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and favours of God heighten his humiliation; He hath lookt down to the bottomles deep, &amp; ſeen with horror what he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to feel everlaſtingly; His crys have been as ſtrong, as his fears juſt; &amp; he hath found mercy more ready to reſcue him, then he could be importunate: His hand could not be ſo ſoon put forth as his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, for deliverance. The ſenſe of this mercy hath raiſed him to an unſpeakable joy to a moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love of ſo dear a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; that love hath knit his heart to ſo meritorious a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and wrought a bleſſed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt God and his ſoul. That union can no more be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from an infinite delight, then that delight can be ſevered
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55180:55"/>
from an humble, and cheerfull acquieſcence in his munificent God; And now, as in an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly freedome, he pours out his ſoul into the boſome of the Almighty, in all faithfull ſuits for himſelf and others; ſo, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys God in the bleſſings recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and returns all zealous prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the giver.</p>
                     <p>He comes reverently to the Oracles of God, and brings not his eye, but his heart with him, not careleſly negligent in ſeeking to know the revealed will of his maker, nor too buſily inquiſitive into his deep counſels; not too remiſſe in the letter, nor too peremptory in the ſenſe: gladly comprehending what he may, and admiring what he cannot comprehend. Doth God call for his ear? He goes awfully into the holy preſence and ſo hears, as if he ſhould now hear his laſt: Latching every word that drops from the Preachers

lips, ere it fall to the ground, and laying it up carefully where he may be ſure to fetch it. He ſits not to cenſure, but to learn, yet ſpeculation and knowledge is the leaſt drift of his labour; Nothing is his own but what he practiſeth. Is he invited to Gods feaſt? he hates to come in a foul and ſlovenly dreſſe; but trims up his ſoul, ſo, as may be fit for an heavenly gueſt: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he leave his ſtomach at home cloyed with the world, but brings a ſharp appetite with him; and ſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates are unfavoury to him, in reſpect of that celeſtiall Manna: Shortly, he ſo eats and drinks, as one that ſees himſelf ſet at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God, and his Angels; and riſes and departs full of his Saviour; and in the ſtrength of that meal walks vigorouſly and cheerfully on towards his glory. Finally, as he well knows that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55180:56"/>
he lives, and moves, and hath his beeing in God, ſo he referres his life, motions, and beeing wholly to God; ſo acting all things as if God did them by him, ſo uſing all things, as one that enjoyes God in them; and in the mean time ſo walking on earth, that he doth in a ſort carry his heaven with him.</p>

of a worthy Chriſtian, who had lived to his middle age in much health, and proſperity, and was now for his two laſt years miſerably afflicted with the Strangury; who in the midſt of his torments could ſay, Oh my Lord God, how gracious haſt thou been unto me! thou haſt given me eight and forty years of health, and now but two years of pain; thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They ſay, Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hurts not, if it be mixed with Rain. In thoſe hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which lie under the ſealding Zone, when the firſt ſhowres fall after a long drought, it is held dangerous to walk ſuddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; for that the earth ſo moiſtned ſends up unwholſome ſteams; but in thoſe parts where the Rain and Sun-ſhine are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally interchanged, it is moſt pleaſant to take the air of the earth newly refreſhed with kindly ſhowres; Neither is it otherwiſe in the courſe of our lives; this medley of good and evill conduces not a little to the health of our ſoules: One of them muſt ſerve to temper the other; and both of them to keep the heart in order.</p>
                     <p>Were our afflictions long, and our comforts rare and ſhort, we had yet reaſon to be thankfull;

                     <p>But if we ſhall caſt up our eies to Heaven, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glorious remuneration of our ſufferings, how ſhall we contemn the worſt that earth can doe unto us?

ſtalk forth, and bid defiance to the whole Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and when the timorous unbeleevers ſhall run away at the ſight of him, and endeavour to hide their heads from his preſence; the good ſoul armed, not with the unmeet and cumberſome harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of fleſh and bloud, but with the ſure (though inviſible) armour of God, dares come forth to meet him, and in the name of the Lord of Hoſts, both bids him battle and foils him in the Combat; and now having laid him on the ground, can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphingly ſay, O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? Five ſmooth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles there are, which if we carry in our ſcrip, we ſhall be able to quell, not onely the power of death, but the terror too.</p>
                     <p>Whereof the firſt is a ſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of both the unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable neceſſary, and certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of death: A neceſſity,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55180:122"/>
grounded upon the juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Decree of Heaven: It is appointed to all men once to <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> die; and what a madneſſe were it for a man to think of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the common condition of mankind? Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is, as it were, eſſential to our Nature; neither could wee have had our ſouls but upon the tearms of a re-delivery, when they ſhall be called for; If the holieſt Saints, or the greateſt Monarchs ſped otherwiſe, wee might have ſome colour of repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Now, grieve if thou wilt, that thou art a man; grieve not, that being man thou muſt die.</p>
                     <p>Neither is the benefit inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the neceſſity; Lo here the remedy of all our cares, the phyſick for all our maladies, the reſcue from all our feares and dangers, earneſtly ſued for by the painfull, dearly welcome to the diſtreſſed: Yea, lo here the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55180:122"/>
Cherub that keeps the gate of Paradiſe; there is no entrance but under his hand; In vain do we hope to paſſe to the glory of Heaven, any other way then through the gates of Death.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is the Conſcience of a well-led life; Guiltineſſe vvill make any man fowardly, unable to looke danger in the face, much more Death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the innocent is bold as a Lion: What a difference therefore there is betwixt a Martyr, and a Malefactor? this latter knows he hath done ill, and therefore if he can take his death but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, it is well; the former knows he hath done well, and therefore takes his death not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently onely, but chearfully.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe no mortall man can have ſo innocently led his life, but that he ſhall have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many offences againſt his moſt holy, and righteous God; here muſt be, Thirdly, a finall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55180:123"/>
peace firmly made betwixt God and the ſoul. Two powerfull agents muſt mediate in it; a lively Faith, and a ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for thoſe ſins can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appear againſt us, that are waſhed off with our tears; and being juſtified by faith we have <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now, if we have made the Judge our friend, what can the Sergeant doe?</p>
                     <p>The fourth is the power, and efficacy of Chriſts death apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſoul: Wherefore dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, but that we might live? Wherefore would he, who is the Lord of life, die, but to ſanctifie, ſeaſon, and ſweeten death to us? Who would goe any other way then his Saviour went before him? who can fear that enemy, whom his Redeemer hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered for him? who can run away from that Serpent, whoſe ſting is pulled out? Oh Death, my Saviour hath been thy death,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55180:123"/>
and therefore thou canſt not be mine.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is, the comfortable expectation, and aſſurance of a certain reſurrection, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate glory: I doe but lay me down to my reſt, I ſhall ſleep quietly, and riſe gloriouſly: My ſoul, in the mean time, no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er leaves my body, then it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys God; It did lately through my bodily eyes ſee my ſad friends, that bade me farewell with their tears; now it hath the bliſſe-making viſion of God: I am no ſooner lanched forth, then I am at the haven, where I would be; Here is that which were able to make amends for a thouſand deaths; a glory, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, eternall, incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55180:124"/>
make up one perſon, yet (as it fals out in croſſe matches) they are in continuall domeſtique jars one with the other, and entertain a ſecret familiar kind of hoſtility betwixt themſelves; For the fleſh luſteth againſt the <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other. One ſays well, that if the body ſhould implead the ſoul, it might bring many foul impeachments againſt it; and ſue it for many great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done to that earthly part: And the ſoul again hath no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quarrels againſt the body: betwixt them both there are many brawls, no agreement. Our Schools have reckoned up therefore eight main incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which the ſoul hath cauſe to complain of in her conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the body: whereof the firſt is the defilement of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, wherewith the ſoul is not tainted as it proceeds, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55180:125"/>
from the pure hands of its Creator, but as it makes up a part of a ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> who brought this guilt upon humano nature; ſo as now this compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which we call man, is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: Who can bring a clean thing out of that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean? <note place="margin">Job 14. 4.</note> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is a proneneſſe to ſinne, which, but by the meeting of theſe partners, had never been; the ſoul, if ſingle, would have been innocent; thus matched, what evill is it not apt to entertain? An ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort is enough to poyſon the beſt diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>The difficulty of doing well is the third; for how averſe are we by this conjunction from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is good? This clog hinders us from walking round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ways of God: The good that I would doe, I doe not, ſaith the choſen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19</note>

                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:55180:125"/>
The fourth is the dulneſſe of our underſtanding, and the dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our mentall eies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the things pertaining unto God; which now we are forced to behold through the vail of fleſh: if therefore we miſ-know, the fault is in the mean, through which we doe imperfectly diſcover them.</p>
                     <p>The fift is a perpetuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation, and ſelf-conflict, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part labouring to oppoſe and vanquiſh the other. This field is fought in every mans boſome, without any poſſibility of peace, or truce, till the laſt moment of diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt is the racking ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of cares, which continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtract the ſoul, not ſuffering it to reſt at eaſe, whiles it carries this fleſh about it.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh is the multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of paſſions which daily blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter within us, and raiſe up con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall tempeſts in our lives,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55180:126"/>
diſquieting our peace, &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ruine.</p>
                     <p>The eight is the retardation of our glory; for fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; wee muſt lay down our load if we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Heaven: The ſeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fructifie unleſſe it die.

                     <p>Now then, ſith ſo many and great diſcommodities doe ſo unavoidably accompany this match of ſoul and body, and all of them ceaſe inſtantly in the act of their diſſolution; what reaſon have we to be too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with their parting?

                     <p>OUr third reſolution muſt be to inure our ſelves to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſmaller diſcontentments; and by the exerciſe thereof, to enable our ſelves for greater: as thoſe that drink medicinall waters, begin firſt with ſmaller quantities, and by degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, at laſt, to the higheſt of their preſcribed meaſure; or as the wiſe <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcourgings of their boyes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured them in their riper yeares to more painfull ſufferings: A ſtrong <hi>Milo</hi> takes up his Calf at firſt, and by continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is now able to carry it when it is grown a Bull.</p>
                     <p>Such is our ſelf-love, that we
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55180:141"/>
affect ever to be ſerved of the beſt; and that we are apt to take great exceptions at ſmall failings: We would walk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in ſmooth, and even paths, and would have no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances in our paſſage; but there is no remedie, we muſt meet with rubs; and perhaps croſſe ſhinnes, and take fals too in our way: Every one is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to enjoy (as they ſay the city of <hi>Rhodes</hi> doth) a perpetuall Sunſhine; but we cannot (if we be wiſe) but know, that we muſt meet with change of weather; with rainy dayes, and ſometimes ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts; it muſt be our wiſdome to make proviſion accordingly: and ſome whiles to abide a whetting; that, if need be, we may endure a drenching alſo. It <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 2. 26. &amp; 33. 5, 6. &amp;c.</note> was the policy of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was to meet with his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> (whom he feared an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but found a friend) to ſend
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55180:142"/>
the droves firſt, then his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, and their children; then <hi>Leah,</hi> with her children, and at laſt came <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> as one that would adventure the leſſe dear in the firſt place, and (if it muſt be) to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his deareſt loſſe. <hi>S.

It is the uſe that wiſe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> made of the ſharp tongues of his croſſe and unquiet wives, to prepare his patience for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſufferings. Surely, he that cannot endure a frown, will hardly take a blow; and he that doubles under a light croſſe, will ſink under a heavier; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily that good Martyr pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his whol body for the Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, with burning his hand in the Candle. I remember <hi>Seneca</hi> in one of his Epiſtles rejoyces much
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55180:142"/>
to tell with what patient tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he took it, that comming unexpectedly to his Countrey houſe, he found all things ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed, that no proviſion was ready for him; finding more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in his own quiet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of theſe wants, then trouble in that unreadines: And thus ſhould we be affected upon all occaſions; Thoſe that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me help, have diſappointed me: that friend on whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed, hath failed my truſt: the ſum that I expected, comes not in at the day: my ſervant ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the buſineſſe enjoyned him: the beaſt that I eſteemed highly, is loſt: the Veſſell in which I ſhipped ſome commodities, is wrackt: my diet &amp; attendance muſt be abated; I muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged of my former habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how do I put over theſe occurrences? If I can make light work of theſe leſſer croſſes, I am in a good poſture to entertaine greater.</p>

                        <pb n="288" facs="tcp:55180:143"/>
To this purpoſe, it will be not a little expedient to thwart our appetite in thoſe things wherein we placed much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and to torture our curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the delay of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, which we too eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected: It was a noble and exemplary government of theſe paſſions, which we finde in King <hi>David,</hi> who being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly thirſty, and longing for a ſpeedy refreſhment, could ſay; Oh that one would give mee drink of the water of the Well <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 15, 16, 17.</note> of Bethlehem! but when he ſaw that water purchaſed with the hazard of the lives of three of his Worthies, when it was brought to him, he would not drink it, but poured it out unto the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Have I a minde to ſome one curious diſh above the reſt? I will put my knife to my throat, and not humour my palate ſo far as to taſte of it: Doe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Letter of newes from a

far Countrey, over night? It ſhall keep my pillow warme till the morning: Doe my impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate recreations cal me away? they ſhall, againſt the hair, be forcibly adjourned till a further leiſure: Out of this ground it was, that the ancient Votaries obſerved ſuch auſterity, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in their diet, clothes, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as thoſe that knew how requiſite it is that nature ſhould be held ſhort of her demands; and continually exerciſed with denials, leſt ſhe grow too wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and impetuous in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: That which was of old gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a rule to Monaſtick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is fit to be extended to all Chriſtians; They may not have a will of their own, but muſt frame themſelves to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and cariage, as ſeemes beſt to their Superiour; If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it pleaſe my God to ſend me ſome little comfort, I ſhall take that as an earneſt of more;

and if he exerciſe me with leſſer croſſes, I ſhall take them as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives to greater; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be thankfull for the one, and patient in the other; and contented with Gods hand in both.</p>

                     <p>Great skill therefore is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the governing of a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and proſperous eſtate, ſo as it may be ſafe and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the owner, and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unto others; Every Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall may know how to order ſome few files, but to marſhall many Troops in a Regiment, many Regiments in a whole body of an Army, requires the skill of an experienced Generall.
