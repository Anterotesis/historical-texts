            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Object. 1.</head>
               <p>MOnarchical government is more Natural, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee ſee even in Commonwealths that they have recourſe unto this, as <hi>Lacedemon</hi> in her Kings; <hi>Rome</hi> both in her Conſuls and Dictators, and <hi>Venice</hi> in her Dukes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label> Government whether Popular or Monarchical is equally artificial; wherefore to know which is the more natural, we muſt conſider what piece of Art cometh neareſt unto Nature; as for example, whether a Ship or an Houſe be the more natural, and then it will be eaſie to reſolve that a Ship is the more natural at Sea, and an Houſe at Land. In like manner where one man or a few men are the Landlords, Monarchy muſt doubtleſly be the more natural, and where the whole people are the Landlords, a Commonwealth; for how can we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it ſhould be natural unto a people that can live of themſelves, to give away the means of their livelyhood to one or a few men that they may ſerve or obey? Each government is equally artificial in effect or in it ſelf, and equally natural in the cauſe, or the matter upon which it is founded.</p>
               <p>A Commonwealth conſiſts of the Senate propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb facs="tcp:114862:4"/>
the People reſolving, and the Magiſtracy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting; ſo the power of the Magiſtrates (whether, Kings as in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> Conſuls as in <hi>Rome,</hi> or Dukes as in <hi>Venice</hi>) is but barely executive, but to a Monarch belongs both the Reſult and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too; wherefore that there have been Dukes, Conſuls, or Kings in Common wealths, which were quite of another nature, is no Argument that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical government is for this cauſe the more natural.</p>
               <p>And if a man ſhall inſtance in a mixed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as King and Parliament, to ſay, that the King in this was more natural then the Parliament, muſt be a ſtrange Affirmation.</p>
               <p>To argue from the Roman Dictator, an imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which ruin'd that Commonwealth and was not to be found in any other, that all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths have had the like recourſe in exigences unto the like remedy, is quite contrary to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal teſtimony of Prudence or Story.</p>
               <p>A man who conſiders that the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> hath ſtood one thouſand years, which never any Monarchy did, and yet ſhall affirm that Monarchical government is more natural then Popular, muſt affirm that a thing which is leſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural may be more durable and permanent then a thing that is more natural.</p>
               <p>Whether is a government of Laws leſs natural then a government of Men? or is it more natural unto a Prince to govern by Laws or by Will? Compare the violences and bloody rapes perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made upon the Crown, or Royal dignity in the Monarchies of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> with the State of the government under either Commonwealth, and tell me which was leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:114862:4"/>
or whether that which is more violent muſt therefore be more natural.</p>

                  <label>Anſwer.</label> In this (ſaith <hi>Machiavel</hi>) Princes loſe themſelvesand their Empire that they neither know how to be perfectly good nor intirely wicked. He might as well have ſaid, that a Prince is always ſubject to error and miſgovernment, becauſe he is a Man, and not a God nor a Divel. A ſhepherd unto his flock, a plough-man to his team is a better Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo not only an abſolute Prince but as it were a God. The government of a better or of a ſuperior Nature, is to a worſe or inferior as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God. The Creator is another and a better nature then the creature, the government in Heaven is of the Creator over his creatures that have their whole dependence upon him and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence in him. Where the Prince or the Few have the whole Lands, there is ſome what of dependence reſembling this; ſo the government there, muſt of neceſſity be Monarchical or Ariſtocratical; But where the people have no ſuch dependence, the cauſes of that Government which is in Heaven are not in Earth; for neither is the Prince a diſtinct or better Nature then the people, nor have they their ſubſiſtence by him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no ſuch effect. If a man were good as God, there is no queſtion but he would be not only a Prince but a God, would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by love and be not only obeyed but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped: or if he were ill as the Divel, and had as much power to do miſchief, he would be dreaded
<pb facs="tcp:114862:5"/>
as much and ſo govern by fear. To which later the nature of man hath ſo much nearer approaches, that albeit we never ſaw upon Earth a Monarchy like that of Heaven, yet it is certain the perfection of the Turkiſh Policy lies in this, that it cometh neareſt to that of Hell.</p>

Of all Controverſies of the Pen next thoſe of Religion, thoſe of Government are the moſt honourable, and the moſt uſeful, the true end of each, though in a different way, being that the will of God may be <hi>done in Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> Of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Government, thoſe in the vindication of Popular Government are the moſt Noble, as that from whence all we have that is good is deſcended to us, and which if it had not been, Mankind at this day had been but a <hi>Herd</hi> of Beaſts. <hi>The Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Popular government</hi> muſt be in an ill hand, or is a Game againſt which there is not a Card in the whole Pack, for we have the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and of the <hi>Romans,</hi> not to omit
<pb facs="tcp:114862:6"/>
               <hi>Machiavel,</hi> all for it: what have they; what can they have againſt us? A Sword; but that ruſts, or muſt have a Scabbard, and the Scabbard of this kind of Sword is a good frame of Government.</p>
            <p>A Man may be poſſeſſed of a Piece of ground by force, but to make uſe or profit of it, he muſt Build upon it, and Till it, by reaſon; <hi>whatever is not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Reaſon cannot be permanent.</hi> In reaſon there be two parts. <hi>Invention</hi> and <hi>Judgement.</hi> As to the later; <hi>in a Multitude of Counſellors</hi> (ſay both <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Machiavel) there is ſtrength.</hi> For Judgement there is not that Order in Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can compare with a <hi>Popular Aſſembly. The voice of the People is the voice of God.</hi> Hence it is, that in all well Order'd Policies the people have the ultimate <hi>reſult:</hi> but unleſs there be ſome other to <hi>invent,</hi> a <hi>Popular Aſſembly</hi> can be of no effect at all, but confuſion. <hi>Invention</hi> is a ſolitary thing. All the Phyſicians in the world put together inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not the circulation of the bloud, nor can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſuch thing, though in their own Art; yet this was invented by One alone, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented is unanimouſly voted and embraced by the generality of Phyſicians. The <hi>Plough</hi> and <hi>Wheels</hi> were at firſt (you muſt think) the invention of ſome rare <hi>Artiſts,</hi> but who or what ſhall ever be able to tear the uſe of them from the people? Hence, where Government is at a loſs, a <hi>ſole Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlater</hi> is of abſolute Neceſſity; nay where it is not at a loſs, if it be well modelled, as in <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Propoſers</hi> though frequently changeable, as in that caſe is Neceſſary, are very few, as the <hi>Counſellers,</hi> the <hi>Savi</hi> the <hi>Provoſts.</hi> Where ever a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is thus propoſed to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ballance or <hi>Popular</hi> Aſſembly will doe her duty to admiration, but till
<pb facs="tcp:114862:6"/>
then never. Yet ſo it hath been with us of late years, that albeit in <hi>Royal Authority</hi> there was no more then <hi>the right of propoſing,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> himſelf was to ſtand (<hi>legibus &amp; conſuetudinibus quas vulgus elegerit</hi>) to the <hi>reſult of the People,</hi> the popular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil hath been put upon <hi>Invention,</hi> and they that have been the prevailing party have uſed means to keep the <hi>Reſult</hi> unto themſelves, quite contrary unto the nature of popular Adminiſtration. <hi>Let one ſpeak and the reſt judge.</hi> Of what ever any one Man can ſay or doe, Mankind is the Natural and competent Judge, in which is contained the very reaſon of <hi>Parliaments:</hi> through the want of this Underſtanding came in Confuſion. <hi>Man that is in Honour and hath no underſtanding is like the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> Nor can we poſſibly return unto Order but by mending the hedge where it was broken. A prudent intire and fit propoſition made unto a free Parliament recovers all. To them who are of the greateſt Eminency or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in a Commonwealth belongs Naturally that part of Reaſon which is invention, and uſing this, they are to propoſe: but what did our Grandees ever invent or propoſe, that might ſhew ſo much as that themſelves knew what they would be at? and yet how confidently do they lay the fault upon the people and their unfitneſs (forſooth) for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: in which they are wondrous wiſe. For this I will boldly ſay where there was an Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that performed their duty, there never was nor ever can be a people unfit for Government; but to the contrary, where the Ariſtocracy have failed, the people (being once under Orders) have held very often. But while they are not under Orders if they fail it is not their fault, but the fault of the
<pb facs="tcp:114862:7"/>
Ariſtocracy; for who elſe ſhould model a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but Men of Experience? There is not in <hi>England</hi> (I ſpeak it to their ſhame) one GRANDEE that hath any perfect knowledge of the Orders of any one Commonwealth that ever was in the World. A way with this ſame grave complection, this huff of wiſdom maintain'd by making faces. The people cannot doe their duty conſiſting in judgement but by virtue of ſuch Orders as may bring them together and direct them; but the duty of the Ariſtocracy conſiſting in invention may be done by any one man and in his ſtudy; and where is there that one man among all the Grandees that ſtudies? They are ſo far from knowing their own duty, that a Man for propoſing that in which no man can find a flaw hath done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be ridiculous unto them, who are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous unto the whole world in that they could never yet propoſe any thing that would hold.</p>
            <p>But if this amount unto a demonſtration it amounts unto a cleer detection of your profound Grandees, and a full proof that they are <hi>Phanatical</hi> perſons, State-Jeſuits, ſuch as have reduced the Politicks to Mental reſervation, and implicite faith in their nods or night-caps.</p>
            <p>God to propoſe his Commandements to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wrote them in two Tables; the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri</hi> to propoſe their Commandements unto the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote them in twelve Tables. The <hi>Athenians</hi> propoſed in writing ſign'd with the name of the particular <hi>Inventor,</hi> After this pattern doe the <hi>Venetians</hi> (as was ſaid) the ſame at this day. But no Gooſe-quil, no ſcribling, your Grandees are above this.</p>

               <hi>Moſes</hi> who was the firſt Writer in this kind ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:114862:7"/>
be pardoned, but <hi>Machiavel</hi> the firſt in later times that hath revived his principles, or trodden in his ſteps, is deſervedly pelted for it by Sermons. They are not for the Scripture but the <hi>Cabala.</hi>

            <p>I will tell you a Story out of <hi>Bocalini.

Were there cauſe I could be modeſt, but this virtue to the diminution of ſound and wholeſome principles would be none: wherefore let a Grandee write and I will ſhew you <hi>Harpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi>

            <p>Thus having ſufficiently defi'd Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> I may with the leſs impeachment of reputation deſcend unto <hi>Tom Thumbe.</hi> Not that I hold my ſelf a fit perſon to be exerciſed with Boys-play, but that ſome, who ſhould have more wit, have ſo little as to think this ſomething. A good <hi>Rat-catcher</hi> is not ſo great a bleſſing unto any City, as a good <hi>Juggler-catcher</hi> would be unto this Nation.

                  <p>It was in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the greateſt Prince and Commander of his age, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with ſcarce inferiour Applauſe and equall fame, being a private Man, wrote that excellent piece of Prudence in his Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, which is called his <hi>Politicks,</hi> going upon far other Principles then thoſe of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s government, which it hath long out-lived: the like did <hi>Titus Livius</hi> in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> and <hi>Machiavil</hi> when <hi>Italy</hi> was under Princes that afforded him not the ear.

A man may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with a Ship and a good Pilot too, yet not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how to make Sea-cards. To ſay that a Man may not write of Government, except he be a Magiſtrate, is as abſurd as to ſay that a man may not make a Sea-card unleſs he be a Pilot.

For the Government that is Natural and eaſie being in no other direction than that of the reſpective ballance, is not of choice but of neceſſity.

of our Anceſtors, as from their Neceſſity. If Three hundred Men held at this day the like overballance unto the whole People, it were not in the power of Prudence to inſtitute any other then the ſame kind of Government, through the ſame Neceſſity. Thus the <hi>meaner ſort</hi> with Thucidides <hi>ſubmitting unto the Mighty,</hi> it came to <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes with hereditary honours;</hi> but the People comming to be wealthy, called their Kings though they knew not why, <hi>Tyrants,</hi> nay and uſing them accordingly found out means with as little deliberation it may be as a Bull takes to toſſe a Dog, or a Hern to ſplit an Hawk; that is, rather (as at the long run they will ever doe in the like caſe) by inſtinct than prudence or debate, to throw down that, which by the meer information of ſenſe they could no longer bear, and which being thrown down they found themſelves eaſed. But the queſtion yet remains, and that is (forſooth) whether of theſe is to be called <hi>Antient Prudence.</hi> To this end, never Man made a more unlucky choice then the Conſiderer hath done for himſelf of this Author, who in the very beginning of his book ſpeaking of the <hi>Pelopeneſian</hi> war, or that between the Commonwealths of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> ſaies, that <hi>the Actions which preceded this, and thoſe again that were more antient, though the truth of them through length of time cannot by any means be clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, yet for any argument that (looking into times far paſt) he had yet light on to perſwade him, he does not think they have been very great either for matter of war, or otherwiſe;</hi> that is for matter of Peace or Government; And leſt this ſhould not be plain enough, he calls the Prudence of the<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in the <hi>Magire.</hi>

True ſaith he, <hi>it is very frequent with ſuch as have been converſant with Greek and Roman Authors to be led by them into a belief that the reſt of the world was a rude inconſiderable people, and which is a term they very much delight in, altogether Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous.</hi> This ſhould be ſome fine Gentleman that would have Univerſities pulld down; for the Office of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is no more then to preſerve ſo much of Antiquity as may keep a Nation from ſtinking or being barbarous, which falt grew not in Monarchies but in Commonwealths; or whence hath the Chriſtian world that Religion and thoſe Laws which are now common, but from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews and Romans, or from whence have we Arts but from theſe or the Greeks? That we have a Doctor of Divinity or a Maſter of Art we may thank Popular government, or with what languages with what things are Schollars converſant that are otherwiſe deſcended? will they ſo plead their own cauſe as to tell us it is poſſible there ſhould be a Nation at this day in the world without Univerſities, or Univerſities without Hebrew, Greek and Latine, and not be barbarous, that is to ſay, rude, unlearned, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114862:13"/>
Yes, <hi>this humour even among the Greeks and Romans themſelves was a ſervile addiction unto narrow Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and a piece of very pedantical pride.</hi> What man! the Greeks and the Romans that of all other would not ſerve, ſervile! their Principles, their Learning, with whoſe ſcraps we ſet up for Bachelours, Maſters and Doctors of fine things, narrow! their inimitable eloquence a piece of very Pedantical pride! The world can never make ſenſe of this any otherwiſe then that ſince Heads and Fellows of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges became the only Greeks and Romans; the Greeks and Romans are become ſervily addicted, of narrow Principles, very Pedants, and prouder of thoſe things they do not underſtand, then the other were of thoſe they did; For ſay they, <hi>in this queſtion, the examples of the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Perſians, and Egyptians</hi> (not to omit the antient and like modern diſcoveries of the Queen of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> and of the King of <hi>China) cannot without groſſe partiality be neglected.</hi> This is pretty; they who ſay nothing at all to the policy of theſe governments, accuſe me, who have fully opened it, of negligence. The Babylonian, Perſian, and (for ought appears to the contrary) the Chineſſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, is ſummed up, and far exceld by that at this day of Turky; and in opening this, I have opn'd them all, ſo far from neglect, that I everywhere give the Turk his due, whoſe policy I aſſert to be the beſt of this kind, though not of the beſt kind. But they will bear me down and but with one Argument (which I beſeech you mark) that it is abſolutely of the beſt kind; for ſay they, <hi>it is of a more abſolute form</hi> (hath more of the Man and leſs of the Law in it) <hi>then is to be met with in any Kingdome of</hi> Europe.</p>
                     <p>I am amazed!

                     <p>THat part of the Preliminaries, which the Praevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator (as is uſual with him) recites in this place faſly and fraudulently, is thus. Relation had unto theſe two times (that of Antient, and that of Modern Prudence) the One as is computed by <hi>Janotti</hi> ending with the Liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> the other beginning with the Arms of <hi>Caeſar</hi> (which extinguiſhing liberty became the tranſlation of Antient into Modern Prudence, introduced in the ruine of the Roman Empire by the Goths and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals) <hi>Government to define it (de jure) or according unto Antient prudence, is an Art whereby a civil Society of Men, is inſtituted and preſerved upon the foundation of Common right or intereſt, or (to follow</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>and</hi> Livy) <hi>it is an Empire of Laws, and not of Men.</hi>

                        <hi>And Government to define it (de facto) or according unto Modern prudence, is an Art whereby ſome Man, or ſome few Men ſubject a City or a Nation, and rule it according unto his or their private intereſt, which becauſe the Laws in ſuch caſes are made according to the intereſt of a Man, or ſome few Families, may be ſaid to be an Empire of Men, and not of Laws.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereby it is plain, whether in an Empire of Laws, and not of Men, as a Commonwealth; or in an Empire of Men, and not of Laws, as Monarchy;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Law muſt equally proceed from will, that is either from the Will of the whole People, as in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; from the will of one Man, as in Abſolute, or from the will of a few Men, as in regulated Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That will whether of one, or more, or all, is not preſumed to be, much leſſe to Act without a Mover.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Mover of Will is Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That Intereſts alſo being of one, of more, or of all; thoſe of one Man, or of a few Men, where Laws are made accordingly, being more private, then comes duly up unto Law (the Nature whereof lyeth not in partiality but in Juſtice) may be called the Empire of Men, and not of Laws: And that of the whole People comming up to the Publique Intereſt (which is none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other then Common right and Juſtice, excluding all partiality or private Intereſt) may be truly called the Empire of Laws, and not of Men. By all which put together, whereas it is demonſtrable, that in this diviſion of Government, I do not ſtay at the Will, which muſt have ſome Motive or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but go unto <hi>the firſt and remoteſt Notion of Government in the Foundation and Origination of it, In which lies the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of this Diviſion, and the Definition of the ſeveral members;</hi> that is to ſay, of intereſt whether private or publique: The Praevaricator telleth me, That this <hi>Diviſion of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

If it be alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this example that it is a private one, the Caſe may be put between ſeveral Princes, States, or Governments, or between ſeveral States of the ſame Principality or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whether it be a regulated Monarchy or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; for in like Obligation of the States, (as of the King, the Lords and Commons) or parties agreeing, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate Patrum &amp; juſſu Populi,</hi> till the Parties that ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to the Obligation, ſhall agree to repeal or cancel it, lyeth all law, that is not meerly in the will of one Man, or of one State, or Party as the Oligarchy. But not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute theſe things farther in this place, let the Government be what it will, for the Prevaricator to fetch the Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law no farther then the will, while he knows very well that I fetcht it from intereſt, the Antecedent of will; and yet to boaſt that he hath out-thrown me, I ſay he is neither an <hi>honeſt man, nor a good Bowler.</hi> No matter, he will be a better Gunner; For where I ſaid that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate upon the Bench is that unto the Law, which a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon his Platform is to his Cannon; he goes about to take better Aim, and ſays, <hi>if the proportion of things be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately conſidered, it will appear that the Laden Cannon</hi>

                     <p>THe Doctrine of the Ballance is that, though he ſtrain at it, which choaks the Prevaricator: for this of all other is that Principle, which makes the Politiques (not ſo before the Invention of the ſame) to be undeniable throughout; and (not to meddle with the Mathematicks
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114862:16"/>
an Art I underſtand as little as Mathematicians doe this) the moſt demonſtrable of any whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe I ſhall rather take pleaſure then pains to look back or tread the ſame path with other and perhaps plainer ſteps; As thus; If a man having one hundred pounds a year, may keep one ſervant, or have one man at his Command, then having one hundred times ſo much, he may keep one hundred ſervants; and this multiply'd by a thouſand, he may have one hundred thouſand men at his Command. Now that the ſingle perſon, or Nobility in any Countrey of <hi>Europe,</hi> that had but half ſo many men at Command, would be King or Prince, is that which I think no Man will doubt. But (<hi>Point d'argent Point de Suiſſe</hi>) if the Money be flown, ſo are the Men alſo. Though <hi>riches</hi> in general <hi>have wings,</hi> and be apt to bate; yet thoſe in Land are the moſt hooded and ty'd unto the Pearch, whereas thoſe in money have the leaſt hold, and are the ſwifteſt of flight. A Bank where the money takes not wing, but to come home ſeaſed, or like a <hi>Coy Duck,</hi> may well be great; but the Treaſure of the Indies going out, and not upon returns makes no Bank; Whence a Bank never paid an Army, or paying an Army, ſoon became no Bank. But where a Prince or a Nobility hath an eſtate in Land, the Revenue whereof will defray this Charge; there their men are planted, have toes that are roots, and Armes that bring forth what fruit you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus a ſingle perſon is made, or a Nobility makes a King not with difficulty or any great prudence, but with eaſe, the reſt comming home, as the <hi>Oxe that not only knows his maſters Crib,</hi> but muſt ſtarve or repair to it. Nor for the ſame reaſon is government acquired with more eaſe then it is preſerved; that is, if the Foundation of Propriety be in Land; but if in money, <hi>lightly come, lightly go.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why a ſingle perſon or the Nobility that hath One hundred Thouſand men, or half ſo many at Command, will have the Government, is that the Eſtate in Land whereby they are able to maintain ſo many, in any <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paean</hi> Territory, muſt overballance the reſt that remains unto the People, at leaſt, three parts in four, by which means they are no more able to diſpute the Government
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114862:17"/>
with him or them, then your ſervant is with you. Now for the ſame reaſon, if the People hold three parts in four of the Territory, it is plain there can neither be any ſingle perſon nor Nobility able to diſpute the Government with them; in this caſe therefore (except force be interpoſed) they govern themſelves. So by this computation of the ballance of propriety or dominion in Land, you have according unto the Threefold Foundation of Propriety, the root or generation of the Threefold kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Empire.</p>
                     <p>If one man be ſole Landlord of a Territory, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance<note place="margin">Oceana, <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> the whole People, three parts in four, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, he is <hi>grand Seignior;</hi> for ſo the Turk not from his Empire, but his Propriety is called, and the Empire in this caſe is abſolute Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>If the few, or a Nobility, or a Nobility with a Clergy be Landlords unto ſuch a proportion as over ballanceth the People in like manner; they may make whom they pleaſe King, or if they be not pleaſed with their King, down with him, and ſet up whom they like better, an <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, or the ſeventh, a <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a <hi>Montforth,</hi> a <hi>Nevil,</hi> or a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſhould they find that beſt for their own ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: For as not the ballance of the King, but that of the Nobility in this caſe is the cauſe of the Government, ſo not the Eſtate or riches of the Prince or Captain, but his virtue or ability, or fitneſſe for the ends of the Nobility, acquires that Command or Office. This for Ariſtocracy, or mixed Monarchy. But if the whole People be Landlords, or hold the Land ſo divided among them, that no one Man, or Number of Men within the Compaſſe of the Few or Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy overballance them, it is a Common-wealth. Such is the branch in the Root, or the ballance of Propriety na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally producing Empire, which not confuted, no Man ſhall be able to batter my ſuperſtructures, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, I lay down my Armes. Till then, if the Cauſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily praecede the effect, Propriety muſt have a being before Empire, or beginning with it, muſt be ſtill firſt in order.</p>
                     <p>Propriety comes to have a being before Empire or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment two wayes, either by Natural or violent revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114862:17"/>
Natural revolution happeneth from within, or by Commerce, as when a Government erected upon one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, that for example of a Nobility or a Clergy, through the decay of their Eſtates comes to alter unto another bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; which alteration in the Root of Propriety leaves all unto Confuſion, or produceth a New branch or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the kind or nature of the roote. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent revolution happeneth from without, or by Armes, as when upon Conqueſt there followes confiſcation. Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation again is of three kindes, when the Captain taking all unto himſelf, plants his Army by way of Military Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Benefices, or Timars, which was the policy of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met;</hi> or when the Captain hath ſome ſharers, or a Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that divides with him, which was the policy introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Goths and Vandals; or when the Captain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Inheritance by lots, or otherwiſe, unto the whole People; which Policy was inſtituted by God or <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This triple diſtribution whether from natural or violent revolution, returns as to the generation of Empire, unto the ſame thing that is unto the nature of the ballance already ſtated and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Now let us ſee what the Praevaricator will ſay, which firſt is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Aſſertion that Propriety producing Empire conſiſteth only in Land, appears too poſitive.</hi> A Pig of my own Sow;<note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> this is no more then I told him, only there is more imply'd in what I told him, then he will ſee; which therefore I ſhall now farther explain. The ballance in money may be as good or better then that of Land in three caſes. Firſt, where there is no propriety of Land yet introduced, as in <hi>Greece</hi> during the time of her <hi>Antient imbecility,</hi> whence (as is noted by <hi>Thucidides) the meaner ſort through deſire of gain, underwent the ſervitude of the Mighty.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in Cities of ſmall Territory and great Trade, as <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Land not being able to feed the People, who muſt live upon Traffick, is overballanced by the means of that Traffick; which is money. Thirdly, in a narrow Countrey, where the lots are at a low ſcantling, as among the Iſraelites, if Care be not had of money in the regulation of the ſame, it will eat out the ballance of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114862:18"/>
Land. For which cauſe though an Iſraelite might both have money, and put it forth unto uſury; (<hi>Faenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis multis gentibus, Thou ſhalt lend</hi> (upon uſury) <hi>unto many nations</hi>) yet might he not lend it upon uſury unto a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 6. 23. 19.</note> or brother (<hi>Non Faenerabis fratri tuo</hi>) whence two things are manifeſt. Firſt, that Uſury in it ſelf is not unlawful. And next that Uſury in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forbidden, then as it might come to overthrow the ballance or foundation of the Government, for where a Lot as to the General amounted not perhaps to four acres: a Man that ſhould have had a Thouſand pounds in his Purſe, would not have regarded ſuch a lot in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of his mony, &amp; he that ſhould have been half ſo much in debt, would have been quite eaten out. Uſury is of ſuch a Nature as not forbidden in like caſes, muſt devour the Government. The Roman People while their Territory was no bigger, and their lots (which exceeded not two Acres a Man) were yet ſcanter, were flead alive with it; and if they had not helped themſelves by their tumults and the inſtitution of their Tribunes, it had totally ruin'd both them and their Government. In a Commonwealth whoſe Territory is very ſmall, the ballance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being laid upon the Land, as in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> it will not be ſufficient to forbid uſury; but money it ſelf muſt be forbidden; Whence <hi>Lycurgns</hi> allow'd of none, or of ſuch only as being of Old, or otherwiſe uſeleſs Iron, was little better, or (if you will) little worſe than none. The Prudence of which Law appeared in the neglect of it, as when <hi>Lyſander</hi> General for the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in the <hi>Peloponeſian</hi> war, having taken <hi>Athens,</hi> and brought home the ſpoil of it, occaſion'd the ruine of that Commonwealth in her Victory. The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> compared with <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> was at the moſt but a <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> and <hi>Laconia</hi> was leſſe then <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now if we imagine <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> divided as was <hi>Canaan,</hi> into ſix hundred thouſand lots, or as was <hi>Laconia</hi> into thirty Thouſand; a <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> Man having one Thouſand pounds in his purſe, would, I believe, have a better eſtate in Money then in Land; wherefore in this Caſe to make the Land hold the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, there is no way but either that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114862:18"/>
uſury, or that of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> by forbidding money. Where a ſmall ſumme may come to overballance a Mans eſtate in Land, there I ſay Uſury or money for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ballance in Land, muſt of Neceſſity be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, or the Government will rather reſt upon the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of money, then upon that of Land, as in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Genoa.</hi> But in a Territory of ſuch extent as <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> the Land being not to be overballanced by money, there needeth no forbidding of money or uſury. In <hi>Lacedemon</hi> Merchandize was forbidden, in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it was not exerciſed; wherefore unto theſe Uſury muſt have been the more deſtructive; but in a Countrey where Merchandiſe is exerciſed, it is ſo far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, that it is neceſſary; elſe that which might be of profit to the Commonwealth would ruſt unprofitably in private purſes, there being no Man that will venture his money but through hope of ſome gain; which if it be ſo regulated that the Borrower may gain more by it then the Lender (as at four in the Hundred, or thereabouts) Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry becomes a Mighty profit unto the Publique, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unto private Men; in which ſenſe we may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by them that do not obſerve the different cauſes that it is againſt Scripture. Had uſury to a brother been permitted in <hi>Iſrael</hi> that government had been overthrown: but that ſuch a Territory as <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> cannot be overballanced by money, whether it be a ſcarce or a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Commodity, whether it be accumulated by Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as in the purſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> or preſented by Fortune, as in the Revenue of the Indies, is ſufficiently demonſtrated, or ſhall be.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by an Argument (<hi>ad hominem</hi> one) good enough<note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> for the Praevaricator, who argues thus; <hi>The wiſedom or the riches of another Man can never give him a Title to my Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, nor oblige Mr.</hi> Harrington <hi>to give his Cloaths or Money to the next Man he meets, wiſer or richer then himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If he had ſaid ſtronger, he had ſpoiled all; for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with a mans Cloaths or Money in that caſe cannot be helped; now the richer as to the caſe in debate, is the ſtronger; that is, the advantage of ſtrength remains unto the ballance. But well; he preſumes me to have Cloaths
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114862:19"/>
and Money of mine own, Let him put the ſame caſe in the People or the ſimilitude doth not hold: But if the people have Cloaths and Money of their own, theſe muſt either riſe (for the bulk) out of Propriety in Land, or at the leaſt out of cultivation of the Land, or the revenue of Induſtry, which if it be dependent, they muſt give ſuch part of their Cloaths and Money to preſerve that dependence out of which the reſt ariſeth, to him or them upon whom they depend, as he or they ſhall think fit, or parting with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto this end muſt loſe all; that is, if they be Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, they muſt pay their Rent or be turned out. So if they have Clothes and Money dependently, the ballance of Land is in the Landlord or Landlords of the People: but if they have cloaths and money independently, then the ballance of Land muſt of Neceſſity be in the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in which caſe they neither would if there were any ſuch, nor can becauſe there be none ſuch, give their money or cloaths to ſuch as are wiſer, or richer, or ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then themſelves. So it is not a mans cloaths and money, or riches, that obligeth him to acknowledge the title of his obedience unto him that is wiſer or richer, but a mans no cloaths, nor money, or his poverty, with which if the Praevaricator ſhould come to want, he could not ſo finely praevaricate but he muſt ſerve ſomebody, ſo he were rich, no matter if leſs wiſe then himſelf; Wherefore ſeeing the People cannot be ſaid to have cloaths and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of their own without the ballance in Land, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ballance in Land, will never give their cloaths, or money, or obedience unto a ſingle perſon or a Nobility, though theſe ſhould be the richer in money, the Praevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator by his own Argument hath evinced that in ſuch a Territory as <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> Money can never come to overballance Land.</p>
                     <p>For a ſecond Demonſtration of this Truth, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh (albeit he miſt of the Indies, in which for my part I think he hit) was the richeſt in money of Engliſh Princes. Nevertheleſſe this acceſſion of Revenue did not at all <hi>praeponderate on the Kings part,</hi> nor change the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. But while making Farmes of a Standard, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Yeomanry; and cutting off Retainers, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed

                     <p>For a Third, the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince <hi>the ſilver of Potoſi ſailed up the Guadalquivir,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is, ſince that King had the Indies, ſtands upon the ſame ballance in the Lands of the Nobility on which it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtood.</p>
                     <p>And ſo the Learned Concluſion of the Praevaricator,<note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> 
                        <hi>That it is not to be doubted but a Revenue ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a force, able</hi> (to cry ware hornes) or <hi>beat down all oppoſition, does equally conduce to Empire, whether it ariſe from Rents, Lands, Profits of ready Money, Duties, Cuſtoms. &amp;c.</hi> asks you no more then where you ſaw her premiſſes: For unleſs they aſcended his <hi>Monti,</hi> and his <hi>Banks,</hi> it is not to be imagined which way they went, and with theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a profeſt <hi>Zealot for Monarchy;</hi> I would wiſh him by no means to be Montebanking or medling; for the Purſe of a Prince never yet made a Bank; nor till Spending and Trading money be all one, ever ſhall. The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> (which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could never doe with the Indies) can make you a Bank out of Letters of Exchange, and the Hollander with Herrings. Let him come no more here; Where there is a bank, ten to one, there is a Commonwealth. A King is a Souldier, or a Lover; neither of which makes a good Merchant; and without Merchandize, you will have a lean bank. It is true, the Family of the <hi>Medice</hi>'s were both Merchants, and made a Bank into a Throne: but it was in a Commonwealth of Merchants, in a ſmall Territory, by great purchaſes in Land, and rather in a meer confuſion then under any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled government; which cauſes if he can give them all ſuch another meeting, may do as much for another Man; otherwiſe let it be agreed and reſolved, that in a Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of any extent, the ballance of Empire conſiſts in Land and not in money, always provided that in caſe a Prince have Occaſion to run away (as <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi> out of <hi>Poland) his ballance in ready money is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the moſt proper for the carrying on of ſo great, and ſuddain an Enterprize.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:114862:20"/>It is an excellent way of diſputing, when a man hath alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no experience, no example, no reaſon to conclude with no doubt. Certainly upon ſuch occaſions it is not unlawful nor unreaſonable to be merry. <hi>Reaſons</hi> (ſays one Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian) <hi>are not ſo common as Blackberrys.</hi> For all that (ſaith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Commedian) <hi>no doubt but a revenue in taxes is as good as a revenue in fee-ſimple,</hi> for this, in brief, is the ſenſe of his former particular, or that part of it, which the Monti and the Banks being already diſcharged, remains to be anſwer'd. Yet that the Rents and Profits of a mans land in Fee-ſimple or Propriety, come in naturally and eaſily, by common conſent or concernment; that is, by virtue of the Law founded upon the publick intereſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore voluntarily eſtabliſhed by the whole people, is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent thing. So a man that will receive the Rents and Profits of other mens Lands, muſt either take them by meer force, or bring the people to make a Law deveſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſo much of their Propriety; which upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all one, becauſe a people poſſeſt of the ballance, can no otherwiſe be brought to make ſuch a Law farther then they ſee neceſſary for their common defenſe, but by force, nor to keep it any longer then that force continues. It is true, there is not only ſuch a thing in nature as health, but as ſickneſs: nor do I deny that there is ſuch a thing as a government againſt the ballance. But look about, ſeek, find where it ſtood, how it was ycleeped, how liked, or how long it laſted. Otherwiſe the comical Propoſition comes to this, <hi>It is not to be doubted but that violence may be permanent or durable,</hi> and the <hi>Blackberry</hi> for it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature is permanent or durable! What other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can be made of theſe words? <hi>It is not to be doubted but a revenue ſufficient to maintain a force able to beat down all oppoſition</hi> (that is a force able to raiſe ſuch a revenue) <hi>doth equally</hi> (on which word grows the <hi>Blackberry) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to Empire:</hi> that is as much as could any natural ballance of the ſame! He may ſtain mouths, as he hath done ſome, but he ſhall never make a Politician. The Earth yieldeth her natural increaſe without loſing her heart; but if you come once to force her, look your force continue, or ſhe yields you nothing: and the ballance of

                     <p>Divines are given to ſpeak much of things which the Conſiderer baulks in this place that would check them, to<note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</note> the end he may fly out with them in others, whereunto they do not belong, as where he ſaith, <hi>that Government is founded either upon Paternity, and the natural advantage the firſt Father had over all the reſt of Mankind, who were his ſons, or elſe from the increaſe of ſtrength and power in ſome Man or Men, to whoſe will the reſt ſubmit, that by their ſubmiſſion they may avoid ſuch miſchief, as otherwiſe would be brought upon them.</hi> Which two Vagaries are to be fetched home unto this place.</p>

But whether the eldeſt ſon of his houſe, if the Praevaricator can find him, at this time of the day. have the ſame right, is ſomewhat diſputable; becauſe it was early when <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> dividing Territories, became ſeveral Kings: and not long after when the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> being all Patriarchs, by the appointment of God (whoſe right ſure was not inferiour unto that of <hi>Adam</hi> though he had lived) came under Popular Government. Wherefore the advantage of the firſt Father is for grave Men a pleaſant phancy, nevertheleſſe if he had lived till now, I hope they underſtand that the whole Earth would have been his demeans, and ſo the ballance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety muſt have anſwered unto his Empire: as did that alſo of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> unto theirs. Wherefore this way of deduction comes directly home again unto the ballance.

unto whom as King and Prieſt <hi>Abraham</hi> paid tithes of all that he had.

                     <p>His ſecond Vagary is in his deduction of Empire from increaſe of ſtrength, for which we muſt once more <hi>round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Coal fire.</hi> The ſtrength wherof this effect can be expected, conſiſts not in a pair of fiſts, but in an Army, and an Army is a beaſt with a great belly, which ſubſiſteth not without very large paſtures; ſo if one man have ſufficient paſture, he may feed ſuch a beaſt, if a few have the paſture they muſt feed the beaſt, and the Beaſt is theirs that feed it. But if the People be the ſheep of their own paſtures, they are not onely a flock of ſheep, but an Army of Lyons, though by ſome accidents, as I confeſſed before, they be for a ſeaſon confinable unto their Dens. So the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or increaſe of ſtrength depends alſo upon the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. There is nothing in the world to ſwear this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple out of countenance, but the fame of <hi>Phalaris, Gelon, Dionyſius, Agathocles, Nabis, &amp;c.</hi> with which much good do them that like it. It is proper unto a Government upon the ballance to take root at home and ſpread out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and to a Government againſt the ballance to ſeek a root abroad, and to ſpread inwards; The former is ſure, but the later never ſucceſſeful. <hi>Agathocles</hi> for having conquer'd <hi>Affrica,</hi> took not the better root in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſa.

                     <p>To conclude this Chapter, the Praevaricator gives me this thank for finding out the ballance of dominion (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as antient in Nature as her ſelf, and yet as new in Art as my writings) <hi>that I have given the world cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a great diſappointment, who while at my hand that ſatisfaction in the Principles of Government was expected, which ſeveral great wits had in vain ſtudied, have in diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Whether the Ballance of Empire be well divided into National and Provincial; and whether theſe two, or Nations that are of diſtinct ballance, comming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon one and the ſame head, ſuch a mixture create a new ballance?</head>
                     <p>THe Ballance of Empire that is National as it is ſtated in the former Chapter, ſtands in regulated or mixed Monarchy upon the Propriety or Native intereſt of the Nobility, in a Commonwealth, upon the Propriety or Native intereſt of the People; ſo theſe are very natural. But the ballance of abſolute Monarchy partaking of force, as well as Nature, is a mixed thing and not much different from the ballance of Provincial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or the manner of holding a Province or conquer'd Countrey. In a Province, if the Native that is rich be admitted unto power, the power grows up Native, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertops the Forreign; therefore you muſt either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not plant your Citizens in your Provinces, where in time they will become native, or ſo planting them neither truſt them with Power nor with Armes. Thus the Provincial bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance comes to be contrary to the National. And as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114862:22"/>
where Empire is Native or national the adminiſtration of it can be no otherwiſe then according to the National bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; ſo where Empire is forreign or provincial the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it can be no otherwiſe then contrary unto the national ballance. That <hi>this may be admitted without Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

Wherefore if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by his war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commons alter'd the Ballance of <hi>Aragon,</hi> it muſt have been one of two ways, either by ſtrengthning the ballance of the Nobility, and governing the Aragonian People by them, in which caſe their ballance though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, remained yet National; or by holding both Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and People by a Provincial Governour and an Army, in which Caſe his Empire in that Kingdome is Provincial. There is no Third way, nor putting the Caſe that the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of <hi>Caſtile</hi> be National, and that of <hi>Aragon</hi> Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; doth this any more create in the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> a Third ballance of Empire, then did the Multiplication of Aſſociations and Provinces diverſe for their ballances in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome. England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united in one Prince, made (if it had been rightly uſed) an increaſe of ſtrength, but not a Third ballance; nor do the Kingdoms in <hi>Spain.</hi> Whether a Soveraignty have many Territories and Provinces in ſubjection, or in League, it is all one as to this point; the ſtronger Union or League will give the ſtronger ballance, and the Caſe of the preſent Soveraignties in <hi>Europe</hi> being no other; the <hi>more nice then wiſe</hi> Speculation of the Conſiderer, who hath not been able to diſcern the ballance of a League from that of Empire, is a <hi>Mares neſt.</hi>

                        <hi>in beaſts is ſo different from the emanation of humane reaſon</hi> (mark the Impoſtor! the Author is ſpeaking of natural affection, and he wipes out that, and puts in <hi>humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) that the inferences from</hi> (the natural affection of) <hi>the one, to the</hi> (degree of reaſon which is in the) <hi>other, muſt needs be very weak.</hi> Excellent! doth it therefore follow that the eminent degree of reaſon, wherewith all God hath endued man, muſt in him deface that natural affection, and deſertion in ſome caſes of private for common good, which is apparent even in beaſts?

Yes, <hi>Mr.</hi> Hooker'<hi>s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is altogether figurative, and it is eaſier to prove from thence that things wanting ſenſe make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and act by election, then that there is ſuch a thing as a common intereſt of mankind.</hi> This is like the reſt, <hi>Hooker</hi> ſpeaketh of the <hi>neceſſity</hi> that is in nature, and this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tranſlateth that ſenſe into the word <hi>election.</hi> So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſtone is neceſſitated to comply with the common intereſt of nature, without Diſcourſe or Election; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it rather follows from hence <hi>that things wanting ſenſe make diſcourſes and act by election then that there is ſuch a thing as a common intereſt of mankind.</hi> His old trick. I do not ſay that becauſe it is ſo with the creatures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be ſo with man: but as we ſee it is with the creatures in this part, ſo we find it to be with man.

hard, lay up, deny himſelf, venture his life for his little Commonwealth) is thus farther demonſtrated. All civil Laws acknowledge that there is a common intereſt of mankind, and all civil laws proceed from the nature of man; therefore it is in the nature of man to acknowledge that there is a common intereſt of mankind. Upon this acknowledgement of mankind, a man that ſteals is put to death, which certainly is none of his private intereſt; nor is a man put to death for any other mans private intereſt; therefore there is a common intereſt of mankind diſtinct from the parts taken ſeverally. But this though acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in part by all Governments, yet through their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural frailty is nothing ſo well provided for in ſome as in others: for if the power be in one or a few men; one or a few men (we know) may be thieves, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe applying money that is publick, without a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that is publick, unto uſes that are private, is thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. But ſuch thieves will not be hanged; in this caſe therefore the Government goeth not upon publick but private intereſt. In the frame of ſuch a Government as can go upon no other then the publick intereſt, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth that <hi>whole Philoſophy of the Soul</hi> which concerneth Policy: and this <hi>whole Philoſophy of the Soul</hi> being throughout the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> demonſtrated; For the Prevaricator to inſinuate that I have omitted it, is to ſhew what it is that he loveth <hi>more then truth.</hi> The main of this Philoſophy conſiſteth in depoſing paſſion and advancing reaſon unto the Throne of Empire. I expected news in this place, that this were to promiſe more for the Magiſtrate or the people, then hath been performed by Stoicks, but two Girles (meaning no body any harm) have provoked his wrath (forſooth) to ſuch extravagancy by the way, that though in all modeſty it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden (as he confeſſeth) by their cheeks, which diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>green ſickneſs,</hi> ſhew'd that they were paſt the rod, he hath taken them up!

Girles was no more, then that having a Cake (by gift of an Uucle or an Aunt, or by purchaſe, or ſuch an one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as was of their own making) in common, or between them, the one had moſt accurately divided, and the other was about to chooſe; when in comes me this rude fellow. <hi>How now Gentlewomen, ſaies he, what dividing and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing!</hi>

                        <hi>will no leſs ſerve your turn then the whole myſtery of a well order'd Commonwealth? who has taught you to caſt away paſſion (an't pleaſe you) like the Bran, and work up Reaſon as pure as the Flower of your Cake?

                     <p>But whereas either Office, that of dividing or chooſing, was Communicable unto either of the Girles, it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in the diſtribution of a Commonwealth, becauſe dividing is ſeparating one thing, one reaſon, one intereſt, or conſideration from another, which they that can ſo <hi>diſcern</hi> in private affairs are called <hi>diſcreet,</hi> but they that can doe it in Publick are <hi>prudent,</hi> and the way of this kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding in the language of a Commonwealth, is <hi>debating.</hi> But they that are capable of this kind of dividing or deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are <hi>few</hi> among <hi>many,</hi> that when things are thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and debated, are able enough to <hi>chooſe,</hi> which in the language of a Commonwealth is to <hi>reſolve.</hi> Hence it is that the <hi>debate</hi> of the <hi>few</hi> becauſe there be but few that can debate, is the <hi>wiſeſt debate,</hi> and the <hi>reſult</hi> of the many

                     <p>AMong diverſe and weighty reaſons why I would have that Prince look well to his file of Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, this is no ſmall one, that he being upon no ballance will never be able to give Law without them. For to think that he ſucceeds unto the Senate, or that the power of the Senate may ſerve his Turn, is a preſumption will fail him. The Senate, as ſuch, hath no power at all, but meer Authority of propoſing unto the people, who are the Makers of their own Laws, whence the Decrees of the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> are never Laws nor ſo called, but <hi>Senatuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſulta.</hi> It is true that a King comming in, the Senate as there it did, to his aid and advantage may remain, ſo they propoſe not as formerly unto the People, but now unto him who comes not in upon the right of the Senate, but upon that of the People (whence ſaith <hi>Juſtinian.

Wherefore the <hi>Zelot for Monarchy</hi> hath made a (<hi>pas de clerc</hi> or) foul ſtep in his proceſſion where he argues thus out of <hi>Cujacius.

Nor ſeeing I am gone ſo far, doth this at all imply free-will, but (as is admirably obſerv'd by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>) the freedome of that which naturally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes will, namely, Deliberation or Debate, in which as the Scale by the weight of Reaſon or Paſſion comes to be turned one way or other, the Will is cauſed, and being cauſed, neceſſitated.

                        <hi>where there is one ambitious poor man, or one vicious rich man, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any ſuch Government as can be ſecure from ſedition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which firſt is rather to make all Governments alike, then to object againſt any, ſeeing that there ſhould not be <hi>one ambitious Poor man,</hi> or <hi>one vicious Rich man,</hi> is equally if not more improbable in a Monarchy then in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That one Man alone, whether he be rich or poor ſhould without a party be able to diſturbe a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth with ſedition, is an abſurdity; nor is ſuch a party as may be able in ſome ſort to diſturbe the Peace by robbing upon the High-way, or ſome ſuch diſorder always able to diſturbe a Government with ſedition: Wherefore this feat goes not ſo much upon the ability of any one man <hi>Rich</hi> or <hi>Poor,</hi> as the puiſſance of the Party he is able to make, and this puiſſance of the party goes upon the Nature of the Government and the content or diſcontents thence deriving to the <hi>Few,</hi> or the <hi>Many.</hi> The diſcontents whether of the <hi>Few</hi> or the <hi>Many</hi> derive from that which is, or by them is thought to be ſome bar unto their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Intereſts</hi> which are the cauſes of ſedition are three; the deſire of <hi>Liberty,</hi> the deſire of <hi>Power,</hi> and the deſire of <hi>Riches,</hi> nor be there any more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for where the People through the want of bread, through violence offer'd unto their Women, or Oppreſſion, riſe up againſt their Governours, it relates unto the deſire of <hi>Liberty,</hi> thoſe alſo under the name of <hi>Religion</hi> make not a fourth but come unto One of the Three.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſpeak in the firſt place of the <hi>Many,</hi> and anon of the <hi>Few,</hi> the people in an <hi>equal Commonwealth,</hi> have none of theſe three <hi>Intereſts.</hi> Not the deſire of <hi>Liberty,</hi> becauſe the whole Frame of an <hi>equal Commonwealth</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſuch a Method whereby the <hi>liberty</hi> of the People is ſecured unto them. Not of <hi>power,</hi> becauſe the <hi>power</hi> which otherwiſe they could not exerciſe, is thus
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114862:30"/>
eſtated in them. Nor of <hi>riches,</hi> becauſe where the rich are ſo bounded by an <hi>Agrarian</hi> that they cannot <hi>overballence;</hi> and therefore neither Oppreſſe the People nor Exclude their induſtry or merit from attaining to the like <hi>eſtate, power, or honour,</hi> the whole People have the whole <hi>riches</hi> of the Nation already <hi>equally</hi> divided among them, for that the <hi>riches</hi> of a Commonwealth ſhould not go accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the difference of mens induſtry, but be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by the <hi>Pole</hi> were <hi>unequal;</hi> Wherefore the people in an equal Commonwealth having none of thoſe intereſts which are the <hi>cauſes of ſedition,</hi> can be ſubject unto no ſuch <hi>effect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To affirm then with the Conſiderer, <hi>that the whole of this Libration, is reduced to the want of power to diſturbe the Commonwealth,</hi> muſt needs be miſtaken, ſeeing in the Commonwealth propoſed the people have the <hi>power,</hi> but can have no ſuch <hi>intereſt,</hi> and the people having no ſuch <hi>intereſt,</hi> no party can have any ſuch <hi>power,</hi> it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a party ſhould come to <hi>overballance</hi> the People, having their Arms in their own hands. The <hi>whole matter being thus reduced unto the want of power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the Government;</hi> this according to his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will appear to be the <hi>Libration</hi> in which the <hi>power whereof the Governour is poſſeſſed ſo vaſtly exceeds the power remaining with thoſe, who are to obey</hi> (which in caſe of conteſt muſt be ſo ſmall a party) <hi>that it would be deſperately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable for them to hope to maintain their Cauſe. If the true Method</hi> then of <hi>attaining to perfection in Government be to make the Governour abſolute,</hi> and the people in an equal Commonwealth be <hi>abſolute,</hi> then there can be none in this Government, <hi>that upon probable terms can diſpute the power with the Governour,</hi> and ſo this State by his own Argument muſt be <hi>free from Sedition.</hi> Thus far upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the <hi>ambitious poor Man</hi> Objected. I have ſpoken of the <hi>Many,</hi> and in ſpeaking of the Many, implicitely of the <hi>Few;</hi> for as in an <hi>unequal Commonwealth,</hi> for Example, <hi>England</hi> during the Peerage or Ariſtocracy, the <hi>Many</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon or were included in the <hi>Few;</hi> So in an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Commonwealth</hi> the <hi>Few</hi> depend upon or are included in the <hi>Many,</hi> as the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> depends upon, or is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114862:30"/>
included in Great Council, by which it is annually ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the whole or in ſome part. So what was ſaid in an <hi>equal Commonwealth</hi> of the <hi>Many</hi> or the <hi>Poorer ſort,</hi> is alſo ſaid of the <hi>Few</hi> or of the <hi>Richer;</hi> who through the virtue of the <hi>Agrarian,</hi> as in <hi>Oceana,</hi> or of other <hi>Orders</hi> ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defect of an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> as in <hi>Venice,</hi> not able to <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verballance the people</hi> can never have any <hi>power</hi> to diſturbe the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> in caſe they had ſuch an <hi>intereſt,</hi> nor can have any ſuch <hi>intereſt</hi> in caſe they had ſuch power. For Example in <hi>Oceana</hi> putting the caſe, that the <hi>Few</hi> were as powerful as it is poſſible they ſhould be; that is, that the whole Land were fallen into five <hi>thouſand hands.</hi> The <hi>Five Thouſand</hi> excluding, the <hi>People</hi> could get no more <hi>Riches</hi> by it, becauſe they have the <hi>whole Land</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, no more <hi>Liberty</hi> by it, becauſe they were in perfect <hi>Liberty</hi> before; nor any more <hi>power</hi> by it, becauſe through the <hi>equality of the ballance</hi> or of their Eſtates, they can be no more by themſelves, then an <hi>equal Commonwealth,</hi> and that they were with the <hi>people;</hi> but would be much leſſe, the <hi>power or Commonwealth,</hi> in which there be <hi>Five thouſand Equalls,</hi> being not <hi>greater</hi> but much leſs then the <hi>power or Commonwealth</hi> wherein the whole people are <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall:</hi> becauſe the <hi>power or effect</hi> of a <hi>greater People</hi> is proportionably <hi>greater</hi> then the <hi>power or effect</hi> of a <hi>leſſer people,</hi> and the <hi>Few</hi> by this means would get no more then to be the <hi>leſſer people.</hi> So the people being no bar unto the riches, Liberty, nor power of the <hi>Five Thouſand</hi> and the <hi>deſire of Liberty, Riches, and Power</hi> being the only cauſes of <hi>Sedition,</hi> There could ariſe no <hi>Sedition</hi> in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth by reaſon of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> who have no ſuch <hi>intereſt,</hi> if they had the <hi>power,</hi> nor have any ſuch <hi>power</hi> if they had the <hi>intereſt,</hi> the people being equally poſſeſſed of the Government, of the Arms, and far ſuperior in Number. In ſumme, an equal Commonwealth conſiſteth but of one hereditary Order, as the <hi>people,</hi> which is by election divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>two Orders</hi> as the <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>Congregation</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> or the <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>Great Council</hi> in <hi>Venice;</hi> for the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> as hath been often ſaid, are the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> the reſt are <hi>Subjects.</hi> And an <hi>unequal Commonwealth</hi> conſiſteth of two <hi>Hereditary Orders,</hi> as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114862:31"/>
the <hi>Patritians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof the former only had an <hi>hereditary capacity of the Senate;</hi> whence it comes to paſſe that the <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>people</hi> in an <hi>equall Commonmealth</hi> having but one and the ſame <hi>intereſt,</hi> never were, nor can be at <hi>variance;</hi> and that the <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>people</hi> in an <hi>unequall Commonwealth</hi> having two diſtinct <hi>intereſts,</hi> never did nor can agree. So an <hi>equall Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> cannot be <hi>ſeditious,</hi> and an <hi>unequall Commonwealth</hi> can be no other then <hi>Seditious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Man be reſolved as the Conſiderer is, to huddle theſe things together, there is no making any thing of this kind of Policy; of which therefore it will be a folly to talk. For example, <hi>Lacedemon</hi> is either to be conſidered as not taking in the <hi>Helotes,</hi> and then in her ſelf ſhe was <hi>an equall Commonwealth</hi> void of any <hi>ſedition,</hi> or cauſe of it, how much ſoever ſhe were troubled with the <hi>Helotes.</hi> So the <hi>Objection</hi> made by <hi>him,</hi> of her troubles by the <hi>Helotes</hi> is impertinently urged, to ſhew that ſhe was a <hi>Seditious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi> Or if he will needs have it, that ſhe took in the <hi>Helots,</hi> it is undeniable that ſhe took them in <hi>unequally,</hi> and ſo was <hi>unequall,</hi> whence the <hi>troubles</hi> by the <hi>Helots</hi> muſt needs be impertinently urged againſt an <hi>equall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, when I alledge <hi>Venice</hi> from <hi>Piero Gradenigo,</hi> that is for the ſpace of about four hundred years from the preſent date, at which time the Reformation yet in force began, as an <hi>Example of an equall Commonwealth,</hi> for him to inſtance in the times before, when though the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> according to the intention, were as Equal as now, yet being not bound by ſufficient <hi>Orders</hi> to give her ſelf <hi>ſecurity</hi> of her <hi>Native Liberty,</hi> her <hi>Dukes</hi> on the one ſide, did what they pleaſed, and the inraged People on the other ſide baniſhed, condemned to death, or murthered them, who ſees not the <hi>Impoſture?</hi> Indeed he bluſhes at it himſelf. Wherefore my Aſſertion being not yet knocked on the head, he promiſeth to kill it better, firſt by the <hi>Example of Lacedemon leaving out the Helots,</hi> and next by that of <hi>Venice ſince the time of Piero Gradenigo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt you muſt know that once upon a time<note place="margin">Conſid. p. 60. <hi>Pauſan. Lacon.</hi>
                        </note> there was a quarrel between <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and <hi>Demaratus</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:114862:31"/>
Kings of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> about ſucceſſion which was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> that is, by a Court of Juſtice and not by the Sword; the like hapned in <hi>Leotychides</hi> the known baſtard of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> or ſo confeſſed to be by his Mother<note place="margin">Plut. Alc.</note> unto divers of her Maids. Now this is a Maxime in the Politicks where the differences of Kings can go no farther, then a Court of Juſtice, there the Government is ſeditious. Moſt ridiculous! Is there a ſtronger Argument that ſuch a Government is not Seditious? No matter give him room, <hi>Much more fatall was the conteſt between</hi> Cleonymus <hi>and his brother</hi> Areus <hi>the ſon of</hi> Acrotatus <hi>by whoſe war</hi> Zarax <hi>was ruin'd and</hi> Pyrrhus <hi>came into the game, who beſieg'd the Capital City: the reign of</hi> Agis <hi>and</hi> Cleomenes <hi>was ſo full of turbulency as</hi> would put a man out of breath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Fair, and ſoftly was not all this after <hi>Lyſander,</hi> and the Spoils of <hi>Athens</hi> and ſo ruin'd <hi>Lacedemon?</hi> I affirm there can be no ſedition in an Equal Cmmonwealth, and he to oppoſe me, ſhews that there was Sedition in an unequal One; whether doth this Affirm his Aſſertion or mine?</p>
                     <p>But for better luck in <hi>Venice. This City by Mr.</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington'<hi>s own confeſſion, is poſſeſt of ſeveral advantages.</hi> Yes, I ſay that the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> thus Seated is like a Man in a Cittadel who thereby may be the ſafer from his Enemies, but nere a whit the ſafer from diſeaſes. What concluſion would you expect he ſhould infer from hence? <hi>why among theſe therefore there is good cauſe to reckon her Immunity from ſeditions;</hi> Doth not our Logician repeat faithfully and diſpute honeſtly? Again, Sir, <hi>ſhe is like a Ship ready to be boarded by Pirates, hath the Turk on this Frontier, the Pope on that, the King of</hi> Spain <hi>on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> As if this were an Argument every Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt not be void of Sedition, ſeeing there is none except they be Iſlands, whoſe frontiers are not bounded by the Territories of other Princes. Well, <hi>but ſince the laſt Reiglement</hi> (in Engliſh Reformation) <hi>in the time of</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denigo; you have had <hi>three ſeditions in</hi> Venice, <hi>that of</hi> Marino Boccone, <hi>that of</hi> Baiamonte Tiepolo, <hi>and that of</hi> Marino Falerio.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bodin</hi> hath been long ſince beaten for this like Stockfiſh,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114862:32"/>
and yet our Author will be ſerving it up for a Courtly diſh. <hi>Bocconi</hi> would have kill'd the Duke, but was hanged before he could doe it. <hi>Felton</hi> kill'd a Duke, that had greater power here then the other in <hi>Venice,</hi> and was hang'd afterwards, therefore <hi>England</hi> was a ſeditions Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for this muſt either be undeniable for <hi>Felton</hi>'s ſake, or why muſt the other be ſo for <hi>Bocconi</hi>'s? Again, <hi>Falerio</hi> and his Complices would have deſtroyd the great <hi>Council,</hi> but were hanged before they could do it. <hi>Vaux</hi> and his Accomplices would have blown up the Parliament, but were hanged before they could doe it; therefore <hi>England</hi> was in this relation a ſeditious Government, elſe why was <hi>Venice?</hi> There paſſeth not a Moneth but there die Rogues at <hi>Tiburn,</hi> is the Government therefore ſeditious? or is this one regard in which it is not? where all that ſo invade the Government are by virtue of the ſame brought unto that end, there the Commonwealth, or the Orders of it are not the Cauſe but the Cure of Sedition, and ſo theſe are undeniable Arguments that <hi>Venice</hi> is not ſeditious, where ſince the Reformation there hath not been a cut Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon this ſcore, ſave onely through the conſpiracy of <hi>Baiamonte,</hi> which indeed came to blows. Nor for this yet, can <hi>Venice</hi> be called a ſeditious Commonwealth. You find no man accuſing <hi>Rome</hi> of ſedition in that ſhe had a <hi>Manlius</hi> or a <hi>Melius</hi> that dangerouſly affected <hi>Monarchy,</hi> becauſe unto theſe her Orders, by which they ſuffered death aſſoon appli'd the remedy. But <hi>Rome</hi> was a ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Commonwealth becauſe the perpetual fewd that was between the Senate &amp; the People ſprung out of her Orders, and was that to which there was no Remedy to apply. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was not a ſeditious Government becauſe it had a <hi>Vaux</hi> or a <hi>Felton,</hi> but becauſe the power antiently of the Nobility, and late of the People was ſuch by the Orders of the ſame as might at any time occaſion Civil war. Put the caſe a ſlave or ſome deſperate fellow have kill'd a Great Turk, the Government for that cannot be ſaid ſeditious, but in this that through the very nature of the Policy, the Janizaries at any time may do as much, it is undeniable ſeditious. <hi>Baiamonte</hi>'s conſpiracy he will not ſay was of this nature. It was not a diſeaſe in the bones of the Commonwealth, but a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114862:32"/>
thing that no ſooner appear'd, or broke out (though it be true, there happen'd a little ſcratching firſt) then it fell off like a ſcab; ſuch an accident may befall the beſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Venice</hi> never had the like but once: if he could ſay as much of a Monarchy, he gains no advantage; yet let him ſay it, and prove it, I give him all. I omit many falſhoods and abſurdities in the proceeding of the Prevaricator, as where he intimateth the power of the Dukes to have been that wherby <hi>Venice</hi> gained I know not what, and yet to have been that alſo by which <hi>Falerio</hi> had like to have ſpoiled all: Each of which (the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> having no power at all) is known to be falſe. Why ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſtay to put you in mind that having affirmed <hi>Venice</hi> to derive her Immunity from inteſtine diſcord no otherwiſe <hi>then a Ship, that is ready to be boarded by Pirates,</hi> he inſtanceth in ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the contrary, as took Occaſion by the hair of a Forreign ſcalpe, while in thoſe of <hi>Boccone</hi> and <hi>Tiepolo</hi> the Commonwealth by her Wars with the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> was put to her plunges, and in that of <hi>Falerio</hi> reduced unto the laſt extremity. I ſhall onely Note that if ſuch ſuddain Flaſhes as theſe may come under the name of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he hath done a fine Office for Monarchy, ſeeing no Senate is ſo much expoſed to like blowes, as any Prince.</p>
                     <p>Well; but for all this it is confeſſed that there may be ſuch a thing as a ſeditious Commonwealth, in that the fewd between the Senate and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> could not be cured; what <hi>ſecurity ſaith he will you give us, that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conſid. p. 48.</note> 
                        <hi>the like may not happen in</hi> Oceana, <hi>or that the whole body of the People being intrvſted with giving a Vote and keeping a Sword, may not by way of Counſel or Arms, fall to ſuch work as Levelling the Five Thouſand, or bringing the</hi> Agrarian <hi>from two to one Thouſand pounds a year, or leſs, as they phanſie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer by a like queſtion, What ſecurity will he give me that the People of any Commonwealth ſhall not caſt themſelves into the Sea? A Prince may be mad and doe ſo, but the people is naturally incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch madneſſe: If men will boaſt of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in principles and yet talk of nothing but effects;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114862:33"/>
why may not a Man fly as well as a Bird? but if cauſes may be regarded, let him once ſhew how the Will ſeeing it is not free, nor moved without ſome Object, ſhould move the people in ſuch a manner; or for what, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the Liberty and all the Power that can be had, ſhould ſtrive? Well, that is ſoon done, for <hi>the Land may come into the hands of Five thouſand, and ſo the Booty may be great and the reſiſtance ſmall.</hi> Good. The Romans being the wiſeſt of all people went no farther towards the Remedy of their grievances then to ſtrive for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> in which they fainted too, even to the Deſtruction of that Government. Except theſe, none have been ſo wiſe, and if there be any ſuch thing familiar with the Nature of the people, why appeared it but once, and then vaniſhed without effect? why did not the people for Example under the late Monarchy (when the Dominion or Freehold of the Nation, by greater ſhares, was in a ſmaller party, and they had not onely Riches, but Liverty, and Power too, to whet them on) ever ſo much as think of levelling Three hundred Men for the Nobility and Clergy in whom was the ballance, were no more. If it be reply'd that the people were not armed; by whom did the Barons make War with the Kings? If that they were not truſted with a Vote; what was that of the Houſe of Commons? Let Dominion or Freehold ſtand upon what ballance you will, unequal or equal, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world you ſhall never find a people turning Levellers: And as Reaſon is Experience in the root, ſo Experience is Reaſon in the branch, which might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſufficient in the Caſe. Nevertheleſs for clearer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in a point of ſuch Concernment, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to dig up and diſcover the Root of this branch, or the reaſon of this Experience. That which in Beaſts is inſtinct, whereof they can give no Account, is in it ſelf that wiſdome of God whereby he provideth for them; ſo is it with the People, they are not Levellers, nor know they why, and yet it is, becauſe to be levellers, were to deſtroy themſelves. For ſeeing I muſt repeat, to repeat briefly. There is no Territory of any Extent and Populouſneſſe where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of Induſtry is not twice as much as the dry Rent.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114862:33"/>
(This hath been demonſtrated in <hi>Oceana.</hi>) The revenue of induſtry is in thoſe that work, that is, the People: Wherefore the Revenne of the People, where their induſtry is not obſtructed, is twofold unto that of the Nobility, holding the whole Territory in Freehold. But where their Induſtry is obſtructed, their Revenue is nothing. Civil war being of all other the greateſt obſtruction of Induſtry, the People in taking Arms muſt venter all they have, for that, which if they obtain, they loſe two for one; and if they obtain not, all for nothing. Wherefore a People never will, nor ever can; never did, or ever ſhall take Arms for Levelling. <hi>But they are inſtructed with a Vote;</hi> and therefore taking away the Lands of the five Thouſand, or diminiſhing the <hi>Agrarian</hi> by way of Counſel, they need not obſtruct their induſtry, but preſerving the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of that, may bring themſelves into the poſſeſſion of the Land too. This will they, this can they leſſe do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being in Counſel they muſt propoſe ſomething for the advantage of the Commonwealth, or of themſelves, as their End in ſuch an Action. But the Land coming to be in the poſſeſſion of five Thouſand, falleth not into a Number that is within the compaſs of the few, or ſuch an One as can be Princes, either in regard of their number, or of their eſtates, but unto ſuch an One as cannot conſent to aboliſh the <hi>Agrarian,</hi> becauſe that were to conſent to rob one another, nor can have any Party among them, or againſt their Common intereſt, ſtrong enough to force them, or to break it, which remaining, the five thouſand neither be nor can be any more then a Popular State, and the ballance remaineth every whit as equal, as if the Land were in never ſo many more hands. Wherefore the Commonwealth being not to be bettered by this means, the People by Counſel can never go about to level nor diminiſh the <hi>Agrarian</hi> for the good of the Commonwealth. Nor can they undertake it for the enrichment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe the Land of <hi>Oceana,</hi> as hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, being levell'd or divided equally among the Fathers of Families only, cometh not to above Ten pounds a year unto each of them, whereas every Footman coſteth his Maſter Twenty pounds a year; and there is not a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114862:34"/>
Cottager having a Cow upon the Common, but with his own labour, at one ſhilling a day, gets Twenty pounds a years; which the Land being levell'd, were impoſſible, becauſe there would be no body able to ſet a Labourer on work, or to keep a Servant; wherefore neither would, nor could the People by Counſel go about any ſuch buſineſſe. So there being no poſſible cauſe of diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Few and the Many, the Senate and the People, there can be no ſuch effect; whence this is the <hi>government, which being perfectly equall, hath ſuch a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration in the frame of it, that no man in or under it, can contract ſuch Intereſt or Power, as ſhould be able to diſturb the Commonwealth with Sedition.</hi> Yet <hi>after all this,</hi> the Praevaricator <hi>will only tell Mr. Harrington</hi> (for to deny the Concluſion, is a fair way of diſputing) <hi>that this Libration</hi>

God or right reaſon, if I ſay that it is in humane prudence ſo to apply theſe banks, that they may ſtand as long as the River runneth; or let this Conſiderer conſider again, and tell me out of Scripture or Reaſon, why not. <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians,</hi> it is true, pretend to be the Monopoliſts of demonſtration; but ſpeak ingenuouſly, have they, as to the Politicks, hitherto given any other demonſtration, then that <hi>there is difference between ſeeing, and making of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles?</hi> Much more is that compariſon of the Politicks, going upon certain and demonſtrable Principles, unto Aſtrologers and Fortune-tellers, who have none at all vain and Injurious: For as in relation to what <hi>David</hi> hath ſaid, and Experience confirmed, of the Age of Man, that it is <hi>Threeſcore years and Ten;</hi> I may ſay, that if a Man lie bed-rid, or die before Threeſcore years and Ten, of any Natural infirmity, or diſeaſe, it was not through any imperfection of Mankind, but of his particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. So in relation unto the Principles and definition of an Equal Commonwealth yet unſhaken, nay untouched by this Praevaricator, I may ſafely affirm, that a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is a Government, which if it have been ſeditious, it hath not been from any imperfection in the kind, but in the particular Conſtitution, which where the like hath hapned muſt have been unequal.

                     <p>OF Monarchy I have ſaid, that whereas it is of two kinds, the One by Arms, the Other by a Nobility; for that by Arms, as (to take the moſt perfect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del) in <hi>Turkey,</hi> it is not in Art, or Nature to cure it of this dangerous flaw, that the <hi>Janizaries</hi> have frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and perpetual power to raiſe Sedition, or tear the Magiſtrate in Pieces. For that by a Nobility, as (to take the moſt perfect Model) of late in <hi>Oceana,</hi> it was not in Art or Nature to cure it of that dangerous flaw that the Nobility had frequent intereſt and perpetual power by their Retainers and Tenants to Raiſe ſedition and Levy war; whence I conclude that Monarchy reaching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the kind, reacheth not the perfection of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but muſt ſtill have ſome dangerous flaw in it.</p>
                     <p>This place (though I did not intend by it to make work for a Tinker) could not be of leſſe concernment then it proves to the Prevaricator, who as if he were obliged to Mend all; falls firſt to patching with a Monarchy by Arms, then with Monarchy by a Nobility; at length diſpairing, throws away each, and betakes himſelf with egregious confidence, to make out of both a New Monarchy, which is neither. By obſervation of theſe three Flouriſhes, the preſent Chapter may be brought into ſome Method: The firſt blow of his Hammer, or that whereby he intends the flaw or hole in Monarchy by Arms, ſhal henceforth be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and Tite, is this. <hi>That the Guards of the Kings perſon be</hi>

                        <hi>drawn out upon ſervice, and chiefly that they conſiſt not of one intire body, united under the ſame head, but be divided into diſtinct parties and Commands; as we may ſee in</hi> France, <hi>where though (in proportion to the: extent of their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) the Kings guards be more Numerous then thoſe of the</hi> Roman <hi>or</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Emperours, yet being divided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct bodies of</hi> French, Scots <hi>and</hi> Switz <hi>under their ſeveral Colonels and Captains, they have never been the Authors of any the leaſt ſedition: And in</hi> Turkey <hi>of late years they begin to learn the Art of poizing the</hi> Janizaries <hi>by the</hi> Spahy's, <hi>and ſo have frequently evaded the danger of their mutinies.</hi> Which fine work at the firſt view goes upon this falſe ground, <hi>that the Foundation of Monarchy by Arms is laid upon the Princes Guards or the Court Militia,</hi> whereas Monarchy by Arms conſiſteth in no other ballance, then the Princes being ſole Landlord, which where imperfect as it was in that of the Roman Emperors, the Empire is the moſt troubled, and where perfect as in <hi>Turkey,</hi> the Empire is leſſe ſeditions: For that which he ſaith of <hi>France,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Monarchy by a Nobility; and therefore is not to be confounded (according to his method) with this, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd unto the next branch.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Monarchy by Arms,</hi> though it be true that the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Dominion in any of the three kinds may be ſaid to be Natural, in regard of the Effect; yet ſeeing God <hi>hath given the Earth unto the Sons of Men,</hi> that of a ſole Landlord, <hi>as Turkey,</hi> is not ſo Natural in the cauſe or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>as the Timars,</hi> and therefore requireth the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome kind of force, <hi>as the Janizaries,</hi> who are not the root of the Government, that being planted in the Earth of the Timars or military Farmes and Colonies (for that the <hi>Janizaries</hi> are not the Foundation of this Empire, which was founded long before, is plain in that this Order was not introduced, till by <hi>Amurath the ſecond</hi>) but the Dragon that lyeth at that root, and without which the fruit would fall into the Mouths of the <hi>Timariots</hi> by way of propriety (as when the Knights fees granted firſt for life, became afterwards hereditary in <hi>Oceana</hi>) which would cauſe ſuch a fall from Monarchy that it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (as we have ſeen) the riſe of Popular power (the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114862:36"/>
Lots in caſe this ſhould happen, of the <hi>Timariots,</hi> little differing from thoſe divided by <hi>Joſhua</hi> unto the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) wherefore when this happens in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, it is at an end: And that this doth not happen, though there be diverſe other concurrent Policies, I would have any Man ſhew me, how it could be but for the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries:</hi> Otherwiſe it is plain that the <hi>Janizaries</hi> being a flying Army, on wing at all games, and upon all occaſions, are not ſo much the guard of the Prince, as of the Empire; which ruin'd, the Prey falls unto the <hi>Timariots,</hi> as thoſe that are in poſſeſſion, except theſe be ruin'd too, who being all Horſe, and far greater in Number then the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> that are Foot, would in caſe the awe of the Prince, and the policy of the Government which holds them divided, were broken, be invincible by the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs by theſe aids can eaſily contain them. <hi>Whence the ſedition of the</hi> Janizaries, <hi>like that of a Nobility, may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Prince, but never threatens the Throne; whereas the ſedition of the</hi> Timariots <hi>like that of a people would be more againſt the Throne then the Prince.</hi> Theſe things conſidered, and in them the Nature, Conſtitution, or Diſeaſe of Monarchy by Arms, we may conſult the more rationally with the Considerer upon the Applications or remedies by him offer'd, which are three.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, that the Guards of the Kings perſon be not increaſed beyond the neceſſity of ſecurity.</hi> But of what ſecurity, that of his Perſon, or of his Empire, or of both? for ſpeaking of a Monarchy by Arms, in this later ſenſe only it is true; and if ſo, then this ſingular Maxime of State <hi>(Fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora)</hi> might have been ſpared <hi>(Celaiſ'en va ſans le dire come les heures de noſtre curè.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>that they be not ſuffered to ſtagnate at Court, but be by a perpetual circulation, drawn out upon ſervice;</hi> for if there be not perpetual ſervice (it ſhould ſeem) Men might be apt to think that Government was inſtituted for peace as well as War. I add no more then is imply'd in his words, which as to this of <hi>Turkey</hi> have chanced well; where not the Stagnation of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> only but of the Court it ſelf (which by the inſtitution ſhould always be in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114862:36"/>
exerciſe of Arms) is the cauſe of that preſent decay, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable in this Empire. But the Prince ſitting ſtill or ſtagnating, to what the Circulation of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> (whoſe alienation from the Government, or intelligence with the <hi>Timariots,</hi> muſt needs be of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) could tend, ſhould have been thought on; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to expoſe the Empire to danger, for the ſafety of the Prince, is no cure of the Government.</p>
                     <p>But his chief remedy remains, <hi>this Court Militia muſt not conſiſt of one intire body united under the ſame head, but be divided under ſeveral Colonels, Captains, Parties, Brigades,</hi> and diſtributed unto ſeveral Quarters. As if this were a Cure, there were any Army that could be mutinous; but where he ſaies <hi>not united under the ſame head,</hi> he intimates perhaps divers Generals, and divers Armies; Now ſuch are the <hi>Turkiſh Beglerbegs</hi> and the Provinces under their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. That theſe therefore be kept divided, ſo that not any two of them can lay their heads together, without having them cut off; nor any Son ſucceed the Father in Government, requires that there be always a ſufficient force (diſtinct from the intereſt of the <hi>Timariots</hi> and <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbegs</hi>) united, and ſtill ready upon occaſion of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the <hi>Janizaries</hi> with the <hi>Spahi</hi>'s or Court horſe, being united, are no more then ſufficient for this ſervice: wherefore if theſe alſo were ſo divided as thereby to be weakened, they could not be ſufficient for this ſervice; and their diviſion except ſuch as might weaken them would be of no ſecurity to the Prince. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, under this awe, are leſſe apt to Rebel, then the Court guards to Mutiny, is no wonder; but the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards being cured by the preſcription of this Phyſitian, of poſſibility of Mutiny (which without weakening them is impoſſible) the Provinces (if Liberty, or Riches, or Power, be deſirable) would never indure the yoak of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore it being inavoidable in the <hi>Turkiſh Em</hi>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that either the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> or the <hi>Timariots</hi> may doe what they liſt (in regard that whether of them be able to give law unto the other, muſt at the ſame time be able to give law unto the Prince, and to bring them unto an equal ballance, were to make a Civil war, or at leaſt to ſow the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114862:37"/>
ſeed of it) the Native wound of Monarchy by Arms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains uncured and uncurable. What more may be done for <hi>Monarchy, founded upon a Nobility,</hi> comes next to be tried. In this the Conſiderer gives his word, that <hi>there never riſeth any danger unto the Crown, but when either a great part of the Soveraign power is put into the hands of the Nobility, as in Germany and Poland,</hi> (where it ſhould<note place="margin">Conſid. p. 47.</note> ſeem by him, that the Electors, and the Gentry, do not put power into the hands of the Emperor, or King, but the Emperor, or King, puts power into the hands of the Electors, or Gentry) <hi>or when ſome Perſon or Family is ſuffered to overtop the reſt in Riches, Commands, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, as the Princes of the bloud, and Lorrain, not long ſince, in France; and of old the Montforts and Nevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The firſt of theſe</hi> he declareth to be <hi>a vicious government, and a Monarchy only in Name; the ſecond</hi> he undertakes ſhall <hi>eaſily admit of this remedy. That the great ones be reduced</hi> (decimo ſexto) <hi>to a leſſer volume, and levelled into an Equality with the reſt of their Order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His <hi>put-pin</hi> is pretty, <hi>the Emperor puts power into the hand of the Electors; and the King of Poland puts power into the hands of the Gentlemen; which Governments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (and all ſuch like, as when the King of <hi>England</hi> put power into the hands of the Barons, at ſuch time as he was no longer able to keep it out of their fingers, by which means the Antient and late Government of King, Lords, and Commons was reſtored) <hi>are vicious Conſtitutions, and Monarchies only in Name;</hi> ſuch as he will not meddle with, and therefore let them go. Well; but where is the Patient then? if theſe be not Monarchies by Nobility, what do we mean by that thing? or what Government is it that we are to Cure? why ſuch an One, <hi>where ſome Perſon or Family is ſuffered to overtop the reſt in Riches, Commands, and Dependance, as the Princes of the bloud, and Lorrain, not long ſince, in France; and of old the Montfords and the Nevils in England.</hi> So then the ſame again (for theſe are no other) upon recollection, are thoſe <hi>that admit of this Eaſie cure. Let the great Ones be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a leſſer volume, and levell'd with the reſt of their Order.</hi> But how? if they be the weaker party, they are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114862:37"/>
not the <hi>great ones,</hi> and if they be the ſtronger party, how will he <hi>reduce them?</hi> Put the caſe a Man have the Gout, his Phyſitian does not bid him reduce his overtopping toes unto the <hi>volume</hi> of the other foot, nor to <hi>levell them unto Equality with</hi> the reſt of <hi>their Order,</hi> but preſcribes his remedies, and inſtitutes the Method that ſhould do this feat. What is the Method of our <hi>Aeſculapius? (Point de Novelle,)</hi> or where are we to find it? <hi>e'en where you pleaſe. The Princes of the bloud, and of Lorrain in France; the Montforts, and the Nevils in England,</hi> overtopped not their Order, by their own riches or power, but by that of the party, which for their fidelity, courage, or conduct, intruſted them with the managing of their Arms, or affairs. So the Prince that would have levelled them, muſt have levelled their party; which in caſe the controverſie be upon the right, or pretended right of the Nobility in the Government (which commonly makes them hang together) may come to the whole Order: what then? Why then,<note place="margin">Conſid. p. 49.</note> ſays he, the Prince muſt <hi>preſerve his Nobility weighty enough to keep the People under, and yet not tall enough in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon to meaſure with himſelf:</hi> which abating, the figure is the ſame again; and ſo I have nothing to anſwer but the figure. Now for this, the Prince himſelf is no otherwiſe <hi>tall,</hi> then by being ſet upon the ſhoulders of the Nobility; and ſo if they ſet another upon the ſame ſhoulders, (as in <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. or the 7th. who had no Titles unto the Crown, nor could otherwiſe have <hi>meaſured with the Prince</hi>) be he never ſo <hi>low,</hi> he comes to be <hi>tall</hi> enough in <hi>his particular perſon to meaſure with the Prince,</hi> and to be <hi>taller</hi> too, not only by thoſe Old Examples, but others that are younger than our ſelves, though ſuch (the <hi>Nobility having not</hi> of late, <hi>been weighty enough to keep the People under</hi>) as derive from another Principle, that of Popular ballance. <hi>A Prince</hi> therefore <hi>preſerving his Nobility weighty enough to keep under the people,</hi> muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in them the ballance of that kind of Empire; and the ballance containing the riches, which are the power, and ſo the Arms of the Nation; this being in the Nobility, the Nobility, when willing, muſt be able to diſpoſe of the King, or of the Government. Nor under a leſſe weight
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114862:38"/>
is a <hi>Nobility</hi> qualified <hi>to keep down the people,</hi> as by an Argument from the contrary; <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. having found the ſtrength of his Nobility, that ſet him in a Throne to which he had no right, and fearing that the tide of their favour turning, they might do as much for another, abated the dependance of their Tenants, and cut off their Train of Retainers, which deminution of their weight, releaſing by degrees the People, hath cauſed that Plain, or Level, into which we live to ſee the Mountain of that Monarchy now ſunck and ſwallowed; wherefore the ballance of the Nobility being ſuch as failing that kind of Monarchy comes to ruine, and not failing, the Nobility, if they joyn may give Law unto the King, the inherent diſeaſe of Monarchy by a Nobility, remains alſo uncured, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are points to which I had ſpoken before; but<note place="margin">The ballance of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note> ſomething concerning <hi>France, and Forraign Guards,</hi> was mumbled by the Praevaricator in a wrong place, while he was ſpeaking of <hi>Turkey,</hi> where there is no ſuch thing.

                     <p>The whole Territory of <hi>France,</hi> except the Crown Lands, which on this account are not conſiderable, conſiſteth of three ſhares, or parts, whereof the Church holdeth one, the Nobility another, and the Preſidents, Advocates, other Officers of the Parliaments, Courts of Juſtice, the Citizens, Merchants, Tradeſmen, the Treaſurers, receivers of the Cuſtomes, aids, taxes, impoſitions, Gabells, all which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make a vaſt body, hold a Third; by how equal portions I am ſorry that I do not know, nor where to learn, but this is the ballance of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, unto which the Paiſant holding nothing, but living (though in one of the beſt Countrys of the world) in the meaneſt and moſt miſerable Condition of a Labourer, or Hiend, is of no account at all.</p>
                     <p>The parties that hold the ballance in a Territory are thoſe of whom the Government doth naturally conſiſt, wherefore theſe are called Eſtates; ſo the Clergy, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,

                     <p>Where it not for this Example, I ſhould have ſaid, that the Indowment of a Clergy or Religious Order with Lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the erecting of them into an Eſtate of the Realm or Government, were no Antienter then the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> who introducing a like Policy, which unto this day taketh place throughout the Chriſtian world, have been the cauſe;</p>

                     <p>And thirdly, by rendring the Mitre able to make War; why of later Ages we have had ſuch a thing as War for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which till the Clergy came to be a Third State or Landlords, was never known in the World: For that ſome Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> taking Arms upon the uſurpation or violation of ſome Temple, have called it the <hi>Holy war;</hi>

                        <hi>that proportion, and the people the other half,</hi> (the ſhares of the Land may be equal; but in regard that the Nobility have much among Few, and the People little among Many; the Few will not be contented to have authority, which is all their proper ſhare in a Commonwealth; but will be bringing the People under power, which is not their proper ſhare in a Commonwealth; wherefore this Commonwealth muſt needs be unequal; and except by altering the ballance, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did by the <hi>Siſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthia,</hi> or reciſion of debts; or as the <hi>Romans</hi> went about to do by an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> it be brought to ſuch equality that the whole power be in the People, and there remain no more then Authority unto the Nobility) <hi>where is no remedy but the one</hi> (with perpetual fewd) <hi>will eat out the other, as the People did the Nobility in Athens, and the Nobility the People in Rome.</hi> Where the Carkaſs is, there will be the Eagles alſo; where the Riches are, there will be the Power: So if a few be as rich as all the reſt, a few will have as much power as all the reſt; in which caſe the Commonwealth is unequal, and there can be no end of ſtaving and tayling, till it be brought unto equality. This for the National ballance; for the provincial, there power doth not follow propriety, but to the contrary. This the Praevaricator having acknowledged, lets ſlip, to the end that he may <hi>take a grip of Venice;</hi> which becauſe the three or four thouſand of which originally conſiſted, and now conſiſteth that whole government, having acquired Provinces, and encreaſe of their City by later comers, do not admit theſe unto participation of power, he ſaith is an unequal Commonwealth. He will be a <hi>Mill-Horſe,</hi> whether <hi>the Cake be dough or not;</hi> for this is to draw in a circle; and <hi>Rome,</hi> which by his former arguments ſhould have been equal, by this again muſt be unequal, ſeeing <hi>Rome</hi> as little admitted her Provinces into the body of the Commonwealth as doth <hi>Venice.</hi> This claſh is but by way of Parentheſis, to return therefore unto the buſineſſe in preſent Agitation.</p>
                     <p>The eſtates, be they one, or two, or three, are ſuch (as was ſaid) by vertue of the ballance, upon which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment muſt naturally depend. Wherefore conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114862:40"/>
the Government of <hi>France</hi> (and all other Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of like ballance) was adminiſtred by an Aſſembly of the three Eſtates, and thus continued, untill that Nation being vanquiſhed by the Engliſh, <hi>Charls</hi> the 7th. was put to ſuch ſhifts, as for the recovery of himſelf in the greateſt diſtreſſe, he could make, unto which recovery while the Eſtates could not be legally called, he happening to attain without them, ſo ordered his affairs, that his Succeſſors by adding unto his Inventions, came to rule without this Aſſembly; a way not ſuiting with the nature of their ballance, which therefore required ſome Aſſiſtance by force, and other concurring Policies of like nature, whereof <hi>the forraign Guards</hi> of that Monarchy are one; The <hi>great baits alluring the Nobility</hi> another; and the <hi>Emergent intereſt of the Church</hi> a Third.</p>
                     <p>To begin with the laſt of thoſe, the Church, except it be in a War for Religion, as when they joyned with the Princes of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and what party of the <hi>French</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility were made, or they could make, againſt the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> are not of themſelves ſo hot at hand, or prompt unto Arms, but the King being (to uſe their word) no Heretick, through their great apprehenſion of the third Eſtate, as that which is moſt addicted unto the Proteſtant Religion, may be confident, they will never ſide with the People: So by this Emergent intereſt, or accident, he hath the Church ſure enough.</p>
                     <p>For the Nobility, which is exceeding gallant, this Change hath the greateſt baits; for whereas the Church being not ſpared, the Third Eſtate is laden, and the Paiſant overladen with taxes, the Nobility is not only at better eaſe in this regard, but for the greater, or more conſiderable part, receiveth advantage by it; the King having always, whether in peace, or war, a great Cavalry, then which there is no better in the world for the Exerciſe, Entertainment, and profit of the Nobility; Governments of Cities, Caſtles, Provinces in abundance, which he rarely diſtributes unto any other. The greater Nobility are <hi>Mareſchals, Generals;</hi> the leſſe Officers in the Armies, eſpecially of the Horſe, the Emoluments whereof they receive alſo in time of peace; and many of this Order
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114862:41"/>
being Penſioners, taſte of the Kings liberality, without taking pains, or having any Imployment at all. By which both that <hi>France</hi> is a Monarchy by a Nobility, and how ſhe holdeth her Nobility is apparent.</p>
                     <p>Now the Church and the Nobility ſtanding thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto the King, by which means he hath two parts of the ballance to one, it is demonſtrable that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be quiet. Nor ſeeing the Church for the reaſon ſhewn is ſure enough, comes the Government (ſince the Proteſtant Cities and Holds were demoliſhed) to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſquieted then by the flying out of the Nobility, which whenever it happens in any party conſiderable, either for the Number, or the Intereſt, cauſeth the Crown to ſhake; for it ſeldome cometh to paſſe upon this occaſion, but the Third Eſtate, or ſome part of it taketh Arms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. In which place it is worthy to be obſerved, that Wealth, according unto the diſtribution of the ballance, hath contrary motions. The Third Eſtate in <hi>France</hi> having riches, and thoſe laden with Taxes, come to have ſomething to loſe, and ſomething to ſave, which keepeth them in continual fear or hope. The Nobility holding unto the King, the Third Eſtate hath ſomething to loſe, which withholdeth them from Arms, through fear; but the Nobility flying out, the Third Eſtate hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſave, which precipitateth them into Arms through hope; whereas the Paiſant having nothing to ſave, or to loſe, to hope, or to fear, never ſtirs. The Caſe ſtanding thus, the ſufficiency of the <hi>French Politician</hi> (ſince the Maſter-piece of <hi>Cardinal Richelieu,</hi> in demoliſhing thoſe walls of the Proteſtants, which had otherwiſe by this time been a refuge for the Third Eſtate, and perhaps overturned the Monarchy) lieth altogether in finding for the Nobility work abroad, or ballancing them in ſuch ſort at home, that if a party flie out, there may be a ſtronger within to reduce it, or at leaſt to be oppoſed unto it. In this caſe, leſt the Native intereſt of the Nobility, ſince the Aſſemblies of the three Eſtates were aboliſhed, might cool the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining party, or make them ſlower in the redreſſe of ſuch diſorders, or diſcontents, then were requiſite, the King is wiſely provided of <hi>Forraign Guards;</hi> which being
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114862:41"/>
always in readineſſe, and not obnoxious unto the Native intereſt, may upon like occaſions be of more Expedition and truſt. Being come thus unto Forraign Arms, which is the point I more eſpecially propoſed unto my ſelf in the preſent diſcourſe, One objection in relation to what hath been already ſaid ſeemeth to interpoſe it ſelf. Seeing <hi>France,</hi> while it is not governed by the Aſſembly of States, is yet of the ſame ballance it was, when governed by the Aſſembly of States; it may be ſaid that a government of the ſame ballance may admit of divers Adminiſtrations.</p>
                     <p>To which I need make no other anſwer, then to put you in mind that while this Government was Natural, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by the Aſſembly of States, it is celebrated by <hi>Machiavel,</hi> to have been the beſt order'd of any Monarchy in the world; and that what it is, or hath been of later times, you may believe your own eyes or ears.</p>
                     <p>There be yet, before I can come unto Forraign Guards,<note place="margin">Of Arms, and their kind.</note> ſome praevious conſiderations; All government as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by what hath been already ſhewn, is of theſe three kinds. <hi>A government of Servants. A government of Subjects; Or a government of Citizens.</hi> The firſt is abſolute Monarchy, as that of <hi>Turkey:</hi> The ſecond Ariſtocratical Monarchy, as that of <hi>France:</hi> The third a Commonwealth, as thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Holland.</hi> Now (to follow <hi>Machiavel</hi> in part) of theſe, The Government of Servants is the harder to be conquer'd, and the Eaſier to be held. The Government of Subjects is the eaſier to be conquer'd, and the harder to be held. To which I ſhall preſume to add, That the Government of Citizens is both the hardeſt to be conquer'd, and the hardeſt to be held.</p>
                     <p>My Authors reaſons why a Government of Servants is the hardeſt to be conquerd, come to this, that they are under perpetual diſcipline and command, void of ſuch intereſts and factions, as have hands or power to lay hold upon advantages or innovation, whence he that invades the Turk muſt truſt unto his own ſtrength, and not rely upon diſorders in the Government, or forces which he ſhall be ſure enough to find united.</p>
                     <p>His reaſon why this Government, being once broken, is eaſily held, are, That the Armies once paſt hope of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114862:42"/>
rallying, there being no ſuch thing as Families hanging together, or Nobility to ſtir up their Dependants, unto far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reluctancy for the preſent, or to preſerve themſelves by complacence with the Conquerors, for future diſcontents or advantages, he that hath won the Garland, hath no more to doe but to extinguiſh the Royal line, and were it ever after in ſecurity. For the People having been always ſlaves, are ſuch whoſe Condition he may better, in which caſe they are gainers by their Conquerer, but can never make worſe, and therefore they looſe nothing by him. Hence <hi>Alexander</hi> having conquer'd the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, he and his Captains after him could hold it without the leaſt diſpute, except it aroſe among themſelves. Hence <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> the ſecond having taken <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and put <hi>Paleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor (whoſe Government was of like Nature with the <hi>Perſian</hi>) together with his whole Family unto the Sword, the <hi>Turk</hi> hath held that Empire without reluctancy.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, reaſons why a Government of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is eaſilier conquer'd, are theſe. That it is ſupported by a Nobility ſo Antient, ſo powerful, and of ſuch hold and influence upon the People, that the King without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if not ruine to himſelf or the Throne (an Example whereof was given in <hi>Hen. 7th</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) can neither invade their Priviledges, nor level their Eſtates, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, they have power upon every diſcontent to call in an Enemy, as <hi>Robert Count</hi> of <hi>Artois</hi> did the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> into <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſons why a Government of Subjects being ſo eaſily conquer'd, is nevertheleſſe the harder to be held, are theſe. That the Nobility being ſoon out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in ſuch a caſe, and repenting themſelves of ſuch a bargain, have the ſame means in their hands whereby they brought in the Enemy, to drive him out, as thoſe of <hi>France</hi> did both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Government of Citizens, as it is of two kinds, an Equal or an unequal Commonwealth, the Reaſons why it is the hardeſt to be conquer'd, are alſo of two kinds; As firſt the Reaſons why a Government of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens where the Commonwealth is equal, is hardeſt to be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114862:42"/>
conquer'd, are, that the Invader of ſuch a Society muſt not only truſt unto his own ſtrength, in as much as the Commonwealth being equal, he muſt needs find them united, but in regard that ſuch Citizens, being all Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or trained up unto their Arms, which they uſe not for the defence of Slavery but of Liberty (a Condition not in this world to be better'd) they have more eſpecially upon this occaſion the higheſt Soul of Courage, and (if their Territory be of any Extent,) the vaſteſt Body of a well diſciplin'd <hi>Militia,</hi> that is poſſible in Nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>an Example of ſuch an One overcome by the Arms of a Monarch, is not to be found in the World:</hi> And if ſome ſmall City of this Frame have happen'd to be vanquiſht by a potent Commonwealth, <hi>this is her Prerogative, her Towers are her Funeral Pile, and ſhe expireth in her own Flame, leaving nothing unto Conqueſt but her Aſhes, as</hi> Sag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ntum <hi>overwhelmed by</hi> Carthage, <hi>and</hi> Numantia by <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſons why a Government of Citizens, where the Commonwealth is unequal, is next the former, the hardeſt to be conquer'd are the ſame, with this difference, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit her Peace be not perfect within, her Condition is not to be better'd by any thing that is without; Wherefore <hi>Rome</hi> in all her ſtrife never call'd in an Enemy; and if an Enemy upon occaſion of her ſtrife, and hopes of advantage by it, came without calling, he preſented her with her moſt Soveraign Cure, who had no leiſure to deſtroy her ſelf, till having no Enemy to find her work, ſhe became her own.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>—<hi>Nondum tibi defuit hoſtis</hi>
                        </l>

                           <hi>In te verte manus</hi>—</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Nor is there any Example that a Government of this kind was ever ſubdued by the Arms of a Monarch; though ſome indeed may be found that have called or ſuffer'd Forraign Princes or Force to come in, as <hi>Holland</hi> by <hi>Marriages</hi> of their Princes, and <hi>Genoa</hi> through her <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as thoſe of the <hi>Fieſci</hi> and <hi>Adorni.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude this part for the Reaſons why a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Cuic. l. 11.</note> of Citizens ſo acquir'd or poſſeſt as through Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114862:43"/>
or faction is the hardeſt to be held, there needs no more then that Men accuſtomed unto their Arms and their Libertys will never endure the yoak; Wherefore the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> though a mighty King, no ſooner began in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a ſmall Commonwealth, to innovate or break her Orders, then ſhe threw him off with ſuch Courage and Diſdain, as is Admirable unto the World. And ſomewhat of the like kind did <hi>Genoa</hi> by the help of her <hi>Doria</hi> in the vindication of her liberty from <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To come by this fartheſt way about as I think the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way home. <hi>Arms are of two ſorts, Proper or Improper;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Proper and improper Arms.</note> 
                        <hi>that is, Native or Forraign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Proper and Native Arms, are according unto the triple nature of Government, of three kinds; Servants in Arms, as the <hi>Helots</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> the <hi>Timariots</hi> and <hi>Janizaries</hi> in <hi>Turkey:</hi> Subjects in Arms, as the Horſe in <hi>France,</hi> and the Sea-guards or Forces in <hi>Venice:</hi> or Citizens in Arms, as thoſe upon the <hi>Lexiarcha</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> of the <hi>Morae</hi> in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi> and the <hi>Legions</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>Improper or Forraign Arms are of two Sorts.</q>

                        <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> or <hi>Mercenaries.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> are ſuch as are ſupply'd by vertue of ſome League, as were thoſe of the <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> unto the <hi>Romans;</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Suiſſe</hi> (except <hi>Zurick</hi>) unto the King of <hi>France;</hi> or they may be ſuch as are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally lent freely, or let forth for money by one State unto another, the later whereof differ not much from <hi>Mercenaries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercenaries</hi> are Souldiers of Fortune that have no other Trade then their Arms, and let out themſelves for money; of ſuch conſiſted the greateſt part of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> ſtrength, ſuch is the land Force of <hi>Venice,</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Antient League of <hi>France</hi> with thoſe Nations, ſuch at this day are the <hi>Suiſſe</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Guards (and ſometimes a good part of the Foot) in <hi>France.</hi>

                        <hi>Machiavil</hi> diſcourſeth upon theſe particulars in his Art of War, unto Admiration: by whom I ſhall therefore ſteer.</p>
                     <p>Where the Arms in bulk are proper, and conſiſting of Citizens, they have other Trades; and therefore are no
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114862:43"/>
Souldiers of Fortune; and yet becauſe the Commonwealth hath Arms for her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trade (in regard ſhe is <hi>a Magiſtrate given for the good of Mankind, and beareth not her Sword in vain</hi>) they are all educated as well in Military as Civil diſcipline, taking their turns in ſervice of either Nature according unto the Occaſion, and the Orders of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, as in <hi>Iſrael, Athens, Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which had if their Territories permitted, and ſometimes (as I may ſay) whether their Territories permitted or no, as in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the vaſteſt the higheſt temper'd &amp; the beſt diſciplin'd <hi>Militia,</hi> that is to be found in the whole compaſs of Story. Some Armies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have conſiſted of three or four hundred thouſand Men: <hi>Rome</hi> upon the rumour of a <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> tumult, armed in <hi>Italy</hi> only, without Forraign aid,<note place="margin">Pliny L.

                     <p>Hence <hi>that a Commonwealth, which had not firſt broken her ſelf, or been broken by ſome other Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ſhould not be found to have been conquer'd by the Armes of any Monarch, is not miraculous but a natural effect of an apparent Cauſe.</hi> In this place, or upon this text, Divines whom I would deſire not to be Enemies of Popular power, but to give <hi>Machiavil</hi> his due, ſhall, if they pleaſe, hear him make a <hi>goodly Sermon,</hi> in theſe words. <hi>If Antient Commonwealths and Governments uſed diligence</hi>

                        <hi>in any other Order to make their people Lovers of peace, faithfully unto their Countrey, and having the fear of God before their eyes, they doubled it in this of their Militia: for of whom ſhould your Countrey expect greater faith, then of ſuch as have offer'd themſelves to die for her? whom ſhould ſhe endeavour to make greater Lovers of peace, then them who only can enſlave her by force? In whom ſhould there be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fear of God, then in ſuch as carry their lives in their hands? This when Lawgivers and Captains rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, was the Cauſe why Souldiers were eſteemed honour'd, followed and imitated above all men in the world, whereas ſince ſuch Orders are broken, and Cuſtome is altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated from the courſe of Antient prudence; men are come to deteſt the iniquity of the Campe, and fly the converſation of</hi>

                        <hi>ſuch as are in Arms, as the Peſtilence.</hi> Where the Arms in bulk are proper, but conſiſt of Subjects, they are the beſt next; and but the beſt next as appears by all Examples, Antient, or Modern. The Arms with which <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> Prince of <hi>Epyrus</hi> invaded the <hi>Romans</hi> were of Subjects, yet that Prince though he were not vanquiſhed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> confeſſed their advantage, and gave them over. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> being a far more potent King then was <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> hath acknowledged as much unto the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> though a far leſs Commonwealth then <hi>Rome:</hi> So have the Princes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> unto the <hi>Switz.</hi> That the Arms of Subjects are nevertheleſs as much ſuperior to the Arms of Servants, as inferior to the Armes of Citizens, is as plaine; Seeing as <hi>Alexander,</hi> with Thirty thouſand Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, vanquiſhed <hi>Darius</hi> having innumerable ſlaves; ſo Thirty thouſand Chriſtians are at this day a Match for any Army of <hi>Turks;</hi> and we ſee <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe force by Sea conſiſts of Subjects, to have made him quit that Element near as fully unto her Dominion or Empire, as did the <hi>Perſian</hi> to <hi>Athens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To Arms, that are proper, but conſiſt of Servants, all the preheminence that can be given, is that they are better then forraign Arms; a proof whereof we have in thoſe of <hi>Selimus,</hi> whereby he conquered the <hi>Mamalucks;</hi> who being but a forraign Force that held <hi>Egypt</hi> in ſubjection, the Countrey was irrecoverably loſt, and (for the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn) as eaſily kept.</p>
                     <p>Improper Arms, whether <hi>Auxiliary</hi> or <hi>Mercenary,</hi> where the Force of a Prince or of a Commonwealth conſiſteth, for the bulk or greater part, of no other, are the leaſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and the moſt dangerous of all. For <hi>Auxiliaries,</hi> or what effect hath been found of them by Princes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, it was ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> during the League by the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> during the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but eſpecially in the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> who having been <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> or <hi>Mercenaries</hi> rely'd upon by the later Emperors, came thereby to ruine the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercenaries,</hi> who make their Arms their Trade, muſt of all other be the moſt pernicious; for what can we expect
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114862:44"/>
leſſe of ſuch whoſe Art is not otherwiſe ſo profitable, then that they ſhould (as <hi>Machiavil</hi> ſhews) <hi>be breakers of their faith, given up unto rapine, Enemies of peace and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>

                     <p>To inſtance in ſome Commonwealths, that of <hi>Carthage</hi> after her firſt war with the <hi>Romans,</hi> fell through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Spendius,</hi> and <hi>Matho,</hi> Ring-leaders of her Mercenaries, into another that was far more dangerous. Of ſuch a Dilemma were the Arms of this State, that if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had conquered <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt have been King of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and not conquering <hi>Rome, Carthage</hi> was ruin'd. The Commonwealth of <hi>Milan,</hi> truſting her ſelf unto <hi>F. Sforza,</hi> and his mercenaries, became the Subject of her Servant, and he her Duke. Nor is <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Land forces are of the ſame kind, otherwiſe in ſafety, as to theſe, then by her ſituation. To give ſome inſtances of the ſame nature in Princes. The father of <hi>F. Sforza,</hi> being Captain of a like Mercenary Army, forced <hi>Joan Queen</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> whom he left diſarm'd in the midſt of her enemies, to lay her ſelf at the feet of the King of <hi>Aragon;</hi> and <hi>Braccio</hi> by ſuch another treachery had plainly poſſeſſed himſelf of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> had he not been broken at <hi>Aquila,</hi> where death intercepted his deſign. From what hath been ſaid, firſt of Government and then of Arms; if a Government of ſervants be harder to be conquer'd, and eaſier to be held, then in this Forraign Arms muſt needs be leaſt neceſſary, and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                     <p>If a Government of Subjects be eaſier to be conquered, and harder to be held, then in this Forraign Arms may be more neceſſary, but muſt be leſſe dangerous.</p>
                     <p>But though a Government of Citizens be both hardeſt to be conquered, and hardeſt to be held, yet as it is, again in this regard, of two kinds, this cannot be ſaid of each kind alike, wherefore I muſt diſtinguiſh.</p>
                     <p>In a Government of Citizens, if the Commonwealth be not for encreaſe, but preſervation only, as <hi>Lacedemon, Carthage, Venice,</hi> Forraign Arms are both neceſſary and dangerous; but in a Government of Citizens, where the Commonwealth is both for increaſe and preſervation, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114862:45"/>
                        <hi>Rome,</hi> Forraign Arms are neither neceſſary, nor dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                     <p>To Repeat the parts of this Concluſion, which being brief, is obſcure, more fully and particularly.</p>
                     <p>The Empire of <hi>Turkey</hi> is of the harder kind to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, wherefore the Turk needeth not forraign guards, to defend him, but it is of the eaſier to be held, wherefore let him take heed of intruſting his perſon with Forraign Guards, who having a forraign intereſt, may have a forraign Nation to aſſiſt them; and ſo the perſon of the Prince being in their hands, they have no more to do then to Extinguiſh the Royal Line, and the Empire, being eaſily held, is their own thenceforth with ſecurity. Thus the <hi>Mamalucks</hi> which were at firſt Forraign Guards, extinguiſhing the Royal line of the Kings of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> came to poſſeſſe, and hold that Realm without oppoſition. Who well conſiders this point, will never enough admire the policy of the Turk, in the creation (as it were) of his Janizaries, free from any National intereſt that might make them dream of, or deſire liberty, and yet ſoevoid of all forraign intereſt, or knowledge, that they know not what, or who were their Country or Parents. Hence though they have intereſt to murther the Turk, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do accordingly, they have no farther intereſt in the world, but what depends upon the Government; and ſo the Empire is ſafe, though the Prince be in danger; whereas if they were Forraign Guards, or had any Native intereſt, not only the Prince, but the Empire too would be in danger, the reſt being ſervants, and ſuch whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition might be bettered by a Change, but could be no worſe. Wherefore a Government of Servants muſt by no means admit of Forraign Guards, or <hi>Mamalucks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Empire of <hi>France,</hi> where the Nobility are not only ſubject to flie out, but to call in ſtrangers, may have uſe of Forraign Guards, which not obnoxious to Native intereſt, and factions, as thoſe of the Nobility, are the readieſt and beſt help at this lift, yet not dangerous, though having the Prince in their power, becauſe by him they are ſafe from the Nobility, who, were it not for the Prince, would be ſo far from bearing or brooking Forraign
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114862:45"/>
Guards, that in caſe a Forraigner came in upon their call, having the ſame means to help themſelves, whereby they brought him in, they would ſhake the yoak, and the Ends why they called him in being ſatisfied or repented of, drive him out again, as they did the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but if this Government being invaded or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, be ſo hard to be kept, how much harder being ſurprized? Wherefore in a Government by Subjects Forraign Arms may be more neceſſary, but muſt be leſſe dangerous.</p>
                     <p>In a Commonwealth for preſervation, as <hi>Lacedemon, Carthage, Venice,</hi> Forreign Arms are neceſſary: So <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> though able to defend her ſelf by her proper forces againſt any one City; yet the wars in <hi>Greece</hi> going much upon leagues and Confederates, was forced alſo to make uſe of her Confederates, and ſometimes of her <hi>Helots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as anciently to <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſo now to <hi>Venice,</hi> Forreign or Mercenary Forces are eſſential, becauſe for Land-ſervice ſuch a Conſtitution can have no other: Yet is this courſe extreamly dangerous, as appeared by <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> who (being ever in fear of her <hi>Helots</hi>) when ſhe had acquir'd upon the matter the whole Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> came by the rebellion of her Confederates, not only to loſe all, but to ruine. For <hi>Carthage</hi> upon the Mutiny of <hi>Spendius</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,</hi> ſhe eſcaped as at other times upon like occaſions, very narowly. That ſuch an accident neither hath befallen <hi>Venice</hi> nor can befall her, is to be attributed unto her ſituation, by which, in this regard, ſhe is ſecure: Nevertheleſſe, her progreſſe, or increaſe, which by this means either cannot be great, or being great, muſt render her but the more infirm, is full bard.</p>
                     <p>To a Commonwealth for increaſe, which always taketh in the whole body of the People, Forraign Arms (ſeeing ſhe aboundeth above all other kinds of policy, with ſuch as are proper) muſt needs be the leaſt neceſſary; and they are the moſt ſafe, becauſe never admitting them, but for her meer convenience, and frugality in expenſe of Native bloud, ſhe receiveth no ſuch charge of them as can recoyl, but muſt carry point blank, and as vigorouſly at her proper intereſt, very neer as her proper Arms. Thus did the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Italian Auxiliaries,</hi> of which joyned with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114862:46"/>
the <hi>Roman Legions,</hi> conſiſted a Conſular Army.</p>
                     <p>By thus much it ſeemeth <hi>that an inference from the ſucceſs of Arms unto the perfection of Government, and from the perfection of Government, to the ſucceſſe of Arms,</hi> ſhould be no fallacious way of diſputing.</p>
                     <p>But this hath been ſweaty work with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Conſiderer; (who loves his eaſe) it is enough to argue thus. <hi>The Switz, Scottiſh, and French guards, have never been the Authors of any ſedition, therefore the ſeditiouſneſſe of a Nobility may be mended by Forraign Guards;</hi> which is, as if one ſhould ſay, ſuch a Phyſitian hath never been the cauſe of the Gout; therefore the Gout may be cured by ſuch a Phyſitian. That Forraign Arms may be well enough applied in the caſe of a ſeditious Nobility, and have ſome good effects, is not denied, but is <hi>France</hi> therefore cured of her ſedition, or remains ſhe notwithſtanding her Forraign Guards, the moſt ſedious example in the world? If thus ſhe have not been, nor be, what hath he read of the Princes of the bloud in former times, or heard of late from them? But if thus ſhe have been, and be, is it not a fine way of cure to give us an example of the diſeaſe for the remedy? Nor are her Guards ſo void of ſedition neither; but the <hi>Switz,</hi> if he want his pay, dares threaten <hi>Paris;</hi> the <hi>Scot</hi> (at leaſt of late years) hath not been ſo bold; but if a Prince flie out, the Enſigns of the <hi>French</hi> Guards will one way or other be Captains, while Souldier and Officer too follows his affections or intereſts, which way ſoever they frame. I ſhould be glad to know when a Dragon fell from that Court, that did not bear down ſtars with his train. But the Prevaricator is ſet upon it, whereas of late years, the <hi>Janizaries</hi> are known to have been far more imbrued in the bloud of their Princes then ever: he gives us his honeſt word, <hi>that of late years in Turkey, they begin to learn the art of poiſing the Janizaries</hi> (who are the foot of the Princes Guard) <hi>by the Spahyes,</hi> (who are the horſe of the ſame) <hi>and ſo have frequently evaded the danger of their mutinies.</hi> At which rate, ſeeing every Army conſiſteth of Horſe and Foot, no Army could be mutinous. If theſe had not been meer ſlights, and ſo intended, he might have done well to have ſhewn us One Mutiny of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> appeaſed by the <hi>Spahyes.</hi> But all the parts of his Politicks (as was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114862:46"/>
ſaid of thoſe in <hi>Rhetorick</hi>) conſiſt of Pronunciation.</p>
                     <p>Thus the wounds of Monarchy, notwithſtanding the former, or this laſt remedy of Forraign Guards, are ſtill bleeding, or feſtering.</p>
                     <p>But his courage is undaunted, (<hi>aut viam inveniat aut faciat</hi>) he will either mend a Government, or make one, by aſſerting without any example, but with egregious<note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 48. 49.</note> confidence, <hi>That the perfection of Monarchy is free from thoſe flaws, which are charged upon it, and that it conſiſts in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by a Nobility, weighty enough to keep the People under, yet not tall enough in any particular perſon to meaſure with the Prince; and by a Moderate Army kept under the Notion of Guards, and Garriſons, which may be ſufficient to ſtrangle all ſedition in the Cradle, from which mixture, or Counterpoiſe of a Nobility and an Army, ariſeth the moſt excellent form of Monarchical Government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There's for your learning now, A Model which is a ſhort horſe, and a <hi>Legiſlator</hi> that hath ſoon curried him. To the parts of it, conſiſting of a Nobility, and in force, I have already ſpoken ſeverally. I ſhall now ſpeak unto the whole together; that is, unto the imagined mixture or Counterpoiſe of a Nobility and an Army; and becauſe there is nothing in Nature, that hath not had a natural effect by ſome example.</p>
                     <p>The ſcale of Arms, or of Iron, continued in the Line of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, and the ſcale of Propiety, or gold, continued in the Barons of <hi>England,</hi> and their Succeſſors. But in this, before the Barons wars conſiſted not the perfection of the Monarchy, becauſe it <hi>preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated too much on the ſide of Arms;</hi> nor after the Barons wars, becauſe the King, <hi>putting power</hi> (which he could not keep out of their fingers) <hi>into the hands of the Nobility,</hi> it became <hi>a vicious conſtitution, and a Monarchy only in Name,</hi> (ſo ſaith the Conſiderer) therefore the ballance being then only even, when neither the King could over-ballance, or get the better of the Barons, nor the Barons over-ballance, or get the better of the King; the perfection of <hi>Monarchy</hi> conſiſted in the <hi>Barons wars! Lycurgus</hi> the Second!</p>
                     <p>Mark; the King by all means muſt have a Nobility <hi>weighty enough to keep down the people;</hi> and then he muſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114862:47"/>
have an Army to <hi>hold gold weight with his Nobility;</hi> as if the Nobility in that caſe would keep down the People, and not fetch them up (as did the Barons) into their ſcale, that ſo together they might weigh down the Army; which ſooner or later is the infallible conſequence of this phantaſie; or let it be ſhewn where it was ever otherwiſe; to inſtance in <hi>France</hi> is quite contrary, where all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable offices, and commands being in the Nobility, or the richer ſort of that Nation, the <hi>ballance of Arms, and of propriety are not two, but one and the ſame.</hi> There is no way for Monarchy, but to have no Army, or no other then the Nobility, which maketh the regulated Monarchy, as in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. or to have an Army that may weigh down Nobility and People too; that is, deſtroy them both, which maketh the abſolute way of Monarchy, as in <hi>Turkey;</hi> the wit of man never found, nor ſhall find a third, there being no ſuch thing in Nature.</p>
                     <p>This Chapter is already with the longeſt, and yet I muſt give you a (corollary <hi>pouce de roy,</hi> or) Piece above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; upon a queſtion which the greeneſt Politician that ever brought his Verjuce to the Preſſe, hath ſpurr'd me.</p>
                     <p>Where he deſires to <hi>know my opinion of the way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by Councils, which he confeſſeth he hath always thought admirable; he doth not mean ſuch as are co-ordinate with the Prince (which have been ſeen in the world) but ſuch</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 49. 50.</note> 
                        <hi>as thoſe of Spain, purely of advice and diſpatch, with power only to inform and perſwade, not limit the Princes will. For almoſt all the weakneſſes which have been thought incident to Monarchy, are by this courſe prevented, and if there be any ſteadineſſe and maturity in the Senate of a Commonwealth, this takes it all in.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To give my Counſel without a fee, and deal ſincerely with a Prevaricator: Let the Prince (that is, ſuch an one as his) hold himſelf contented with his <hi>Divan,</hi> or <hi>Cabinet.</hi> If this be that he means, we are agreed; but if he would have more, I can make no leſſe of his words, then an han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after ſuch Councils as I have propoſed, and that theſe are ſuch as he <hi>always thought admirable, ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent almoſt all the weakneſſes incident to Monarchy, and take in the ſteadineſſe and maturity of a Commonwealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How may we make this agree with that other place?
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114862:47"/>
where he ſaith <hi>that there is no frame of laws, or conſtitution of government, which will not decay and come to ruine, unleſſe repaired by the prudence and dexterity of them that govern. Now that this may not be expected from a Monarch, as well as</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 68.</note> 
                        <hi>from a Senate, or aſſembly of men, he hath not yet met with any conviction, but rather finds it reaſonable to think that where debates are cleereſt, the reſult of them moſt ſecret, and the execution ſuddain, (which are the advantages of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy) there the diſorders of a State will ſooneſt be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the neceſſary remedies beſt applied.</hi> In that former place he bethought himſelf, that the debates of <hi>Rome</hi> were as clear as thoſe of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that her reſults were as ſecret as thoſe of <hi>Philip,</hi> or <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and of more ſuddain execution then either of theirs. He doubted it might be true, which is affirmed by good Authors, and commonly enough known, that for the clearneſſe of debate, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy of reſult, the world never ſaw any thing like the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> and that in all apparence they are for execution, as quick with the Divan, as the Divan can be with them. Now when all this is done, to baniſh ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous thoughts without ſhewing us for what cauſe, and knock under the table, is ſad news. But he ſhall find me, in any thing that is reaſonable, moſt ready to ſerve him. To the queſtion then, how ſuch Councils as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed would do with a Prince? I anſwer, truly the beſt of them, I doubt, but untowardly. One, that is the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Aſſembly, hath no mean, but is either the wiſeſt in Nature, or hath no brains at all. When affairs go upon no other then the Publick intereſt, this having no other intereſt to follow, nor eyes to ſee withal, is the wiſeſt Council: but ſuch ways are deſtructive to a Prince, and they will have no nay: The Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> would not hearken to their advice, depoſed him: and we know what Popular Councils, ſo ſoon as they came to ſufficient power, did in <hi>England.</hi> If a Prince put a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Council from this ward, He does a great matter, and to little purpoſe, for they underſtand nothing elſe but themſelves. Wherefore the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Spain,</hi> have diſſolved all ſuch Aſſemblies. It is true, where a Prince is not ſtrong enough to get money out of them, but by their cocſent, they are neceſſary, but then they are not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114862:48"/>
                        <hi>purely of advice and diſpatch,</hi> but ſhare in the Government, and he cannot be meddling with their Purſes, but they will be meddling with his Laws. The Senate is of fitter uſe for a Prince, and yet except he have the way of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but a tickliſh piece, as appears by <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who was deſtroyed by <hi>Pupienus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> Captains ſet up againſt him by this Order. To go unto the Root. Theſe things are not otherwiſe in prudence or choice then by direction of the ballance; where this is Popular no remedy, the Prince muſt be adviſed by the People, which if the late King would have endured, the Monarchy might have ſubſiſted ſomewhat longer, but while the ballance was Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as during the great Eſtates of the Nobility and the Clergy, we find not the People to have been great or wiſe Counſellors. In ſum, if a King govern by a Popular Council, or an houſe of Commons, the Throne will not ſtand long. If he governs by a Senate, or an houſe of Lords, let him never fear the Throne, but have a care of himſelf: there is no third as I have ſaid often enough but the Divan.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Whether a Commonwealth that was not firſt broken by her ſelf, were ever conquer'd by the Arms of any Monarch?</head>
                     <p>I Come in this Chapter to reſume the diſcourſe, where I broke off in the former, making good my aſſertion that a Commonwealth is the Goverment, which from the beginning of the world unto this day was never conquer'd by any Monarch; For if the Commonwealths of <hi>Greece</hi> came under the yoak of the Kings of <hi>Macedon,</hi> they were firſt broken by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>When I ſpeak of a Commonwealth, in relation to this point, I am no more to be argued againſt out of the <hi>Little Cities in Aſia,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Raguſa, and San Marino,</hi> which cannot be ſhewn to have had the Command of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Army, then I argue againſt the Praevaricator, where he aſſerts <hi>Monarchy to conſiſt of a mixture of Arms and of a Nobility,</hi> from the King of <hi>Yuetot</hi> who had neither.</p>
                     <p>This aſſertion in the judgement of any rational Man
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114862:48"/>
ought not to be encountered, but where there was a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral poſſbility of defence, in regard that a City which hath no Army at all, as <hi>Geneva</hi> (which yet being invaded by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> found means to defend her ſelf) or ſuch an one as is not conſiderable, ſhould be ſubdued by ſome potent Monarch (if we could find the Example) concerns the Government no more, then if it had been overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſome inundation, or ſwallowed up by ſome Earthquake. And yet all that is Oppoſed by the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, amounts not unto thus much. The teſtimony he brings out of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> comes far ſhort; for it is recorded (ſaith the Author ſpeaking of the <hi>Lucedemonians) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted by the bounty of</hi> Craeſus, <hi>they were the firſt that</hi>

Now if it were ſo, (and if otherwiſe let the Conſiderer ſhew) that theſe Commonwealths, inveagled by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Craeſus,</hi> came firſt under the <hi>Lydian,</hi> and fell with that under the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, when <hi>Craeſus</hi> was ſubdued by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> All I can learn by this example is no more than that <hi>Craeſus,</hi> for ought that is perceivable, might have bought thoſe Commonwealths as <hi>Coſimo</hi> of <hi>Medices</hi> did <hi>Florence;</hi> of whom it is affirm'd by <hi>Machiavel</hi> that <hi>there was not a conſiderable Man in the whole City that had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome conſiderable ſum.</hi> So this Example preſumes; but in the next (which is of <hi>Sicily</hi>) there is not ſo much as a Preſumption in favour of the Aſſertor, The State of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> before that which the <hi>Romans</hi> call the firſt <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> war being clear in Story againſt his deſign.

To him ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Son another <hi>Peter</hi> who through youth and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conceiving the power exerciſed by his Predeceſſors to be no more than his due, took upon him the Goverment as abſolute Lord of All, and ſtanding moſt formidably up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Guard grew ſottiſhly profuſe of the Publick money, committed many abſurdities and violences; By which means having incurred the hatred of the Citizens, he was baniſhed by the Signiory, with Cardinal <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> his brothers.

This is the Action for which the Praevaricator will have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to have been conquered by the Armes of a Monarch, though who reades the ſtory may very ſafely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, Firſt that <hi>Florence</hi> never attained unto any ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as could deſerve the Name of a Common-wealth; and next that the purſe of <hi>Coſimo</hi> had done that long before, which is here attributed unto the Armes of the Pope and the Emperour.

Let him that ſaith a Common-wealth hath been at any time conquer'd by a Monarch, to it gain, and ſhew us the Example. But though fruits and flowers be eaſily known each from other; their Rootes are latent, and not only ſo, but of ſuch reſemblance that to diſtinguiſh of theſe a man muſt be a Gardiner or an Herbaliſt. In this manner, the reaſon why a Common-wealth, hath not been overcome by a Monarch, hath been ſhewn in the diſtribution of Armes, thoſe of a Prince conſiſting of Subjects or ſervants, &amp; thoſe of a Common-wealth rightly Order'd, of Citizens, which difference relates plainly unto the perfection or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the Goverment.</p>

                     <p>Examples of the ballance introduced at the inſtitution, and by the Legiſlator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are firſt thoſe in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> introduced by <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Moſes;</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> which were Democratical or Popular.

                     <p>This may be done divers wayes, as by <hi>entailing</hi> the Lands upon certain Families, without power of Alienation in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſe, as in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> or except with leave of the Magiſtrate, as in <hi>Spain;</hi> but this by making ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies too ſecure, as thoſe in poſſeſſion, and others too de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpairing, as thoſe not in poſſeſſion, may make the whole People leſſe induſtrious.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the other way, which by the regulation of purchaſes, ordains only, that a Mans Land ſhall not exceed ſome certain proportion; for example, two thouſand pounds a year, or exceeding ſuch a proportion, ſhall divide in deſcending unto the Children, ſo ſoon as being more than one, they ſhall be capable of ſuch diviſion, or ſub-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, till the greater ſhare exceed not two thouſand pounds a year in Land, lying and being within the Native Territory, is that which is received and eſtabliſhed by the Common wealth of <hi>Oceana.</hi>

Except there be obſtruction or impediment by the Law, as in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky</hi> where the Countrey; and in <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> where the City is forbidden to increaſe. Where-ever there be a populous Country, for Example, <hi>France:</hi> it makes a populous City as <hi>Paris;</hi> And where-ever there be a populous City as <hi>Rome,</hi> after the ruine of <hi>Alba,</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> after the ruine (as to Trade) of <hi>Antwerp;</hi> it makes a populous Territory, as was that of the Ruſtick Tribes, and is that of <hi>Holland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the wayes how a populous City comes to make a populous Countrey, and how apopulous Countrey comes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114862:61"/>
to make a populous City are contrary; the one fiapning through <hi>ſucking,</hi> as that of the City, and the other through <hi>weining,</hi> as that of the Countrey.</p>
                     <p>For proof of the former, the more mouths there be in a City, the more meat of neceſſity muſt be vented by the Countrey, and ſo there will be more Corn, more Cattel, and better Markets, which breeding more Labourers, more Husbandmen, and richer Farmers, bring the Countrey ſo farre from <hi>a Common wealth of Cottagers,</hi> that where the bleſſings of God through the fruitfulneſs of late years with us, render'd the Husbandman unable <hi>to diſpute precedence with the Beggars-buſh,</hi> his Trade thus uninterrupted, in that his Markets are certain, goes on with increaſe of Children, of Servants, of Corn, and of Cattel; for there is no reaſon why the fields adjoyning unto <hi>Emporium,</hi> being but of an hard ſoyl, ſhould annually produce two Crops, but the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſs of the City.</p>
                     <p>The Country then growing more populous, and better ſtocked with Cattel, which alſo increaſeth manure for the Land, muſt proportionably increaſe in fruitfulneſs. Hence it is, that (as the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo were good at ſuch works) in <hi>Holland,</hi> there is ſcarce a puddle undrained, nor a bank of Sand caſt up by the Sea, that is not covered with Earth, and made fruitful by the People; theſe being ſo ſtrangely, with the growth of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> increaſed, as comes perhaps to two parts in three: nor, the <hi>Agrarian</hi> taking place in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceana,</hi> would it be longer diſputed, whether ſhe might not deſtroy Fiſhes to plant Men. Thus a populous City makes a Country milch, or populous by ſucking; and whereas ſome may ſay, that ſuch a City may ſuck from forraign parts, it is true enough, and no where more apparent than in <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> But a City that hath recourſe unto a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign dug, ere ſhe had firſt ſucked that of her proper Nurſe or Territory dry, you ſhall hardly finde; or finding, (as in ſome Plantation not yet weyned) will hardly be able to make that Objection hold, ſeeing it will not lye ſo much againſt the populouſneſs of the place, as the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But a populous Countrey, makes a populous City by <hi>weining;</hi> for when the People increaſe ſo much, that the dug of Earth can no more, the over-plus muſt ſeek ſome
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114862:61"/>
other way of Livelihood: which is either Arms, ſuch were thoſe of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandalls;</hi> or Merchandize and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, for which ends it being neceſſary, that they lay their heads and their Stock together, this makes populous Cities. Thus <hi>Holland</hi> being a ſmall Territory, and ſuckt dry, hath upon the matter weined the whole People, and is thereby become, as it were one City that ſucks all the World.</p>
                     <p>But by this meanes (ſayes the Conſiderer) <hi>Emporium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already too great</hi> (while indeed <hi>Amsterdam</hi> conſidering the narrowneſs of her Territory, or the ſmallneſs of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is much more populous) <hi>would immediately grow into an exceſs of power and riches, very dangerous unto Liberty, an Example whereof was ſeen in the late Tyranny of that City;</hi> As if it were not ſufficiently known that <hi>Amsterdam</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and hath contributed more unto the defence of the Common wealth, or united Provinces, than all the reſt of the League, and had in thoſe late Actions which have been ſcandalized, reſiſted not the intereſt of Liberty, but of a Lord. That the increaſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was alwayes ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died by her beſt Citizens, ſhould make her head too great for her body, or her power dangerous unto the Tribes, was never ſo much as imagined; and though ſhe were <hi>a City of Princes,</hi> her Ruſtick Tribes were ever had in greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and honour; inſomuch, that a Patrician would be of no other.</p>
                     <p>But the Authority of ancient Common wealths is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the <hi>Praevaricator</hi> by his own Argumentation or might, layes himſelf neck and heels.</p>
                     <p>For, ſaith he, <hi>Were this</hi> Agrarian <hi>once ſetled,</hi> Emporium <hi>would be a City of Princes, and the Nobility ſo throughly plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>

                        <hi>that they would be just as ſtrong of wing, as wild Foul, in moulting time.</hi> There would be a City of Princes, and yet no Nobility. He is ſo faſt that I have pitty on him, if I knew but which way to let him looſe. He meanes perhaps, that the Merchants growing rich, would be the Nobility; and the Nobility growing poor, would be Graſiers.</p>
                     <p>But ſo for ought I know, it was alwayes, or worſe, that is, men attained unto riches &amp; honours by ſuch or worſe arts, &amp; in poverty made not alwayes ſo honeſt retreats. Unto all
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114862:62"/>
which infirmities of the State, I am deceived, if this <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> do not apply the proper remedies. For ſuch an <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> maketh a Common wealth for increaſe: the Trade of a Common wealth for increaſe, is Arms, Arms are not born by Merchants, but by Noble-men, and Gentlemen. The Nobility therefore having theſe Arms in their hands, by which Provinces are to be acquired, new Provinces yield new eſtates; ſo whereas the Merchant hath his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in Silk or Canvas, the Souldier will have his return in Land. He that repreſenteth me as an Enemy to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, is the man he ſpeaketh of; For if ever the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth attain unto five new Provinces, (and ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth will have Provinces enow) it is certain, that (beſides honours, Magiſtracies, and the Revenues annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) there will be more eſtates in the Nobility of <hi>Oceana,</hi> of fourteen thouſand pound Land a year, then ever were, or can otherwiſe be of four; and that without any the leaſt danger unto the Common wealth: for if <hi>Rome</hi> had but lookt ſo farre to it, as to have made good her <hi>Agrarian</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> though ſhe had neglected the reſt, the wealth of her Nobility might have ſucked her Provinces, but muſt have enriched the People, &amp; ſo rather have water'd her Roots, then ſtarved and deſtroyed them as it did. In this Caſe therefore the Nobility of <hi>Oceana,</hi> would <hi>not moulter like wild Foul,</hi> but be ſtrong of wing as the Eagle.</p>
                     <p>One Argument more I have heard urged againſt the populouſneſs of the Capital City which is, that the rich in time of ſickneſs forſaking the place, by which meanes the Markets come to fail, the poor leaſt they ſhould ſtarve, will run abroad, and infect the whole Countrey. But ſhould a man tell them at <hi>Paris,</hi> or Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> (in the latter whereof, the Plague is more frequent and furious, then happens with us) that they are not to build Houſes, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſo much, leaſt they ſhould have the Plague, or that Children are not to be born ſo faſt, leſt they die, they would think it ſtrange newes. A Common wealth is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Lawes, and power to adde ſuch as ſhe ſhall finde needful. In caſe a City be in that manner viſited it is the duty of the Country, and of the Government, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them by contribution.</p>

Hereupon, having leiſure and being deſirous (in a matter of ſuch moment) of good advice he diſpatcht a meſſenger unto his father <hi>Herennius</hi> the ableſt Counſellor in <hi>Samnium,</hi> to know what might be his beſt courſe with the <hi>Romans</hi> now inavoydably at his mercy, who anſwered <hi>that he ſhould open the Paſſe, and let them return untouched.</hi> The young Generall amazed at this Counſell, deſired far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direction; whereupon <hi>Herennius</hi> for the ſecond time made anſwer <hi>that he ſhould cut them off to a man.</hi> But the Generall upon the ſtrange diſagreement of ſuch opinions, having his fathers age (for he was very old) in ſuſpition took a third courſe, which <hi>neither</hi> (according to the firſt advice of wiſe <hi>Herennius) making friends;</hi> nor (according unto the ſecond) <hi>deſtroying enemies,</hi> became as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyed the utter ruine of the Common-wealth of <hi>Samnium.</hi> For the <hi>Romans</hi> being diſmiſſed ſafe, but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly, the <hi>Senate</hi> upon their Return, fell into the greateſt ſtreight and conſternation, that had been known among them.

of this Vale invironed with Rocks, but he only that could not finde it out of the other, <hi>Posthumius,</hi> who having firſt ſhewed, that neither Warre nor Peace could be ſo made, as to ingage the Common wealth (<hi>injuſſu Populi</hi>) without the Command of the People, declared that the <hi>Senate</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> with ſuch other as had conſented unto ſo wicked and diſhonourable a peace, naked, and bound unto the <hi>Samnites,</hi> were free, nor ceaſed till the Senate (thereunto preſt by the Neceſſity of the Common wealth) reſolving accordingly, <hi>Hee, Veturius,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi> were delivered unto the <hi>Samnites;</hi> who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to hold the <hi>Romans</hi> unto their <hi>League,</hi> diſmiſſed them with ſafety.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114862:75"/>
remedies might have been of longer life and better health. The diſeaſes which this Common-wealth, from contention about the Agrarian, contracted, were acute, and tumultuous, but thoſe being ſlower, and without tumult, which ſhe got by prolongation of Empire were Chronicall, and went home with her, giving a warning by her Example, how dangerous it is unto States that would enjoy their liberty, to ſuffer Magiſtracy, how deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever conferd, to remaine long in the poſſeſſion of the ſame man. Certainly if the rest of the Romans, whoſe Empire hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be prolonged, had been as virtuous and provident as L. Quinctius, they had never run into this inconvenience. Of ſuch wholſome Example was the goodneſſe of this man, that the Senate and the people, after one of their ordinary diſputes, being come to ſome accord, whereas the people had prolonged the Magiſtracy of their preſent Tribunes, in regard they were perſons more fitly oppoſed unto the Ambition of the Nobility, then by a New Election they could readily have found, and hereupon the Senate (to ſhew they needed not be worſe at this game) would have prolouged the Conſulate unto Quinctius, he refuſed his conſent, ſaying that ill Examples were to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by good ones, and not encouraged by others like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor could they ſtirre his reſolution, by which meanes they were neceſſitated to make new Conſuls. Had this wiſdom and virtue (I ſay) been duly regarded, or rightly underſtood, it might have ſaved <hi>Rome,</hi> which through this neglect came to ruine. The first whoſe Empire happned to be prolonged was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilius Philo, his conſulate expiring at the Campe before Palepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, while it ſeemed unto the Senate that he had the Victory in his hand <hi>(Actum cum Tribunis Plebis eſt ad Populum, ferrent<note place="margin">Liv. b. 9.</note> ut cum Philo Conſulatu abijſſet, Proconſule rem gereret)</hi> they ſent him no ſucceſſor, but prolonged his Empire, by which meanes he came to be the firſt Pro-Conſul. An Expedient (though introduced for the Publick good) that came in time to be the publick bane: For by how much the <hi>Roman</hi> Armyes marched farther off, by ſo much the like courſe ſeeming to be the more neceſſary, became the more cuſtomary; whence enſued two pernicious conſequences, the one that there being fewer Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, and Men of known ability for conduct, the Art with the reputation of the ſame, came to be more ingroſſed, and obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious unto ambition: the other, that a Generall ſtanding long,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114862:76"/>
got ſuch hold upon his Army; as could take them off from the Senate, and hang them on himſelfe. Thus <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> could be followed by the Souldiery to the detriment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> to her perdition. Whereas had <hi>Rome</hi> never prolonged Empire ſhe might perhaps not ſo ſoon have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Greatneſſe, or acquiſition, but would have made leſſe haſt to deſtruction.</p>

                     <p>What I have confeſſed to be otherwiſe in <hi>Venice,</hi> I have ſhewn already at leaſt ſo far as concerneth the preſent Occaſion, the cauſes of that defect being incompatible with a Common-wealth conſiſting of the <hi>many;</hi> otherwiſe why was not the like found in <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> where though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man preſſed forward towards Magiſtracy, yet the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates were, for illuſtrious Examples, more in weight and Number, than are to be found in all the reſt of the world.</p>
                     <p>If where Elections were the moſt expoſed to the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Competitor, and the humours of the People they yet failed not to excell all others that were not Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, what greater vindication can there be of the Naturall integrity of Popular ſuffrage even at the worſt?

from all that preſſing for Magiſtracy in the Competitor, or faction of the People that can any wayes be layd unto the former; or let the Conſiderer conſider again, and tell me by what meanes either of theſe in ſuch a State can be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous or troubleſome, or if at worſt the orders for Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in <hi>Oceana</hi> muſt not perform that part, better then a Crowd and a Sheriff.

                        <hi>knowledge for the leading of a Common-wealth?</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was ſeldome or never without Men of Sufficient skill and ability; though the Orders there were more in Number, leſſe in Method, not written and of greater difficulty then they be in <hi>Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana:</hi> There, if not the <hi>Parliament man,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelf was upon <hi>Termes</hi> and <hi>Vacations,</hi> which unto a Council of ſuch Nature is the moſt dangerous thing in the world, ſeeing <hi>diſſolution,</hi> whether unto a body <hi>Naturall</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall</hi> is <hi>death.</hi> For if <hi>Parliaments</hi> happened to riſe again &amp; again, this was not ſo much <hi>coming unto themſelves,</hi> (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Council of ſo different Genius hath not been known) as a <hi>New birth</hi> and a Councill that is every year New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne indeed muſt <hi>keep a common-wealth in perpetnall Minority</hi> or rather Infancy; alwayes in danger of being overlaid by her <hi>Nurſe,</hi> or ſtrangled by her <hi>Guardian:</hi> whereas an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> continued by Succeſſion or due Rotation regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Terms</hi> giving ſufficient time for digeſtion, growes up, and is like a Man, who though he change his fleſh neither changeth his body, nor his ſoul. Thus the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> changing fleſh, though not ſo often as in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth conſiſting of the Many were requiſite, yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſt of any other in the world, is, both in Body and Soul or Genius, the moſt unchangeable Councill under Heaven. Fleſh muſt be changed or it will ſtink of it ſelf; there is a <hi>Terme</hi> neceſſary to make a man able to lead the Common-wealth unto <hi>her intereſt,</hi> and there is a <hi>Terme</hi> that may inable a Man to lead the Common-wealth unto <hi>his intereſt.</hi> In this regaurd it is, that (according to <hi>Mamerous</hi>) the Vacations are (<hi>mazima libertatis cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia) the Keepers of the Libertyes of</hi> Oceana.</p>
                     <p>The three <hi>Regions</hi> into which each of the leading Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cills, is divided, are <hi>three formes</hi> (as I may ſay) in the <hi>Schoole of State,</hi> for them of the <hi>Third</hi> (though there be care in the choice) it is no ſuch great matter what be their skill: The Ballot which they practiſed in the Tribe being that in the performance whereof no Man can be out, and this is all that is Neceſſary unto their Novitiate or firſt year, during which time they may be Auditors: by the Second, they will have ſeen all the Scenes, or the whole
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114862:79"/>
rotation of the Orders, ſo facile, and ſo intelligible, that at one reading a Man underſtands them as a Book, but at once Acting as a Play, and ſo Methodicall, that he will remember them better. Tell me then what it is that can hinder him for the ſecond year from being a Speaker; or why for the third, ſhould he not be a very able Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                     <p>The Senate and the Prerogative, or repreſentative of the people, being each of like conſtitution, drop annually four hundred, which in a matter of ten yeares, amount to four thouſand experienced Leaders, ready upon new electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to reſume their leading.</p>
                     <p>Another thing which I would have <hi>conſidered,</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our moſt Eminent Men found their parts in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or brought them thither. For if they brought them, think you not the Military Orders of the youth, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Tribes, the eight years Orb of the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, the Provincial Armies of <hi>Oceana,</hi> likely to breed Men of as good parts, as no ſuch matter? Nor have Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers that familiarity with the Starrs, which Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe Orbs will have with ſuch as are in them. He is very heavy, who cannot perceive that in a Government of this frame, the Education muſt be Univerſal, or diffuſed throughout the whole Body. Another thing which is as certain, as comfortable, is that the pretended depth and difficulty in matter of State, is a meer cheat. From the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World unto this day, you never found a Common wealth, where the Leaders having honeſty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, wanted skill enough to lead <hi>her unto her true intereſt at home or abroad:</hi> that which is neceſſary unto this end, is not ſo much skill as honeſty, and let the Leaders of <hi>Oceana</hi> be diſhoneſt if they can. In the leading of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth aright; this is certain, wiſdom and honeſty are all one, and though you ſhall finde defects in their vertue, thoſe that have had the feweſt, have ever been, and for ever ſhall be the wiſeſt.</p>

                     <item>The fourth ſhews the deduction of the Chirotheſia from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, or Aristocratical Government, and the ſecond way of Ordination from the Chirotheſia.

                     <item>The fifth debateth whether the Chirotonia uſed in the Cities mentioned were (as is pretended by Doctor <hi>Hamond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Seaman,</hi> and the Authors they follow) the ſame with the Chirotheſia, or a far different thing. In which are contained the divers kinds of Church-government introduced and exerciſed in the age of the Apoſtles.</item>

Now ſo to make my way into the parts of this diſcourſe, that whereas they who have heretofore menaged it in Engliſh, might in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Readers have neer as well written it in Greek, I may not be above the vulgar capacity; I ſhall open both the Names whereof, and the things whereupon we are about to Diſpute by way of Introduction.</p>

                     <p>Theſe words thus interpreted, I ſhall throughout my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (which elſe muſt have run altogether upon the Greek) preſume as already I have done, to take for good Engliſh, and ſo proceed unto the things whereof we are to diſpute; firſt, by opening the Scene of this perambulation, which will be done beſt by the help of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> a man as for his learning not inferior to any, ſo for his freedom not adicted unto inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, or parties. For the Remainder then of this Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall begin with the nineteenth Verſe of the eleventh, and continue my diſcourſe unto the end of the fourteenth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> interweaving the Text where it is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> of that excellent Author for light, and his <hi>Parapraſe</hi> with the <hi>Text,</hi> where it is clearer for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in manner following.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>They whom the heat of perſecution from the death of Stephen had diſperſed, travelled through the Cities and<note place="margin">Act. 11. 19.</note> Villages as far as Phenice, and the adjacent Iſland of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus; as alſo through Antiochia, which lyeth between Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice and Cilicia, preaching the Goſpel received from the Apoſtles, which nevertheleſs they dared not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but to ſuch only as were of the Iewiſh Nation, not out of envy, but a kind of Superſtition, they believing that to do otherwiſe were to give the Childrens bread unto doggs, which Chriſt hath forbidden.</p>
                        <p>But ſome of them that believed being of Cyprus and Cyrene, when they came unto Antioch, had the boldneſs to ſpeak of Chriſt unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord Ieſus, in which they made ſuch progreſs, through the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God upon them and their labours, that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe alſo believing the Goſpel, were turned unto the Lord. The tidings of theſe things coming unto the Ears of the Church, which was at Ieruſalem, a man of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſincerity, Barnabas the Levite, a Cyprian born, was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114862:85"/>
ſent by the Apoſtles to take a view of what was done upon the places, and if he found it to be according unto the will of God to approve of it, by authority of the Apoſtles. So great caution in receiving the Gentiles unto the Goſpel was not, but the thing was greatly deſired by the Apoſtles: but leaſt it ſhould afterwards be repeated or made void by the Iews, as done raſhly, or that the Gentiles ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſs upon what was done, as conceiving it needed rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Law. Wherefore Barnabas ſo ſoon as he came to Antioch, and found the Greeks by Faith, and without profeſsion of the Law, to have received the ſame grace of God with the Iews, was very much joyed that the number of Believers increaſed, and exhorted them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main conſtant in their Enterprize of adhering unto the Lord. For he was a good Man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of Faith. Wherefore through his Miniſtry it came to paſſe, that a Multitude of other Believers were added unto the former. Now Antioch being not far from Cilicia, the Neighbourhood of the place invited him to ſeck Paul the fitteſt helper in this work, as choſen by Chriſt to preach his Name unto the Gentiles, and Kings of the Earth. For when Paul fled from Ieruſalem, the Diſciples had conducted him to Caeſarea of Phenice, whence he went to Tarſus, whom therefore when Barnabas had found there, he brought to Antioch, hoping in a City both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and populous, (but with a confuſed mixture of Iews and Greeks) to receive the better fruit through the aid of an Apoſtle more peculiarly deſigned unto this work. Theſe two being converſant an whole year in the Church of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, which by the confluence both of Iews and Greeks, became very numerous, ſo many were added by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that whereas hitherto not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expoſing the Name of Chriſt unto Envy, they had been called Diſciples, they now began firſt at Antioch from the Name of their founder to be called Chriſtians. In theſe times certain Prophets came
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114862:86"/>
from the City of Ieruſalem unto Antioch, whereof one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Agabus, ſtanding up in the Congregation, ſignified by inſpiration, that there ſhould be a great dearth through the whole world; which came to paſs under Claudius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar the Succeſſor of Caligula. At this time they at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, partly becauſe they were poor at their converſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Goſpel, partly becauſe they had depoſited their goods in Common, and partly becauſe they had been ſpoiled by the Prieſts for their profeſsion of Chriſt, Ordained that by the contribution of ſuch as had wherewithall, eſpecially among the Believing Gentiles, money ſhould be ſent unto the relief of the Chriſtians dwelling in Iudea: but ſo, that this Contribution was not to he forced but free; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto every mans ability. This money thus gathered was ſent by Paul and Barnabas unto the Elders at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to be diſtributed at their diſcretion unto ſuch as were in need. While Paul and Barnabas were thus employed, King Herod, the ſame that had beheaded Iohn, and returned Christ clothed through deriſion in white unto Pilate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grieved to ſee this kind of People increaſe, and the Name of Ieſus King of the Iews to grow famous in divers Nations, became concerned to root out ſuch a Faction, and ſo ſpreading; wherefore he stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the Church, killed Iames the Brother of Iohn with the ſword, and becauſe he ſaw it pleaſed the Iews, proceeded farther to take Peter alſo, who being impriſoned, was afterward miraculouſly delivered. But Paul and Barnabas having performed the Truſt committed unto them by the brethren, and delivered the Contribution for relief of the Poor unto the Apoſtles, returned from Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem unto Antioch, taking with them Iohn whoſe Surname was Mark.</p>
                        <p>Now the Church of Antioch flouriſhed in ſuch manner, that ſhe had ſome filled with the gift of Prophecy, &amp; others withthat of teaching, among whom was Barnabas and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114862:86"/>
Simeon alias Niger together with Lucias a Cirenian, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trach, whom he left to come unto Chriſt; but the chief of them was Saul endowed with all the gifts and graces apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical. While<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all theſe were intent upon the Miniſtry of the Church, imploying their ſeveral gifts unto the glory of God, and in his moſt acceptable ſervice, the ſalvation of Souls with Faſting and Prayer, The Holy Ghoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up by their zeal, ſignified his will by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſaying, Separate me Barnabas and Paul for the work whereunto I have called them, namely, to be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Gentiles, that by them I may propagate the Goſpel. The command of the Spirit was obeyed, and Barnabas with Paul, to the end that every one might ſee who were choſen, were ſeparated from the reſt; and when the Congregation had unanimouſly imoplored the favour of God by Prayer and Faſting, the moſt eminent in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among them, laid their hands upon the perſons ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and ſent them wherever the Spirit of God ſhould direct them. By this impulſe therefore Barnabas and Paul went unto Selencia, being a Promontory of Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, and thence ſailed into the Iſland of Cyprus, where landed at Salamis a famous City upon the Eaſtern part of the Iſland, they preached not humane inventions, but the Word of God, nor that by ſtealth, but in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of the Jews, whereof through the Neighbourhood of Syria there was ſtore. This honour by the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Chriſt was alwaies deferd unto the Jews, that the Goſpel ſhould be firſt offerd unto them, leaſt they being a querulous and repining Nation ſhould complaine that they were deſpiſed; thus travelled theſe Apoſtles through the whole Iſland, till they came unto Paphos, a City con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated unto Venus upon the Weſtern Coaſt of Cyprus. Here they found a certain Magician called Bar-Jeſus, that is the Son of Jeſus a Jew, both by Nation and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114862:87"/>
under which colour he falſely pretended unto the gift of Propheſie. This Man followed the Court of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Paulus Pro-Conſul or Governor of the Iſland for the Romans, otherwiſe a prudent Man; but this ſort of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine inſinuateth it ſelf into the Beſt to chooſe that ſo their corruption may do the greater and more compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miſchief unto Mankind. The Proconſul nevertheleſs having underſtood the Goſpel to be planting throughout Cyprus, not only forbore to ſtop the Ears of others, but by ſending for Baruabas and Paul ſeem'd deſirous to open his own. Wherefore Bar-Jeſus endeavouring to reſiſt the growth of the Word, as an enemy to Chriſt, and reſiſting the Truth with falſehood, a ſtrife aroſe between the true Prophets, and a falſe One, (for ſuch is the interpretation of the Syriack word Elymas,) whom Paul at the length confuted of ſpiritual blindneſs, by taking away the Eyes of his body miraculouſly ſtrucken in the preſence of the Pro-Conſul, who at the ſame time receiving the Light of the Goſpel, imbraced the Chriſtian Faith This being done at Paphos, Paul embarqued there with his Aſſociates for the leſſer Aſia, and came unto Perga, being a City of Pamphylia; here John whoſe Surname was Mark left them, and returned unto Jeruſalem, while they when they had viſited Pamphylia travelled unto Antiochia, a City of Piſidia, where having entred a Synagogue, they ſat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the uſual manner with the reſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon Paul ſtanding up preached unto them Chriſt; whence came the word of Lord to be divulged throughout that Region, albeit the Jews out of Envy to the Gentiles

Wherefore certain of the Cenſors have thought fit to conſult me, whether they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a man that is of a forraign City for that cauſe our of the Senate. Now becauſe the Law, though it forbid the adoption of a forreigner, commandeth not that a Forraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for that cauſe ſhould be removed out of the Senate, and I am informed there be forreign Citizens almoſt in every Senate: ſo that many, not only Men, but Cities might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

Theſe (though <hi>Cicero,</hi> would hardly receive any of them) were towards the latter time of the Common-wealth, extended by the provincial Magiſtrates unto ſo great a burthen to the people, that it cauſed divers Laws to be paſſed in <hi>Rome (de repetundis)</hi> for reſtitution to be made unto the Provinces, by ſuch as had injured them. Upon ſuch Laws was the proſecution of <hi>Verres</hi> by <hi>Cicero,</hi> When and where this kind of <hi>Court</hi> was to be held, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, Pro-Conſul,</hi> or <hi>Praetor</hi> by <hi>Proclamation</hi> gave timely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, being aſſembled at the time, and the City appointed, in the <hi>Town Hall</hi> ſtood a <hi>Tribunal,</hi> upon this the <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> or Chair of State, in which ſat the <hi>Conſul, Pro-Conſul,</hi> or <hi>Praetor</hi> with his <hi>Praetorian Cohort</hi> or Band about him, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all manner of <hi>pomp,</hi> and Officers requiſite unto the ornament, or adminiſtration of ſo high a Magiſtracy.

                     <p>There be in theſe times that are coifed with ſuch opinions, that to ſhew <hi>Scripture</hi> to be reaſon, is to make it looſe weight with them, and to talk of the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> is to prophane it; of theſe I ſhall deſire no more than to know how they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that place of <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> for if they can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe make ſenſe of it, than as I have done, it is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof, (letting the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> go) of all that I have ſaid.

                     <p>There is in the Old Teſtament no mention of laying on of Hands by way of <hi>Ordination,</hi> or election, but only by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the deſignation of <hi>Joſhua</hi> for his <hi>Succeſſor;</hi> and in this <hi>Moſes</hi> did firſt as <hi>Romulus</hi> afterwards in the Election of the <hi>Praefect</hi> or <hi>Protector</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> but upon a far greater exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Romulus</hi> did the like; was ſeated or planted, but the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> did this, was neither ſeated nor planted, nor indeed a Common-wealth, but an Army deſigned to be a Common-wealth. Now between the Government that is neceſſary unto an Army, and that which is neceſſary to a Common-wealth, there is a vaſt difference. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even of the Armies of <hi>Rome,</hi> when ſhe was a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, was nevertheleſs <hi>Monarchical:</hi> in this regard <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf exerciſed a kind of <hi>Dictatorian Power</hi> for his life, and the Common-wealth being not yet planted, nor having any <hi>ballance</hi> whereupon to weigh her ſelf, muſt either have been left at his death unto the care of ſome man, whom he knew beſt able to lay her foundation, or unto extream hazard; wherefore this <hi>Ordination</hi> which was but accidental, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent Military condition of the people, <hi>Moſes</hi> moſt prudently diſtinguiſheth from the other; in that he ſhew'd them how they ſhould manage their Common-wealth, in this he bequeaths them the man whom he thinks the moſt likely to bring them to be a Common-wealth; of which judgement and undertaking of <hi>Moſes, Joſhua</hi> the next illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Example, moſt worthily acquitted himſelf.</p>
                     <p>There is in theſe Elections another remarkable paſſage, but ſuch a one as being ſo far from political, that it is ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

Any man that underſtands the politicks, and conſiders that God was now proceeding according unto this art, as in his conſtitution of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and of the people, or <hi>Congregation</hi> is moſt obvious, muſt needs ſee that this power he indulged unto <hi>Moſes</hi> of making his own choice of one man could not poſſibly be intended, as a permanent conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for whereas he intended <hi>Popular Government,</hi> nothing is plainer then that a people not electing their own Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates can have no <hi>popular Government.</hi> How abſurd is it to conceive that God having already made an expreſs Law that the people if at any time they came under Monarchy, ſhould yet have the election of their King, ſhould now make a Law that the people being under a Common-wealth, ſhould no longer have the election of their Magiſtrates? for who ſeeth not that to introduce the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> as a ſtanding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, had been to bar the people of this power? <hi>Iſrael</hi> at

this time, though deſigned for a Common-wealth, had no Land, no foundation to ballance her ſelf upon, but was an Army in a Wilderneſs, encompaſſed about with enemies; to permit unto the people in this caſe, the choice of all their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrates was nevertheleſs ſafe enough, nay beſt of all, for at the election of <hi>wiſe men, and understanding, and known among their Tribes,</hi> ſo far as was needful unto civil admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, their skil muſt needs have been at any time ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but the Common-wealth was yet in abſolute neceſſity of a <hi>Protector,</hi> and of <hi>Dictarian power.</hi> Now to know who was fitteſt in this caſe to ſucceed <hi>Moſes,</hi> required the wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> or of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore was not yet ſafe to be ventur'd upon a people ſo new in their Government.

                        <hi>caſe it ſhould happen that in all the Holy Land there remained but one Presbyter, that Presbyter aſſisted by two other Iſraelites, might ordain the ſeventy, or great Sanhedrim, and the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim ſo constituted might conſtitute and ordain the leſſer Courts, I am of opinion that were there no Presbyter in the Land, yet if all the wiſe-men of Iſrael ſhould agree to conſtitute or ordain Judges, they might do it lawfully enough. But if ſo, then how comes it to paſs that our Ancestors have been ſo ſolicitous, least Judicature ſhould fail in Iſrael? Surely for no other cauſe than that from the time of the Captivity the Iſraelites were ſo diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they could not upon like occaſions be brought together.</hi> Now I appeal whether <hi>the clear words of Maimonides,</hi> where he ſaith that out <hi>Master Moſes ordained the Sanhedrim by the Chirotheſia,</hi> be not more clearly and ſtrongly contradicted in this place, than they are affirmed in the other, ſince acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that if the people could aſſemble, they might <hi>Ordain</hi> the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> he gives it for granted, that when they did aſſemble, they had power to <hi>Ordain</hi> it, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> did aſſemble them upon this occaſion is plain in <hi>Scripture.</hi> Again if the power of <hi>Ordination</hi> fall ultimately unto the <hi>People,</hi> there is not a ſtronger argument in Nature, that it thence primarily derived. To conclude the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian party</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> is thus confeſſed by the Author no otherwiſe neceſſaty, than through the defect of the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> of the <hi>People:</hi> which ingenuity of the <hi>Talmudiſt,</hi> for any thing that hath yet paſt, might be worthy the imitation of Divines.</p>
                     <p>In tracking the Jews from the reſtitution of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth after the Captivity to their diſperſion, it ſeemeth that the later <hi>Monarchy</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was occaſioned by the <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> the <hi>Oligarchy</hi> by the <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> and the <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> by the <hi>Chirotheſia.</hi> But that this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> though erected by Magnanimous and Popular Princes, could be no leſs than <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> deriv'd from another principle, that is, the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>ballance.</hi> For albeit from the time of the Captivity, the <hi>Jubilee</hi> was no more in uſe, yet the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> as an Heireſs, is affirmed by ſome to have been Married unto <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond Presbytery, which is now attained unto a well ballanced Empire in the Papacy, hath infinitely excelled the patern, the Lands of <hi>Italy</hi> being moſt of them in the Church. This if I had leiſure might be tracked by the very ſame ſteps: at firſt it conſiſted of the ſeventy Pariſh Prieſts, or Presbyters of <hi>Rome;</hi> now ſeventy Cardinals creating unto themſelves an High Prieſt, or Prince of their <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> the Pope, but for the Superſtition whereunto he hath brought Religion, and continues by his Chirotheſia to hold it, a great and a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Monarch, eſtabliſhed upon a ſolid foundation, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by an Exquiſite policy, not only well ballanced at home, but deeply rooted in the greateſt Monarchies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, where the Clergy by vertue of their Lands are one of the three States.</p>
                     <p>The maxims of Rome are profound, for there is no making uſe of Princes without being neceſſary unto them; nor have they any regard unto that Religion which doth not regard Empire. All Monarchies of the Golthick model, that is to ſay, where the Clergy by vertue of their Lands are a third eſtate, ſubſiſt by the Pope, whoſe Religon creating a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the people, and bearing an awe upon the Prince, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the Clergy, that elſe being unarmed, become a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prey unto the King or the people; and where this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth (as in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth) down goes the Throne, for ſo much as the Clergy looſeth, falls out of the Monarchical into the Popular ſcale. Where a Clergy is a third eſtate, Popular Government wants earth and can never grow: but where they dye at the root a Prince may ſit a while, but is not ſafe; nor is it in nature (except he have a Nobility or Gentry able without a Clergy to give ballance unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that he ſhould ſubſiſt long, or peaceably: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Government is founded upon an Army (as in the Kings of Iſrael, or the Emperours of Rome) there the ſaddeſt Tragedies under heaven are either one the ſtage, or in the

Tiring-houſe. Theſe things conſidered, the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing originally nothing elſe but a way of Policy excluding the people, where it attaineth not unto a ballance that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this purpoſe, bringeth forth Oligarchy or Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as among the Jews: And where it attaineth unto a ballance ſufficent unto this end, produceth Monarchy as in the Papacy and in all Gothick Kingdomes.</p>
                     <p>The Prieſts of Aegypt, where (as it is deſcribed by <hi>Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>) their revenue came unto the third part of the Realm, would, no queſtion, have been exactly well fitted with the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> pretended unto by modern Divines. Suppoſe the Apoſtles had planted the Chriſtian Religion in thoſe parts. and the Prieſts had been all converted, I do not think that Divines will ſay that having altered their Religion they needed to have deſerted their being a third eſtate; their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verballance to the people, their lands, their preheminece in the Government, or any part of thir Policy for that: and I am as far from ſaying ſo as themſelves.</p>

                     <p>EIther I have impettinently intruded upon the Politicks, or cannot be ſaid ſo much to meddle in Church-matters, as Church-men may be ſaid to have medled in States matters. For if the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> be election by the many, and the <hi>Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſia</hi> be election by one, or by the Few, the whole difference between Popular and Monarchical Government falls upon theſe two words; And ſo the queſtion will be, whether the Scriptures were intended more for the advantage of a Prince, of an Hierarchy or Presbytery, than of the People. But that God in the Old Teſtamentiinſtituted the <hi>Chirotonia,</hi> not only in the Common-wealth as by the election of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> but in the Monarchy as in the Election of the Kings is plain; ſo if there remain any advantage in Scripture unto Kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hierarchy, or Presbytery, it muſt be in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Gods choſen people, and God was Iſraels choſen King; That God was pleaſed to bow the Heavens, and come down unto them, was his choice, not theirs; but in that upon his propoſition, and thoſe of his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> they reſolved to <hi>Obey his voice, and keep his Covenant,</hi> they choſe him their King. In like manner the Church is Chriſts choſen people, and Chriſt is the Churches choſen King. That
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114862:110"/>
Chriſt taking fleſh was pleaſed to bow the Heavens, and come down in a more familiar capacity of propoſing himſelf unto Man-kind, was his own choice, not theirs; but in that the Church upon his propoſition, or thoſe of his Apoſtles ſent by him, as he was ſent by the Father, reſolved to obey his voice, and keep his Covenant, ſhe hath choſen him her King. Whatever in nature or in grace, in Church, or in State, is choſen by Man according unto the will of God, is choſen by God, of whom is both the Will and the Deed. Which things conſidered; I wonder at Doctor <hi>Hamond,</hi> who ſayes:</p>

Chriſt was not choſen by them to whom he preached, for ſaith he, ye have not choſen me, he came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſent by his Father on that Errand, and happy they whom he was thus pleaſed to chooſe, to call, and preach to. And when his Apoſtles after his example go and preach to all Nations, and actually gather Diſciples, they choſe their Auditors, and not their auditors them.</hi> To make ſhort work, I ſhall anſwer by explaining his words as they fall.</p>
                     <p>A Roman chooſing whether he would ſpeak unto the Senate or the People, choſe his Auditors, &amp; not they him: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs if it were the Conſul they choſe him, &amp; not he them. It is onething to be a Speaker unto a People, that have theliberty, when that is done, to do as they think fit, and another thing to be a guide whom the People have conſented, or obliged themſelves to follow, which diſtinction not regarded, makes the reſt of his Argumentation recoyl upon himſelf, while he proceeds thus, <hi>and they that give up their Names to the obedience of the Goſpel,</hi> (chooſe the Preachers as I ſhould think of that Goſpel their guides) <hi>One branch of this obedience obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them</hi> (by their own conſent it ſeems, becauſe before they gave up their Names) <hi>to obſerve thoſe that</hi> (being thus placed over them by their conſent) <hi>are placed over them by God, ſuch not only are their Civil Magistrates</hi> (who ſucceed unto their places by, and govern according to the Laws which the people have choſen) <hi>but alſo their Paſtors, whom the Holy Ghoſt either mediately</hi> (according to the Rules of Church-Diſcipline in Scripture) <hi>or immediately</hi> (upon ſome ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous call, as the people ſhall judge to be no impoſture)

                     </p>
                     <p>If he would ſtand to this yet it were ſomething, for if the Holy Ghoſt make a Biſhop, then I ſhould think that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ordain'd a Biſhop, and ſo that the Election and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of a Biſhop were all one. But this hereafter will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a more dangerous conceſſion, than perhaps you may yet apprehend. Wherefore when all is done you will not find Divines, at leaſt Doctor <hi>Hamond</hi> to grant that the Holy Ghoſt can ordain, he may elect indeed, and that is all, but there is no ordination without the Chirotheſia of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or of the Presbytery. Take the Doctors word for it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>God may purpoſe as the Electors do to the great Council of <hi>Venice,</hi> but the power of the Council, that is to reſolve or ordain is in the Biſhop ſaith Doctor <hi>Hamond,</hi> and in the the Presbytery ſaith Doctor <hi>Seaman.</hi> Indeed that Election and Ordination be diſtinct things, is to Divines of ſo great importance, that looſing this hold they looſe all For as I ſaid before whatever is choſen by man according unto the Will of God, that is according unto Divine Law, whether natural or poſitive, the ſame whether in ſtate or Church, is choſen by God, or by the Holy Ghoſt, of whom is both the will and the deed. To evade this, and keep all in their own hands, or Chirotheſia, Divines have invented this diſtinction, that Election is one thing, and Ordination another. God may Elect, but they muſt conſtitute, that is, God may propoſe, but they muſt reſolve. And yet <hi>Grotius</hi> who in theſe things is a great Champion for the Clergy, hath little<note place="margin">De Imp. ſum. Pot.

                     <p>Where in the firſt place I for my particular (who have had the Books of Doctor <hi>Hamond,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Seaman,</hi> ſent to me by way of Objection, need not go a ſtep further. All that I have inſerted in my Occana concerning Ordination, is in theſe three Votes acknowledged and confirmed. For the Probationer, to be there ſent by an Univerſity unto a Cure that is vacant, may by a Doctor, or the Doctors of the ſame Univerſity already ordained, receive Impoſition of Hands, if that be thought fit to be added, and then the Election of the ſame Probationer by the people does no hurt, nay ſaith<note place="margin">De Imp. c. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Grotius,</hi> is <hi>of the right of nature; for it is naturally permitted unto every Congregation to procure thoſe things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto their conſervation, of which number is the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Function. So Merchants have the right of Electing of a Maſter of their Ship, Travellers of a Guide in their way, and a free people of their King.</hi> The Merchant it ſeems doth not make the Maſter of his Ship, the Traveller his Guide, nor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114862:111"/>
the free people their King, but elect them. As if <hi>Van Tromp</hi> had been Admiral, a Robber upon the High-way had been a Scout, or the guide of an Army, or <hi>Saul</hi> a King before they were elected. The point is very nice, which inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, he illuſtrates in the beginning of the ſame Chapter by theſe three ſimilitudes.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this, <hi>the power of the Husband is from God, the Application of this power unto a certain perſon is from conſent, by which nevertheleſs the right is not given, for if this were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Matrimony might be diſſolv'd by conſent, which cannot be.</hi> As if an apparent retraction of Matrimonial conſent, as when a Wife conſents unto another than her own Husband, or committeth Adultery, did not deliver a man from the bond of Marriage by the Judgements of Chriſt. There is an imperfection or cruelty in thoſe Laws, which make Marriage to laſt longer than a man in humanity may be judged to be an Husband, or a Woman a Wife; to think that Religion deſtroyes humanity, or to think that there is any defending of that by Religion which will not hold in Juſtice, or natural equity, is a vaſt error.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſimilitude is this; <hi>Imperial power is not in the Princes that are Electors of the Empire, wherefore it is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by them, but applyed by them unto a certain perſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is anſwer'd by <hi>Peter,</hi> where he commandeth Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note> unto every Ordinance of Man (or as ſome neerer the Original every power created by men) whether it be unto the Roman Emperour as Supreme, or unto the Pro-Conſuls of Aſia, and Phrygia, as ſent by him (for this is the ſenſe of the Greek, and thus it is interpreted by <hi>Grotius</hi>) now if the then Roman Emperour were a creature of man, why not the now Roman Emperour?</p>
                     <p>The laſt ſimilitude runs thus: <hi>The power of life and death is not in the multitude, before they be a Common-wealth, for no private man hath the right of revenge, yet it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by them unto ſome man or Political body of men.</hi> But if a man invade the life of another, that other whether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Laws, or not under Laws, hath the right to defend his own life, even by taking away that (if there be no other probable remedy) of the invader. So that men are ſo far from having been void of the power of life and death before
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114862:112"/>
they came under Laws, that Laws can never be ſo made as wholly to deprive them of it after they come under them; wherfore the power of life and death is derived by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate from, and conferred upon him by the conſent or Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia of the people, whereof he is but a meer creature, that is to ſay an Ordinance of man.</p>
                     <p>Thus theſe candles being ſo far from lighting the houſe, that they die in the ſocket: <hi>Grotius</hi> hath been no leſs boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than to grant us that the people have as much right, (where there is no humane creature or Law to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) to elect their Church-men, as Merchants have to elect their Sea-men, Travilers their guides, or a free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> people their King; which is enough a conſcience. Nor is Doctor <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> ſtreighter handed, Election (ſays he) was permitted by the Apoſtles unto the multitude, and therefore the ſame may be allowed, alwaies provided that the (<gap reason="foreign">

                        <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> men, and women: now it is not probable, that theſe, who ſhould ſeem to have been numerous, were all ordained, at leſt the women; And ſo the Miracle is to be attributed unto the hands of the Apoſtles, and not unto ordination in general. <hi>Joſhua was full of the Spirit,</hi> (not becauſe he had been ordained by the Chirotheſia, for ſo had many of them that Crucifyed Chriſt and perſecuted the Apoſtles, but) becauſe <hi>Moſes had laid his hands upon him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Would Divines be contended that we ſhould argue thus; the Chirotonia or ſuffrage of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the firſt inſtitution was followed with Miraculous indowments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who ever is elected by the people ſhall have the like? Or what have they to ſhew why the Argument is more holding as to their Chirotheſia, ſeeing for above one thouſand years all the Hierarchy and Presbytery laid together have done no more Miracles than a Pariſh Clerk?</p>
                     <p>A continued Miracle, as that the Sea ebbs and flowes, the Sun alwaies runs his admirable courſe, is nature. Intermitted nature as that the waters of the red Sea were mountains, that the Sun ſtood ſtill in the dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> is a Miracle. To continue the latter kinde of Miracle were to deſtroy the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that is, to deſolve nature. Wherefore this is a certain
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114862:113"/>
rule that no continued external Act can be in the later ſenſe Miraculous. Now Government whether in Church or State is equally a continued external Act. An internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Act may indeed be natural or ſupernatural as Faith.</p>
                     <p>A natural man being even in his own natural apprehenſion <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> is by the continued Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of nature convinced that the world had a creator, and ſo comes to beleeve in that which is ſupernatural; whence it is that all Nations have had ſome Religion: and a Spiritual man being convinced by the purity of Chriſts Doctrine, and the Miracles whereby it was firſt planted, is brought unto the Chriſtian Faith. However Chriſt may require ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Faith or Spiritual exerciſe of his Church as is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, he requireth not any ſuch continued Act or bodily exerciſe of his Church as is ſupernatural. But the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church is a continued Act or bodily exerciſe. It ſhould be heeded that to delude the ſenſe is not to do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but to uſe impoſture. Now to perſwade us, That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, Ariſtocratical, Popular, or mixt Government have not alwaies been in nature, or that there hath ever been any other in the Church were to delude ſenſe; Wherefore give me leave (in which I am confident I ſhall uſe no manner of irreverence unto the Scripture, but on the contrary make the right uſe of it) to diſcourſe upon Church-Government, according unto the rules of prudence.</p>
                     <p>The Goſpel was intended by Chriſt to be preached unto all Nations, which (Princes and States being above all things exceeding tenacious of their power) is to me a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the Policy of the Church muſt be ſo provided for, as not to give any of them juſt cauſe of Jealouſy, there being nothing more likely to obſtruct the growth of Religion, and truly the nearer I look unto the Scripture, the more I am confirmed in this opinion.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt being taken up into Heaven the firſt Ordination<note place="margin">Firſt way of Ordination in the Church of Chriſt. Acts 1.</note> that we finde was that of the Apoſtle <hi>Matthias</hi> after this manner.</p>
                     <p>The Ariſtocracy of the Church, that is the Apoſtles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the whole Congregation of Diſciples or Beleevers at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being in number one hundred and twenty, where <hi>Peter</hi> (it having as it ſhould ſeem been ſo agreed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles)
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114862:113"/>
was Propoſer, who ſtanding up in the midſt of the Diſciples acquainted them, that whereas <hi>Judas</hi> was gone unto his place, the occaſion of their preſent meeting was to elect another Apoſtle in his room: whereupon proceeding unto the Suffrage, they appointed two Competitors, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Matthias,</hi> whoſe names being written each in a ſeveral Scroll, were put into one Urne, and at the ſame time two other lotts whereof, one was a blank, and the other inſcribed with the word <hi>Apoſtle</hi> were put into another Urne, which done they prayed and ſaid, <hi>Thou Lord which knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen:</hi> The Prayer being ended they <hi>gave forth their lotts, and the lott fell upon Matthias</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) and by this <hi>Pſephiſma</hi> (the very Popular word, and not onely ſo, hut being applyed unto the ballot, in the very literal and Original ſignification) he was added unto the eleven Apoſtles. So you have the firſt way of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination in the Church after Chriſt was taken up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven performed by the Election or Chirotomia of the whole Church.</p>
                     <p>Now except any man can ſhew that <hi>Matthias</hi> ever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the impoſition of hands, theſe ſeveral things are already demonſtrated. Firſt, that the Chirotonia is not onely the more ancient way of Ordination in the Common-wealth of Iſrael, but in the Church of Chriſt. Secondly, that the Chirotheſia or Impoſition of Hands is no way neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ordination in the Chriſtian Church. Thirdly, that the diſcipline of the Chriſtian Church was primitively Popular (For to ſay that in regard of the Apoſtles it was Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, is to forget that there is no ſuch thing, without a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ariſtocracy, that is without the Senate, as a Popular Government in nature.) Fourthly, that Ordination in the Common-wealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> being exactly after this pattern, is exactly according unto the diſcipline of the Church of Chriſt. And fiftly, that Ordination and Election in this example are not two, but one and the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>The laſt of theſe Propoſitions having been affirmed by Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> tels him plainly, that his aſſertion <hi>is far from all truth:</hi> Let us therefore conſider the Doctors<note place="margin">§ 115.</note> Reaſons, which are theſe; <hi>ſeeing the Congregation</hi> (ſaith he)

                        <hi>is affirmed by the Gentleman to have Ordained, and it is plain by the words of St.</hi> Luke, <hi>that God Elected, Election and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by this Example, muſt be diſtinct things:</hi> which in another place going about to fortifie with this Argument, <hi>that it was done by Lottery, and Solomon ſaies, the Lot is at the diſpoſing of the Lord,</hi> he utterly overthrows without and beyond help; for in this <hi>Solomon</hi> not denying, but rather affirming that he was choſen King by the People, plainly ſhewes that Election by the People is Election by God. Where it is affirmed, that <hi>God raiſed up Iudges in Iſrael,</hi> it is not denied that the People elected them. The Doctor is at it in <hi>Maimonides</hi> more than once, <hi>that the Devine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties reſted upon ſuch as were Ordained by Impoſition of Hands.</hi> But whereas it is affirmed by <hi>Maimonides</hi> more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that <hi>when the People (Eccleſia Dei) or Congregation of Iſrael aſſembled then the Divine Majesty, or the Holy Ghoſt reſted upon them:</hi> Of this he never takes any notice: The People whether in <hi>Iſrael, Athens, Lacedemon,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſembled for Enacting of Laws or Election of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates without ſacrifice and imploring the aſſiſtance of God, to whom when their work was performed they alwaies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the whole reſult or election; and would the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor have <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to allow him but a Piece? for whereas God Electing there had in the ſenſe both of Jews and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, his choice of all, God electing here had in the ſenſe of Divines, but his choice of two, which were next <hi>this or none,</hi> but that indeed, where he hath not the whole he hath none at all: Is that then <hi>far from all truth,</hi> which the Gentleman, or that which the Divine hath ſaid, either in this part, or where he addeth, that the hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Dr. H. of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. § 115.</note> in the text are never mentioned but once, and then it is in a Parentheſis?

Thirdly in ſuch eſtimation for their honeſty and ability for Government as in their conſciences (to which alſo they made Oath) they ſhould judge fitteſt for the Common-wealth; yet is all this ſo far from any proof, that <hi>Athens</hi> was no Democracy, or that the Soveraign power, whether in Enacting of Laws, or election of Magiſtrates by the lott or the ſuffrage (inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons equally popular) was not in the people, that it amounts unto the ſtrongeſt argument the people were Soveraigne, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114862:117"/>
the Common-wealth was Democratical. Could truth deſire greater advantage than redounds from ſuch oppoſition? We have another example of the ſame modell, in which, becauſe it hath been paraphraſed upon already in the Introduction, I ſhall be briefer here. In the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> where the<note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> Diſciples were now become ſo numerous, that they began to be called Chriſtians, there were among them Prophets, ſo being aſſembled upon occaſion (as I conceive) of giving an extraordinary Commiſſion after the manner of the people of <hi>Athens</hi> when they Elected Ambaſſadors, or (that I may avoid ſtrife upon a point ſo indifferent) to chooſe two new Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work wbereunto I have appointed them;</hi> that is, (for ſo it is rendred by all Interpretors) the Holy Ghoſt ſpake thoſe words by the mouths of the Prophets. Now the Prophets being well known for ſuch, this ſuffrage of theirs was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner given than (as one that can allow Prophets to be leading men may eaſily think) followed by all the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: ſo the whole multitude having faſted and prayed, the moſt eminent among them, or the Senatorian order in that Church, laid their hands upon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who being thus ſent forth by the Holy Ghoſt, departed unto <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To evade this apparent Election, or Chirotonia of the whole Congregation, whereby theſe Apoſtles or Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors unto the Churches of the Gentiles were ordained; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have nothing to ſay, but <hi>that they were elected by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> as if the Chirotonia of the people were more excluſive unto Election by the Holy Ghoſt, than the Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſia of the Ariſtocracy, for which in the mean time they contend: but if neither of theſe were indeed excluſive of the Holy Ghoſt, how is it poſſible, in this frame (where though of natural neceſſity an Ariſtocracy muſt have been included, yet the Ariſtocracy is not in the Text, ſo much as diſtinguiſht from the people, or once named) that the power, and ſo the ordination ſhould not have been in the people? The Council of the Apoſtles, of the Elders, and of the whole Church at Jeruſalem, and other Councils, not of Apoſtles, nor of the whole Church in other times or places, uſed this form in their Acts, <hi>It ſeemeth good unto the Holy Ghoſt, and</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> can be no otherwiſe underſtood in nature, nor ever was in the Common-wealth of the Jews, than Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the few: And ſo even under the meer <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and Election were not two, but one and the ſame thing.

                     <p>The third conſtitution of Church Government in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">Third way of Ordination i the Church c Chriſt.</note> (whether conſiſting of Biſhops or Presbyters, between which at this time a man ſhall hardly find a difference) runs wholly upon the Ariſtocracy without mention of the people, and is therefore compared by <hi>Grotius</hi> unto the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> of<note place="margin">Grot ad 2 Tim. 4. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as that came to be in theſe dayes; from whence Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines alſo generally and truly confeſs that it was taken up, to which I ſhall need to add no more than that it is an order for which there is no precept, either in the Old Teſtament of God, or in the New of Chriſt: This therefore thus taken up by the Apoſtles from the Jews, is a clear demonſtration that the Government of the Church in what purity ſoever of the times, nay though under the inſpection of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves, hath been obnoxious unto that of the State wherein it was planted. The <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> from the inſtitution of the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> for a conſtant Order, conſiſted of no other Senators than ſuch only as had been ordain'd by the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hands, which came now to be conferred by the Prince in the preſence, or with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> the ſame order was obſerved by the Jewiſh Synagogues, of<note place="margin">Grot. ad Mat. 19. 13.</note> which each had her archon: nor would the Jews conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Chriſtian Faith relinquiſh the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereunto this way of Ordination, among other things,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114862:118"/>
though erroneouſly, was vulgarly attributed: whence in the Church, where it conſiſted of converted Jews, Ordination was conferred by the Archon, or firſt in order of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with the aſſiſtance of the reſt. Hence <hi>Paul,</hi> in one place, exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> thus: <hi>Neglect not the gift that is in</hi>

                     <p>I grant Divines, that Ordination by this time was wholly in the Presbytery, what ſay they then unto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Ordination and Election?

If they ſay no; Who in this place but the Presbytery elected? Why ſaies Doctor <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">§ 106.</note> it is plain that <hi>the Spirit of Propheſie elected?</hi> But to give account of no more than is already performed, were the ſpirit of Hiſtory rather than of Prophecy, to which it appertains to tell things before they be done, as did the Prophets now living in this Church, that <hi>Tim thy</hi> ſhould come to be ordained, ſo the place is interpreted by <hi>Grotius,</hi> and how it ſhould otherwiſe be underſtood I cannot ſee: But putting the caſe ſome Act preceded, as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> were elected Kings by <hi>Prophecy:</hi> Yet did ever man ſay that for this <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>David</hi> were any whit the leſs elected Kings by the People? To the contrary in every well ordered Common-wealth (<hi>a jove principium</hi>) the diſpoſing of the Lot and of the Suffrage too, hath univerſally been attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God.</p>
                     <p>The Piety of Divines in perſwading the People, that God<note place="margin">§ 134.</note> elects for them, and therefore they need not <hi>trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> to vote, is as if they ſhould perſwade them that God provides their daily bread, and therefore they need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves to work.

the Jews, is unto me an irrefragable Argument, that he ordained not after this manner among the Gentiles; for whereas the firſt ordination in the Chriſtian Church, namely that of <hi>Matthias,</hi> was performed by the <hi>Chirotonia;</hi> which by degrees came now in complacence with the Jews unto the <hi>Chirotheſia;</hi> it ſeems he was contented not to alter the worſt of Political inſtitutions or cuſtomes, where he found them confirm'd by long and univerſal practice; and if ſo, why ſhould any man think that he would go about to alter or weed out the beſt, where they had taken like Root? That this adminiſtration of the Jews was of the very worſt, is clear in the nature of the politicks, there being no example of a pure Ariſtocracy, or of a Senate, ſuch as was now the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> without a popular ballance that ever governed with Juſtice, or was of any continuance. Nor was the <hi>Chiroth ſia,</hi> by which means this work came to effect in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> introduced by the prudence of God, but by the corrupt arts of men. Now that the Governments at the ſame time of the Gentiles, all ballanced by the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> of the people, were in their Nature more excellent, and indeed more accomodated unto antient prudence, as it was introduced by God himſelf in the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hath been already ſufficiently proved; Nevertheleſs to refreſh your memory with one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample more.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114862:120"/>
aftewards to receive ſome mixture of the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> as in the ordination of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and laſt of all by excluding the people to degenerate wholly into the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> as in the ordination of <hi>Timothy;</hi> all this by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture, and in the pureſt times, even the age of the Apoſtles. Whence my undertaking to ſhew that as Chriſt intended his Doctrine ſhould be <hi>preached unto all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ſo he intended his Diſcipline ſhould be ſuch as might ſute with any Government, (as indeed if the choice of any of theſe three be lawful, it doth exactly) is I hope performed. For where the Government is popular, it is the ſame with the firſt, where it is Ariſtocratical or Monarchical, it agrees with the laſt, and where it is mixed, it is between both, and reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto the ſecond.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114862:121"/>
introduced the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> in Iſrael) to have been Chiroto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized Ruler of the People, can in my judgement be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than originally and literally taken, ſeeing God himſelf was no otherwiſe made King in Iſrael than by the ſuffrage of the People. That the like muſt be underſtood of the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> hath been already ſhewn. The Doctor is the firſt hath told me, that the plural number for the royal ſtile is ſo ancient as <hi>Epiphanes:</hi> Sure I am it was not deriv'd from his <hi>Macedonian Predeceſſors,</hi> for in the Letters to the <hi>Athenians</hi> and the <hi>Thebans</hi> recited by <hi>Demosthenes, Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Cor.</note> writes in the ſingular number. But the Letter of <hi>Epiphanes</hi> to <hi>Jonathan</hi> muſt it ſeems import that he at ſingle hand (though the words carry double) had Chirotonized an High Prieſt of the Jews: Who can help it? Some Princes have not onely given out that their Prieſts have been chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonized when they were not, but that themſelves have been Chirotonized when there was no ſuch matter. When a Prince ſaies that he was Chirotonized or Elected by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to talk of Rhetorique is to have none. Divines in this caſe commonly underſtand it to be proper, or literally meant, for to impoſe a new ſenſe is to ſpoil the word, and ſpoil the word, ſpoil the Prince. <hi>Lucian</hi> is a droll and intends a jeſt, but not ſo good an one, as that he of all other ſhould come neareſt to help up with an Heirarchy. For the Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia or Election of the Roman Magiſtrates by the ſuffrage of the People or of the Army, every man knows that it is literal; <hi>Suidas</hi> himſelf interpreting the word by this very example; where he affirms it to ſignifie Election or Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the many. The quotation out of the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with thoſe of Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> and others out of the Greek Fathers, and out of Councils, do not onely imply the word <hi>Chirotonia,</hi> but the thing, while they all relate unto that kind of Ordination, which being in thoſe Churches yet adminiſtred as at the Ordination of <hi>Stephen,</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred without the conſent of the People. But it is above all, that labouring to prove the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> and the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> to be the ſame thing, they ſhould rely moſt upon the place where the Apoſtles are ſaid (<gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>as Agrippa in Philo ſaith of that City, it was the Metropolis not only of Iudea, but many other Regions, becauſe of the Colonies thence ſent into Aegypt, Phenice, and both the Syria's; nay to Pamphilia, Celicia, and a great part of Aſia, as far as Bythinia and Pontus. So in reaſon the Churches in Lyſtra, Iconium, and Antioch, where Paul and Barnabas ordain'd Elders were to follow the pattern at Ieruſalem, and there We know it was not by the ſuffrage of the people, that an Elder was aſſumed into the Sanhedrim, but the Prince or head of the Sanhedrim received him in by Impoſition of Hands; it will be much more reaſonable to deduce the circumſtances of ordaining Elders from the cuſtoms familiar unto them that preached the Faith unto them, than from the former uſages of them, to whom it was preached, who were not to diſpute, but to believe and receive the inſtitutions as well as Doctrines which were brought them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe me thinks are ſtrange arguments; the Goſpel came to us from <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>Rome</hi> therefore the Metropolis of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> It is true <hi>Agrippa</hi> being a Jew, and writing unto <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> in the behalf of the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not of the Chriſtians, tells him, <hi>That Ieruſalem is the Metropolis of the Iews, and of all their Colonies;</hi> ſo is <hi>London</hi> of the Engliſh, and of all their<note place="margin">Philo delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jum.</note> Colonies; but doth it follow from hence that either <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> or <hi>London</hi> is the Metropolis of Chriſtendome? <hi>But the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had many Colonies in Aſia, and therefore the Churches of Lystra, Iconinm, and Antioch were to follow the pattern at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> The Jews indeed had Synagogues in <hi>Iconium</hi> and <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> as the French have Churches in <hi>England,</hi> but is this a good argument, the <hi>French</hi> have Churches in <hi>England,</hi> therefore the Engliſh are to follow the orders of the French Church?

And what was that? why <hi>there we know it was not by the ſuffrages of the people that an Elder was aſſumed into the Sanhedrim, but the Prince or head of the Sanhedrim received him in by Impoſition of Hands.</hi> The Government of the Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians was popular, that of the Jews was Ariſtoeratical; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iconians receiving the Chriſtian Faith, were bound to change their Democracy into Ariſtocracy. The Apoſtles to comply with an Oligarchy, had alter'd that ordination, which originally (as at the election of <hi>Mathias</hi>) was popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar unto Ariſtocracy; therefore being now to plant the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in a free State, they might not alter it from Ariſtocracy to Democracy: to pleaſe the Jews they might change for the worſe, therefore to pleaſe the Iconians they might not change for the betrer, but muſt tell the people plainly <hi>that they were not to diſpute, but to believe and receive the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as Doctrines that were brought them</hi> from the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis.

The Doctor comes near the word of defiance unto Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> in a matter of fact ſo apparent unto any judgement that I need not ad what goes before in the life of <hi>Clement the ſecond,</hi> where the <hi>Emperour ingageth the People of Rome not to meddle with the Election of the Pope without his expreſs Command:</hi> nor what follows after in <hi>Leo the ninth,</hi> where <hi>the whole power of Election was now conſerred by the Emperour upon ihe Clergy.</hi> Again <hi>Victor the ſecond,</hi> (ſaith the ſame Author) <hi>obtained the Papacy rather by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Emperour, than by free ſuffrages of ihe Clergy and the People of Rome, who apprehended the power of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour whoſe diſpleaſure they had ſometime incurred by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Popes:</hi> So then the People, (it is clear) had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to created the Popes.

the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> and their <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> as it was exereiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the converted Jews, when <hi>Timothy</hi> was Ordained <hi>by the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery.</hi>

                     <p>Now this is that with which of all others Divines are ſo inamoured, that they will not endure it ſhould he ſaid there is any other: It is alſo propitious above all the reſt unto Monarchy, as that which according unto the inherent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or impotence of Oligarchy, muſt have a Prince at home or abroad to reſt upon or become the inevitable prey of the People. Herein lies the Arcanum or ſecret of that Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, which is between a Clergy and a Popular Government, and of that ſimpathy which is between the Mitre and the Crown. A Prince receiving a Clergy with the Monopoly of their <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> hath no more to do than to make a Metrapolitan, by whom he governs them, and by them the People, eſpecially if he endow them with good Revenues, for ſo they become an Eſtate of his Realm, and a more ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Pillar of his Throne than his Nobility themſelves, who as their dependance is not ſo ſtrong, are of a more ſtirring nature.

It is alſo remarkable that the Political ballance extends it ſelf unto the deciſion of the queſtion about Ordination.
